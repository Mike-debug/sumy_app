The reemergence of the Covid-19 pandemic worldwide suggests the stay-at-home theme will continue playing out. And after Netgear refreshed its WiFi products, it may grow its market share, user base, and subscription revenue.Netgear stock pulled back this month as technology stocks dropped by over 10% from their peak. Investors may blame Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) for leading the decline.But savvy investors should look at Netgear's prospects in the quarters ahead. Anyone who missed the last article will have to pay ~20% more:In the second quarter, Netgear had nearly half of the U.S. retail WiFi market (based on NPD Group data, as shown on slide 4). Netgear has three strategies in its approach to growth: technology inflections creating new product categories, and building its recurring service revenue. Netgear's value-added services, accessible as a mobile app, include Netgear Armor, Circle, and Insight. Revenue rose a respectable 21.3% year-over-year to $280.1 million. The company benefited from strong demand for CHP products. Globally, the transition to working from home drove demand for network connection upgrades. The company shipped 3.7 million units, with the revenue split between home and business products at around 82% and 18%, respectively.Sales in the APAC region fell by 3.7%, although it only accounted for $29.4 million in revenue.Netgear managed its costs effectively in the quarter. Headcount did not change by much. Research and development costs fell to 6.9% of net revenue. Still, to grow its subscription service business and maintain its lead in Wi-Fi 6, expect R&D costs increasing slightly. The company posted a non-GAAP EPS of 54 cents. With inventory down and cash on hand rose by $48.8 million to $258.6 million, Netgear will not hurt investors by selling stock.It did the opposite.The firm bought back 315,000 shares at $7.5 million. Since Q4/2013, it spent $551.2 million to cancel 15.7 million shares.Netgear has an attractive portfolio of home networking gear. This includes Orbi, which is a mesh network that provides full wireless coverage in large homes. Consumers may buy a three-pack of Orbi, a Wi-Fi 6 AX4200 Tri-Band mesh system, for under $500. If they need more units, they may buy and add it to the system. Nighthawk and Nighthawk Pro Gaming are reputable products, too. For example, Techspot rates the latest Nighthawk X10 R9000 AD7200 with a score of 82/100.Net revenue from the SMB market worsened in the quarter. The pandemic hurt small businesses, sending revenue down 21% Y/Y to $50 million. Conversely, Netgear's PoE Plus and ProAV switching lines did well, commanding 49% of the market.Netgear's value score is only fair at this time, due to its GAAP price-to-earnings score of a D+:Data courtesy of SA PremiumCompared to its peers, Netgear has slightly less value than Arlo. After the stock's rise, its momentum score of A- suggests that investors may wait for buying pressure to ease before starting a position:Arlo may have better value but it requires an uptick in subscription sign-ups to justify the stock rally. Arlo stock price more than tripled from the $2.00 low, peaking at $7.30 recently. By contract, Netgear traded at around $24 since May, only to rally recently to $30.

The stay-at-home trend may lift average selling prices. Still, financial companies are starting to bring workers back to the office on a rotating basis.The fall and winter season is fast approaching. This may favor the flu virus and help the coronavirus spread, as people spend more time indoors. If companies play it safe and encourage remote work, then Netgear could exceed its 50% second-half growth rate forecast on services. CEO Patrick Lo said:Netgear shares are still well off the 2018 highs in the $40+ range. As network hardware sales grow, the company will return to the $1 billion market capitalization, rewarding patient investors."

Non-GAAP EPS will grow in the double-digits. The company is trying to take a page from Microsoft’s (MSFT) strategy of shifting towards subscription revenue. Adobe (ADBE) did the same a few years ago with its Photoshop suite of products. Yet Netgear will not find the same success. It is building a recurring revenue stream on value-added services. Netgear Armor and parental controls are examples. So, customers decline the additional service, and the company’s revenue growth will stall.Management forecast revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digits annually. The former target is a more realistic target in the year ahead. But if Netgear successfully converts its one million of installed users to a paid subscription, then the stock will trend higher.

4251464,104958,2019-03-28T02:35:47-04:00,NETGEAR's management expects solid growth for 2019 after its recent earnings slump.I think the stock is worth buying for its future growth potential.The stock is reasonably priced and would best suit patient investors as the stock can trade sideways for extended periods.,"NETGEAR, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTGR) is a provider of wired and wireless networking and internet connected products. NETGEAR’s revenue has declined in recent years and its earnings have been volatile, but the company expects these to turn around in 2019 with revenue growth of around 5% and earnings growth of at least 10%.I think that the company has a future as the demand for its products will only continue to increase as more devices are connected to the internet. In my opinion, NETGEAR would make a good long-term investment and would be more suited to patient investors as the stock can spend some time trading sideways with no real capital gain. However, over the longer term, I think the stock price will work its way higher in line with NETGEAR’s future growth potential.At present, NETGEAR is reasonably priced and I think this provides a good entry for a long-term investment.NETGEAR has reported its financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018 (data from Seeking Alpha and Yahoo).The company’s reported fourth-quarter revenue was down 19% from the fourth quarter of 2017. NETGEAR reported diluted earnings per share of $0.03 compared to $0.64 reported for the fourth quarter of 2017. The company’s EBIT was down 26% over the fourth quarter of 2017. The EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Tax) gives an indication of the company’s profitability at an operational level.On an annual basis, revenue for 2018 was up 1.9%. NETGEAR reported full-year diluted earnings per share of $0.52, which was up from the $0.35 loss reported for the 2017 fiscal year. NETGEAR’s EBIT is down 6.7% over the 2017 fiscal year.NETGEAR’s return on equity is currently around 3%. Over the last decade the company’s return on equity has ranged from 1% to 14%.The profit margin (profit to revenue ratio) is currently around 1%. The profit margin has been over 10 percent in recent years.NETGEAR’s current ratio is 2.2, meaning that its current assets exceed its current liabilities. The company’s current ratio has ranged from 2.1 to 3.3 over the last decade. The company’s generous current ratio means that the company has ample working capital (which is the company's short-term finances such as cash and short-term deposits) that's used for paying its bills.The asset ratio (total liabilities to total assets) is 40%, which means that NETGEAR’s total debt is 40% of the value of everything the company owns (note that the asset value is the book value and not the liquidated value of its assets). Over the last decade the asset ratio has ranged from 27% to 42%. NETGEAR’s asset ratio is quite low, which means that the company is conservatively financed and can easily source more funding if needed.The company’s book value is currently $19.88 and with a stock price of $33 NETGEAR is trading at 1.7x book value.The analysts’ consensus forecast is for revenue to increase by 3.8% in 2019 and increase 4.5% in 2020. Earnings are forecast to recover in 2019 and increase another 17.6% in 2020. The 2020 PE multiple is 11.5x.The financials reveal that NETGEAR operates with a generous amount of working capital. This means that NETGEAR can easily pay its bills without needing to dip into its long-term finances. The company is conservatively financed with its total debt being well under half of the company’s assets. Should NETGEAR need to borrow more money in the future, it can easily do so without overloading its balance sheet with debt.NETGEAR does seem to have some profitability issues. The company is struggling with slow revenue growth and on an operating level its profits have declined with a drop in EBIT. This has led to low profit margins and low returns on equity.As an investor, I personally like to examine the company’s revenue and earnings history. To make this task easier and more convenient, I like to visually present the data on a chart.NETGEAR data by ADVFNThe above chart visually shows NETGEAR’s historical revenue and earnings trend along with the next two years of consensus forecasts.Examining the chart shows that NETGEAR’s revenue increased from 2009 until 2013 and then started to decline. The revenue picked up slightly in 2018 and the analysts are expecting NETGEAR’s revenue to continue increasing at a slow rate heading into 2020.The chart shows that NETGEAR’s earnings are volatile. While the earnings for 2018 have improved from 2017, they are still down from the earnings peak of 2011. The forecasts are for earnings to recover in 2019 with a further increase expected for 2020.Patrick Lo, Chairman and CEO of NETGEAR, stated in its earnings call,It seems that management is confident that NETGEAR’s growth will continue, admittedly at a modest single-digit rate which I would interpolate as around 5% for its revenue growth and an increase of more than 10% for its earnings.The new technologies the CEO is referring to include the next generation WiFi routers and the 5G routers that NETGEAR will provide for AT&T’s new 5G service.NETGEAR operates in a highly competitive environment and its future success is dependent on the company developing new products. NETGEAR has a brand name and I am personally using one of its modems for my current internet provider. However, I have also used other internet providers, using different modem brands such as Huawei and D-Link.In order to remain competitive, NETGEAR has to continually invest in research and development which places a strain on its margins. For the 2018 fiscal year research and development costs amounted to $82.4 million, which represented 8% of its revenue. The problem is if NETGEAR doesn’t spend this on research and development then its product line will fall behind that of its rival’s and this will effectively lower NETGEAR’s revenue. So just to maintain its revenue growth NETGEAR must spend on research and development.NETGEAR has spun off its home-security camera Arlo business in an IPO in August last year. NETGEAR stockholders received 1.98 shares of Arlo common stock for every share of NETGEAR common stock held. It appears that Arlo wasn’t profitable enough for NETGEAR, so it seems that the company decided to divest the business. Another reason for divesting Arlo could be that NETGEAR's focus is router and modem-based and possibly NETGEAR figured that home-security cameras didn’t fit in with its business model.It’s interesting that NETGEAR has acquired Meural which provides picture frames that display digital images uploaded from the cloud via a WiFi connection. Meural also provides artwork via its app for display on mobile devices.Meural uses WiFi-based devices for its digital frames and of course NETGEAR will supply these devices. This was actually a smart business move as it ensures that NETGEAR’s devices are used rather than its competitors’. Also, as a bonus, NETGEAR receives a recurring revenue stream as the Meural service costs around $50 per month to use. This is on top of the cost charged to purchase the digital frame which starts at $595.I think that management is on the right track here – sell its home-security camera business with questionable profitability and purchase a business that will use NETGEAR devices and provides a bonus revenue stream.It appears to me that management is working at driving future growth. In order for shareholders to justify the company’s stock price, NETGEAR will need to grow both its revenue and its earnings. I like management's approach with divesting its Arlo business and replacing it with the Meural business. The recurring revenue will provide a boost.I personally think that there is more future growth in NETGEAR. We live in a digital age with an increasing range of products being smart connected. These products included smart TVs, game consoles and even household items such as smart home thermostats and smoke detectors. These all require devices produced by companies like NETGEAR and I think this will ensure NETGEAR’s future growth but I also think that NETGEAR will face plenty of competition.As an active investor, I personally like to determine some likely price targets. This gives me a feel for how high the stock price could go in the short term and how soon it could get there.NETGEAR chart by StockCharts.comThe stock chart reveals that NETGEAR’s stock price has broadly increased over the last decade. The stock did spend quite some time trading sideways, having peaked in 2011 before finally breaking out and hitting its high of $47.50 in mid-2018. The stock then sold down along with the decline in the stock market. The stock quickly traded up earlier this year before dropping after its quarterly earnings release.The stock could trade back up to its 2018 peak of $47.50 if the current stock market rally continues. The stock does have a history of trading sideways and it’s quite possible that if NETGEAR did reach its 2018 peak, then it could sell back down again into its trading range.Over the longer term the stock has the potential to continue higher, but NETGEAR would need to produce revenue and earnings growth to sustain a higher stock price.NETGEAR’s revenue has declined in recent years and it has a history of volatile earnings. Management feels confident that the company can produce revenue growth of around 5% and earnings growth of at least 10% for the 2019 fiscal year.To help meet these growth goals NETGEAR has spun off its home-security camera Arlo business in an IPO and acquired the Meural business. While NETGEAR has not shown any real growth in recent years, I think that the company has a future. The demand for its products will only continue to increase as more devices are connected to the internet.NETGEAR is reasonably priced and in my opinion the stock would suit patient investors with a long-term view as the stock price has a tendency to trade sideways for extended periods."
4279459,24594,2019-07-31T09:19:51-04:00,"NETGEAR's legacy business has performed better than might be understood.The second half looks particularly important as the company battles competition and tries to reverse declines in the WiFi market.There's still a lot to like here, and a valuation that incorporates basically zero growth.Risks need to be minded, but NETGEAR still can drive profits higher - but isn't priced accordingly.","NETGEAR (NTGR) has performed better than might be realized. To be sure, its stock hasn't performed well: adjusted for its spin-off of Arlo Technologies (ARLO) at the beginning of the year, NTGR touched a three-year low in late June. Operating margins saw pressure last year ahead of the spin, though they've started to recover. NETGEAR hasn't been a torrid grower by any stretch, but at least as a business it's mostly held up.The question is if that can continue - and if NTGR, after a 17% post-earnings pop last week, can gain if it does. For now, both appear likely. New products are driving sales, and secular trends should benefit growth in the company's Connected Home segment. Valuation is muted, with NTGR on a trailing twelve-month basis priced for ~zero growth, and backing out cash likely at a 10-11x multiple to 2020 earnings.There are risks. NTGR has significantly underperformed my sum of the parts case from a year ago, though the collapse in Arlo's valuation is the primary factor (and no longer a concern here). Competition, particularly with Amazon.com (AMZN) acquiring NETGEAR's mesh rival eero, is a concern. But this still is a company with dominant market share in markets that should see some modest growth. With margins recovering and initiatives in place to drive bottom-line growth, I still think NTGR has room to run from here.At its Analyst Day last year, NETGEAR laid out aggressive long-term targets:Source: NETGEAR Analyst Day presentationIt's quite clear that the market doesn't believe those targets. On a trailing twelve-month basis, NTGR trades ex-cash at something like 12.5x net income (excluding interest contribution). Given past guidance for free cash flow conversion in the 85-100% range, that suggests a P/FCF multiple around 14x. That's not a multiple that prices in 10%+ annual earnings growth, particularly in this market.Even the top-line projections look potentially aggressive, as seen so far this year. Revenue has declined over 4% year-over-year in the first half. The midpoint of Q3 guidance given in the Q2 release suggests, at the midpoint, growth of just over 1%, but NETGEAR clearly has been conservative with guidance for several years now. Even assuming the company can reach normal seasonality - which it's targeted as a 22-25% increase in second-half sales versus Q1- full-year growth will only be 1-2%, and analysts see that type of sequential performance as aggressive.Meanwhile, NETGEAR has to drive revenue growth mostly in a WiFi market that, at least at the moment, is declining. (The Connected Home segment, which focuses on consumers, generated 72% of trailing twelve-month sales, though its profit contribution is in the high 50s on a percentage basis.) The market fell 8% in Q1, per that quarter's call, and 4.5% in Q2. Both declines were greater than NETGEAR expected, as CEO Patrick Lo explained on the Q2 call, and the company does see potentially further, if smaller, declines in the second half.With NTGR priced for ~zero growth at least, recent revenue trends have to improve to drive real upside here. And there's reason to think they won't. The router market is shrinking at the moment - and NETGEAR, by its accounting, owns about half that market. The company moved up some of its WiFi 6 (technically known as 802.11ax) routers to try and drive sales, given that its size means it can actually move that market. But that strategy hasn't been as effective as the company hoped, given that the market is declining at a faster rate than it expected.Looking forward, over time, router unit sales are flat at best, and even Lo has said repeatedly that NETGEAR can only drive growth through higher pricing. On the SMB side, NETGEAR has even larger share in switches - 55% at retail, per the Q2 earnings slides - but the same broad problem holds. Growth in that market, too, is relatively limited, with share gains and pricing required to drive growth.Indeed, NETGEAR's history would seem to further support top-line concerns. Recast financials from the 10-K - which exclude Arlo - show that revenue declined 23% between 2014 and 2018. The only year in which sales rose was last year - by less than 2%. Getting from there - and modest growth at best in 2019 - to ""mid-single-digit"" revenue increases seems a difficult, if not impossible task.And it might be. Indeed, I'm still somewhat skeptical of the targets. But there are some reasons for the dreaded ""this time is different"" case to take hold here. First, there's been a significant, long-running headwind here: service provider revenue. Those sales - to broadband providers - totaled $580 million in 2014, per that year's 10-K. (Arlo's service provider revenues were minimal even last year, so it had zero impact on that number.) The total in 2018 was $160 million.The declines came in part because NETGEAR, in early 2015, refocused its strategy on profitability over revenue. But whatever the cause, the effect on sales has been enormous. Total revenue dropped 23% in four years; excluding service provider sales, however, the figure actually rose over 13%, a 3.2% CAGR.That headwind is fading simply because the service provider contribution is getting smaller, representing just 13% of trailing twelve-month revenue. It hasn't diminished entirely: service provider weakness (including a lost deal in Australia) pressured Q2 results, and Lo noted on the Q1 call that the business now has profitability roughly equivalent to that of the retail business. But the company sees a return to something close to normalcy in Q3, one reason why guidance for the quarter beat analyst expectations (something that rarely happens given that NTGR clearly guides low).There also are more positive catalysts ahead. The shift to WiFi 6 is only just beginning - and should drive selling prices higher. The company's Nighthawk line, for instance, is priced from $199 to $499 for the highest-end, gaming-focused router. The Orbi 'mesh' product has had strong sales since its launch, and smart speaker Orbi Voice has been reasonably well-reviewed. 5G hotspots have been launched for AT&T (T), and that's a enormous opportunity as that standard takes hold in coming years.NETGEAR is looking to subscription revenue, including for its Armor cybersecurity offering, which can help both sales and margins. Last year's acquisition of Meural, a ""smart art frame"", can contribute (though the jury is still out and NETGEAR paid just $22 million). SMB remains reasonably stable, but an emphasis on the VAR (value-added reseller) channel can drive increased adoption of switches in use cases like surveillance and AV.There's a nice potential combination here of trends helping in Connected Home at the same time the service provider headwind is fading. I wouldn't be so quick to write off NETGEAR's growth potential just yet.There is one obvious headwind to revenue growth: competition. It's already had an impact on the stock: NTGR's shares fell 15% the day after Amazon announced its acquisition of eero in February. Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) has Google Home. Other competitors include CommScope (COMM) unit ARRIS, Foxconn's Linksys, and others.And it's not just a revenue issue, either: those rivals, particularly the giants, can pressure NETGEAR's margins. As Lo noted on the Q4 call, ""their business model is selling customers' data and if anyone of them behave irrationally in the market, that would be tough."" I'm not sure Amazon necessarily fits that characterization, but its pricing discipline is well-known at this point. If NETGEAR has to cut prices on the Orbi to match the eero, for instance, those promotions act as contra-revenue and hit gross and operating margins reasonably hard. (That's essentially what happened to Arlo over the holiday season.)With TTM non-GAAP EBIT margins in the mid-8% range, it doesn't take much in the way of pricing pressure to materially change underlying profitability. The February sell-off shows that investors are quite concerned about Amazon, particularly with its existing inroads into 'smart home' via the Echo.That said, here, too, I wouldn't write off NETGEAR just yet. Google has been in the market for some time, and hasn't taken much in the way of market share. Echo aside, Amazon hasn't been great in hardware. eero hasn't moved to 802.11ax yet, and indeed few of the smart home players have plans to adopt WiFi 6.NETGEAR has dominant share - and it's ahead in WiFi 6, and ahead in 5G hotspots. As we've seen with Roku (ROKU), a better product can win even against giants. Subscription revenue growth (admittedly still small; NETGEAR has said it will disclose the actual figure once it reaches 10% of gross profit) can offset some hardware pricing pressure as well. The 15% operating margin target on its own suggests ~75% profit increases from current levels; here, too, even improvement short of the target implies solid growth going forward.That said, competition is a risk that needs to be watched closely, particularly during the upcoming holiday season. And if Amazon decides to ramp investment behind eero, that could pressure NTGR's stock on its own.On a trailing twelve-month basis, backing out nearly $7 per share in cash, NTGR trades at 12.3x adjusted earnings (excluding interest income) and 8.5x EBITDA. And so the bet is reasonably simple: if NETGEAR grows earnings, its stock rises, and if profits fall, so does NTGR.I'm still willing to take that bet - and, interestingly, so is NETGEAR. Ahead of the Arlo spin, the company had talked up its cash balance and seemed to float the idea of M&A. This year, however, the focus has been on share repurchases. A new buyback authorization includes nearly 15% of the current share count, and it seems like at the moment the company plans to be aggressive in using that authorization.There are risks here, but - again - performance and potential here still seem better than the market realizes. NETGEAR is a leader in two key end markets at a time when increasing data demands should drive dollar growth in both markets. If it can hold off larger rivals, the gains in NTGR's stock from the lows should continue."
4251001,69175,2019-03-26T08:08:51-04:00,"Netgear's 5G and Wi-Fi 6 products may turn out to be major revenue drivers for the company in the coming years, but the company isn't there yet.Besides, Amazon's acquisition of Eero doesn't bode well for Netgear.The networking giant's revenues and its shares could remain subdued and distressed over the next two quarters at least as it lacks short-term growth catalysts.","Shares of Netgear (NTGR) have remained distressed for the better part of the past year now; the stock is down 30% from the highs it created in last year’s July. The company is lacking in short-term growth catalysts and I believe its shares will remain under pressure and can head lower from the current levels over the next two quarters at the very least. Let’s take a closer look.(Source: Bigstockphoto, Image license purchased by author)Let me start by saying that Netgear does indeed have a few growth catalysts lined up ahead that have the potential to materially bolster its sales over 2020 and maybe even beyond. The only problem here is that we realistically don’t know how big or small these opportunities are going to be, and when they’ll start to account for a meaningful portion of Netgear’s overall revenue.For instance, there’s a new buzzword in the networking domain of late: Wi-Fi 6. This next-generation standard of wireless networking, also known as 802.11ax, is better than the currently leading 802.11ac tech on several fronts – throughput, bandwidth and power efficiency amongst other facts. The slide by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), attached below, highlights the applications and benefits of Wi-Fi 6.(Source: Intel)Now, Netgear is into the business of manufacturing and selling routers, so naturally, the industry’s shift from 802.11ac to 802.11ax would trigger an upgrade spree amongst retail and enterprise customers. This may result in higher shipments for Netgear. Besides, the new tech would naturally be sold at a premium compared to the dated 802.11ac-based products, which is dated and has more or less become mainstream by now, so the upgrade spree stands to also boost Netgear’s ARPUs in 2020-21.(Source: BusinessQuant.com)The industry's transition to Wi-Fi 6 is expected to happen quite quickly, at least on fancy marketing slides and ambitious excel sheets. ABI Research forecasts that WiFi-6 routers would reach 1 billion shipments by 2022, within merely three years of its first commercial rollout. I'll let readers decide whether this is a realistic forecast or whether it sounds too good to be true.Besides, the transition from 4G to 5G wireless services over the coming quarters stands to enable a myriad range of IoT applications. This is another area where Netgear stands to benefit. The company recently announced the rollout of world’s first millimeter wave 5G mobile device and their management noted during their Q4 earnings call that they would be coming out with more 5G devices over the course of 2019.But with that said, let’s also look at some of the challenges faced by Netgear.For starters, the problem with Netgear’s 5G and Wi-Fi 6 prospects is that these two potential catalysts won’t start accounting for a material portion of Netgear’s revenue over the coming quarters. For starters, Netgear is still in the process of developing and rolling out Wi-Fi 6 routers. The commercial rollout of these products may begin in 2019 but we can’t expect it to go mainstream this year itself. I’m of the opinion that the mass adoption of Wi-Fi 6 routers will begin in 2020, once the new tech has made its way into consumer devices (phones, tablets, IoT devices), meaning we still have to wait for a few more quarters before the Wi-Fi 6 upgrade spree starts to bolster Netgear’s sales.Not to mention, Netgear’s 5G business isn’t exactly expected to ramp exponentially right away either. When asked about the size of this business vertical during their Q4 earnings call, Netgear’s management noted:To put things in perspective, Netgear registered $288.9 million in Q4 revenue. This means that its $35 million worth of 5G business represents just about 12% of its overall revenue. Sure, the segment may turn out to be a huge revenue driver for the company over the coming years but we aren't there yet. Also, as the management stated, its 5G-related revenues won’t be sizable during 2019 at least, so investors shouldn't go overboard with expectations.The challenge for Netgear and its shareholders would be that there aren’t any short-term growth triggers that can meaningfully drive the company’s growth over the next three quarters, or at least until its 5G and Wi-Fi 6 products start to become mainstream market products and subsequently revenue drivers for the company. I suspect the next few quarters would be dull for the company and its shares would languish along the way unless the networking giant comes up with a new roadmap that materially changes this sales outlook.(Source: BusinessQuant.com)The chart attached above would highlight that Netgear’s revenue has been more or less range-bound if not stagnating across both its operating segments. One factor that can particularly weigh on its revenue trends over the coming couple of quarters is Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquisition of a mesh router company called Eero which is a direct competitor for Netgear. This development has twofold repercussions:(Source: BusinessQuant.com)Granted that Netgear is a prominent name in the networking space but it’s currently faced with a few challenges for the time being at least. Only time will tell how big of an impact the Eero acquisition would have on its business, and when exactly its 5G and 802.11ax products would start to become a material growth driver for the overall company. As a result of this dynamic, I expect its shares to stay distressed over the next couple of months and forecast a rebound only beyond H2 CY19 if all goes as per management’s plan.Author's Note: I'll be writing another report on Netgear this week, you can click the ""Follow"" button at the top of this page to stay updated.

4349878,22786,2020-05-25T09:37:39-04:00,"Netgear's revenue growth picked up at the tail-end of the first quarter.Paid subscribers could double.Mesh network, WiFi 6, and hotspots are positive drivers for revenue growth.","Netgear (NTGR) shares are little changed since its valuations were last reviewed in Jan. 2020. Anyone who bought NTGR stock on the massive March 18 sell-off would have done well. The stock added $10 from there and is back at the $25 level. After work from home levels surged during the lock-down, the company should have reported strong unit sales thanks to WiFi 6 router and 5G mobile hotspot. Instead, the company faced a few headwinds in the period. Should investors look at the quarterly revenue short-fall as a temporary setback? Does Netgear have positive catalysts ahead that will send the company’s valuation back to the $1 billion levels?Netgear reported revenue falling 7.7% year-on-year to $229.96 million. It earned 21 cents a share (non-GAAP) but lost 14 cents on a GAAP basis. The difference is due to the exclusion of stock-based compensation of $5.6 million, litigation reserves, and amortization of intangibles.Below: Netgear erased March's losses.Data by YChartsNetgear stock trended higher after the April 22 report because the company said on its conference call that market demand strengthened toward the end of the quarter. The ""massive shift to work from home around the world"" increased demand for WiFi 6 centric chips in its consumer market. On the small and medium business, Power-over-Ethernet demand improved.Geographically, sales in the Americas rose 6.9% Y/Y but in EMEA, net revenue fell 26%. The latter drop is due to tougher yearly comparisons. In Q1/2019, a scheduled Brexit deadline accelerated orders. Similarly, investors may expect the increasing work from home movement will increase hardware sales in the current quarter.Netgear ended the quarter with $209.7 million in cash. It reduced its inventory by $54.9 million. This positions it to shift its mix towards more highly profitable products like WiFi 6.Increasing demand for better wireless coverage in large homes may drive WiFi 6 Mesh product sales higher. Netgear sells its Mesh products in varying sizes, with prices in the range of $229 to $699. Its two major competitors do not have a comparable product on the market. This will give the networking firm a strong lead.Netgear said that “mobile hotspots are now being used by people working from home when they are not able to get high-speed wired Internet access.” For example, first responders relied on hotspots during the pandemic. So, after adding a record 51,000 paid subscribers for its mobile hotspot service, it ended the quarter with 228,000. The strong demand should continue throughout the year. Netgear should have no problem exceeding its goal of more than doubling its subscriber base in 2020.The Pro AV, or Professional AV over IP, the product is another growth opportunity for the company. Announced on Nov. 5, 2019, the shift from 1080 to 4K and from 4K to 8K will drive the demand for this product line.Long time readers may follow the many 5G stock ideas published over the last year. Nokia (NOK), AT&T (T), and NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) are just a few companies that benefit from 5G. Similarly, Netgear’s 5G WiFi 6 mobile hotspot offers its customers double the performance of a 4G mobile hotspot. For now, chances are good that mobile hotspot solutions will lead to higher service provider revenue.Price target and Your TakeawayFew analysts cover Netgear but those who rank the stock as a “buy” have a price target between $30 - $38:Data Courtesy of TipranksSince Netgear will likely report stronger service provider revenue in the coming quarters, the stock may offer investors another $10 in upside, or a gain of 38%. This is based on the following metrics in a 5-year DCF EBITDA Exit model:Data courtesy of finbox (click on the link to re-calculate fair value)After the run-up, Netgear probably has a limited upside in the near-term. My $35 price target may not play out until later this year. If it gets there, the stock will return to the billion-dollar market capitalization it lost due to selling pressure in the last year."
4279127,104952,2019-07-30T15:13:29-04:00,"Despite optimistic outlook into Q3 and Q4, Several declining trends in the major market in which Netgear operates will create a significant headwind going into FY 2020.We like the fact that Netgear has been leveraging its strength to serve the demands in gaming market through its new Wi-Fi 6 fast router product.Netgear will need to use Q3 and Q4 to prove that it could reverse the declining U.S. retail Wi-Fi market trends with its new Wi-Fi 6 product.","We’ve learned a few things from the most recent Netgear (NTGR) earnings call in Q2. On a positive note, we are pleased that Netgear has made the move into the trending and growing gaming market. Its newly-launched product line, Nighthawk fast router, provides significant performance upgrades to professional gaming and deployment in densely-populated locations such as stadiums or airports and is manufactured using the latest Wi-Fi 6, 802.11ax wireless standard.On a more negative note, new standard introductions mean two things; 1) It will take time before mass-market adoption happens. 2) During the adoption period, hardware with older standards (802.11ac) will face slower growth due to a deprecation effect as newer-standard hardware (802.11ax) is introduced.(Source: Google finance. NGTR performance YTD).Based on those two fronts, we feel that the market had taken an expected action to do a wait-and-see in regards to how Netgear will be able to manage their inventories older-standard hardware during or ahead of the displacements and how they will position themselves to battle the declining trends in their core market. In light of the Q2 earnings call, we saw that Netgear being down more than 20% YTD before rising into $34 per share in a matter of a few days, which means it is now up 3% YTD.As a long-term investor, overall, we are still positive about Netgear’s prospect going forward after taking into account the downsides. On a more cautious note, we do feel that despite Netgear beating the Q2’s EPS expectation with solid guidance, it will be in on a more roller-coaster ride at least until the second half of 2020, where broader 5G rollouts by mobile service providers and market adoption of its Wi-Fi 6 products will have taken place.Across the board, we saw how Netgear’s Connected Home segment’s YoY revenue went down by almost 3% in Q2 2019 due to several declining trends in the US retail markets. Apart from the slight cannibalisation effect as Netgear’s new Wi-Fi 6 generation routers are trending up while some of their customers are shifting from Netgear’s main legacy 802.11ac generation router product lines, we also think that the revenue decline was partly driven by the rise of unlimited fast data plans offered by mobile service providers which potentially reduces the demand for home broadband subscription.(Source: Author. Netgear’s Q2 YoY Revenue 2018-2019 and business segment trends).We are optimistic that Netgear’s Wi-Fi 6 routers and overall smart devices segment will gain significant tractions in gaming and the smart home market for the long term. The greater cause for concern for us would be Netgear’s ability to gain significant traction from its mobile Wi-Fi segment. Portable device such as mobile Wi-Fi is very useful during leisure or business travels. With the 5G rolling out, that means there is a need for 5G-compatible mobile Wi-Fi devices. However, outside the Americas, 5G remains a frontier technology in most of Netgear's market, such as EMEA and APAC. The issue mainly has to do with the inadequate infrastructure that will delay the rollouts of 5G in less-developed markets further. In the last Q2 earnings call, the company claimed that the reduced spending by US mobile service providers such as T-mobile and AT&T (T) has created downward pressures on their Connected Home revenue segment in Q2 ahead of the 5G rollout. We also believe that the company has a bigger problem to solve when it comes to working around the short-term seasonality headwinds than the decreased spending due to delay in 5G rollout. Net revenue for the Americas was $157 million, which is down 9.9% YoY, though up 6.2% on a sequential basis. However, the company is also guiding to more optimistic Q3 net revenue within the range of $265 million - $280 million driven by the back-to-school spending. While the seasonality effect may continue until Q4 2019, it remains questionable whether 5G rollout could be a double-edged sword for the company. There is a possibility that the expected uptrend of mobile Wi-Fi ahead of 5G rollout by the service providers could be reversed by the greater systemic trend in adoption of 5G unlimited mobile data plan, which comes bundled with the phones and reduces demand for home internet broadband.Netgear is currently trading at a P/Sales around 0.96. If Netgear ends the year at P/Sales of 1.12, it would mean that it trades only slightly lower than its all-time high P/Sales in 2018 of 1.13. Given its Meural acquisition and continuation of its add-on cyberthreat protection plan, Armor, which was launched in 2018, we think that the strengthened recurring revenue stream will add a premium into Netgear’s sales going forward.(Source: Stockrow)That is why, at P/Sales of 0.96, we feel that Netgear is currently a little undervalued, though it probably is a reflection of the upcoming uncertainties going into FY 2020 with significant headwinds. Netgear has been having a challenging year so far. The company has now been working towards reversing the declining trends in the U.S. retail Wi-Fi market followed by increasing trends in unlimited data plan from the service providers which potentially reduces ongoing demand for home internet. In the light of that, we think that Netgear has made the right bet going into gaming and smart devices market, and are quite optimistic that Netgear will finish the year as expected, while also remain positive that FY 2020 will be much better for the stock. The latest Q2 earnings call has also given a slightly positive outlook that the management team will be able to slowly reverse the trends by taking advantage of the seasonal retail market momentum in Q3 onwards into the holiday season at Q4 to push for greater Wi-Fi 6 and subscription-based product adoptions across the board."

But bottom fishers seeking value are buying the stop on the dip. At a modest P/E of 17.6 times and exceptionally strong EPS growth of 62% in the next five years (per finviz data), should investors bet that the recent setback is temporary?There are three reasons to buy Netgear stock on the dip.Netgear reported third-quarter revenue of $265.9 million, and even though this missed estimates, it commands the majority of the U.S. retail WiFi and network Switch market share.Source: NetgearIts share of 51% and 53%, respectively, suggests that when Netgear customers upgrade, growth will resume. The company has three WiFi 6 products in the quarter and ended the quarter with seven. But revenue fell 1.3% year-on-year, which also hurt its non-GAAP operating margin. Geographically, revenue from the Americas grew 1.6% Y/Y, EMEA fell 6.8% Y/Y, and APAC net revenue fell 6.7%.Netgear benefits from a product mix of wireless and wireless product revenue split at 68% and 32%, respectively. Home products make up 72% of its revenue. So, with key technology inflections in mesh networks, WiFi 6, 5G, content streaming, and gaming, consumers need new Netgear products. With a large install base, the company has an opportunity to grow its recurring revenue. Netgear aims to have a 15% operating margin (non-GAAP). NTGR stock reset lower in the last week because investors expressed disappointment over its short-term delays in getting there.In the third quarter, Netgear consumed $26.1 million in cash flow from continuing operations. Still, it ended the quarter with $171.9 million in cash. At $5.52 a share in cash compared to its $27 stock price, no debt, and a book value of $19.91, the company has room to improve cash flow. After moving its manufacturing sites out of China, it will work down its buffered inventory levels. This will lead to positive cash flow generation next.Netgear spent $22 million in share buybacks or 679,000 shares at an average price of $32.34. And even though the price paid is above its current price, continued share buybacks on the dip will minimize any further downside on the stock.Netgear's Connect Home segment delivered $190.7 million in revenue, down 2.1% year-over-year but up 13.8% sequentially. Nighthawk, Orbi, Nighthawk Pro Gaming, and Meural brands are advanced products. Unfortunately, they did not resonate with consumers fast enough, leading to the sluggish revenue. But with the holiday season approaching, Netgear may both run promotions and advertising campaigns during the Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and holiday season to drive revenue.Despite the seasonal strength ahead, Netgear forecasts the U.S. WiFi market declining Y/Y. Plus, WiFi 6 router products will offset the decline.Below: Netgear's marketing for WiFi 6.Source: Netgear (slide 11)With the Orbi WiFi 6 Mesh system, the Nighthawk retailing for $600 and the Nighthawk WiFi 6 Mesh extender on the market facing no competition, Netgear need not lower prices. To re-accelerate growth, sales of its insight cloud management solution for SMBs will enable the company to expand in adjacent markets. Its ProAV switch for deploying AV over IP also expands potential sales. Its introduction of Meural Canvas II, a digital Canvas, may expand its market beyond routers.Below: higher ASPs for Netgear products.Source: NetgearNetgear's Meural initiative may not take off. Though subscription is $69.95 a year, consumers may use other image marketplaces instead.The company's light fourth quarter will limit the upside on NTGR stock. GAAP operating margins will be in the range of 0.1% to 1.1%. And for 2019, revenue will fall to the single-digits while operating profits could fall by over 30%. Netgear's reliance on the WiFi 6 rollout may lag expectations.Netgear is in the middle phase of shifting production outside of China. It has built up inventory to help buffer any potential delays in the transition. With a market capitalization of under $1 billion, this small-cap company may reward value investors. If Q4 turns around better than expected, the stock will quickly rally back to the $34-36 level reached in early September. Seasonal strength in the current quarter is another tailwind that might give the stock another reason to rebound."

(Source: Techcrunch)According to a market report by Consumer Digest, U.S. digital art frame sales dropped to $88.6 million in 2012 from $159.4 million in 2011. Main factors driving market decline were the low replacement rate and low picture quality.This acquisition is part of NetGear’s desire to locate a home WiFi router inside the digital art frame. According to another 2018 market research report by Transparency Market Research, the global home WiFi market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.6% between 2018 and 2026.The main drivers for this expected growth are the growth of telecommunications, residential & commercial sector, and industrial development.Asia-Pacific is projected to be the industry leader, growing at a CAGR of 8% during the forecast period.Major competitive vendors that provide or are developing home WiFi electronics include:Netgear didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so the acquisition was likely for a financially non-material amount.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that NTGR had $355.6 million in cash and short-term investments and $501 million in total liabilities.Free cash flow during the six months ended July 1, 2018, was $26.7 million.In the past 12 months, NTGR’s stock price has risen 42.1% vs. the S&P 500 Index 13%, as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)Netgear has acquired Meural as part of a plan to reduce the footprint of its WiFi routers by putting them inside the digital art frame. The new device combination will also be applicable to hotel room environments as it allows the device to be hidden in the digital frame reducing the opportunity for theft or damage.NTGR wants to create new, differentiated product categories and was previously an investor in Meural’s Series A financing round, so appears to have been considering this approach for some time.As its routers become increasingly commodified, Netgear management is correctly looking for higher margin product extension or branching opportunities to build on its connected home & office ambitions.I expect to see additional investments and/or acquisitions in this fertile environment for Netgear. There will likely be many opportunities for NTGR’s nimble management team to consider as they attempt to become a more important player in the connected home and office space.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4194993,25120,2018-08-05T06:57:06-04:00,"Netgear is a company which never surfaced on my radar until Arlo went public.The former subsidiary of Netgear represents quite a bit of value, presenting investors with a potentially appealing relative arbitrage play.If shares of Netgear drop a little further or Arlo's shares move higher, I am tempted to buy Netgear and short Arlo.","Netgear (NTGR) is a company which never surfaced on my radar until I found out it was the former mother company and now major shareholder of Arlo (ARLO). Following the IPO of this business, Netgear becomes a relatively appealing arbitrage play, especially if the valuation of the remaining assets of Netgear rapidly approaches zero in case of a momentum run in the shares of Arlo.Netgear claims to be an innovative leader in connecting the world to the Internet; that is at least the mission statement of the company. The company focuses on leadership in WiFi, LTE, and wire-free products. Other key features of its line up include the fact that intelligent software and cloud connectivity are combined with a seamless mobile experience.Arlo is its line-up of savvy security/monitoring solutions, but more about that company in this article, as this former subsidiary just went public. Besides Arlo, Netgear reports divisional results for connected home and SMB.For the year of 2017, the company reported a 6% increase in revenues to $1.41 billion. The company did report a 12% decline in adjusted earnings. Reported adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.74, as GAAP profits only amounted to $0.59 per share. Much of the discrepancy is due to the tax reform as stock-based compensation was a very real expense, amounting to $0.67 per share. Adjusted for that number and accepting the other changes to non-GAAP earnings, my estimate of earnings power only amounts to $2.07 per share.Note that Arlo contributed $378 million in revenues in 2017, with connected home generating $762 million in revenues and SMB posting $266 million. It should be noted that sales of both connected home and SMB segments were on a downward trajectory, with both of them posting sales declines of roughly 10%.As a whole the company reported GAAP operating margins of 6.2%, while adjusted margins totalled 8.7% of sales. GAAP operating profits amounted to $86 million, of which the S1-Filing of Arlo reveals a $6 million contribution from that business. Hence the two remaining businesses of Netgear report operating earnings of $80 million on $1.03 billion in sales.Knowing that Arlo has become a separate business, I focus on the remaining connected home and SMB businesses. Connected home reported an 8% decline in first-quarter sales as revenue from the much smaller SMB business was up by 3%. Things improved in the second quarter, as sales of connected home grew by 3% and SMB growth accelerated to 7%.What is of interest is the sum-of-the-part valuation of Netgear. With 31.7 million shares outstanding on a diluted basis, the market value of the company stands at $2.09 billion, trading at $66 per share.The company holds $355 million in cash and equivalents. It will make a $70 million cash contribution to Arlo, reducing the net cash to $285 million. Following the IPO, Netgear still holds 62.5 million shares in Arlo. Trading at $22 per share on the opening day, this stake is valued at $1.37 billion. This means that operating assets of Netgear are valued at $435 million.That is the value currently attached to the connected home and SMB businesses which generate about a billion in sales. The problem is that operating margins appear to be trending lower. Reported adjusted operating margins totalled 8.7% for all of 2017. Assuming similar margins for the remaining businesses, adjusted operating profits are seen around $87 million on a billion in sales.That does not yet account for the 250 basis point margin pressure seen so far this year, resulting in adjusted operating earnings trending at levels closer to $62 million. The problem is that this number excludes stock-based compensation running at a rate of $35 million a year.Assuming that $20 million of the stock-based compensation expense can be attributed to the remaining core business, I peg adjusted operating profits at $42 million these days. As the company is not leveraged, no interest expenses will be incurred. Assuming a 20% tax rate, I see net earnings power at $34 million. That more or less suggests that the remaining businesses (which are not really growing) trade at 12-13 times earnings, a modest valuation by all means.The interesting part of Netgear is the interplay with Arlo. To explain this: Netgear holds 62.5 million shares in Arlo and its stock hardly moved after shares of Arlo moved higher from $19 to $22 on Friday (representing roughly $200 million in incremental value for Netgear). The lack of reaction is interesting as the move higher in Arlo added about $6 per share to the value of Netgear's shares.The appeal in my eyes is that the valuation of Netgear's remaining assets is relatively limited, at $435 million or 12 times earnings based on the calculation above. In my eyes, there is some upside based on the cheap and unleveraged valuation, especially as margins have been trending a bit lower and corporate cost allocation for Arlo might ""fall"" away.Hence I am quite attracted to buy into Netgear and sell Arlo short (in the right proportion) if the value of the remaining core assets falls further or perhaps approaches zero. Of course, it will become more clearer in the following quarters upon the effective split, as I am quite compelled to the potential relative arbitrage play which is unfolding now."
4192964,24594,2018-08-01T09:26:32-04:00,"NTGR stock tanked after earnings for the third consecutive quarter despite a beat - once again due to concerning guidance.An apparent deceleration in Arlo growth ahead of that unit's IPO also represents a concern.But there's some good news here, between pricing for the Arlo IPO and in what will be the remaining business.Investor reaction does make some sense - but even pulling down expectations modestly, $65 remains an attractive price.","Heading into last Monday's Q2 report, NETGEAR (NTGR) was my largest position (and it still is). So I'm not entirely thrilled with a 13% decline following the report - or with the report itself. Most notably (at least to my eye), Arlo revenue growth decelerated. That's a key point given that my own model suggests that Arlo, ahead of an IPO in the second half of this year, supports over half of NETGEAR's current enterprise value. Margin concerns - an issue over the past several quarters - persist, with relatively thin profitability guided for Q3, driven in part by costs related to the separation of the two businesses.That said, I'm not ready to push the panic button just yet. Arlo revenue still grew a solid 36% year-over-year. Pricing for the IPO seems to support the argument that the remaining NETGEAR businesses are available dirt cheap. And it's important to remember that we've been here before. In one of the weirder trading patterns I remember seeing, NTGR fell 15% after Q4 numbers, 10% after Q1, and now 13% after Q2. Yet the stock is up 57% over the past year - and trades pretty much in line with where it did before Q4, after mixed trading the last few sessions.Essentially, each quarter the market has ignored a beat (relative to both the Street and guidance, the latter of which at this point has to be considered conservative, if not sandbagged) and focused on the outlook. Investors then spend the next three months buying the dip before the whole process starts again. That history doesn't guarantee that the pattern will repeat a third time - but there's enough here to suggest that it very well might.The bear case relative to NTGR for some time has centered around competition. The expansion of Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) into Hardware has made that behemoth a direct competitor in routers (Google Wifi) and in IoT (NETGEAR's expanding Arlo portfolio against Alphabet's Nest). NETGEAR's own market share figures from recent slides cite eight competitors in IP cameras (and more on the way, including IP telephony provider Ooma (OOMA)), and 6 apiece in consumer Wifi and switches (where NETGEAR mostly focuses on the SMB market).Add to that potential secular pressures from 5G, which could conceivably sharply reduce the need for in-home routers, and steadily declining sales to Internet service providers (to be leased to end customers), and the bearish argument for NTGR isn't necessarily (just) that it's overvalued. Rather, the core of the bear case here is that the business should head into decline at some point amid competitive and secular pressures. Given short interest that stands currently at 8%, and briefly exceeded 10% late last year (up from ~3% in early 2017), some market participants certainly hold that view.I'd imagine some of the shorts are rather frustrated at the moment because there is some evidence backing that thesis in the last few quarters. Most notably, margins have compressed:source: NTGR Q2 earnings presentationThe Q2 figure is compressed by spend ahead of the pending spin-off of the Arlo IP camera division, which according to the Q2 conference call totaled about $5.1 million. But that spend only adds about 140 bps of pressure.The margin compression has come because NETGEAR has had to spend more in advertising and, in particular, on promotional expenditures to compete at retailers like BestBuy (BBY) and Amazon (AMZN). And that has significantly hit NETGEAR's profitability: operating income through the first half is down 21%, including a 16% decline in Q2.And on that front, Q3 guidance looks particularly concerning. Separation-related spend is estimated to rise to $19 million on a non-GAAP basis, which will push EBIT margins down to just 4-5%. (Note that spend is recurring; one-time expenses are excluded from the non-GAAP figures. An email to NTGR investor relations trying to get more color on the nature of the spend by unit hasn't been returned as of this writing.) By my numbers, that implies Q3 adjusted EPS of about $0.45 - against consensus heading into the report of $0.72. That, in turn, raises the question of just how valuable the non-Arlo business will be post-spin, while the acceleration to $19 million in the quarter suggests a larger hit to earnings for the separated companies than I, and likely other investors, anticipated.So, I can understand why some investors sold off NTGR after the quarter, particularly with a strong run into the release. (The stock still is up a few points for the month despite the 13% post-earnings drop.) But I still think, looking closer, there's room for optimism ahead of the Arlo IPO next week.Margins are a concern - but it's worth reiterating that NETGEAR clearly has guided conservatively over the past few quarters. Meanwhile, the SOTP case I laid out in June still holds up, even if it might look a touch more aggressive at the moment. The basic math was:That valued NTGR from $83-92 - 28%+ upside at the time, and 26-40% above a current price just below $66. I can see a case that the range maybe needs to get pulled down post-Q2, but at current levels, there still are some nice gains.For Arlo, the 36% increase in sales in Q2 was a deceleration. But CEO Patrick Lo called it a strong quarter on the Q2 conference call, and a 44% first-half increase still puts Arlo on a nice path to $500 million-plus in revenue this year.Meanwhile, the Arlo IPO reportedly is coming on Friday, and initial pricing of $18-20 per share supports a solid valuation. That pricing, along with a diluted pro forma share count of 74.2 million share and 84.2% ownership by NETGEAR (both assuming underwriters' options are exercised) values the Arlo stake at $1.125-1.2 billion.That obviously is a discount to my range - but a post-IPO pop would get the Arlo stake reasonably close to at least the low end of my model. And I'd be happy to own Arlo at $20 (though I'm probably unlikely to acquire more shares given my stake in NTGR). I still think Arlo is a better business than Axis and Avigilon; it's certainly growing faster. The Q2 call listed a series of launches, including Arlo Chime and Doorbell, that make the offering a true IoT play. The business maintains dominant market share in IP cameras, its AI capabilities are quickly improving, and subscription revenue will come in at high margins.There are risks here. The bearish comps for Arlo are GoPro (GPRO) and Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), and the hardware space can be tough for both businesses and stocks. EBITDA models do have to move down; I had estimated $30-40 million in incremental spend for Arlo, and it seems likely that figure is higher based on the $19 million in guided duplicative costs (which are split between the two businesses, though in what proportion isn't yet clear).But some of the initial spend is coming from investments in sales and marketing and R&D, both of which spiked in Q2. (Non-GAAP S&M rose 28% Y/Y; R&D increased 34%.) A good chunk of the $19 million is just the cost of having two businesses instead of one - but there's also more investments going into the Arlo platform that will be leveraged over time. I still think 3x revenue - a discount to Axis, and a huge discount to where GPRO and FIT traded early in their growth profiles - is a reasonable bogey, and that still gets to the $1.5 billion figure.And elsewhere in the business, Q2 looks pretty solid, at least from a revenue perspective. The SMB business grew 6%+, and market share in switches now is at 61%, per the Q2 earnings presentation, down a point Q/Q. Service provider revenue is starting to stabilize - the acquisition of Time Warner by Charter Communications (CHTR) caused some disruption, per the Q1 call - and is down to the low double-digits in terms of overall revenue. Wi-Fi market share ticked up 2 points to 52% per the Q2 slides; both Orbi 'mesh' products and the high-end Nighthawk are doing well.The higher costs are a potential issue here; I had estimated post-spin EBITDA around $90 million (adding back stock-based comp), and it's possible there's a $10-20 million impact there. A conservative 7-8x multiple means the business is valued as low as $500 million - but that seems too conservative. Belkin, a struggling rival, sold to a unit of Foxconn for 1.1x revenue. The Connected Home and SMB segments combined still are generating $1 billion-plus in annual sales; Orbi and Nighthawk are growth products unlike many in the networking space. I had argued the legacy business was worth at least $1 billion; I still think that's the case. Haircutting EBITDA based on Q3 cost guidance and bringing the revenue multiple down to 0.7-0.8x perhaps gets to $700-800 million.All told, I can see an argument that the past range of $83-92 might have been too aggressive. Post-Q2, NTGR could look more like this:At the non-GAAP share count of 32.7 million shares, that SOTP knocks NTGR down to a range of $66-72 - basically 0-10% upside. That said, I think this range is a bit too conservative - and a bit too short-sighted. It's not entirely clear to what extent the margin pressure, and the higher spend, necessarily is permanent. At the very least, a portion of it simply is being ramped to grow Arlo, and likely to a lesser extent Nighthawk and Orbi. It's worth remembering as well that NTGR has guided conservatively the last several quarters on both revenue and margins.NETGEAR ex-Arlo is going to have some room for M&A and to finally deploy the long-held cash on the balance sheets. And I still think Arlo will rise from its IPO pricing, with every $1 in Arlo shares above $18 adding ~$2.25 in value to NTGR. As such, I still think the range of $80+ holds, with Arlo worth $1.3B+, the rest of the business $1B+, plus cash on the books. The range above, which shows limited upside, seems more like a conservative case than a true test of fair value.Much will come down to the Arlo IPO, which obviously is the biggest near-term risk here. And trading in what could be a volatile issue post-IPO until the full stake is spun off next year could drive some volatility in NTGR as well. I'm still happy to ride it out, even if I'll admit to some understanding of the sell-off of the past few sessions."

The following text provides a good review of the company's smart internet-of-things platform:Source: arlo.comIs this another company selling security systems? No, it isn't.

In 2017, 2.3 million users visited the website of the Arlo Community.Source: community.netgear.comHow is the business growing at such a high pace? It seems evident that being part of NETGEAR has helped Arlo. As mentioned in the prospectus, Arlo has benefited from decades of expertise, long-standing relationships with suppliers, and established business processes and leadership teams.Which companies are competing with Arlo? Big corporations like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with Blink and Ring, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) with Nest, Samsung (OTC:SSDIY) and other large companies are offering their own solutions. Read the following lines for more information in this regard: Source: S-1 FilingAccording to Gartner, IoT endpoints hardware and services spending will be equal to $1.8 trillion by 2021. On the top of it, it is expected that total addressable market for the global connected home alone will grow from $45 billion in 2017 to $146 billion in 2021, which represents growth of 34% CAGR. Additionally, according to the NPD Group, the company expects to receive substantial demand from small businesses and local government agencies, in which the company owns 40% market share.The number of users and new clients is not the only beneficial feature of Arlo. The company's income statement also shows that business is doing great. The revenues and the gross profit grew at 100% and 139% to $370 million and $91 million in 2017 respectively. In addition, the company was able to be profitable in 2017 with $6.5 million in net income.It is interesting that sales expenditure is below research and development expenses in 2016 and 2017. The company spent $24 million and $34 million in R&D in 2016 and 2017 respectively. Investors should note that these expenses are what make the difference between a private security company and Arlo.Source: S-1 FilingThere is more on the revenues front. With the company making most of its revenues in the United States, the revenue potential in other territories is significant. The following image shows Arlo's revenue breakdown by geographic region:Source: S-1 FilingIt is also beneficial that Arlo increased its assets to $269 million in 2017, which represents 70% asset growth y/y. It is worrying that account receivables increased by 93% in 2017 to $157 million and inventories also increased to $82 million, 74% increase.Source: S-1 FilingWith that, it is also beneficial that total liabilities are not that significant.

The fact that the company will be controlled by NTGR is not ideal, but the company seems to be making great efforts to separate the management of both companies."
4130527,103910,2017-12-10T07:30:00-05:00,"Vince Martin typically starts his analysis by trying to reverse-engineer the current price and understand what that says about the market's projections.The importance of a healthy skepticism towards management plans, why flat is not the “new up” for retail comps and how to avoid value traps.Vince Martin shares a long thesis on Netgear.","Vince Martin has written about stocks for most of this decade, primarily here on Seeking Alpha. A brief stint in the financial industry at the peak of the dot-com bubble imparted a number of lessons that would serve him well - along with a healthy appreciation of downside risk. Notable calls include a bearish thesis on Aeropostale (NYSE:ARO), bullish thesis on Full House Resorts (NASDAQ:FLL), bullish thesis on Blucora (NASDAQ:BCOR) and bearish thesis on Stage Stores (NYSE:SSI). We emailed with Vince about how the casino has (and has not) changed, why it pays to start with the current stock price rather than the target price, and a formative experience in risk management.Seeking Alpha: Companies facing secular headwinds always claim to have a plan to combat it – how can investors evaluate the likely success of these plans? Can you give an example of where a plan worked out and where it didn’t?Vince Martin: If it's truly a secular headwind, then by definition, success is very unlikely. But broadly, one very useful trick is simply to listen to management - and note the vocabulary they're using. There have been a lot of plans in retail, for instance, in which management used 1,000 words to describe five “pillars” of a plan that is basically ""we're just going to do what we’ve been doing, only do it better."" And I think anytime a CEO calls e-commerce an “opportunity” without specifying why or what that opportunity is, there’s enough to at least consider a short.But if you look at Gap, for instance, who I badly underestimated, CEO Art Peck cited specific plans in terms of their supply chain, the footprint for the mall-heavy Gap and Banana Republic banners, and overall cost reductions. It was a detailed, logical strategy. So a company can find a path against those headwinds. But if management doesn’t have a feasible, detailed plan, it’s a safe bet that it won’t.SA: On a related note, one of your best calls was a bearish thesis on Aeropostale (ARO) - from a broader standpoint what retail strategies are (and are not) working? What are the key factors that bulls miss when evaluating struggling retailers?VM: In terms of brick-and-mortar retailing, I don't think any of the strategies really are working. There are a few exceptions like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) or Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), and maybe a few specialty plays. Tilly's (NYSE:TLYS) has done a fantastic job. As noted, Gap Inc. (NYSE:GPS) has taken a smart tack and performed much better than I expected over the past year. Still, neither stock looks all that attractive from the long side.But I think a lot of investors looking to time the bottom in the space are forgetting just how far expectations have fallen. The past few quarters, at least on a relative basis, flat comps sound like a good thing, right? On an absolute basis, however, they’re not - particularly at a time when wage and healthcare inflation is running rather high.And I still think investors are missing two key points on that front. The first is that flat comps, over time, generally mean declining profits. The idea that a ""stable"" business - if stable means 0-2% same-store sales growth - can support even a 10-12x P/E multiple strikes me as still too optimistic. Really, a ""not bad"" retailer should be at a single-digit multiple to cash flow, because all else equal, margins still will compress and that FCF will decline.The other point forgotten over the past 18-24 months is that, cyclically, we should be closer to a top than a bottom. If a retailer is posting -3% or -5% comps in this environment, what happens when the macro environment inevitably changes? Add to that the accounting changes coming that will convert operating leases to debt - wiping out the ""net cash"" a lot of retailers hold at the moment - and I don't think the carnage in the space is done.Shorting it is a matter of timing, as we've seen over the past few weeks. But I do think there will be another bite at the apple, particularly for the brands that either aren't big enough and/or aren't differentiated enough. Vera Bradley was one of my favorite shorts for most of the year - and it's presented another opportunity after a big move on Wednesday. I think we'll see some similar opportunities going forward.SA: A common investor frustration is missing out on an “obvious” trend for fear that the stock has already risen/fallen significantly – how do you avoid this type of thinking?VM: Honestly, by avoiding those trends - which has caused me to leave some money on the table in this market. I’ve definitely exited a number of successful retail shorts too early and backed off the gaming space last year, missing out on gains there over the past 4-5 quarters. Pigs get fed, etc. etc.But I think my experience in 2000-01 - being 21-22 years old and watching grown men blow up in real time - probably influences my thinking there. To a lot of investors, “the trend is your friend”. To me, it’s something that has a real risk of ending in tears.So, my usual thought process is that an “obvious” trend should already be priced in, and I tend to discount them in my analysis. That’s probably helpful in some ways, but I’ve certainly missed a few trades as a result.SA: You’ve identified a number of value traps – how do you avoid them?VM: Well, that's the million-dollar question, right? Echoing a previous answer, the biggest sign an investor almost always can get is from management. In terms of 'value' or 'cheap' stocks, the numbers almost always work on paper. But what will management do with the proceeds? How is the excess value apparent in the fundamentals realized? And, just as importantly, how - and when - will that value make its way to shareholders? If management isn’t saying, that’s a big problem.Often management IS saying, and often investors ignore them. If the CEO of a declining business is talking about a return to growth, it’s almost certainly a value trap. On paper, declining cash flow or an asset sale or whatever the pillars on the bull case are might support upside. But growth requires investment, and that in turn means the company is spending money that investors believe is more valuable in their own hands.The great example is magicJack (NASDAQ:CALL), which finally is selling itself at $8+. That was a stock that met all the value criteria and has attracted a number of value funds over the years. But they wouldn’t sell, wouldn’t distribute cash, and kept trying to restart growth, including through a disastrous acquisition. Easily, those actions cut a third off the final sale price, if not more. But they weren’t, or at least shouldn’t have been, a surprise.SA: You’ve covered casinos for a while - how has the industry changed in the past decade? What is the outlook for the group and the major drivers/metrics to focus on?VM: A big change in the U.S. has been the simple fact that there aren't any more markets left to enter. Since Ohio came online, the only markets of size left are really Atlanta and Texas - and there's just no political movement behind legalization in either place. So, you've seen casino managers instead focus solely on maximizing profits on a same-store basis, along with a modest pullback in promotional spending. Given the financial leverage most of the majors have, a few points in EBITDA margins here, and there makes a big, big difference in equity prices. It’s a much smaller version of the airline industry - more rational competitive activity improves margins, and leverage amplifies that improvement.In addition, what's been really surprising is the lack of innovation in the industry. The machine manufacturers like Scientific Games (NASDAQ:SGMS), IGT (NYSE:IGT), and Everi Holdings (NYSE:EVRI) still are waiting for the replacement cycle to begin. Consumers seem rather happy to play games that are 5 or 10 years old, and so the industry just isn’t spending more than it needs to. At a time when technology is having a huge impact on daily life, the last major innovation in the casino space was the move from coins to tickets. A casino floor looks essentially the same as it did a decade ago - can you say that about any other business?As far as the outlook goes, I backed off my bullishness toward the US regional sector, in particular, last year - and left a lot of money on the table as a result. Valuation is back toward 2007 levels, when Caesars went private in what might have been the worst LBO ever. And yet growth really isn't that impressive, and at some point, the margin gains have to run out. I still don't trust the Macau market, but I've missed out there as well. Overall, the space looks very dangerous to me at this point - but I was saying the same thing 6-9 months ago.We’ll see what happens with sports betting. Six years ago, pretty much everyone believed iGaming would be a $10 billion market at this point. We’re below $1 billion, excluding DFS, and there was no movement for 5 years until Pennsylvania legalized online poker - which is unlikely to be that big, since liquidity on the platforms there will continue be an issue. If the Supreme Court does open sports betting, I expect to see another short term pop for the regionals. But I’d caution that sports books aren’t that profitable, and without an online component, I’m skeptical of the enthusiasm, as I was regarding iGaming.SA: As much as the market is supposed to be forward looking, there are often opportunities present because it is focused on the past - in these types of situations, how you identify what is priced into the stock and what the market is missing?VM: One of the aspects of my writing that honestly might frustrate some readers is that I'm not real big on trying to determine a specific price target. I usually try to reverse-engineer the current price and understand what that says about the market's projections about the future trend.From there, it's a matter of trying to understand the business - and the industry - as well as possible.So, to your question, one key factor to understand relative to valuation is whether the market is pricing in a change - or the status quo. From there, it’s the simple task of figuring out whether you’re smarter than the other thousands of investors trying to do the same thing.SA: What’s one of your highest conviction ideas right now?VM: I still love NETGEAR (NASDAQ:NTGR), which is up almost 20% since I bought it this summer. It’s being treated, and valued, like a potential value trap, and everyone is terrified that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are going to take their share in routers and now IP cameras.But it’s just not happening so far, and a lot of investors seem to forget that Amazon, in particular, hasn’t been that effective in smaller end markets. Google hasn’t been all that successful in hardware, either.NETGEAR has a cash-loaded balance sheet and a low teen FCF/EPS multiple backing out that cash. The enterprise value is $1.25 billion or so. The Arlo IP camera business alone is growing 100%+ this year and on track to generate ~$350 million in sales. They’re setting up a recurring revenue stream there, and that segment alone should support a good chunk of that enterprise value.Margins came down this year, as they’re ramping marketing and trade spend this year behind Arlo and their higher-end Nighthawk routers. They should rebound in 2018, and if you combine earnings growth and a re-rating even toward the mid-teens, there’s another 20% easy. If they don’t rebound, NTGR still is a little cheap. If they do, and NTGR starts using that cash (or an acquirer does), it’s absurdly cheap.***Thanks to Vince for the interview.

4091069,24594,2017-07-28T08:15:00-04:00,"NETGEAR's Q2 wasn't quite as good as the headline beat suggests.There is some weakness in switches, and home Wi-Fi market growth looks a bit light.But Arlo performance continues to be outstanding, and the multiple here remains too low.Growth should rebound starting in the second half - but even at $47, NTGR isn't pricing that growth in.","NETGEAR's (NTGR) stock has had a disappointing 2017, declining 19% YTD ahead of the company's Q2 report Wednesday afternoon. Higher channel marketing spend to drive market share gains for Arlo IP cameras and Orbi 'mesh' routers led to disappointing guidance, particularly out of Q1. But I've argued that the market has overreacted to what should be temporary pressure and overlooked growth opportunities in those categories.The Q2 report supports that argument, even if it wasn't quite as strong as a solid consensus beat suggests. The news was a bit mixed: Arlo had an exceptional quarter, but there are some concerns in legacy categories such as Home Wi-Fi and switches. But with NTGR not far from a 52-week low heading into the report, the quarter certainly was good enough. And it was easily enough to keep the bull case here intact.The most obvious piece of good news in the quarter was the performance from Arlo IP cameras. Revenue more than doubled year-over-year, and market share rose to 41%, according to the Q2 presentation. The Arlo Baby line appears to have had some early hiccups, per the Q2 conference call and Amazon reviews, but CEO Patrick Lo said performance and reviews had improved (and appears to be correct). Arlo Go - a wireless offering with a six-month battery - has been rolled out as well. (At a Verizon (NYSE:VZ) store yesterday, actually, a salesman tried to sell me a Go.)This remains a huge opportunity for NETGEAR - and it's still barely contributing any profit, with margin cited at about 4% for the quarter. That, in turn, implies the product contributed roughly 10% of total operating income. Those margins will expand - and already are, with segment margin expanding 350 bps Q/Q.Overall numbers look solid as well. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.60 beat consensus of $0.54, which was also the figure implied by Q1 guidance. Non-GAAP operating margin of 8.5% was in the middle of 8-9% guidance. Overall revenue rose 6.1% - and 12% excluding an expected decline in service provider sales. NETGEAR had guided for double-digit revenue growth on the latter basis, and seems well on track toward that goal after an 18% increase in Q1. Service provider sales actually increased sequentially, and at $57 million are a bit above the ~$55 million targeted at the beginning of the year.Q3 guidance isn't outstanding on an absolute basis, with revenue guided up 2.7% at the midpoint and EPS expected to decline to ~$0.67 (based on the midpoint of sales and operating margin ranges) from $0.76 the year before. But those figures are in line with analyst estimates (EPS is modestly better than a $0.64 consensus), and the guidance-driven declines seen after Q4 and Q1 shouldn't repeat here. In fact, NTGR rose 7% in after-hours trading.It's easy to see the outlines of the bull case in the quarter, particularly with NTGR trading at ~14x 2017 EPS plus cash. Arlo is a legitimate driver, and the business is growing double-digits outside of expected service provider declines. Basically, a long position in NTGR is a bet that the company can grow earnings. And Q2 seems to set that growth up, even if it likely won.In the rest of the business, the news was mixed. Overall revenue of $330.7 million was ahead of guidance of $315-330 million. But it's also starting to look as if NETGEAR guides conservatively, and it's likely Arlo was the major driver.Non-GAAP EPS of $0.60 beat consensus of $0.54, which also was the figure implied by the midpoint of Q1 guidance. But a lower-than-expected tax rate appears to have contributed about $0.03 of the beat, and NETGEAR bought back almost 3% of its shares in the quarter, which likely contributed another penny or so. Indeed, non-GAAP operating margin was 8.5%, right in the middle of the guided 8-9% range.And outside Arlo, there are some concerns. Revenue in the SMB segment declined 11% year-over-year. CFO Christine Gorjanc cited weakness in gigabit switches, and storage sales continue to decline. Connected Home revenues were up only modestly excluding service provider, and look a bit disappointing for the second straight quarter. In the Q&A, Gorjanc explained that Charter Communications' (CHTR) acquisition of Time Warner Cable had slowed retail demand, as Charter doesn't break out modem rental fees. As a result, TWC customers looking to avoid those fees who would have purchased NETGEAR routers (as I did about 18 months ago) are now much less incentivized to do so.And while NETGEAR modestly beat expectations, the fact is that gross margin still compressed 390 bps, largely due to contra-revenue from channel marketing. The margin concerns that pushed NTGR to $44 seem justified by the results:Source: NTGR Q2 presentationEven though I'm bullish on NTGR, I don't think Q2 necessarily was a great quarter. But I still think it's more than good enough.The key drivers of the NTGR bull case are still here. At $47, NTGR has an enterprise value of $1.25 billion. Arlo is on pace for something close to $300 million in revenue this year, and I'd argue that business, on its own, could support half or more of that value. (Is 2x+ revenue that unreasonable?) Orbi market share held, despite the presence of Google Wifi in the mesh space. Switch weakness should reverse at some point; single-point router sales should come back (and ASPs should trend higher, helping both revenue and margins).The bull case for NTGR is basically that the market is pricing in what the company looks like at the moment, and at ~14x my 2017 EPS estimate of $2.70, is pricing in very little growth. But Arlo margin expansion alone could get 2018 EPS over $3. Market share in consumer Wi-Fi has been expanding for years now, and ever-faster internet is going to require ever-better routers. Service provider revenue has stabilized after a few legs down (and after NETGEAR cut costs to dramatically boost margins last year).Yet, NTGR is pricing in basically no growth from an EPS standpoint - and even less given that normalized free cash flow is generally higher than net income, given low capex requirements. The bull case for NTGR requires that growth to come at some point, even if it's not until next year when channel marketing can be better leveraged and (hopefully) either SMB or single-point trends improve.And I still think that growth is coming - and Arlo's performance, in particular, means that Q2 supports that case. It's not a perfect quarter, and it's not a perfect stock. But even at $47, it's still not getting enough credit from the market."

Despite that low growth, management argues that it is still gaining market share (Q2CC):This is rather important because the company is up against fairly formidable competition from the likes of Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Ubiquiti (UBNT). Investors would like to see some growth remaining after Arlo has been spun-off. The company does have a dominant position in the consumer Wi-Fi market (from the earnings deck):The company continues to launch new products (Q2CC):Management mentioned rising ASPs and much (if not all) of that is related to these advanced gaming routers.There is also a new mesh extender for the Nighthawk family. Management claims that they stay ahead of the competition with these launches as (Q2CC):The SMB segment is the smallest ($70.8M of revenues in Q2) but growing nicely at 7.2% y/y. Its most important product is switches, in which they have a dominating market position:The Arlo segment is growing pretty fast. Revenues were up 33.1% y/y to $104.8M, which is quite a slowdown from the 59% growth in Q1. From the earnings deck:Even while preparing the Arlo segment for IPO (and hence management is in a quiet period, they couldn't comment too much), it's introducing new products like the Arlo Smart and Arlo Security Light.Arlo Audio Doorbell and Arlo Chime will be new additions in the present quarter (Q2CC):From the Arlo prospectus, here's a short overview of its products:Investors will appreciate its rapid market share increases:We're now at 52%, up from 40% in Q1 and just 33% a year ago. SA contributor Vince Martin noticed the following:It certainly looks like Arlo is ready for a successful IPO, which will happen under the ARLO ticker and fetch a price between $18-$20 with 10.2M shares offered.We already cited the well-researched article from SA contributor Vince Martin, who has done a large section on possible valuation comps and one has to say that one walks away from that rather optimistically.For instance, we were unaware that there's an analyst, Global Equities Research’s Trip Chowdhry out there who argues that Arlo is worth $15B based on the amount of data that is uploaded. The thinking is that data is the new oil (machine learning improves with the amount of data).This draws attention to the Arlo platform, and if they can monetize that the company becomes a different proposition altogether as the hardware business is tough for most newcomers. There are certainly some encouraging figures (from the IPO prospectus):Here is what the platform actually does:Arlo smart is the paid subscription service that adds AI functionalities and comes in three tiers:Here are the services (from the IPO prospectus):Quite frankly, we are very intrigued as we have studied numerous SaaS platform companies and we have seen how many of these platforms rapidly grow into a Swiss army knife with proliferating revenue streams, up-sell opportunities and increasing stickiness of the platform.What we see here is a proto-connected home platform that could really take off, especially when 5G comes around and IoT devices are expected to explode and connectivity becomes ubiquitous.There are a couple of things that make Arlo a really promising platform, in our view:While the company is up against formidable competition in the wider connected (""smart"") home market, it has found quite a promising way to get users on-board on its platform.What they need is rapidly pair with third parties to increase the attractiveness of their platform, which now has a security focus only.Another route could be that they become the go-to platform for security solutions and they expand users by linking to other connected home and IoT platforms.It looks like management already has some ideas about how to expand the platform as an expansion of services was mentioned in the filing.We see a lot of potential here, and seen in this light the $15B valuation that the above-mentioned analyst Trip Chowdhry came up with isn't as crackpot as it might appear at first sight, even though Arlo has it all to prove still, but the potential is there and we've seen plenty of platforms commanding 10x sales multiples and more.Netgear itself has a lot riding on a successful IPO and also on Arlo's continued success as it:Some other figures from the prospectus, but keep in mind this is all Q1 data:The company announced it's going to sell 10.215M shares (an additional 1,532,250 shares is likely), priced at between $18-$20. Just as important, the company will keep an 84.2% stake in Arlo, from the amended prospectus:This means that Arlo's value is in the order of $1.2B on these metrics. This apparently surprised the market on the downside. As we showed at the start of the article, the stock tanked $10.NTGR Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsAnd here you get another view, this time non-GAAP:Their decline is not done, and has a lot to do with the Arlo spin-off (Q2CC, our emphasis):That was quite a bit more than what they said on the Q1CC ($5M), but these costs are one-offs. Q3 revenue is guided at between $380M-$395M, which is a little softer than what analysts expect ($397M).NTGR Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsCash flows have recovered pretty nicely notwithstanding the margin compression, that's good to see. Their cash balance will soon get another $200M or so on top of:So the company will sit on $550M+ of cash with no debt.NTGR EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsValuation metrics have ticked up quite a bit and this is mostly down to Arlo. If the IPO price holds up, we know that Netgear's post-IPO part of Arlo is roughly $1B.EPS is expected to reach $2.64 this year and $3 the next according to analysts. We assume this includes the spinoff of Arlo.The Arlo IPO is very interesting. This is a fast growing business where some of the company's products have received rave reviews, it's already profitable, and it has an interesting IoT proto-platform that has significant potential.Their two remaining businesses are also doing fairly well these days. After two years of declines, the consumer business is benefiting from rising ASPs and market share gains and their SMB is growing at double digits, although we'll have to see how long that lasts as history isn't terribly encouraging in this respect.The company will sell a stake of it for roughly $200M of its Arlo business, which is its fastest growing segment by far.Post Arlo's IPO, the company will have $550M+ of cash, which is more than a quarter of its market cap but they will lose Arlo's revenues.If the IPO price ranges holds up in the market, the remaining part of Arlo still on the books of Netgear is worth almost $1B alone, valuing their two remaining businesses at a mere $500M or so, or just over half their sales.That seems a little too cheap to us."
4085435,24594,2017-07-04T09:30:00-04:00,"NTGR's Q1 report actually was pretty good, though higher investment spend behind new products likely pulls down FY17 expectations.But a 20% sell-off from the pre-earnings price to post-earnings lows represents a ~25% decline in enterprise value - which is far too steep.At this point, NETGEAR is priced for zero growth - and that's a pretty bearish case given strength in Orbi, Nighthawk, and Arlo.There's enough to drive some growth - and big potential upside if the newer products show continued strength.","In early February, just ahead of its Q4 report, NETGEAR (NTGR) traded around $57. With expectations for ~$3 in 2016 EPS, and ~$12 per share in cash, the stock was priced at around 15x earnings plus cash. That multiple made some intuitive sense. As I pointed out in November, NTGR's 2016 figures (at least based on Q4 guidance) were almost exactly in line with those from four years earlier.NETGEAR would post a blowout Q4, beating consensus on the top and bottom lines. It would post another beat in Q1, which marked the seventh straight quarter NETGEAR came in ahead of the Street in both sales and earnings. Yet since February, NTGR has declined about 25%:Source: finviz.comAdmittedly, it wouldn't be true that there's been no reason for the decline. NTGR fell following both Q4 and Q1 due largely to disappointing guidance. Commentary following Q1 suggests increased spending behind several key growth products, and fears of increased competition both have some validity, and drove a March downgrade from Off Wall Street.But the decline has been simply far too steep. On an enterprise basis, NETGEAR's valuation has dropped over 30% in four months with little real news. 2017 earnings expectations have come down, given needed investments this year. But the long-term impact of those investments - even if they fail - should be relatively minimal, and there simply hasn't been that much of a change in the NTGR story YTD. With the stock now trading at 12.6x 2017 consensus EPS - estimates that look low to my eye - plus cash, and an even lower multiple to free cash flow, the sell-off has been overdone. And it's created a buying opportunity in NTGR.Q1 EarningsNETGEAR's Q1 report was a tale of good news in reported numbers - and bad news in guidance and outlook. On the Q4 conference call, NETGEAR had tipped a weaker Q1, guiding for revenue of $300-$315 million - down YOY at the midpoint - and non-GAAP operating income margin of 9.5-10.5%. Sales of $323 million represented a 4.3% increase year-over-year however, and handily beat guidance, driven by strength in the Retail segment.Segment revenue fell 21% Q/Q, which looks to be better than expected given more pronounced seasonality in that business and a record Q4. Meanwhile, operating margin of 10% came in right at the middle of the guided range, leading to a $0.02 consensus beat on the bottom line.The issue in the quarter was guidance. Q2 revenue guidance looks reasonably solid, and full-year targets excluding service provider revenue were reaffirmed on the Q1 conference call. But operating margin targets imply a big dip in EPS.Implied guidance for Q2 suggests ~$0.54 in EPS at the midpoint. That compares to $0.72 a year ago and consensus estimates of $0.70 heading into the quarter. The major driver of the earnings 'miss' - at least on a forward basis - is that NETGEAR said it would ramp up marketing spend behind its retail products in a bid to increase market share. That will impact margins and profits for at least the rest of the year.As a result, full-year consensus EPS estimates have come down sharply, to $2.65 from $3.16. That in turn implies a rather sharp decline in profit YOY for 2017 (-15%), and the 16% drop in earnings expectations would seem to support a double-digit percentage decline in NTGR shares, given the $10+ in cash on the balance sheet.But again, NTGR now has dropped 25%. By itself, that seems like too large a drop simply from a fundamental standpoint. That decline suggests a material change in the mid- to long-term outlook for NETGEAR beyond the simple math relative to FY17 and FY18 earnings expectations. It's only valid if the news from Q1 suggests that margins will weaken with no corresponding increase in market share.That in turn seems to imply a belief that NETGEAR's increased marketing spend a) won't be limited to FY17 and FY18 and b) won't work. Again, per management, the spend is coming to move market share higher - not what is required to maintain share in IP cameras and Wi-Fi routers, in particular. The current valuation suggests not only that management is wrong, but unable to change course. It implies that the story at NETGEAR post-Q1 is notably different than it was coming out of Q4. But that simply doesn't appear to be the case.NETGEAR's Revenue Outlook Looks (Relatively) UnchangedFirst, the revenue story here remains intact. Indeed, what's most comforting about the quarter from the bullish perspective is not just the revenue beat, but how NETGEAR drove the revenue growth. Over the past few years, total revenue has been relatively stagnant ($1.37 billion in 2013, $1.33 billion last year). But the contribution from service providers (cable companies and telcos that lease NETGEAR routers to customers) has declined notably:Source: author from NETGEAR filingsService provider revenue has fallen sharply of late, with NETGEAR focusing on maximizing profitability in that business last year (and seeing a big jump in EPS as a result). Commercial sales - Ethernet switches, wireless controllers and unified storage - rebounded last year, driven by strength in switches. And Retail growth has impressive the last two years: 21% in 2015 and 24% last year, driven by Nighthawk routers, Orbi 'mesh' Wi-Fi systems, and Arlo IP cameras.The bull case for NTGR heading into Q1 was that those retail drivers would continue to improve sales, with the long decline in service provider revenue stabilizing at lower back-half levels (~$55M/quarter) while commercial and retail revenue increased.(The company itself targeted 10%+ growth in those two segments combined). Lapping an additional leg down in service provider sales last year in that scenario would lead to rather modest, if back-half-weighted, growth in 2017: about a 4% increase in sales and a similar gain in EPS, based on operating margin targets. But that also laid the groundwork for further growth going forward, given the steadily diminishing importance of those service provider revenues.On the top line, nothing has really changed after Q1. NETGEAR changed its segment reporting in the quarter, breaking out Arlo revenue separately and adding ""Connected Home"" and ""SMB."" But the service provider business - still detailed in the Q1 release - looks on track, and there was no evidence of another leg down in that business. Excluding service provider sales, as CEO Patrick Lo, pointed out on the Q1 call, first-half revenue is expected to grow ~15%, nicely ahead of that full-year 10% target. That includes 18% growth in Q1, decelerating to ~12% or so in Q2.Meanwhile, Arlo looks like a winner, with Q1 revenue of $60.7 million increasing 150% year-over-year. That business still is barely profitable - EBIT margins of 0.5% in Q1 - but margins will come at some point. Connected Home revenue declined 10% year-over-year; but increased 1% excluding service provider revenue. Margins did decline there, due to the shift from legacy routers toward Nighthawk and Orbi, but that decline seems reasonably within expectations.Management said an overall drop in gross profit was due to one-time benefits in the year-prior quarter from service provider sales, which were concentrated in the renamed CH segment. SMB sales did disappoint, which management attributed to weakness in Europe, but the business posted a nice jump in margins.Again, nothing in either Q1 or guidance really changes the top-line story here. The new data relative to Arlo shows the product generated nearly $190 million in revenue last year. A 40%+ growth target for 2017 implies ~$270 million - and Arlo still isn't contributing to profit. Even a 10% margin at that level would add ~$0.55 to EPS, 20% growth from revised 2017 consensus. There's simply a huge opportunity in that product, one that has the potential to get NTGR EPS back above $3 over the next two years even with no help from the rest of the business.All told, the revenue story hasn't changed much here. The one potential concern is an apparently quicker-than-expected adoption of 'mesh' Wi-Fi solutions like Orbi. That shift from single-point routers (like NETGEAR's Nighthawk) to mesh moves demand from an area where the company has ~55% market share to one where it has ~35% share. And even excluding service provider revenue, it does look like router sales growth was muted (~1%) in Q1.On the Q1 call, CEO Lo cited the shift to mesh as providing some pressure. And there may be some competitive concerns there. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) is focusing on mesh through its Google Wi-Fi, and startup eero has a mesh product that garners solid reviews.But it's not as if NETGEAR has no position in mesh - it has top share there as well, just not to the same extent it does in single-point. It's not as if Google has been some massive steamroller in consumer areas (Nest has disappointed, Pixel sales don't move the needle, etc. etc.). Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is exiting the router business. There's an opportunity for NETGEAR to attain the same dominance in mesh as it has in single-point, and the company is spending in the near term to establish that dominance. That's a strategy that seems logical - and proactive, not reactive.There's clearly a risk that NETGEAR will fall beyond in mesh. But that, truthfully, has been a risk for some time - as it is for any market leader in a market that's shifting to new technology. But that shift is taking NETGEAR from 55% share to 35% share - not 80% to 5%. And it's gained that 35% share in two quarters, as Lo pointed out on the Q1 call: Orbi was launched ahead of the holiday season.It's also moving the company into an area with higher price points, which could help offset any potential share loss. The shift to mesh simply is not a risk that changes the long-term outlook for NETGEAR - nor does it justify a valuation that suggests NETGEAR is basically done growing profits.Margin QuestionsOf course, the other near-term change is that NETGEAR is ramping up marketing spend over the next few quarters. And that spend will have a major impact on margins. Q2 guidance suggests non-GAAP EBIT margins of just 8-9% against 11.6% the year before. The midpoint of that guidance suggests EPS of roughly $0.54, down 25% against the year-prior quarter.As noted above, analysts slashed 2017 EPS estimates in response to the decision - and logically so. 2018 estimates have come down as well - moving from $3.63 down to $3.06.But there's a sort of 'one or the other' problem with the stock's reaction to the margin concerns. If the marketing spend works, then margins should improve next year (or in 2019 at the latest), as NETGEAR should (in theory) be able to pull back somewhat on that spend and/or enjoy the scale benefits of getting mesh to 40%+ share and 50%+ in IP cameras. Arlo likely will generate somewhat close to 20% of 2017 revenue - and at close to zero margin. Simple normalization there alone should add 100 bps+ in EBIT margin.Similarly, if the ramped-up spend doesn't work in terms of getting share to the targeted levels in mesh and cameras, at some point it can be reduced. Over the past few years, NETGEAR has at the least shown its ability to manage margins in low-growth areas. The market seems to be throwing that history out the window in reacting as if it won't be able to do the same in areas where category growth should be solid and market share is already well-established.Reverse-engineering the current valuation suggests that margins are the ""new normal"" and that marketing spend will stay elevated simply to maintain current market share. That's a possibility, to be sure. But it's also a rather bearish outcome - and there really isn't much in the Q1 results to suggest a near-term return to flat sales and no margin expansion. Again, Arlo sales grew 150% in Q1, and should rise 40%+ for the full year.Even flat market share for Orbi should keep Connected Home operating profit reasonably stable, as margins in the newer space should be higher and mesh demand should help growth in the router market as a whole (which has barely grown the past few years).Basically, before Q1, the market priced NTGR as if profits would grow. Now, it's not. That simply looks like an overreaction to what management expects to be a relatively short-term spike in marketing spend. Maybe management is wrong. But at this point, being wrong looks close to priced in, if not fully so.Zero-Growth ValuationWith NTGR below $44, it is now trading at about 12.6x 2017 EPS estimates plus cash. Those figures are non-GAAP, and exclude ~$17 million pre-tax stock-based compensation. But NTGR's free cash flow also generally outpaces earnings, as D&A is much higher than capex (D&A has averaged $34 million-plus the last three years; capex just $15 million, including $10 million last year).In other words, even backing out dilution, NTGR is trading at ~12x 2017 FCF. That in turn implies a company providing basically zero growth going forward - and that's far too conservative. 2017 marketing spend will either provide ROI, or be reduced in 2018. Arlo is a legit growth driver; service provider revenue has stabilized, and commercial revenue have some growth opportunities (even after a weak Q1). Basically, the market is pricing NTGR as if the next five years will look like the last five.That's despite the fact that Arlo, Nighthawk, and Orbi - even if market share goals are too optimistic - offer better growth drivers than NETGEAR has had in some time. And that's despite the fact that the overall impact of service provider revenue declines largely has played out.At $44, NTGR looks like a classic ""heads I win, tails I don't lose much"" opportunity. A return to ~zero growth is largely priced in. Any share gains in mesh or IP cameras are not. Arlo Baby was launched this quarter, and even a much smaller rival like VOXX International (VOXX) has cited IP baby cameras as a growth driver. Arlo Go (essentially a cellular version) is on the way, as is a new Arlo product in a ""non-camera product category"" later this year.Stable market share in mesh still implies growth in Orbi as that market grows - and likely enough to offset erosion in the legacy single-point business. And mesh isn't going to take 100% of the router market - it simply isn't necessary in many homes, and NETGEAR's recent history of substantial gains in single-point should continue (particularly with Apple's exit removing a competitor for high-end Nighthawk).None of those potential drivers look priced in at the moment. Modeling low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth, a jump in EBIT margins next year (thanks to either lower marketing spend and/or improvement in Arlo) and 10-20 bps from 2019 onward implies low-to-mid single-digit free cash flow growth.That gets NTGR back above $50, assuming a ~15x multiple plus cash and/or reasonable DCF expectations ($3 in FCF in 2018, growing at 4% with a 1% terminal rate and an 8% discount rate). In a bull case where one of the growth drivers takes off and NTGR can leverage the current marketing spend, $60+ isn't off the table (16-17x FCF and/or 8% growth for a few years before leveling off).It's not the sexiest bull case in tech, to be sure, and there is some downside risk. Share erosion from competition in growth drivers, combined with another leg down in service provider revenue, could lead FCF to actually decline going forward. But that's a rather aggressive bear case, which implies that basically none of NETGEAR's current potential is realized and that key risks materialize in retail and service provider revenue.At the least, $50+ looks like a more reasonable fair value at the moment looking at blended bull/bear/base cases. That might be only 15%+ upside from current levels, but the cash on the balance sheet and the relative lack of downside risk makes that figure more attractive than it might appear on an absolute basis.Again, I can see the case for some downside coming out of Q1, based on the higher marketing spend (which in turn might imply that NETGEAR is seeing more competition, likely from Google Wi-Fi), the shift from single-point to mesh, and a modestly disappointing quarter in equipment. But a 30% decline in enterprise value just since mid-February is simply too negative a reaction. The bet in going long NTGR at current levels is basically very simple: it's a bet that NETGEAR's cash flow will grow going forward. And there's been nothing in either Q4 or Q1 results, or guidance, to suggest that bet isn't worth taking.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

4182051,24594,2018-06-25T05:00:00-04:00,"NETGEAR continues to face margin compression as it ramps marketing and trade spend behind new products - leading to steadily lower profits.But the Arlo IP camera business, to be spun off in 2H, is growing remarkably - and could support most, if not all, of the current enterprise value.Within a year, NTGR has moved from being a value play to a growth play - but there's enough from an SOTP standpoint to suggest more upside.","The bull case for NETGEAR (NTGR) has changed dramatically in the year or so since I took a long position in the stock. Last summer, NTGR traded at about 12x 2017 free cash flow - a zero-growth multiple that made some intuitive sense. Earnings growth had been limited for years, one reason why NTGR stock basically didn't move between early 2011 and late 2015.There was some optimism toward newer products like the Arlo IP camera, Orbi 'mesh' Wi-Fi router, and the Nighthawk fixed-point product. But there also seemed real competitive risk, with NETGEAR most notably going up against Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG) units Google in 'mesh' wi-fi and Nest in cameras. Guidance after Q1 2017, for sharply lower EBIT margins due in part to spending designed to compete with those (and other) rivals, sent NTGR shares tumbling as a result.Meanwhile, revenue from service providers (cable and satellite providers) was in the midst of a multi-year decline, providing a headwind to growth. Indeed, short interest in NTGR actually neared 10%, as some investors bet that the bottom was set to fall out. Net/net, a ~zero-growth multiple, on its face, didn't necessarily seem all that outlandish given headwinds and what looked like potentially balanced risk/reward to the growth opportunities. At the time, I argued that multiple was too cheap given the somewhat transitory nature of the margin pressure: either the spending would work and drive revenue growth, or it wouldn't, allowing some level of margin rebounds. But the risks were clear.A year later, NTGR looks very different. Margin compression has led earnings lower: non-GAAP operating income dropped 20% in 2017, and the same in Q1. Guidance concerns centered around EBIT margins led the stock down 15% after Q4 (albeit after a huge run into the report) and 10%+ after the Q1 report in April, despite solid beats to consensus expectations in both concerns. And yet NTGR has gained nicely - up 45% over the past twelve months - with multiple expansion outrunning the margin compression, and the post-Q1 gap down already filled (and then some):Source: finviz.comThe gains are even more pronounced considering the cash on NETGEAR's balance sheet (nearly $12 per share as of the end of Q1). On an enterprise value basis, NTGR has risen about 70% from May 2017 lows. The P/E multiple, even backing out cash, has moved from about 11x to nearly 20x. In short, in a year, NTGR has moved from being a value play to a growth play (at least by the standards of the hardware space).Though I'm tempted to take some profits - and the margin concerns seem very real - I think the new bull case here still suggests upside. NETGEAR is spinning off a stake in the Arlo business in the second half of this year (and the rest in 1H 2019), and that alone could support a good chunk of the enterprise value at current levels. The rest of the business still has some value, and the competitive threat from Google and other rivals hasn't shown up yet in terms of market share. Conservative multiples on the two businesses support the current price; reasonable valuation efforts suggest substantial upside.Ahead of the spin, a reasonably large proportion of NTGR's valuation seems attributable to Arlo. Arlo is the best-selling IP (Internet Protocol) camera manufacturer in the consumer space. IP cameras are fixed-location devices usually used for surveillance and/or home protection, with the video data streamed to the 'cloud' and accessible through the Web or, more commonly, a mobile app.It's a crowded market, with competitors including Alphabet unit Nest and consumer accessories maker Logitech (LOGI), among many others. But it's also a quickly growing market, and one in which NETGEAR has taken substantial share:Source: NETGEAR Q1 earnings presentationThat figure is up sharply from the 33% cited by the company just a year ago. And it's not hard to see why. The Pro, and the newer Pro 2, have received rave reviews, getting an Editor's Choice nod from PC Magazine, being named ""the best home security cam we've ever tested"" by DigitalTrends, and cited as a ""top-notch camera"" by Tom's Guide. Arlo isn't the lowest-priced option, but by acclamation it appears to be the best in class.There remains plenty of runway for growth in the U.S. and internationally. The more reasonable price (the Arlo 2 retails for $179.99 at Best Buy (BBY)) has brought home surveillance to the masses, so to speak. Cloud capabilities mean the systems don't need expensive and bulky recording devices, as older 'closed-circuit' models did.The market is forecast to grow 20% annually - but Arlo's recent growth has been far more explosive. Revenue doubled in each of the last two years, reaching $378 million in 2017. Sales then jumped another 59% year over year in Q1, albeit in a seasonally quieter quarter.The business seems likely on track to generate at least $500 million in 2018 revenue (32% growth Y/Y) and likely somewhere above $550 million (45%). And it has turned profitable, with ""contribution income"" (basically segment EBIT) reaching $33.6 million on a TTM basis, against a ~$5 million loss in 2016.Against an enterprise value of $1.8 billion, there's a stretch case that the Arlo spin-off will leave current shareholders owning the rest of NETGEAR for nothing, or close to it. As noted, revenue should reach ~$550 million this year; contribution income should clear $60 million. (Margin expanded ~400 bps in Q1; the same performance over the full year would get the figure to $65 million.) NETGEAR on the Q1 call cited ~$5 million in incremental Q2 expense from 'dis-synergies' required to duplicate some positions at the soon-to-be-split companies, a figure that should rise going forward. Depreciation should be a few million a year as well.It's tough to pin down an estimate, but $30-$40 million in standalone pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for Arlo seems within a potential ballpark. (I'd aim for the high end: $65 million in contribution income less $30 million in annual overhead costs, plus a few million in depreciation.) That's with higher R&D spending this year, and increased trade spending (accounted for as a reduction to revenue). Going forward, leverage and potentially an increased focus on margins over growth at some point certainly should allow for margin expansion from ~7% to the double-digits.Is 3.2x revenue and 40x+ Adjusted EBITDA - multiples which value Arlo alone at NTGR's current enterprise value - necessarily outrageous for Arlo, given what looks like 50% revenue growth this year and room for margin expansion? I don't believe it is. Global Equities analyst Trip Chowdhry has argued Arlo is worth $15 billion (~$500 per NTGR share!), equating it to Intel (INTC) acquisition Mobileye, given its data capabilities. I'm not nearly that bullish, but comparisons suggest a $1.5 billion-plus valuation on Arlo alone could be reasonable.Motorola Solutions (MSI) acquired commercial IP camera manufacturer (and surveillance software developer) Avigilon earlier this year. According to MSI's most recent 10-Q, the net purchase price was $974 million. That's 2.38x Aviligon's 2017 revenue (according to its filings on SEDAR; the company was listed on the Toronto exchange), which rose 15.5% last year. The EBITDA multiple was 14x+, with Aviligon's margins in the 16%+ range.Meanwhile, another commercially-focused provider, Sweden's Axis Communications AB (OTC:AXCTY), the inventor of the IP camera, trades at about 2.8x revenue and ~20x EBITDA. That's with EBITDA margins around 14%, and double-digit revenue growth for the last few years (albeit with a sharp deceleration to 2% in Q1).Applying the Avigilon revenue multiple to Arlo's 2018 sales suggests a valuation of about $1.3 billion - roughly three-quarters of NTGR's current enterprise value. Axis' revenue multiple gets Arlo to about $1.5 billion. And, again, Arlo is growing significantly faster than both of those companies, with revenue growth likely at 40%+ this year against mid-teens for those commercial operators. Both revenue multiples suggest a high-teen/low 20s multiple to Arlo's 2019 EBITDA, assuming continued top-line growth (to something like $700 million, in the 25-30% range) and EBITDA margins moving toward 10%.It's also worth considering two recent IPOs of high-growth hardware plays. GoPro (GPRO) at its peak traded at about 9x its TTM revenue ahead of its offering, and 60x+ Adjusted EBITDA. Fitbit (FIT) reached 8x revenue and about 35x EBITDA. Fitbit's growth was much more spectacular (it's easy to forget, but revenue tripled through the first three quarters of 2015, with EBITDA margins over 20%), but GoPro's growth profile heading into its IPO (revenue up 87% in 2013, +22% through 9M 2014, 11% margins) looks much more similar to that of Arlo.If the market is willing to price in margin expansion, 3x revenue - or higher - is not an unreasonable multiple. A premium to Avigilon and Axis on an EV/revenue basis seems deserved given sharply higher growth. NETGEAR also has a much larger addressable market, which more than offsets potentially lower margins for the retail-heavy Arlo. Penetration still seems to be in the single digits in the US - Arlo still is shy of 2 million users with its dominant share - and users tend to add additional cameras (we have gone from one to three relatively quickly). Meanwhile, GPRO and FIT both traded at 3x+ sales even ahead of, and after pulling back from, their respective post-IPO peaks.Of course, FIT and GPRO hardly seem like bullish comparisons. At Fortune, Aaron Pressman dismissed the Arlo IPO after its announcement, pointing out the dismal history of consumer hardware plays. GoPro and Fitbit at least are still in business: Flip, Jawbone, ION Worldwide and Pebble aren't so lucky. And it's possible investors will keep those failures in mind when it comes to pricing Arlo; note that NTGR still fell 15% following Q4 earnings, which included the spin-off announcement. Both FIT and GPRO now trade at sub-1x EV/revenue multiples (even after FIT's torrid run the past few weeks), which would value Arlo at ~$500 million at most and likely suggest pretty substantial downside in NTGR stock.I think that's far too conservative. There's no comparison between Arlo at its current stage and those other hardware plays at the moment. This is a valuable business with plenty of growth. Competition is numerous - but it's barely making a dent. Again, revenue has doubled in each of the last two years. In its 10-K for the year ending March 31, Logitech - no slouch in the consumer tech space - attributed ~$24 million in Y/Y growth in its 'Smart Home' category ""primarily"" to its Circle IP camera line. Arlo revenue grew $190 million last year.Concerns about Google taking market share have dogged Arlo and other NETGEAR products for some time, but Nest has been a bit of a disappointment. Admittedly, the business is growing nicely: recast figures from Alphabet's Q1 release (the company moved Nest from 'Other Bets' to the Google segment) suggest Nest, as a whole, drove $726 million in revenue in 2017, up from a reported $340 million in 2015. But only a portion of those revenues come from IP cameras, and Google's hardware history doesn't exactly strike fear in the hearts of competitors.Meanwhile, Arlo is rolling out Arlo Smart, which uses AI to recognize people in video, and a three-tiered subscription platform ranges from $2.99 to $14.99 per camera per month. Subscription revenue represents an attractive, and high-margin, potential revenue stream. We have IP cameras (actually the Logitech Circle, much to my initial dismay) and soon after buying one added two more, which appears to be relatively common. There's growth opportunities, then, both in adding users and selling more cameras to the users.As a result, the comparison to GoPro falls through because NETGEAR has a much higher addressable market (there are many more potential IP camera customers than action camera customers, and I'd wager few people own multiple GoPro cameras). Fitbit had execution issues (a risk to Arlo - along with every other company in the market) and Apple (AAPL) taking over its category.Arlo is a very different product from both FitBit and the GoProHero. There's a real opportunity from recurring revenue; so far, the contribution remains low, as Pressman pointed out, but Arlo hasn't really put much effort behind the rollout just yet. There's a desire, if not a need, for multiple products per user (front door, backyard, etc.). Steady improvements on the software side using AI - which can add image detection, better sound, better alerts, and other features - will hold off the 'cannibalization' concern that besets every hardware company eventually. Arlo is going to grow for some time.I'm relatively confident this is a business that will reach $1 billion in revenue - at least. And I'm more confident that this is a business worth more than $1 billion right now. The wrinkle is how post-spin trading might play out. Will the small initial stake floated lead the stock to spike? Or will forced fund selling lead the stock down, perhaps leading to a Klarman/Greenblatt-type opportunity in 2019? At the moment - particularly without better data - it's too early to tell. But any reasonable estimate of the value here - which to my eye is a large chunk of the current enterprise value - seems like enough to stick with NTGR.The concern is that the rest of NETGEAR isn't performing all that well. Even with Arlo's growth - and profit contribution in 2017 - adjusted net income in 2018 should be well below 2011 levels. The Connected Home segment saw revenue decline 9.8% in 2017 on top of a 9.9% drop the year before. Margins plunged in 2017 due to an effort to position Orbi in the mesh market. SMB revenue dropped 9.7% last year and is down 2% over the past two years, with gross margin compressing in 2017 due to higher returns and more promotions. NTGR's recent gains leave the stock trading at about 14x EV/EBITDA, which seems an enormous (and ridiculous) multiple against that type of performance.But the news isn't quite as bad as it seems. Here, as in the Arlo business, margins have been pressured by promotional activity in an effort to keep up market share. NETGEAR still has 50% share in the consumer Wi-Fi space, and 62% in the switch business that drives SMB revenue (up from 55% a year ago). And a big part of the decline in sales in Connected Home has come from lower service provider revenue. Service provider sales have dropped from $580 million in 2014 to $210 million over the past four quarters. Three-quarters of the Y/Y decline in Connected Home in 2017 came from service provider revenue.That headwind should start to abate. The acquisition of Time Warner by Charter Communications (CHTR) had a significant impact, per the Q1 call, with Charter bundling modems instead of leasing the devices. But the Orbi mesh router should drive demand, and longer-term 5G represents an opportunity.Q1 results in the CH segment admittedly were somewhat disappointing, with revenue down over 8%, and about 4% excluding the service provider impact. But on the call, CEO Patrick Lo reiterated guidance for full-year growth outside of Arlo, and at some point the new products in the business should start to shine through. Lapping tougher revenue comps driven by Charter-TWC and weaker margins, which began in earnest in Q2 of last year, should help. Orbi is growing nicely, and the high-end Nighthawk added a new gaming product, gaining exposure to that growing market. 5G should help both in retail and with service providers (NETGEAR already has a Nighthawk mobile 5G hotspot out in two small markets for AT&T (T)).In SMB, Q1 results showed a solid 3.5% increase in revenue, led by strength in switches, and offset by weakness in storage, per the 10-Q. There's not going to be a ton of growth in that business, but margins are much higher and the dominant share in switches should provide some stability.And across the board, NETGEAR is lapping the big step-down in margins seen a year ago:Source: NETGEAR Q1 earnings presentationOn a trailing twelve-month basis, contribution income from the two businesses has been $161 million ($96 million from Connected Home, $65 million from SMB). Unallocated corporate expenses are about $80 million, with another $25 million in share-based compensation. Depreciation and capex both track to about $10 million post-Arlo. As such, EBITDA post-Arlo (even including share-based comp) should be about $90 million, and free cash flow about $70 million.A conservative 7-8x EBITDA multiple would get value post-spin NTGR in the $700 million range, with 10-12 P/FCF moving the figure a bit higher. But that may be conservative - for reasons beyond the low multiples. Belkin, which owns router rival Linksys, was acquired in March by Foxconn unit Foxconn Interconnect Technology for $866 million. A filing [pdf] from that Hong Kong-listed company suggests a revenue multiple of 1.1x, with Belkin showing limited profits on a GAAP basis ($4.4 million pre-tax in 2017 after a $10.7 million loss in 2016).Belkin did post 4.6% sales growth in 2017, according to the filing, against the declines for NETGEAR. And its revenue is modestly higher than that of NETGEAR's Connected Home segment. But Belkin sales also include likely lower-margin products like chargers and USB-C cables, and in the router/gateway space, Linksys has substantially lower share than NETGEAR. It would seem difficult, based on the information at hand (Belkin was a private company), to argue that Belkin should be more valuable than the NETGEAR consumer business.And that in turn suggests that a $700-$800 million valuation ex-Arlo is far too low, as Connected Home at a Belkin-like multiple is worth over $800 million itself. More reasonable profit multiples (9x EBITDA, 13-15x FCF) get the figure up to the $1 billion range; unallocated costs may also come down post-spin, helping profit. 1x revenue for Connected Home values that business at $750 million (still below Belkin) and 8x ~$40 million in EBITDA for SMB (backing out $25 million in unallocated cost, about 30% of the total) gets that segment to $320 million, for a reasonably valued total of about $1.07 billion.From here, the current $1.8 billion enterprise value seems easily covered by the valuation of the respective businesses. A $1 billion valuation for Arlo appears too low, suggesting a revenue multiple as much as a turn below commercial providers Axis and Avigilon, despite far more impressive growth, and a roughly low- to mid-teen multiple to near-term EBITDA earnings power despite rapid top-line growth and clear room for margin expansion. Zero-growth multiples for the rest of the business (and ~0.7x sales) create the remaining ~$800 million in value including all of the currently unallocated corporate costs. I'd argue that $65, even after big rallies since November (and late April, for that matter) values NTGR very conservatively - and too conservatively.That's not to say there's no downside risk. Arlo sales could decelerate,- perhaps if Nest starts taking share as it adds Nest Hello and other products. NETGEAR has held off competitive threats so far - but it's had to pay up to do so, in both routers and Arlo. The non-Arlo businesses could see revenue decline: networking isn't a strong space at the moment and retail Connected Home sales have disappointed.But NTGR, at the moment, isn't pricing in any sort of rebound outside of Arlo - and it's undervaluing Arlo, at least based on the information available at the moment. Investors seem to be looking at consolidated profits, and margins, while both assuming that current margins will hold in perpetuity and ignoring the potential to be unlocked with Arlo. Yes, 14x EV/EBITDA and almost 20x EPS (even backing out cash) seems ridiculous given margin pressure and profit declines.But that's not the point. Valuing the businesses separately - as they will be soon - in a reasonable SOTP valuation looks something like this:That suggests a market cap of $2.7-$3.0 billion - and a value of $83-$92, or 28-41% upside. (To emphasize, currently unallocated corporate costs are included in the valuation of the post-spin NTGR, as are recurring duplicative post-spin expenses at Arlo; thus neither needs to be deducted here.) And there's an obvious catalyst for those gains. The first step of the spin - roughly 20% of shares - is coming in the second half of this year (though details on the roadshow and initial S-1 filings haven't been released), with the remainder being distributed to NTGR shareholders six months later, which at the moment looks like Q2 CY19.There's also the question of what NETGEAR's next step will be post-Arlo, and if more value can be created. On the Q4 conference call, CEO Patrick Lo said the company would focus on improving margins - and M&A of its own. Unlocking the long-held cash hoard should boost ROIC and potentially earnings, particularly given the post-spin business likely will have too much overhead coming out of the gate.What's interesting about the shift of NTGR from value play to growth play is that in just a few months, it will be both. The remaining SMB and Connected Home businesses should make NTGR a value play, with upside based on grinding out margin expansion and (hopefully) accretive M&A. Arlo, meanwhile, will be a growth stock. Qualitatively, that seems like an attractive combination.And fundamentally, it still seems undervalued. It's still possible that post-spin trading could give Arlo a valuation equivalent to the current enterprise value of NETGEAR as a whole. Even without that, reasonable post-spin multiples on both businesses suggest 20%+ upside. Some investors seem to be seeing the value here looking forward, given that NTGR has twice shaken off disappointing near-term guidance. As more investors follow, NTGR's recent run should continue."
4058080,97176,2017-03-27T07:54:07-04:00,"Due to the emergence of unlimited cell phone data plans, some predict home Wi-Fi will fall out of favor.This would have the potential to hurt the sales of routers.However, we think the rise of the IoT and the smart home will protect home Wi-Fi and router manufacturers.","With almost all leading telecommunications companies in the United States now offering unlimited data plans, home network manufacturers such as Netgear (NASDAQ:NTGR) have been tipped to feel the pinch as consumers ditch Wi-Fi at home in favor of using their smart devices for all their internet usage. But we think one thing some market commentators are forgetting is the meteoric rise of the Internet of Things, also known as IoT. As more and more devices become connected, we expect companies like Netgear to see a resurgence in demand for routers that can efficiently handle the high number of devices connecting to the internet around homes. Because of this we think Netgear is in a solid position to profit, making it a great long-term investment option.Connectivity is rapidly shoe-horning its way into every object which Silicon Valley start-ups can get their paws on. First conceived in the late 90's due to a stock supply shortage of lipstick, the internet of things initially consisted of sensors relaying data to computers. Now, the things have computers installed in them, the same product - only smarter. Wrist watches which can relay heart rates and average jogging speeds, mattresses which tell us about our sleeping patterns, and the list goes on. Many devices nowadays require a constant high-speed data connection in order to fulfil their status as a smart device. According to Bloomberg, Swedish network equipment maker Ericsson has forecast there to be 29 billion connected devices worldwide by 2022, up from 16 billion last year. Interestingly nearly all of this growth is expected to come from devices that aren't phones or computers.But with so many devices connecting around the home, consumers with older routers are experiencing the degradation of signals, a lack of full coverage around the home, and poorer quality internet. As Bloomberg explains: ""Routers compete for airwaves with cordless phones, baby monitors and nearby Wi-Fi signals. When a neighbor moves in, changes a setting or downloads a movie, it can interfere. A network can also get overwhelmed by the addition of new devices and create the equivalent of rush hour on a Los Angeles freeway."" It then explains that: ""This is because older devices connecting to a traditional router look for a reasonably uncongested lane of wireless spectrum, then stay in that lane regardless of how backed up it gets.""While using your cell's unlimited data plan at home might seem like a quick fix, it's not really the answer for a home with multiple devices connected to the internet at the same time. When that cell leaves with its owner for work, does the home then go without internet? We think not. We think the real answer is a router refresh and Netgear's Orbi could be in pole position.As well as being able to efficiently handle high numbers of connected devices, the Orbi router comes with extenders for around the home or office which can boost a Wi-Fi signal to fill in those black-spots. With several units which chatter to one another on a third frequency band, there is no impact on your 2.4GHz or 5GHz Wi-Fi connection. Another key selling point in our opinion is that although it has been designed to handle complex tasks, the Orbi unit is extremely easy to set up.Source: Company 10QWith Netgear focusing its attention on providing solutions for the smart home, we expect to see its retail segment continue to perform strongly for the next decade. Pleasingly year-to-date sales are up 25% in the segment. But even more pleasing is the fact that segment margins have improved from 12.9% to 14%. This increased profitability was the result of the company's strategy of pursuing higher average selling prices, something we expect will result in further margin improvement over the next few years. This is because in our opinion consumers are now aware that cheap routers are cheap for a reason. If they want a smart home to operate efficiently, they need to pay a little more for the privilege. Thankfully with consumer confidence climbing higher, we feel consumers will be okay with this.Not that we expect fireworks in the fourth quarter. Traditionally the fourth quarter is a slower quarter for its retail unit. Furthermore, the company expects a smaller contribution from its Service Provider segment. Hence why management expects net revenue in the range of$340 million to $355 million during the quarter. This will bring full-year revenue to between $1.300 billion and $1.315 billion, compared to $1.33 billion in FY 2016. Instead we feel that next year is where we will see Netgear start to benefit. Our forecast is for top line growth of 15% to approximately $1.5 billion, thanks largely to its retail segment continuing its strong performance. And with margins continuing to expand, we have forecast earnings per share of $3.72. This is an increase of 18% on the analyst consensus for the current year.Which based on a conservative PE ratio of 16, gives us a 12-month price target of $59.52, approximately 15.7% higher than the last close price. This return, along with its bright long-term growth prospects, hefty cash balance, and next to no debt, makes Netgear an ideal addition to most portfolios in our opinion. For this reason we have recently opened a long position with the networking solutions provider."
4054627,21815,2017-03-13T13:43:46-04:00,"NETGEAR displayed a stellar performance in 2016 as it managed to restructure its declining SPBU unit.Retail and commercial sectors put in a stellar performance, but these will be difficult to repeat.Still, growth is returning as the SPBU unit will stabilize and we think the shares should bottom here.","NETGEAR (NASDAQ:NTGR) is a producer of network gear and sells to three different sectors. The biggest is Retail (the 'RBU' business unit), but it also sells to Internet Service Providers ('SPBU') and Enterprise ('CBU').Shares in NETGEAR were slumbering for years and then suddenly took off at the end of 2015, driven by solid growth in its biggest sector, the retail sector and a restructuring in the lagging ISP sector that got margins up from roughly 8% to 15%, more in line to those in retail.The restructuring of the SPBU sector is basically a one-off, and perhaps it's this that have made the shares fall back again, at least to some extent. But we see some interesting opportunities here.The bullish sideHere is the decline in the server business, from the Q4CC:That is quite an achievement. The revenue decline in the service business in Q4 was even bigger as it nearly halved (-48.3%) from Q4 2015. Here is the relative size of the business units in Q4:The $51.4M is just 14% of the total $367.9M revenues, any further shrinkage won't matter all that much anymore. In fact, the company has guided that they believe they can keep the quarterly run rate of this sector at $55M per quarter, so they don't expect any further declines.The strong performance in the retail sector comes from leading products (like the Nighthawk routers, Orbi mesh networks and Arlo Pro cameras. The company is gaining market share and increasing average selling prices (for instance with the recently introduced $499 Nighthawk X10).The increasing performance needs for streaming media and gaming is what's driving the demand for these high-end routers like Nighthawk and Orbi. The latter is indeed the performance leader in mesh networks, from TrustedReviews:Management believes that, while seasonality is more pronounced because of a relatively larger dependence on the retail unit, the home Wi-Fi market will continue to grow in the high-single digits.They have a 45-50% market share in routers and although they are the market leader in mesh routers, the share is significantly smaller in that segment.While this market is competitive, the company isn't sitting still and it will introduce a number of new products (with a host of awards); from the Q4CC:Also for the commercial sector (which is the sector with the highest margins), the company has been innovating, and it will introduce an evolution of web-managed smart switches in the form of switches one can manage from a smartphone.It has been dragged down by a decline in storage and the competitive situation in wireless LAN, but NETGEAR's switching business is growing nicely and is becoming an ever bigger part of the unit's sales, to the point where the decline in storage is going to matter less and less.Any gains here is especially welcome, not only for the revenue stabilization (at the minimum, management is guiding some growth), but for margins as it is the unit with the highest margins.For high growth, the company depends on the smart devices market, which will grow in excess of 40% a year according to management. For that purpose, the company has acquired Placemeter, a provider of computer vision analytics for the Arlo smart home platform to add intelligence to Arlo's home security cameras.Then there is the $104.2M in free cash flow generated in 2016 and the share buyback program, which has already bought back roughly 9.5M shares since Q4 2013, lowering diluted share count by some 13.5%. The program still has 1.3M shares left for buyback.Problems and risksBasically, we have discussed most of these already above, but here are some additional considerations on the competitive situation. For instance, Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) has been rather aggressive with its competing product to the Orbi, it's AmpliFi home Wi-Fi mesh network, underpricing Orbi.And, of course, also cheaper in the same category (mesh networks) there is the well-received Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Wi-Fi. The only downside seems to be that it must be in constant connection to your Google account. This does have an upside as it regularly updates the software.While NETGEAR's top line products are faster, they're more expensive compared to the competition that's entering the market and it remains to be seen how this plays out this year, but with the increasing competition it is difficult to imagine they could have another year with increasing ASPs.Increased seasonalityNETGEAR posted considerably better results for the Q4 quarter:However, the shares plunged nevertheless on weaker than expected Q1 guidance. This isn't necessarily bad news, as the company will experience more pronounced seasonality because:ConclusionWith over $11 in cash per share and no debt, and a 2016 GAAP EPS of $2.25 and non-GAAP of $3.10, the shares are fairly cheap even if 2017 EPS isn't likely to exceed these numbers by a whole lot (2017 guidance is that the company ""expects to deliver year-over-year EPS growth"").While the decline in the SPBU sector will be arrested and margins in that sector have greatly improved (90 basis points in gross margins, 60 basis points in adjusted operating margins), mainly as a result of higher ASPs, it's difficult to imagine that in the face of increasing competition, the much bigger retail sector can make another leap forward like it did last year.But on the other hand, they have market leading products and keep innovating. Without a significant turn in the markets or major bad news from the company, we expect the shares to bottom out in the low $50s, supported by the valuation, share buyback and free cash flow generation.While the company has put in a stellar performance in 2016, it's a little early to conclude that NETGEAR has become a growth stock. We need a couple of more years of that to happen.This will be easier because the stabilization in the SPBU sector, but on the other hand, replicating the stellar 2016 performance in the other two units is a lot to ask."
4031837,101421,2016-12-21T00:11:42-05:00,"Newtworking equipment maker Netgear has acquired Placemeter for an undisclosed sum.
        Placemeter has developed video recognition technology that creates structured data from electronic video.
        It's a smart move, as it should enable Netgear to tightly integrate its products with software and diversify its offerings into recurring revenue subscription-based services.","Quick TakeHome networking technology company NETGEAR (NASDAQ:NTGR) has acquired Placemeter for an undisclosed amount.The acquisition of Placemeter provides Netgear with potential subscription service offerings for both home and business applications.I view the deal as a positive and meaningful signal of where management may pursue new revenue streams and technology development.Target CompanyNew York-based Placemeter was founded in 2012 by CEO Alexandre Winter and COO Florent Peyre.The company has developed computer vision technology that obtains 'data points from video streams' via networks of cameras and turns that information into structured data.As part of its system, Placemeter provided users with a key performance indicators dashboard, an API to integrate the data as well as the ability to export data as needed.To-date, the company's systems have been deployed by cities to analyze traffic and user flow in public areas; out of home advertising to determine reach and dwell time; retailers for store door counts, front of store traffic, street to purchase conversion rates.Placemeter raised nearly $10 million in several rounds, mostly from angel investors but also from VC firms such as New Enterprise Associates, Correlation Ventures and Scrum Ventures.Acquisition TermsThe companies didn't disclose the financial terms of the deal, and there are no relevant SEC filings that might provide clues as to the amount or terms.Since it appears that Placemeter had a rather limited customer base, it is likely that Netgear acquired it for the technology.Prior to the acquisition, Placemeter had already integrated its system with Netgear's Arlo home security camera.As such, the price paid was probably determined on the basis of a 'buy vs. build' cost analysis, so my expectation is that it was less than $20 million.Rationale and CommentaryAlthough Placemeter's focus has been on the commercial and municipal part of the market, Netgear's family of products are focused on the home, but also include business applications.In my view, the acquisition makes sense in that it provides Netgear with an analytics/A.I. potential that can move its offerings into new segments.For example, Arlo combined with Placemeter can become a smart camera that identifies visitors to a home or business, for security or business intelligence purposes.Additionally, businesses can be charged an ongoing subscription fee service, enabling Netgear to expand beyond its 'sell once' product-orientation to a recurring revenue model.So, I see the Placemeter acquisition as a first step to Netgear offering more vertically integrated products and related services.This is a smart move by management since it avoids potential commoditization of product and effectively turns those products into services, enabling potential cross-selling opportunities.As the late Steve Jobs of Apple repeatedly said, as performance demands increase, the combination of hardware and software developed together is superior to those technologies developed separately.With the rise of consumer interest in the smart home and business interest in more valuable analytics, the Placemeter acquisition positions Netgear to begin to build out a service offering for both segments.I view the deal as a positive signal that management is staying on top of current demand trends and preparing the way for a more services oriented future.I write about IPOs, follow-ons, secondaries, and M&A.

The company operates in three segments: retail, enterprise, and service providers (SPs).Currently, the fastest growing segment is retail. Netgear sells home WiFi networking solutions and smart connected devices like security cameras. The enterprise segment provides business networking, storage, and security solutions. The service provider segment provides home networking solutions that SPs sell to their subscribers.Over the past few years, the retail segment has seen strong growth while the SP unit has struggled, leading to its restructuring.Netgear's Bullish ReversalWe have seen a very strong bullish reversal in the share price over the past week, and it is worth looking at how far this may go. finbox.io's nine valuation models conclude an average fair value price target of $60.66 per share, well above its current trading price of around $46.00. In fact, only the Earnings Power Value model suggests a fair value below the current price. Wall Street's consensus is just below the finbox.io average fair value at $58.67. Overall, the nine models and three Wall Street targets imply that the stock is 28-32% undervalued.NTGR Fair Value PageAfter the 2008 bear market, the share price experienced a strong rally through 2011 and then traded in a tight range for nearly five years. In 2015, another rally started, as the retail segment began to show signs of strong growth.Here's What Should Concern InvestorsSince September 2016, the company's shares have been under pressure for a variety of reasons:• Netgear's Service Provider segment revenues fell a whopping 48% from Q4'15 to Q4'16. In fiscal-year 2015, this segment represented 32% of total revenues and now only represents 14%.• The company also incurred nearly $4 million in restructuring costs in 2016 in connection with its SP segment. However, investors have been unimpressed by the results thus far.• Netgear's management has already shown investors that it is capable of operating with long periods of mediocre growth as illustrated below:However, the recent bullish reversal should excite shareholders.Here's What Should Excite InvestorsThe fall in the share price was justified, but it may have been overdone, and there are a couple of very good reasons we could see more upside from here.• The contribution from the SP unit now makes up just 14% of revenue. Even if the contribution from the SP unit continues its decline, it will only have a marginal impact on gross revenue going forward.• Gross margins are expanding as the contribution from the high-margin retail segment grows and the contribution from the low-margin SP unit shrinks (highlighted below).• Sales of Netgear's Arlo wireless security cameras jumped 150% year over year.• Netgear is recognized as the market leader for home WiFi routers. The Orbi router offers the highest speeds when measured against competitors.• The company is about to launch two new products to the retail market; the Arlo Baby and Arlo Go weatherproof cameras.• Netgear has no debt and enough cash on hand to fund further growth initiatives.• The company's EBITDA multiples trade at a significant discount to selected peers: NetScout Systems (NASDAQ:NTCT), Brocade Communications Systems (NASDAQ:BRCD), Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and the average of the IT sector.Why Netgear Could Become A Growth StockNetgear is a solid company trading well below its fair value. However, there's more to the story and its upside potential. As a trusted manufacturer of connected devices, Netgear is perfectly positioned to become a player in the Internet of Things (IOT) market. Companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are already investing billions in this fledgling industry, which happens to be dependent on the technology Netgear is a market leader in.Looking back at the past decade, Netgear would not be described as a growth stock. But when you look at the revenue growth from the retail segment, the new products on the horizon and the optionality of exposure to the IoT market, you have the recipe for a growth stock.Overall, Netgear is a value play but has the potential to evolve into a growth stock. The strong price action we have seen recently appears justified."
3620076,92146,2015-10-29T12:44:17-04:00,"NTGR’s restructuring plan to focus on the growing wireless segment appears to be working as there was “higher-than-normal” demand from service provider customers in Q3 2015.The retail business unit delivered the bulk of the revenue growth in Q3 2015, up around 24.9% compared to the same quarter last year.We believe the Arlo wire-free camera and Nighthawk routers are positioned to deliver massive sales growth in the next two quarters.NTGR stock jumped 29% after Q3 financial results were released.","Netgear Realigned Priorities to Match the Market RealityEarlier this year, Netgear (NASDAQ:NTGR)  initiated an internal restructuring plan that realigned its focus on the service-provider segment. Netgear  management resized their cost structure and set the quarterly revenue run rate expectation for the service provider segment at around $100 million in the next quarter.Over the last two years, something interesting has been happening in the US networking market. Service providers are increasingly focusing on reducing traditional wireline networks and investing to expand their wireless reach.As part of the restructuring process Netgear  prioritized their sales efforts on capturing this wireless growth segment.Staggering Revenue Growth in Q3 2015 Figure 1: Compared to Q2, Netgear  Revenue increased 18.39% in Q3, 2015Netgear's restructuring paid a healthy dividend in the last quarter as its revenue grew from $288.78 million in Q2 2015 to $341.89 million in Q3 2015, representing 18.39% growth. It is worth noting that despite this staggering quarter-over-quarter growth, compared to Q3 2014, the year's Q3 revenue still fell short by $11.4 million, representing a 3.20% year-over-year decline.As a result, NTGR jumped from $32.70 per share on October 22, 2015, to $42.45 on October 23, 2015, representing an overnight increase of of 29.82%.The CEO Said Revenue Grew Because of Success in North American MarketThe Chairman and CEO of Netgear, Patrick Lo, said during the earnings call that the ""sequential uptick in revenue is primarily due to our success in North America where we experienced a robust back-to-school season and strong demand for our flagship product lines such as Nighthawk and Arlo.""He also mentioned that the ""higher-than-normal"" demand from service provider customers also played a crucial role. However, it was nice of him to point out that the service provider segment revenue is still down $37 million on a year-over-year basis due to the restructuring plan his company initiated earlier.While the cost cutting measures were taken to focus more on marketing wireless products, management had also taken the decision to completely exit certain businesses because they did not meet their ""financial metrics,"" according to the CEO.Why Are We Optimistic About Netgear?Despite the fact that Netgear  has volunteered to quit making some of the products for its service provider segment, we believe it freed up the resources to pursue opportunities elsewhere.In Q3 2015, Netgear  released a total of 21 new products and two of these products have the potential to bring sustained growth for the company over the next few quarters.The retail business unit contributed $164.1 million to net revenue in Q3 2015, up 24.9% compared to the same quarter last year. In the retail business unit, Netgear  is enjoying the fruits of its Arlo wire-free IP camera system, which is a weatherproof HD security camera. Netgear  has silently taken the lead in the consumer IP camera markets in three of the major geographical segments in the world - the United States, Europe, and Australia.The second product we are enthusiastic about performing well against competing products are the Nighthawk routers. Nighthawk routers are positioned as premium products and its latest model, Nighthawk X8, is going to be one of the top contenders in the quad-stream, tri-band router niche.Although revenue from the commercial business unit and the service provider segment is going through a major transition period, the retail segment is doing well enough to make up the difference.ConclusionSure, the business restructuring plan has put a dent on Netgear's return on equity since the start of 2015, down 1.91% (YTD). But as the CEO indicated, demand from the service provider segment was ""higher-than-normal"" in Q3 2015, and there is ample reason to believe this segment will hold its ground for a while and may actually grow if the investments in wireless networks continue to work out.Last quarter's revenue growth really surprised a lot of analysts as the market was rather concerned about the spread of malware in the Netgear SOHO routers and its effect on the stock price. However, the strong rebounding sales have changed all that.We believe the 29% jump in NTGR was the start of a gradual uptrend and there is a good possibility that it would likely continue over the next two quarters. Earlier this week, Rosenblatt Securities set NTGR's price target at $47 per share, which would offer investors an additional 13.58% upside potential from the stock's current price."
2553235,66493,2014-10-11T10:18:18-04:00,"Netgear has struggled over the last several years. The company's struggles are the result of two segments underperforming.The EMEA segment has declined due to issues in Europe. The slow economy has hurt the segment's revenue but the company has also had sales execution issues.Despite a sluggish European economy, Cisco was able to grow their EMEA revenue. Netgear's management is addressing their issues with two new initiatives which will take several quarters to work.Netgear's commercial revenue has declined due to the struggles of their NAS system. Netgear is struggling in the NAS market due to a subpar entry-level product and the competitive environment.Management believes they can compete in the high-end NAS market. Yet, the market is dominated by two large vendors. As a result, Netgear is positioned to continue to struggle.","Netgear, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTGR) is a producer of wireless routers and network storage devices. Over the last few years, Netgear has struggled. From 2009-2013, revenue grew at a CAGR of 18.8%. Yet, revenue growth has slowed drastically since 2011. In 2011, revenue grew 30.9% but has since slowed to 7.7% in 2012 and 2013. Revenue growth has continued its downward trajectory in 2014. In the first half, revenue grew 5.5% and even declined 5.6% in Q2. Netgear's subpar revenue growth has coincided with a decline in profitability. Since 2011, gross, operating, and net profit margins have all fallen. Gross, operating, and net profit margins have declined 6.3, 3.6, and 3.5 percentage points, respectively. Management attributes the company's struggles to the weak economy in Europe. Yet, larger competitors have fair much better in Europe which means Netgear's European issues are company specific. Netgear's European struggles are more the result of sales execution issues rather than just a slow economy. The decline in EMEA revenue has weighed on total revenue growth over the last several years. Netgear's European problems should continue due to continued weakness in Europe and a lack of an aggressive sales strategy. Total revenue has also been impacted by the commercial segment. The commercial segment has suffered due to subpar network attached storage or NAS sales. The company's NAS solutions will continue to struggle due to the dominance of two market leaders and a subpar entry level product. In Q2, the EMEA region accounted for 30.2% of revenue and the commercial business accounted for 22.7% of revenue. These two segments have some overlap but still represent a significant portion of total revenue. Netgear should continue to struggle due to these two segments. Netgear's revenue growth issues should continue which will result in Netgear's stock continuing to underperform.Struggles In Europe ContinueOver the last several years, Netgear's growth has been impacted by declining revenue in Europe. From 2011-2013, the EMEA region's revenue has declined 13.6%. The EMEA region's decline has had a major impact due to the region's significant percentage of revenue. In 2011, the EMEA region represented 40.4% of total revenue. Despite declining revenue, the EMEA region accounted for 30.2% of total revenue in Q2. The region is still vital to total revenue growth. In the first half of 2014, the EMEA region was the only geographic region to decline. On the Q2 conference call, Patrick Lo discussed Europe's impact on the retail business ""For the Retail Business Unit, or RBU, net revenue came in at $110.7 million, down 5.7% year-over-year and down 6.4% sequentially. While we are not satisfied with the year-over-year performance of RBU, primarily due to the issues in Europe..."" Although the European economy has struggled, Netgear's struggles have been more company specific. Over the last few years, Cisco Systems', Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) EMEA revenue only slightly declined in 2012. Cisco's EMEA revenue grew 4.1% (2011), -1.7% (2012), and 1.1% (2013). This isn't a spectacular performance but is significantly better than a decline of 13.6% over the period. Additionally, Cisco generates over $12 billion from the EMEA region. If the entire region or Europe specially was experiencing a rapid deterioration, Cisco's revenue would have been more severely impacted. Management has simply been unable to come up with a sales strategy for the EMEA region over the last several years.On the Q4 2012 conference call, Patrick Lo discussed moving sales personal out of Europe ""With the current weakened market demand in Europe, we have been shifting our sales and marketing resources to the emerging markets where we believe there is growth to achieve and more market share to be gained."" In 2013, this decision helped cause a decline of 9.8% in EMEA revenue. In Q2 2014, management still appears to have no answer to restart the region's growth. On the Q2 Conference call, Patrick Lo discussed Europe ""I mean, Europe is definitely a little bit more difficult than what we anticipated. The market has stabilized, as what we have pointed out, and on a very, very slow recovery."" As shown above, other companies have fared much better in Europe. Yet assuming the European economy is the company's only issue, Netgear's EMEA segment will continue to struggle. European GDP growth has started to slow after a slight recovery over the last few years. In Q2 2014, the Economist reports Germany's GDP declined, Italy's GDP grew 0.2%, and France's GDP was stagnant. These three countries represent the three largest economies in Europe. Additionally, European growth should continue to stagnant or even decline due to their current deflationary issues. Europe's struggles should continue over the next several years. This will continue to impact revenue generated from the EMEA region.In order to increase growth, management has decided to adjust their European sales efforts and focus on several large resellers. On the Q2 conference call, Patrick Lo discussed their focus on large resellers ""Europe continues to be a difficult market for us, so during Q2, we took some proactive measures to address this. In the Northern European region, especially in the German-speaking countries, the market has become more concentrated in fewer, larger resellers."" Management is also increasing their online sales presents in Europe. On the Q2 conference call, Patrick Lo discussed their European online sales effort ""So I think we make a very good progress in building a sales team specifically for online around the world. So we're trying to do the same for the German-speaking and Nordic countries as well. That's the last piece of the puzzle that we have to plug..."" If they work, these new initiatives will still take several quarters to produce results. In the meantime, Europe is still struggling which will continue to impact Netgear's EMEA segment. Additionally, the company's new initiatives could fail to produce results which wouldn't be unlikely due to the company's European track record. Europe is going to continue to struggle which will continue to impact Netgear's revenue growth. Europe has impact all 3 of Netgear's business segments. Yet, the commercial business segment is also struggling due to subpar NAS sales.NAS Market Too ConcentratedThe network attached storage or NAS market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 14.3% until 2018, according to TechNavio. In 2012, Netgear was the leader in the NAS market based on unit volume, according to Gartner. In 2012, the company's NAS systems were able to generate $98.8 million. Yet since 2012, the NAS system has struggled. In the second quarter 2014 10Q, management writes about commercial revenue's decline ""The decrease was primarily attributable to the decreased sales of our network storage products and switches."" The companies NAS sales issues are the result of an inferior low end product, a rocky product transition, and a competitive NAS market. On the Q1 2013 conference call, Patrick Lo talked about the transition to their new NAS system ""The new ReadyNAS product transition occurred late in the quarter and we experienced difficulty securing components coupled with some last-minute bug fixes, which led to unanticipated delays. This marked the first time we completely replaced an entire line of products, which involved obsoleting 10 models and replacing them with 7 brand-new models."" The rocky transition resulted in the NAS segment struggling in 2013. In Q2 2014, management is still struggling to produce a competitive low end NAS system.On the Q2 conference call, Patrick Lo discussed the need for an improved product ""It's in the entry level that we need to continue to work on the usability and the cloud capability at the entry level."" The company's entry level struggles are the major reason for the decline in NAS revenue. In 2012, Netgear was the market leader in unit volume but wasn't near the top in NAS revenue. This means they relied on the entry level market to generate their NAS revenue. Yet, Netgear is still struggling to produce a competitive product. This should result in the NAS segment continuing to struggle which will continue to impact revenue growth. However, management believes they can compete in the high end market. On the Q2 conference call, Patrick Lo discussed about their NAS solutions ""So in the high end, we do believe that we are well positioned and we are gaining share, we're going to gain share..."" Management wants to gain market share in the high end market. Yet, this is going to be very difficult due to the dominance of two vendors.In 2012, Gartner estimates EMC Corporation (EMC) and NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) controlled 78.2% of the NAS market. These two companies have been strengthening their leadership position over the years. Gartner estimates these two vendors accounted for 43.1% of the market in 2008. Despite Netgear's volume leadership, the majority of revenue was generated by EMC and NetApp. Additionally, the rest of the top 5 NAS vendors were International Business Machine Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). The top 5 vendors are much larger and more capable than Netgear. The top 5 vendors predominately target the high end market. This is why Netgear was so successful in the entry level market. Gaining market share in the high end market has been very difficult for many companies expect the market leader. Like other companies, Netgear should struggle to gain meaningful market share in the high end market. Netgear needs to find more areas of growth. The NAS market is and should continue to grow but the two market leaders will make gaining market share very difficult. This combined with an inferior low end product will result in the NAS segment continuing to struggle.Struggles Should ContinueNetgear has struggled over the last few years. The company's struggles are the result of a subpar performance in the EMEA region and the commercial business segment. The company's European struggles are due to management's inability to come up with a successful sales strategy. Although the European economy has struggled, other larger competitors have been able to grow revenue over the last few years. This means Netgear's European issues are more company specific. In 2013, management diverted sales and marketing resources out of Europe. This decision helped cause a decline of 9.8% in EMEA revenue. The European economy is still struggling and should continue for several more years. This will continue to impact Netgear's EMEA revenue. In Q2, management did decide to adjust their sales strategy after several years of subpar results. If the adjustments work, they will take several quarters to produce results. Yet in the meantime, the EMEA region should continue to weigh on revenue growth and the commercial segment will further hinder growth.Netgear's commercial segment is struggling due to declining revenue from their NAS systems. Despite being a market leader in 2012, Netgear's NAS segment has struggled. The NAS segment's issues have continued into 2014. In Q2, management is still trying to make their entry level NAS system more competitive. The entry level is vital to NAS revenue due to the competitiveness of the high end market. In 2012, Netgear was the volume leader but wasn't at the top in NAS revenue. Netgear's NAS revenue growth was driven by the low end market. The company's inferior low end product is why NAS revenue has been declining. Although, management believes they can compete and gain market share in the high end market. Yet, this will be very difficult due to the dominance of the two market leaders. In 2012, EMC and NetApp represented nearly 80% of the NAS market. Since 2008, the two market leaders have been strengthening their market share lead. Gaining market share in such a concentrated market has been very difficult for many companies. Netgear will face similar issues in the high end market. Netgear's NAS segment is positioned to continue to struggle. Due to issues in Europe and the NAS segment, Netgear should continue to struggle to grow revenue. The company's continued struggles should result in the underperformance of their stock."
4024539,24594,2016-11-19T07:33:28-05:00,"NETGEAR has done a nice job of offsetting declining sales to internet service providers through retail growth.Current valuation implies basically zero consolidated growth going forward, despite strong sales in IP cameras and high-end routers.That seems too conservative; but with the service provider business still a question mark post-2018 and competition coming en masse, a good holiday season would drive confidence.All told, I like NTGR at $51, but I don't love it.","At $51, NETGEAR (NASDAQ:NTGR) is being valued by the market as if its future profit growth will be essentially zero. Including a substantial cash balance (almost $12 per share,) NTGR trades at about 11.9x trailing twelve-month free cash flow and a bit over 13x 2016 earnings (including the midpoint of Q4 guidance). Looking at the company's historical performance, that makes a lot of sense:full calendar year figures; 2016 figures are author estimates using Q4 guidance and post-Q3 commentary* - non-GAAPIt's not necessarily true that NETGEAR's business simply has been stagnant; in fact, there have been a number of changes. The most notable is a continuing decline in service provider revenue (driven by sales of routers, primarily, to telcos and cable companies for subscriber use). That has been offset by impressive growth in the company's Retail segment, where innovative products like Arlo IP cameras and Nighthawk high-end routers have boosted sales:Source: author from NTGR filingsThe mix shift has helped gross margin; the required R&D spend (+183 bps as a percentage of sales, on a non-GAAP basis over the past few years) to drive retail sales has increased opex. With the Commercial segment relatively flat - enterprise networking is a tough space, as seen in recent results at Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper (NYSE:JNPR), among many others - the shift from service provider to retail has led to somewhat of a wash for NTGR on a consolidated basis. And that seems to support the low-teen multiple being given to NTGR at the moment: even with a move from ISP to retail, the end markets still should be reasonably challenged, and if JNPR trades at ~12x 2016 EPS plus net cash and investments, and CSCO around 13x FY17 consensus, NTGR's similar multiple doesn't seem particularly outlandish.But there is a story that the market might be missing here. So far, the mix shift has been relatively margin- and profit-neutral; but going forward, NTGR has a clear opportunity to drive above-market earnings growth that should support a premium to its larger peers, and at the least a multiple that incorporates some level of growth. ISP margins have improved dramatically, from 8-9% to a likely 15%+ this year - in line with retail. The retail business now is far larger on a relative basis; even incorporating a guided reduction in ISP revenue next year, simple math shows that growth in a segment that drives 56% of 2016 revenue is going to more than offset potential weakness in another business that likely will generate just ~15% of 2017 sales.And the growth in retail is both impressive and sustainable: both Arlo and Nighthawk are legitimate hits and appear to be leaders in fast-growing categories, and NETGEAR has another major product launch on the way. It's certainly possible that somewhat-undercovered and largely forgotten NTGR is being lumped in with enterprise IT and/or networking plays, nearly all of which are relatively unloved by the market, and not getting enough credit for its potential in consumer sales and its exposure to the IoT (Internet of Things) trend. And that grouping is leading the market to undervalue NTGR's growth potential.I do think there's some truth to that argument, and I do believe NTGR, at Thursday's close of $51.35, is undervalued. A negative-growth FCF multiple simply seems too low, and it's not as if there's a near-term growth limit on the major retail drivers. There are two key problems, however. One is that cash and the negative leverage it drives, which seems to limit NTGR's upside somewhat. A 2-turn multiple expansion only gets shares to ~$57, or less than 12% upside. The second is that competition is coming for NETGEAR, and that competition is big names (Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google among them) and likely in a big way.So I'd like to see a little more from NTGR: either a lower price, or a strong holiday season against competitive launches. Obviously, that may be asking too much: a strong Q4 may spike the stock, and a lower price may imply a market anticipating a disappointing report. But at the moment, I think NTGR is intriguing but not quite compelling, and cheap but not quite cheap enough. Still, there's a story here to keep an eye on, and a story that I'm not sure the market 100% understands as yet.NTGR's Growth PotentialThe market has been relatively skeptical toward NTGR for years; in fact, for a good chunk of this decade, the stock traded at a single-digit multiple to EPS plus cash. There was a bit of a ""value play or value trap?"" argument - although, truthfully, the extremely tight range seems to show that few investors seemed to care enough to argue:NTGR data by YChartsA restructuring in the Service Provider segment and success at retail changed the narrative last year; back-half EPS took off and growth continued into 1H 2016. (Non-GAAP EPS almost doubled in the first six months, to $1.46 from $0.75.) And NTGR doubled in response, a huge move that looks more dramatic given a ~150% increase in enterprise value over roughly a year. But shares have given back some of the gains, in large part because it's become clear that the 1H 2016 growth rates, in particular, were largely due to one-time cost-cutting in the Service Provider segment.That's not to say that NETGEAR's growth necessarily is over, or that the company and the stock are heading back to the flat performance earlier this decade. (Non-GAAP operating income from 2011 to 2014 was $146 million, $148 million, $140 million and $141 million. There's a reason the stock barely moved, in either direction.) But it's difficult to model a re-acceleration going forward. The bull case is that Retail will continue to impress, Commercial will be stable to up, and Service Provider will stabilize post-2017 at the current elevated margins. And looking at each business, that doesn't seem terribly outlandish:RetailSource: author from NTGR filings; 2016 figure author estimateIf there's one key question with NTGR from an investment perspective, it's this: is the growth seen in the Retail segment sustainable? The current valuation doesn't require the ~20% growth rates seen in both 2015 and (likely) 2016 to hold, to be sure. But looking forward, given relative weakness in enterprise networking and further erosion in the service provider business, Retail still needs to be the driver.And there is a case that the segment has years of growth in front of it. The retail business isn't just basic routers and switches anymore. Arlo IP cameras are the company's first step into 'smart home' products and they've been a huge success:Source: NETGEAR Analyst Day presentationMarket data supplied in the presentation implies that 27% share has driven ~$160 million in sales over the past twelve months, or nearly a quarter of the segment's total. The IP camera market is growing at a 30% CAGR; penetration is estimated under 10%; and NETGEAR isn't done with Arlo or IoT as a whole. An upgraded Arlo Pro was launched for the 2016 holiday season, and Netgear offers upgraded subscriptions which can drive recurring revenue beyond initial product sales. Meanwhile, the IP camera seems just a first step in 'smart home; CEO Patrick Lo said on the Q2 conference call that, in the back half, NETGEAR was planning to enter ""new product categories that nobody ever has ventured into.""In routers, NETGEAR has taken a huge chunk of share over the past two years, going from 26% to 56%, according to management at the Analyst Day. Prices are increasing as well - NETGEAR's average selling price is up 23% over the same period - in part due to success with NETGEAR's high-end Nighthawk line. The most recent launch, the X10, was touted by the company as the world's fastest router, with an MSRP of $499, and as bandwidth demands increase for streaming video and gaming, there should be a multi-year move toward the higher end of the market, which already has better than doubled since 2014 to an estimated $150 million in 2016 (per NPD data cited by NETGEAR). And the company isn't done in terms of consumer networking: a new Orbi 'mesh' WiFi system has been well-reviewed. The 'tri-band' system extends WiFi signal across the property - but doesn't require a device to change SSIDs, as is the case with standard WiFi extenders.Notably, the new products aren't a driver in the sense that they provide opportunities for incremental revenue growth; these products are the growth. Lo said on the Q3 call in response to an analyst question that Nighthawk, Orbi and Arlo ""absolutely"" would be over 50% of retail revenue in the quarter. NETGEAR hasn't broken out product revenue, but share and market information at the Analyst Day implies something like $160 million in trailing Arlo sales and $90 million in Nighthawk revenue: combined, ~35% of retail segment revenue. Those estimates may be a bit low at this point, and Orbi's contribution needs to be added. Furthermore, mix will shift toward those more giftable products in the holiday season (a $129 router isn't much of a present); it's not certain that the three products represent a majority of full-year retail sales, or just in Q4.Whatever the exact figure, Nighthawk, Orbi and Arlo are not ancillary products for either the segment or NETGEAR as a whole, and with the new launches, one would expect that the ~50% level will be breached soon, if it hasn't been already. And that's a bit of a double-edged sword. On one hand, those products represent legitimate growth opportunities: both Arlo cameras and Nighthawk routers are market share leaders in fast-growing categories. And they are large enough as a percentage of revenue to drive segment and consolidated growth on their own. NETGEAR's retail business no longer is based just on router replacement and/or upgrades from customers looking to stop paying a $7 monthly lease fee to their cable operator; it's a legitimate play on IoT growth and increasing bandwidth demands, both of which look like multi-year opportunities. And there's a symbiosis here: as adoption of Arlo (and other competing/adjacent devices) increases, the number of devices required to be supported via the home network rises in tandem, which pushes more customers into high-end solutions like Nighthawk and Orbi.On the other hand, there's still ~50% of the business left in legacy home networking, a difficult space where prices erode and low-cost competition is intense. It certainly seems that business is declining: retail revenue, by my estimate, should grow about $230 million between 2014 and 2016. Assuming $160 million from Arlo, maybe $75 million from Nighthawk, and some contribution from Orbi in Q4, the rest of the business seems likely to be declining, possibly at a mid-single-digit rate. Even with the retail segment, there's going to be an offset to new product growth that should perhaps keep a lid on near-term expectations. NETGEAR itself is targeting 10% revenue growth in retail and commercial combined in 2017, which implies a low-teen increase in retail sales next year even if commercial revenues are flat.The other concern is that the smart home space is an absolute mess. There are at least five platforms: Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) HomeKit, Samsung's (OTC:SSNNF) SmartThings, Comcast's (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Xfinity Home and others. Competition is going to be intense, with Google pushing Nest (and entering the mesh market with Google Wifi's pending launch). There's certainly an upside scenario where NETGEAR winds up at the center of the IoT trend; but it's far from guaranteed, even with the early head start in IP camera market share. There is going to be a mad scramble for share in the space, with some very large entrants who will be willing to cede near-term margin for long-term penetration.So it's the growth opportunity in retail that gives me a bit of hesitation. NETGEAR has an opportunity - but it's far from guaranteed. And even as retail heads toward being ~60% of revenue and 50%+ of segment-level operating income (the commercial business is higher-margin), ~half of that retail business still remains challenged. And I'm not confident enough that the other two businesses can drive much, if anything, in the way of growth.CommercialSource: author from NTGR filingsThe performance in the Commercial business has been choppy, even within the products: switches were up in 2014 but down in 2015, which led to a leg down in the business. Those sales have rebounded year-to-date: commercial revenue is up over 7%, and leverage has led segment income up 26%. The 10-Q cites strength in switches, offset by further weakness in network storage. NETGEAR's strength in web-managed switches - where growth is strongest and price erosion the lowest - has helped this year, and dominant share in 10GbE provides another growth driver.But here too, there's a drag from the legacy business, with storage and wireless negative in both 2014 and 2015 and likely to continue to decline going forward. End markets might get some help, particularly in SMB, if the VoIP services being pushed by so many companies bear fruit. Still, top-line growth seems likely to be modest going forward, with legacy products negating some of the opportunities in switches. And margins already have jumped to a high of 23% last year and increased another 300+ bps year-to-date; further expansion seems likely to be difficult. The Commercial business can contribute to growth - but its smaller size (~22% of 2016 sales) and limited potential mean it's not going to be a major driver.Service ProviderNETGEAR restructured the SP unit early in 2015 and changed its focus from growth to profitability. Per management commentary, the company has essentially abandoned the European market, where spectrum costs for providers limit capex investment and low-cost Asian competitors have undercut existing suppliers. Domestically, the company has walked away from business as well.The restructuring a year ago - along with further cuts in Q1 2016 - has boosted margins significantly, keeping profitability despite a substantial decline in margins:Source: author from NTGR filingsThe problem here - and one reason the stock has pulled back of late - is that the segment is taking another step down in 2017, with NETGEAR now guiding to ~$55 million a quarter in revenue against a previous $75 million. With margins around 15%, that represents about $0.20 in lost EPS annually.Looking forward, it's far from certain that further declines aren't on the way. Consolidation among operators hasn't helped NETGEAR so far, and competition isn't going away. Management has speculated about potential opportunities for growth down the line, but in the near term stagnant revenue - and flattish margins - seems the best investors can expect.ValuationAgain, with the drivers in Arlo, Orbi and Nighthawk, there is a case for NTGR at the current valuation. Management is solid and long-tenured and there's nearly $12 per share in cash. Even zero growth probably roughly supports the current share price and continued share repurchases (the current authorization still covers ~5% of shares outstanding) can add some value as well. After all, 2016 results look relatively similar to those of 2012 - yet shares are up over 50% over that period.So the argument for NTGR is that downside is reasonably protected and any further upside from the recent growth drivers and/or the new products isn't priced in. Another strong year of retail growth next year not only drives up EPS but opens the door to multiple expansion, which lends upside bias from a risk/reward standpoint. The case here reminds me of Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI) in many ways: growth opportunities that perhaps weren't quite understood, net cash on the balance sheet and a legacy business that seemed in run-off mode. LOGI has doubled this year (though I missed that story).I'm sympathetic to that argument, and indeed I think NTGR is undervalued. But I'm not sure it's that undervalued. The growth opportunities might be undercovered, but they're also going to be offset by weakness in the legacy business. NETGEAR's own targets for 2017 - 10% growth in commercial and revenue combined, along with operating income of 11.5-12.5% - only implies EPS of about $3.10, up roughly 4% year-over-year. There may be room to accelerate in 2018, particularly if the Service Provider segment stabilizes, but the drag of having ~70% of the business being relatively weak and the negative leverage seems to limit EPS growth. Even something like $3.50 in 2018 and a 2-turn multiple expansion to ~15x plus cash gets shares to $65, only up about 25% from current levels.That's not an unlikely outcome, to be sure, and against more modest (likely) downside, it does imply current fair value in the $55 range. But I don't quite see enough for the stock to be compelling enough at current levels. A pullback would help - even below $50, the numbers start to change, particularly since the stock then is pricing in negative growth. And a strong Q4 in retail which cements mid-term growth opportunities in the new products would go a long way - though, at the same time, that type of quarter might get priced in. There is a path to upside for NTGR, and I don't think the stock is getting quite enough credit at the moment. That said, the opportunities aren't quite certain enough, and the price isn't quite cheap enough."
1658832,20952,2013-08-27T09:08:29-04:00,,"Business Overview:Netgear (NASDAQ:NTGR) is small-cap global networking company that delivers innovative products to the consumers, businesses and service providers. Its product line consists of wired and wireless devices that enable networking, broadband access and network connectivity. The company mostly focuses on high-growth segments of the industry with strong emphasis on R&D. It serves all kinds of customers: retail, commercial, and service providers.The company conducts its business across three geographic regions: Americas, Europe, Middle-East and Africa (""EMEA"") and Asia Pacific (""APAC"").Investment Thesis/Theme:The company holds an excellent growth potential, and its current valuation offers an attractive entry point to the company. I believe these valuations are cheap and don't reflect its true business strengths, its future growth potential and leaves a lots of space for the further appreciation of its share price. There are several reasons behind my belief like:1. Focus on high-growth segment:The company's focus is on high-growth segments of the industry like:As said by the management:""We are seeing the Smart Home market continue to grow about 30% year-over-year in North America, and it is already about half the size of the WiFi router market. In 3 years, we believe the retail market of Smart Home networking devices will be as big, if not bigger than the router market. We believe there are countless ways to improve and expand our product offering for the Smart Home and that we have a lot of share to gain by striving to be the leading provider of seamless and easy-to-use solutions for the modern connected family."" (Source: seekingalpha)The cloud computing is growing at an exceptionally fast rate.According to the Cisco Global Cloud Index, the global data center traffic is expected to grow fourfold and reach a total of 6.6 zettabytes annually by 2016. The company also predicts global cloud traffic, the fastest-growing component of data center traffic, is expected to grow six-fold, a 44 percent combined annual growth rate, from 683 exabytes of annual traffic in 2011 to 4.3 zettabytes by 2016. The global cloud traffic will account for nearly two-thirds of total data center traffic by 2106. Moreover, the Software as a Service (""SAAS"") and cloud-based business application services are expected to grow from $13.4 billion in 2011 to $32.2 billion in 2016, a five-year CAGR of 19.1%.This increasing popularity of cloud computing, coupled with the rising rate of data transfer, offers lots of growth opportunities in the ""cloud data access solutions"" market.Another segment where the company is very active is its Wi-Fi offerings. According to the management:""Wireless LAN market, which according to the latest market report is growing 15% plus."" (Source: seekingalpha)The company through its R&D effort has produced and commercialized Wi-Fi products that offer the most advanced configuration: its 802.11ac routers and gateways (normally known as Wi-Fi routers) which are compatible with most advance devices like Samsung Galaxy S4, HTC One, MacBook Air, etc.All these segments (smart home, cloud networking and wireless LAN) are the fastest-growing segments within the networking industry, and much of the future growth within the industry is expected to come through these segments. Unlike most of the other companies which are facing stiff competition from the low cost manufactures, the company is not expected to see any such pressure as it itself got its products manufactured from third party, low cost manufacturers, mainly from China. With its top-class technology, cost-effective products, and its multiple sales channels, the company is all set to make most out of these growth opportunities.2. Best in class, cost-effective, offerings:The company develops products that are, best in class to compete against the big quality manufactures, and cost-effective to compete against the low cost manufacturers. The latest example is its 10-gigabit switches used by its commercial customers.As said by the management:""We have the first breakthrough 10-gigabit switches for sub-$1,000, no competition over there. We have our enterprise-class storage products, which would enable our customers to have data protection, such as unlimited snapshots and remote replicate that, frankly, is right at the capabilities of the NetApp and EMC but much easier to use and maintain.""(Source: seekingalpha)The above statement says a lot about its product quality, cost-effectiveness and ease of use. These things are converting into the sales and the sale of its 10-gigabit switches are doubling, tripling every quarter.As the company gets its products manufactured from the third party, low-cost, manufactures it is capable of introducing such low cost products (10-gigabit switches for sub-$1,000) without compromising the quality standards. To maintain its quality standards the company sets up its own quality standards. To make sure that the products manufactured by the third party manufacturers meet its quality standards the company deploy its own checking teams and quality control centers that make sure that the quality of the products meets the required standards. This capability of the company to make low cost products with high-quality standards should not only allow it to stay ahead of its competitors but should also helps it to gain the market share in a fiercely competitive market.3. Its strong emphasis on R&D:The company gives the strong emphasis to its in-house R&D activities that focuses not only on developing the top quality products but also takes care that the products are produced in a cost-effective way, the 10-gigabit switches are example of the same. This emphasis on R&D also makes it sure that the company introduces the products that are compatible with most advance devices, e.g. its Wi-Fi routers (explained above). This R&D capability also allows the company to introduce products at a rapid pace in the dynamic industry. In the Q2 FY 2013 alone, the company introduced 22 new products.In any technology-based industry, the R&D plays the most important role in determining the future of any company. The amount of resources a company provides to its R&D department is very crucial. The company not only dedicates significant resources to its R&D department but also makes sure that its R&D department works in the right direction. The company clearly understands that any product it develops not only should meet the updated technological requirements but also should be cost-effective. This approach by its R&D department makes sure that the company's products compete well with similar products (technology-wise as well as cost-wise). This R&D approach of the company should allow it to develop the products that can meet the desire technological capabilities in a cost-effective manner and further help the company to stay ahead of its competitors in a fiercely competitive market.4. Innovative approach:The company also actively brings the innovative products to the market, particularly for the Smart home market e.g. Push2TV device that transpose videos from the mobile devices, be it, a tablet or a Smartphone, onto the TV.This kind of innovative product builds a strong brand image among the tech-savvy customers and should allow the company to capture any forthcoming growth opportunity at its nascent stage of development.5. Getting ready for the future (LTE gateways):The company is actively working on the LTE technology solutions. this technology is one of the most advance communication technologies for telecommunication industry. This technology will increase the capacity and speed of wireless data networks as compare to present 2G and 3G network technologies. The company is working on the products that can work with the said technology, particularly for its smart home and services provider customers it has already successfully been developing such products like: NETGEAR Zing Mobile Hotspot and NETGEAR tri-band USB modem for Sprint.Its presence in the LTE technology and R&D efforts to further build-up the LTE technology should lead the company to a high-growth trajectory in the future, as this technology is expected to be the future of telecommunication industry, and the products that are compatible with this technology are expected to see huge demand growth in the years to come.6. Acquisition strategy:The company follows an aggressive acquisition strategy and targets the companies that not only give the strength to its core business but also hold significant R&D capabilities. The listed below are some of its latest acquisitions:All the above acquisitions, not only strengthen the core business of the company but also allows the company to further develop these technologies in the future, through the strong R&D capability that these companies bring along with them.This acquisition strategy is excellent for any company, which is operating in the industry. This strategy makes sure that the company gets a quick access to the technologies which fits its core business, but the company has not build-up the R&D capability in that technologies.7. Global reach:The company serves consumers all over the world. This global reach will allow the company to tap every available growth opportunity and will also, to some extent, save it from any country/region-specific slowdown or from any adverse changes in the regulations.The following table breaks down its net revenues ($ in thousands) by the geographic regions:(Source: Latest Form 10-Q)8. Multiple sales channel and strong retail presence:The company sells its networking products through multiple sales channels worldwide, including traditional retailers, online retailers, wholesale distributors, direct market resellers (""DMRs""), value-added resellers (""VARs""), and the broadband service providers.Its retail channel includes traditional retail locations such as Apple Stores (NASDAQ:AAPL), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Fry's Electronics, K-mart, MicroSoft Stores (NASDAQ:MSFT), Radio Shack (NYSE:RSH), Sears (SHLD), Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS), Target (NYSE:TGT), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Argos (U.K.), Dixons (U.K.), PC World (U.K.), MediaMarkt (Germany, Austria), Dick Smith (Australia), JB HiFi (Australia) and Elkjop (Norway). Online retailers include Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Newegg.com and Buy.com.Its DMRs include CDW Corporation (NASDAQ:CDW), Insight Corporation and PC Connection in domestic markets and Misco throughout Europe. In addition, the company also sells its products through broadband service providers, such as multiple system operators (""MSOs""), DSL, and the other broadband technology operators. Its products are available at approximately 45,000 retail outlets around the world.This vast retail presence gives a significant advantage in the dynamic industry as it allows the company to effectively market its products in a very quick time, ahead of its competitors, and also should help the company to build its image as the leading introducer of technologically advance products, in the market.9. Valuations:The company is currently trading with a market cap. of about $1.15 billion and PE of about 16x (""TTM""). Its share price has shown a decline of about 21% (see the chart below) in the last one year due to its dismal results, particularly in the last two quarters. Considering its business strength and its future growth potential the valuations looks attractive.NTGR data by YChartsRisks:1. Latest financial performance: three months ended June 30, 2013: (see the table below)The company's latest financial performance is not so good. Its revenues show a decent growth (due to the recent acquisitions) of about 11.5%, and its gross profit shows a growth of about 9%. Its gross margins show a decline of about 0.6 percent point from 29.5% to 28.9%, the decline in margins is mainly due to:Its operating income shows a steep decline of about 30% mainly due to reasons like:(Source: Latest Form 10-Q)2. Litigation and Other Legal MattersThe Company is involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. Most of these cases are related to patent infringements. Any adverse ruling could affect the company negatively. In the last quarter, the company faces a ruling in the Ericsson vs. NETGEAR case, and the jury assessed the damages against the company to the amount of $3,555,000. The company may face similar ruling in many other cases.3. Competition and rapidly changing industry:The company operates in a dynamic and fiercely competitive market. The competition is expected to continue to be intense, including price competition. Its principal competitors include Allied Telesys, Barracuda, Buffalo, Data Robotics, Dell, D-Link, Fortinet, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HP), Huawei, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), etc.Conclusion:The company operates in a very competitive and dynamic industry where technology advancement is the key to success; the company understands it very well, and its this understanding of the industry reflects in its aggressive acquisition strategy and its strong emphasis on its R&D activities. The company currently has a presence in all the growth segments of the industry (explained above), and the company is preparing itself for the future growth through these segments. Its recent financial performance makes its share prices to fall by about 21%, this makes the valuation more attractive. I would like to get into the company at its current valuations as these valuations have already factored-in all the negatives (recent results) and don't reflect the future growth potential of the company. Fundamentally, the downside risk is limited (unless something drastically goes wrong) and seems to hold significant upside potential due to all the positive reasons discussed above. The company presents a strong base for high growth potential, long-term, portfolio investment.I would like to buy the company due to the following reasons:Disclaimer: Investments in stock markets carry significant risk, stock prices can rise or fall without any understandable or fundamental reasons.

3391555,78265,2015-08-04T15:02:36-04:00,"The shares of Netgear may rise a bit further as the company buys back more stock, but we believe there are enough signs of slowing profits to avoid this company.Even after removing infrequent wealth destroyers, operating profits are too low given the risks involved with the business.The shares remain very expensive, which is another reason why continued buyback activity is so strange.","We believe that Netgear (NASDAQ:NTGR) is representative of an overall market that is obsessed with revenue and relatively indifferent to earnings. This is somewhat strange to us because earnings are the source of sustainable shareholder wealth. For that reason, we want to examine the operating profits at the firm along with some signs that profitability may fall from here. We'll also comment on the board's (ill timed) decision to buy back shares.Operating YieldThe first thing we look at when examining any company is the amount of operating profit they can generate relative to the amount of capital employed. The reason for this obsession is the fact that operating profits represent the source of all sustainable profits. If management isn't generating sufficient operating profit as a percentage of the capital employed, there's not much point in continuing the exercise. We'll disqualify a potential investment immediately if operating profits aren't high enough. Since investing in businesses presents risks, if providers of capital can receive a higher yield elsewhere, they should take it. In the case of Netgear, the company generated an operating yield of ~8% over the past four quarters. With a risk free rate of ~2.16%, we need an operating yield of about 12% given all of the risks we know about (and some that we likely don't). Thus, Netgear must increase operating profits by about 50% for us to consider it investment worthy.We note the following about this calculation:Source: Company filingsOther Signs of Operational Problems: Valuation Allowance and Goodwill ImpairmentIn 2014 a valuation allowance appeared on the 10-K.Source: Netgear 10-KWe love the opaque language: ""to the extent we believe the recovery is not more likely than not, we must establish a valuation allowance."" To refresh the reader's memory, a valuation allowance is basically the company's admission that they believe there's a likelihood that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The only way such an asset won't be realized is if the company believes future net income will be too low to capture that allowance. Now, leaving aside problems with management discretion, expressed by the words ""we believe"", when a company puts a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, management is basically saying that future earnings will likely be lower than anticipated. When management themselves are broadcasting that future earnings will be lower, we consider that to be a bad sign. The valuation allowance represents ~4% of the current deferred tax asset values. We are skeptical that the California allowance is the only one that should be recognized.Goodwill ImpairmentsAnother risk that investors may not be paying attention to is the problem with goodwill impairments. These come from the phenomenon of management acquiring other companies for more than they're worth (technically, for a price greater than the acquired company's assets book value). We pay attention to excessive goodwill because it has a tendency to get written down, which impacts earnings. More broadly, when goodwill is too high, or when goodwill happens, that's a clue that management is too aggressive in acquiring companies. Thus, a higher percentage of assets made up by goodwill is potentially troublesome for a couple of reasons.With that in mind, Netgear's $74.2 million impairment charge against goodwill in 2014 drove the fourth quarter of that year into a loss. As of now, goodwill and other intangible assets represent about 15% of the capital structure of the firm. These may not all be vaporous, but we believe that some percentage of those will be written down, with negative consequences for earnings.BuybacksWhen we invest, we don't just buy companies, but we buy the surrogates for those companies (the stock) and those surrogates often behave according to rules that have little to do with the behaviour of the underlying business. The stock can behave in ways that seem counterintuitive relative to the fortunes of the business because it acts according to supply and demand functions for the stock itself. One thing that drives demand for stock is if management announces a buyback. On July 24, Netgear announced that their board had authorized an additional 3 million share buyback program. This is in addition to the $76.2 million the company spent to buyback 2.5 million shares already this year.Buybacks represent the intersection of management's skill and the behaviour of the stock. The stock will react to the news that a new buyer with very deep pockets (management, using shareholder wealth) is coming to market to buy. The risk is that when this frenzy of buying activity ends, shares drift lower.This is not to say that all buybacks are bad for shareholders. We're impressed when management can buy back shares in such a way that it creates shareholder wealth. That's not the case here, though. We'll quote Warren Buffett in his 1999 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders to illustrate the point.Source: Warren Buffett letter to shareholders, 1999Buybacks can create value if the shares are bought below their instrinsic value. If the shares are bought at a premium, though, buybacks destroy value.We believe that Netgear's buyback is actually unwise. Specifically, at a PE of 504, an EV/EBIT of 42, the company is not selling ""below its intrinsic value, conservatively calculated."" For management to buy shares at these levels will make shares float a little longer and may allow them to achieve some specific per share metrics, but will eventually destroy shareholder value.ConclusionWe continue to believe that long term investors should avoid Netgear. The company doesn't generate a sufficient operating yield, even after we strip out infrequent destroyers of shareholder wealth like an excessive tax rate or goodwill writedown. Further, the valuation allowance gives us a clue that future earnings will likely be even lower. Perhaps this is the motivation for the ill timed share buyback. Total earnings may be lower, but per share earnings maybe actually higher. In any case, a buyback at these levels will destroy value over time in our view. The shares may rise from here on the back of this buyback, but we believe any rise will be ultimately unsustainable."
1059501,39301,2012-12-12T07:40:11-05:00,,"IntroductionNetgear (NASDAQ:NTGR) is a technology company that emphasizes the development and production of wireless networking solutions for consumer and commercial markets. Netgear looks to be an amazing growth opportunity in the small cap space. Netgear was the largest gainer on the Standard and Poor 600 Small Cap Component on December 11th 2012.Qualitative AnalysisNetgear Inc has a broad product line. Netgear Inc operates in both the commercial and consumer space.Netgear commercial product offerings include: Ethernet switches, wireless controllers, internet security appliances and network attached storage.Netgear consumer product offerings include: routers, gateways, IP telephony products, and media servers.Netgear offers other products: wireless access points and range extenders, wireless network interface cards/adapters, Ethernet network interface cards and adapters, media adapters, power line adapters and bridges, multimedia over coax alliance standard adapters and bridges.Historically Netgear experiences increases in net sales in the third and fourth quarter compared to other quarters. This can be an up-side catalyst as there has been strong consumer sentiment in this past retail season.Technical AnalysisOn December 11, 2012 Netgear experienced a sharp rally of 8.10%; this sharp move hit the upper-trend line of the multi-year trend line. The impressive move had nothing to do with media press releases, or earnings calls. I saw no notable analyst recommendation or upgrade on the stock.I anticipate the stock to break above the channel on strong earnings, sentiment, and cyclical reasons (sales usually strengthen in Q3 and Q4 for NTGR).(Chart from freestockchart.com)Netgear broke and remains above the 20, 50, and 200-day moving averages. The moderate-volume implies accumulation and limited trading.Notable resistance areas are 41.50, 43.50, and 45.30 per share. 45.30 is the most important resistance area.Street AssessmentAnalysts on a consensus basis have strong expectations for the company going forward.(Table and data from yahoo finance)The company shows great potential as analysts on a consensus basis have a 5-year average growth rate forecast of 20% (based on the above table).(Table and data from yahoo finance)The average surprise percentage is 2% over analyst forecasted earnings over the past four quarters (based on above table).Forecast and History(Table created by Alex Cho, data from shareholder annual report, and price history is from yahoo finance)The EPS figure shows that throughout the 2007-2009 period revenues dropped as the company was adversely affected by the great recession. Once the United States economy exited the recession in 2010-2011 the company earnings have improved.(Table created by Alex Cho, data from shareholder annual report)By observing the chart we can conclude that the business is cyclical and is affected by macroeconomics. Therefore the largest risk factor for Netgear is the slowing of international gross domestic product growth. So as long as the world economy continues to grow, the company will generate outstanding returns over a 5-year time span based on the forecast below.(Forecast and table by Alex Cho)By 2016 I anticipate the company to generate $6.05 in earnings per share. This is because of their past growth trend, improving global outlook, and the continued success of their product offerings. The forecast is proprietary, and below is a non-linear chart indicating the price of the stock over the next 5-years.(Forecast and chart by Alex Cho)Investment StrategyNetgear closed at 38.45 on December 11th, and although the holiday season is coming to a close, it is likely that the winter sales will boost Netgear's earnings. I have a price forecast of 55.09 for 2012, being that there is only 18-days before the end of 2012. It may not necessarily hit that price target due to the short time frame. Which means we should move to the long-run, and focus on 2012-2013. In 1st quarter 2013, Netgear will announce earnings for 4th quarter 2012. Up until the earnings are announced, the stock should experience a strong run-up. I anticipate the stock to trade to around $55.09 to $64.42 implying a lot of upside going forward.Short TermOver the next couple months, the stock is likely to appreciate from $38.45 to $55.09. This implies 43% upside from current levels. The technical chart readings imply a strong up-trend in price action, which supports my price target. Therefore both the forecast model for fundamentals and the market sentiment incline me to recommend a buy at 38.45 and to sell at $55.09. However there are notable resistance areas along the way at 45.00 per share. A minor pull back at that level is likely.I would sell the stock beyond $55.09 per share to pocket short-term gains in 2013.Long TermThe company is a great investment, I anticipate NTGR to deliver upon the price and earnings forecast despite the risk factors (global economic slowdown). Netgear's primary upside catalyst is international growth, and growth in cloud products (enterprise network and storage). Therefore I anticipate the company to deliver upon my forecasted price target of $148.86 by 2016.ConclusionNetgear is a great investment opportunity. The growth forecast along with strong market sentiment reinforces my optimism in this small-cap stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
3169586,78265,2015-05-12T13:29:49-04:00,"We are fans of Netgear's products, but we believe the assumptions embedded in the current price are a bit rich.Because of short-term headwinds affecting the company, we believe any faith the short term will be anything but bad is an example of magical thinking.The relationship between revenue and net income has been weak for some time. Not only is the strong US dollar impacting revenue, but revenue doesn't always equate to higher income.","BackgroundNetgear's (NASDAQ:NTGR) mission is to be the ""innovative leader in connecting the world to the internet."" They accomplish this by selling a host of switches, routers, data storage units, range extenders and home monitoring solutions globally. This is a company that is a ""play"" on the explosive growth of wireless access to the internet globally and we believe they are well positioned over time given the ease of use of their products. We believe they understand the fact that most of the growth here will come from relatively technologically unsophisticated users. Breaking down the company's sales by region, the Americas represents the lion's share of their business at 56% of sales. EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) represent 29% of sales and Asia Pacific account for 15% of sales in 2014. We believe that the company is well run and has excellent long-term prospects to grow its business, but the stock is a terrible investment at these prices.Reverse Engineering AssumptionsOne of the things we like to do at Doyle Publishing is to reverse engineer the price of a stock relative to some other variable like earnings and/or book value per share. We do this to attack the assumptions implicit in price at a given time. For instance, if the current price earnings multiple is lofty and the forward price earnings multiple is far less expensive, we need to work out what has to happen to move from expensive trailing twelve month earnings to inexpensive forward earnings. We can then work out whether the assumptions implicit are reasonable or not.When we perform this exercise on Netgear, we get some startling results. The company is trading at ~$30.75 and it's twelve month earnings per share is $.08, meaning that the trailing twelve month (NYSE:TTM) PE multiple is 384. According to Morningstar, forward PE for this company is 13.To refresh our readers' memory, the forward price earnings multiple is a measure of price earnings using the forward year earnings forest instead of current earnings. In other words, the expectations for earnings are so great that if you buy (admittedly overpriced) shares today, you'll be rewarded by ballooning earnings to make your original purchase price seem reasonable. If we hold price constant, earnings per share will need to grow from $.08 to $2.36 (a CAGR of ~2850%).How Realistic Is a 2850% Growth In Earnings?Now that we know how much earnings will have to grow to match current forward expectations, the next step is to try to ascertain whether those growth assumptions are reasonable. Consider the following:The company's international business was obviously negatively affected by the currency drag in 2014. On the most recent conference call, the CEO referenced the fact that the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Australian dollar all depreciated between 15-20% against the greenback. Given that just shy of half revenue comes from outside the United States, this problem with the currency is significant. We believe the greenback will mean revert, but it may take years to reach some kind of reasonable parity relationship with other global currencies.Additionally, Netgear faced some local competition in those markets, with costs in the local currency which had an impact on market share. We believe the company's responses to this problem with the currency are reasonable (work with suppliers to strip out as much of cost as possible, shift sales to newer and more high margin products, and to increase the number of new products). This is all reasonable, but it will not provide a short term boost to international profitability.Correlation Between Revenue and Net IncomeAnother thing we like to do (I know…get a hobby) is to review the correlation between revenue and net income. We want to see a strong linear relationship where revenue increases translate into net income increases. We care about net income because it is the source of all shareholder wealth, from dividends to growth in book value via retained earnings. When we see a weak relationship between the ""top line"" and the ""bottom line"", the obvious question arises: If growing sales won't increase earnings, what will? We ran a correlation analysis on the relationship between Netgear's revenue and net earnings going back to the financial crisis. It turns out that the correlation between revenue and net income at the firm is .42. There is a positive relationship, where more sales leads to more income, but it's rather weak in our view.Source: GurufocusConclusionWe are fans of this company and its products. We believe management is honest, hard working and the whole team provides well built, innovative products. We also believe the demand for those products is growing rapidly. The hospitality industry, for instance, is an excellent target market for this company that provides straightforward wireless solutions. That said, we don't believe the assumptions embedded in the stock at the moment are reasonable. We believe this is an example of an excellent company and terribly priced stock. We would consider buying in the $18-20 range."

For the first quarter, the company sees revenue of $201 million to $205 million, with non-GAAP operating margin of 11%-12%. In the latest quarter, non-GAAP operating margin was 10.8%, down from 11.6% a year ago, and 11.7% in the third quarter. The company said the lower margins reflected “unexpected high costs of air freight in the fourth quarter.” Wow, that’s novel. An earnings miss on air freight costs.In after hours trading, NTGR is down $2.27, or 8.5%, at $24.60; that reverses a gain of 97 cents in the regular session."
42934,20135,2007-07-31T03:17:02-04:00,,"Femto cells are miniature base stations — low-power cellular access points for the home environment.  Plug a femto cell into your cable modem or DSL router and you light up 5 bars of CDMA or UMTS cell coverage in your home.  If you live in a small town (like I do) that has been arguing about the location of cell towers for close to eight years, you will be a happy camper.  In the next 12–24 months, virtually every mobile operator in the known universe will be offering femto cells to consumers.
But femto cells are not without their technical hurdles.  One of those challenges is the requirement for femto cells to behave nicely in the overall macro cell radio frequency [RF] system.  In other words, when thousands or millions of femto cells interact with the larger cellular infrastructure in the RF domain, they must mitigate the potential interference with other femto cells and with the surrounding macro cell network.
Most people think of femto cells as Wi-Fi routers or access points with different radios.  But femto cells are quite different from Wi-Fi access points. When Netgear (NASDAQ:NTGR), D-Link, or Buffalo ship consumer-grade Wi-Fi routers or access points, they rarely lose sleep over their products’ interaction as a larger system.  Wi-Fi operates in unlicensed bands on a world-wide basis — and in the world of high-volume Wi-Fi products, each product is considered autonomous as long as it passes the test for regulatory compliance.
  Some Wi-Fi products automatically select non-interfering channels and adjust their transmit power to avoid interference, and the whole next generation of Wi-Fi products based on 802.11n will use MIMO technology to punch through the noise.  Even so, few consumer designs consider their behavior in a larger system of millions of chatty little radios.  Since no one has responsibility for the good behavior of the overall system, Wi-Fi is your basic free for all.  If your Wi-Fi router is interfering with your neighbor’s, he can tell you to do something about it…that is, if he can find you.
Back to femto cells.  Unlike Wi-Fi, femto cells will interact with macro cell towers and other femto cells in close proximity.  As a result, every femto cell must have a means of listening to the environment around it, and then adjusting approprately to mitigate interference.  What does appropriately mean?
It turns out that each femto cell manufacturer will have its own method of mitigating RF interference.  But there is, in fact,  no standard means of doing so at the moment.  Each femto cell producer will have an opportunity to thrive on inventions that outshine the competiton in this area, or crash and burn on something that hardly works at all.  Stay tuned.  The next 12–18 months will be interesting.

I have one, it works, although its predecessors were both killed by lightning strikes when it turned out my phone and (later) cable connections weren't properly grounded.Yes, it does make routers, but it is steadily divorcing from a business that depends on telco or cable connections:NetGear is a fairly controversial issue. Bears have it falling below $32. Bulls have it rising past $42. (Today it's at around $36.50)What it's doing is, simply, transforming the locus of innovation from the PC to the network, and controlling that network. This is something companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have been trying, and failing to do for years, mainly by building TVs or “home media servers.”NetGear is using your existing stuff and building peripherals that turn your existing WiFi data stream into the backbone of everything the TV and PC guys were trying to do. Only it's easier, and cheaper. And once NetGear has these high-bandwidth applications set up, can low bandwidth ones be far behind? Home automation, home inventory, medical and security applications, with single-chip systems as the clients and either your existing PCs or a NetGear server at the center?I think it's possible. Once the current boom in stock prices turns into a bust, maybe later this week, this will be one of the companies on my buy list.

Goldberg adds that “for the moment, the pricing environment also remains relatively benign.”Goldberg says the consumer business has stabilized, although he sees little upside, noting that visibility is poor, and that retailers “have yet to fully engage on their plans for Q4 orders.” Enterprise demand remains particularly weak, he says, consistent with corporate IT trends in other product categories. Goldberg says that for the company to outperform this year, it would need to see stronger end demand. But he also says Q4 results should at least be up from a “disastrous” quarter a year ago.Goldberg is hardly a bull on the stock; he says long-term trends remain challenging. That said, he did up estimates significantly. For Q2, he goes to 21 cents a share, from 18 cents. For 2009, he now sees 85 cents a share, up from 60 cents. And for 2010, he goes to $1.09, from 55 cents. He is now WAY ahead of the Street at 30 cents for this year and 73 cents for next year.NTGR Monday is up 99 cents, or 6.7%, to $15.74.Original post"
716411,30811,2012-07-12T03:09:04-04:00,,"Shares of NETGEAR, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTGR) have a flat year-to-date performance. At $33.45 per share, the stock is trading at 5.2x the NTM EBITDA and 11.3x the NTM EPS, positioning for a possibly substantial upside based on the following five reasons:1. Netgear is over-discounted relative to its growth potential. Analysts predict a solid growth ahead with revenues, EBITDA, and EPS estimated to rise at a two-year CAGR of 14.8%, 15.4%, and 8.3%, respectively, over the current and next fiscal years. That results in a low PEG of just 0.6x.2. Netgear is also undervalued relative to its peers. Compared with other major network equipment providers in the U.S. (see below), Netgear's growth potential is relatively at par, as the estimated EBITDA growth is fairly in line, and the better revenue growth likely offsets the impact from a slower EPS growth. Although the firm has slightly lower profitability margins, its investment return metrics such as ROE and ROIC are substantially higher.In addition, Netgear has a healthy liquidity position as it carries no debt and the high levels of current and quick ratios reflect a liquid balance sheet. One thing should be noted that about 29.1% of the $1.27B market capitalization is actually in cash. As such, the stock should at least warrant an in-line valuation. Nevertheless, the current price of $33.45 implies a substantial 19.7% valuation discount to both the peer average P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples (see below), which appear to be overblown.Click to enlarge3. NTGR has a proven record of beating market expectations. Over the past five quarters, it has consistently beaten revenue, EBITDA, and EPS estimates by sizable surprises (see below).4. Most of the financial estimates have solid upward revisions over the past 12-18 months, reflecting analysts' increasing confidence in the company's prospects (see below).5. Analysts are generally bullish on the stock. Of the 8 performance ratings, there are 1 strong buy, 4 buys, and 3 holds. BWS Financial upgraded the rating to strong buy from buy in April. Barclays has also recently raised its rating to overweight from equal weight and target price to $45 from $40 citing that the firm is positioned well for the European market and will likely experience a solid demand going forward.For all of the above reasons, I strong recommend acquiring the shares at the current price or selling out-of-money put options to establish a long position.Comparable analysis table is created by the author, all other tables are sourced from Capital IQ, and all financial data is sourced from Morningstar, Thomson One, and Capital IQ.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in NTGR over the next 72 hours."

Netgear (NASDAQ:NTGR) is one of the leaders in this business as it manufactures all kinds of gateways, routers and access point devices for data traffic. The company prides itself on creativity and typically rolls out 12 new products each quarter according to IBD. Products introduced less than 12 months ago typically make up a quarter of the firms revenue. The stock got beat up after the last quarters announcement. The company fell short of its own revenue projections and although margins were a bit better than expected, the earnings number came in below consensus. This caused a drop of over 23% the morning after the announcement after a strong run in the stock through the spring. Management attempted to assure investors that their expectations for the second half were strong, but it was little consolation for missing in Q2. To break out the announcement, there were a few key points to analyze. First, is that the decline was primarily in North America and the Europe, Mid East, and Africa [EMEA], while the Asia Pacific area was strong. Unfortunately Asia Pacific makes up only 11% of sales so that was not enough to offset the other geographies. The second interesting point is that inventories picked up substantially. When asked about this level, management noted that it was to ramp up ahead of the upcoming back to school season. However, the inventory levels were also up compared to last Q2 which should have also accounted for back to school inventories. It is more likely that the company manufactured more products than they were able to sell which could become a problem if technology evolves or prices drop and the company is sitting on stale product. Good sides to the earnings call included some contracts landed with cable and telephone companies who install internet accessibility in consumer homes. Relationships like these allow the company to reach a greater number of clients without spending as much on direct marketing. These new contracts were in Australia, Japan and Germany and the company hopes these will add significantly to sales in the second half. The balance sheet is firm with significant cash reserves even after spending $60m to acquire Infrant. This acquisition gives the company access to networked storage devices made by Infrant. These new products should be a good complement to the other network devices offered by NTGR. My major concern is that the company pushed back growth targets for this year into the second half but management is still optimistic and does not believe the weak sales indicates a long-term problem. Turbulence in the global economic environment will likely weigh down the consumer (not just in N. America, but also in the EMEA regions) which casts a doubt on a rebound in sales. This environment has not been conducive to new small business spending or to consumer spending which could significantly affect the outlook. This is true about many consumer electronic companies but NTGR has already shown weakness even before the true economic weakness began. I would counsel investors to lighten up on NTGR positions as the outlook remains uncertain. Current investors appear to be taking a “show me” attitude and it will likely take several strong quarters to regain their confidence. In the meantime, any negative surprises could cause swift selling in the stock. Disclosure: Author has a short position in NTGR NTGR 1-yr chart"

BitTorrent is one of the pioneers in peer-to-peer technology to deliver videos. Today, there are still a number of BitTorrent users - the company has 135 million members, I'm told by co-founder Ashwin Navin -- who use the site for illegal downloads. In my interview with Navin, he talks about how BitTorrent is trying to combat piracy with its new partnership with Netgear. The store launches on Feb. 5, and will cost $200 per box.

As I noted last weekend, the company announced several products, include a dual-mode cordless phone that supports Skype. But it’s big launch was its digital media adapter, a product it calls the Digital Entertainer HD, which is designed to route digital media content from wherever it is stored in your house to whatever screens you want to display it on. 
The box can handle both digital music and high-def video, and includes selected content from the Web, including YouTube and a selection of Internet radio stations. If you have a PC with a TV card, you can also use it as for digital video recording, with the programming residing on your PC. (It has no storage of its own.)
At the time of the announcement, with the Steve Jobs keynote still two days away, the company declined to compare its device to Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iTV AppleTV box, which has some similar functionality. But by Wednesday, when I sat down to talk to NetGear CEO Patrick Lo, the Apple news was out. And that made the device fair game.
You will not be surprised to learn that Lo thinks his $349 Home Entertainer HD box is a lot better than the $299 Apple TV box.
That said, Lo had some kind words for the iPhone.
I asked Lo whether consumers were going to be able to handle to complicated networking involved in setting up the new Netgear box. He says the company is aware of those concerns, and will partner with Best Buy’s (NYSE:BBY) Geek Squad and similar installation services at other consumer electronics retailers.
NetGear, of course, is better known as a networking equipment company, makes routers, hubs and other gear for both consumers and businesses. The company’s traditional networking products are still 85% of its revenue, Lo says, with 15% from newer products like media adapters and phones; he says the “new stuff” could be 30%-35% of the total three years from now.
Lo declined to give any forecast on how the company might perform in 2007. Lo notes that he previously forecast guidance for 2006 of 25%-28% growth; he did say that the home and small-business networking market in 2007 should growth at comparable rates as in 2006, and he expects the company to continue to take market share. Lo says the company will report results in mid-February."

In fact, they specifically said that they were not making any announcements about their relationship with YouTube; not sure what that means. ADDENDUM: A couple of other things about the Digital Entertainer product after talking to NetGear execs. One, the lack of Mac support will bother some iTunes users, no doubt. Also interesting that they won’t talk about any relationship with YouTube; at this point they do not support other streaming video sites. Access to the YouTube content is via a remote-control driven menu. The service also hooks to Internet radio services, including Shoutcast and Radio IO; they both apparently have open systems and there isn’t any reason NetGear should need to partner. The device also supports RSS feeds, and has some news feeds from Yahoo pre-loaded. They declined to compare the device to the Apple iTV, which should be discussed at Macworld on Tuesday.

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Nutanix (NTNX), the hyperconverged infrastructure company that is in the process of transforming itself from a hardware-based appliance product into a pure software company, may be on the path to a rebound. All eyes have been on Nutanix's subscription Billings this year, especially with the fear that the coronavirus would cause large companies to pull back on their IT infrastructure spending. After slogging through several painful quarters of slow/no growth, however, Nutanix has recently released strong fiscal third-quarter results showing an acceleration in billings. And despite having risen ~70% from Nutanix's all-time lows notched in March, the stock still remains a healthy ~30% down year-to-date:Data by YChartsI advised caution on Nutanix in April when the stock was trading in the high teens, but now that we've seen Nutanix's strong third quarter, it's a good time for investors to re-evaluate the bullish thesis in this stock. The main points are namely that:At current share prices near $23, Nutanix trades at a market cap of $4.58 billion. After netting off the $736.1 million of cash and $482.2 million of debt on Nutanix's balance sheet (one of the other points we like about Nutanix is the fact that its balance sheet is loaded with liquidity, giving it plenty of flexibility in a challenging year), we arrive at an enterpise value of $4.33 billion. Versus Wall Street's $1.30 billion revenue consensus for the year, that's a valuation multiple of just 3.3x EV/FY20 revenue - hardly where most software companies trade, suggesting investors' perception of Nutanix still hasn't shifted toward its growing software model. Given the glimmer of strength we've seen in Nutanix's execution throughout Q3 (the first coronavirus-impacted quarter), we're ready to go long on Nutanix again.Let's now parse through Nutanix's latest quarterly results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Nutanix 3Q20 resultsSource: Nutanix 3Q20 earnings release Nutanix's revenue of $318.3 million (+11% y/y) edged out over Wall Street's expectations of $314.5 million (+9% y/y) by a solid two-point margin. Billings, of course, is Nutanix's key metric now as a subscription company. See the breakdown of revenue versus billings in the table below:Figure 2. Nutanix billingsSource: Nutanix 3Q20 earnings release Nutanix billed $383.5 million in the quarter, representing +11% y/y growth. Note that this is on the high end of Nutanix's guided range of $365-$385 million (5-11% y/y growth range). Considering that Nutanix offered this view in late February, before the global impacts of the coronavirus were truly known, I'd consider this an overachievement. Note as well that subscription billings present 84% of the total, up twenty points from 64% in the year-ago quarter - while the legacy hardware and non-portable software components continue to decline. The fact that more and more of Nutanix's billings are coming from recurring sources gives us confidence that should there be another demand shock like the coronavirus. Here's some useful demand commentary from CEO Dheeraj Pandey. Though Nutanix saw some volatility like other companies, the company also benefited from an increase in VDI usage due to the transition to remote work. Per Pandey's prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call:Several other points are worth highlighting. Nutanix is preparing to convert its sales compensation model to more closely align to its present subscription-oriented state. Per CFO Duston Williams, ""starting in the first half of FY ‘21 we will move to either a partial or full ACV sales comp model. This is the first step in setting up a comp structure to take advantage of the natural leverage a subscription model affords."" This compensation change may help to both drive additional subscription sales as well as draw operating leverage. Also per Williams' prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call, ""We exceeded our pipeline generation goal for Q3 that was set before the quarter started."" This sets Nutanix up strongly for a big Q4 and Q1 as demand recovers as normalization continues around the world. On the cost front, the disappointing element is the fact that Nutanix's pro forma operating losses grew to -$133.3 million, versus -$104.8 million in the year-ago quarter, despite a 370bps improvement in pro forma gross margins (thanks to the richer subscription mix). We note, however, that Nutanix has taken some steps to reduce costs in the wake of the coronavirus (cutting exec salaries by 10%, and furloughing most employees for two weeks) and that the ""natural leverage"" inherent in the subscription model should help Nutanix in its path to profitability. We note as well that Nutanix's pro forma EPS of -$0.69 also still beat Wall Street's mark of -$0.86 for the quarter. There's a lot to like about Nutanix as it gears up for a rebound. Billings are recovering, the sales pipeline is healthy, and the conversion from a hardware appliance company to a subscription-based software service is continuing strong. Buy Nutanix on the upswing."
4377567,104099,2020-10-05T07:54:12-04:00,"I have been bearish on Nutanix for some time. I thought I'd check in to see if the shares now represent good value. They don't.There's a strong negative correlation between revenue and net income here. There's nothing to suggest this will change. In spite of this, the shares remain expensive.I think the options market represents the best (forgive the pun) option for people who wish to remain long here.","It’s been just over a year since I wrote my latest bearish piece on Nutanix Inc. (NTNX). Since then, the shares are down about 12.25% against a gain of 13.8% for the S&P 500. This is on top of a loss of 58.5% from the time I wrote my first bearish piece on the name. The fact is, though, that every business has some value embedded in it. I think markets overreact to good news on the upside and to bad news on the downside, and it may be the case that the shares represent excellent value. Also, the company has another year of financial history that’s worthy of commentary. A stock that is trading at $22.25 has a much different level of risk than one that was trading at $25.35, so should I switch from bearish to bullish on this name?You may not be a busy crowd, dear readers, but you may be able to think of a few thousand things that are more fun to do than reading my article about a specific company. For that reason, I’ll reiterate the general point made by the title of this article along with the bullet points above. The problems that I referenced in my earlier articles linger. Specifically, it seems that the more this company sells, the more it loses.In fact there’s a very strong negative correlation (r=-.85) between sales and net income. There’s nothing that I can spot on the horizon that will change this multi-year dynamic. In spite of this, the shares remain quite expensive in my estimation. I think investors would be wise to avoid this name. That said, I think the crowd can drive these shares higher. For people who want to maintain a long position, I think options make the most sense here.There’s much to like about the financial situation here, obviously. First, over the past eight years, the company has managed to grow revenue at an eye-watering CAGR of 106%. Gross profit growth has also been impressive, having grown at a CAGR of 93% over the same time period. Also, I think the capital structure is in very solid shape, as evidenced by the fact that cash and short-term securities are about twice the value of the convertible notes outstanding. Finally, the per share loss has grown at a CAGR of “only” 3.6%.Unfortunately, that’s where the relatively good news ends. Investors aren’t compensated with sales; they’re compensated with whatever cash is left over after all of the suppliers, landlords, research scientists, salespeople and every other source of cost is paid. The problem that I’d noted in the past seems to persist here. Specifically, it seems that the more this company sells, the greater are its losses.So as sales have grown at a remarkable pace, so too have losses. Specifically, losses have grown at a CAGR of about 27% over the same time period. I ran a correlation analysis on revenue and net income and found a very strong (r=-.85) correlation between the two. This demonstrates a persistent relationship that is harmful to shareholders: the more this company sells, the greater are its losses over time. It’s easy enough to spot the culprits here.In support of the growth of the business, sales and marketing expenses, R&D, and general and administrative expenses grew at CAGRs of 49%, 44.5%, and 43.4% respectively. This suggests to me that the company is on the financial equivalent of a hamster wheel. In order to support growing sales, it must spend ever-growing amounts on those things that attract customers. This prompts two questions of the bullish case here:These two questions are fundamental in my opinion. As far as I can tell, no one has answered these, and I eagerly await any feedback from bulls in the comment section.Finally, the reason that EPS losses have grown at a rate of only 3.6% is because of the massive dilution that investors have been exposed to over the years. Since 2013, the number of shares outstanding has grown at a CAGR of about 22%. Dilution is troublesome, too.Source: Company filingsJust because I think there’s little reason to hope that this company will turn profitable anytime soon doesn’t mean there’s no value here. As I’ve written repeatedly (and no doubt tiresomely), a great business can be a terrible investment at the wrong price, and a mediocre business can be a great investment at the right price. In my view, the price paid for a given investment is the single biggest variable in determining investment returns, and for that reason I need to write about the stock as a thing distinct from the business.Because there’s an inverse relationship between the price paid for a stream of future cash flows and the returns on those cash flows, I want to try to determine whether the shares are expensive or cheap. Cheap is better. I measure whether a stock is cheap in a few ways, ranging from the simple to the more complex. On the simple side, I look at the ratio of price to some measure of economic value, like earnings, free cash flow, and the like. There are obviously no earnings to speak of in this case, so I’ll look at the ratio of price to cash from operations. There is one advantage of this ratio and a few disadvantages. The advantage is the fact both numbers are positive at the moment.The downside is that CFO obviously adds back some significant charges, and includes figures that may give an excessively rosy assessment of the firm’s financial health, per the following from the latest 10-K.10-KFor more, feel free to check out page 86 of the latest 10-K, as it’s a real page-turner.In my view, cash from operations is a much more “generous” measure of a company’s earnings generating capacity because it adds back things like depreciation, in spite of the fact that depreciation and amortization represent real economic costs, especially for a company like this one. Stock- based compensation is obviously an expense that impacts shareholders, though it’s obviously “added back” to earnings to come up with cash from operations. Perhaps most strange is the fact that $262 million in deferred revenue is added to cash from operations. Remember that deferred revenue involves the company receiving cash today for services that it’ll have to deliver in the future. Where I come from that’s called an “obligation,” but it’s added back to cash from operations.So, because of these three items, cash from operations is ~$505 million higher than it would otherwise be. I consider this somewhat ridiculous, but as I wrote above, at least it allows for a positive figure to compare price to.As we can see from the chart below, at this time last year this ratio of price to cash from operations was about 126 times.Data by YChartsSource: YChartsAt the moment, the ratio of price ($22.25) to CFO/share ($.50) is just under 45 times. I consider this to be very expensive, but I will admit that 45 times this inflated number is much better than 126 times this inflated number. It seems the shares are much cheaper than they were this time last year, which is slightly positive in my estimation.In addition to working out the simple ratio of price to some measure of economic value, I like to try to understand what the market is assuming about a given company’s future. In order to do that, I turn to the work of Professor Stephen Penman and his book “Accounting for Value.” In this book, Penman walks investors through how they might isolate the “g” (growth) variable in a standard finance formula to work out what the market must be assuming about a given company. According to this approach, it seems that the market assumes this company will grow at a perpetual rate of about 15%. I would consider this an optimistic forecast if this company was massively profitable. In the case of this company, though, this forecast seems downright insane in my view.I can understand the challenge faced by someone who remains bullish in the teeth of the continued losses. Such people understand that investors buy the future, and that some of the greatest companies in history incurred losses for years before turning a profit. They may also take some consolation in the fact that losses are less egregious now, and that the stock is relatively less expensive now. Finally, stock prices are more often than not driven by crowd sentiments and there’s no evidence that the crowd has become any more sane recently.While I haven’t been wrong in my assessment of Nutanix yet, I may be underestimating something. To be absolutely clear, I recommend avoiding these shares. For people who wish to remain long here, though, I recommend a solution involving the options market. This solution involves far less risk.Instead of remaining long the shares at current levels, I think the options market is offering generous premia on put options. I think a short put option represents a win-win trade at the moment. If the shares remain above the strike price, the investor simply pockets the (generous) premia. If the shares continue to languish, the investor is obliged to buy, but must do so at a price that’s a significant discount to the current market price. Thus, selling puts represents the opportunity to generate a decent return at a much-reduced level of risk.Specifically, I think people who want to maintain some exposure to Nutanix would be wise to sell any shares they own and also sell the April Nutanix puts with a strike of $17.50. These are currently bid-asked at $3.05-$3.15. If the investor simply takes the bid on these, and the shares remain above $17.50, they’ll enjoy a very nice return over the next 6 ½ months. If the shares languish, as I suspect they will actually, the investor will be obliged to buy, but will do so at a net price ~35% below the current market price.Now that you’re hopefully intrigued by the “win-win” character of short puts, dear reader, it’s time for me to revert to type and disappoint you by writing about risk. The nature of the world is such that we must choose between a host of imperfect trade-offs, as there's no ""risk-free"" option. Short puts are no different in this regard. We do our best to navigate the world by exchanging one pair of risk-reward trade-offs for another. For example, holding cash presents the risk of erosion of purchasing power via inflation and the reward of preserving capital at times of extreme volatility. The risks of share ownership should be obvious to readers on this forum.I think the risks of put options are very similar to those associated with a long stock position, actually. If the shares drop in price, the stockholder loses money, and the short put writer may be obliged to buy the stock. Thus, both long stock and short put investors typically want to see higher stock prices.Puts are distinct from stocks in that some put writers don't want to actually buy the stock - they simply want to collect premia. Such investors care more about maximizing their income and will, therefore, be less discriminating about which stock they sell puts on. These people don't want to own the underlying security. I like my sleep far too much to play short puts in this way. I'm only willing to sell puts on companies I'm willing to buy at prices I'm willing to pay. For that reason, being exercised isn't the hardship for me that it might be for many other put writers.My advice is that if you are considering this strategy yourself, you would be wise to only ever write puts on companies you'd be happy to own. I feel that I need to repeat the point that I made earlier. I don’t recommend owning Nutanix at any price, and so for that reason I will not be selling puts on it. Short put options are only viable in this case as an alternative to actual share ownership.In my view, put writers take on risk, but they take on less risk (sometimes significantly less risk) than stock buyers in a critical way. Short put writers generate income simply for taking on the obligation to buy a business that they like at a price that they find attractive. This circumstance is objectively better than simply taking the prevailing market price. This is why I consider the risks of selling puts on a given day to be far lower than the risks associated with simply buying the stock on that day.I'll conclude this rather long discussion of risks by indulging my tendency toward tedious repetition, and I'll use the trade I'm currently recommending as an example. An investor can choose to buy Nutanix today at a price of ~$22.50. Alternatively, they can generate a credit for their accounts immediately by selling put options that oblige them - under the worst possible circumstance - to buy the shares at a net price about 35% below today's level. Buying the same asset at a discount is the definition of lower risk.If you would not be content making “only” $3.05 while tying up $17.50 in capital for six months, and you want to get a bit more sophisticated, you might consider using the put premia you generate to buy call options that give you most of the upside of the stock. For reference, the April Nutanix call with a strike of $22.50 is bid-asked at the moment for $4.20-$5.10. If the investor simply takes the ask on these, they will have access to most of the upside for the shares over the next 6 ½ months. They will also only have ~23% of the capital at risk. I consider having most of the upside while exposing only 23% of the capital to be an ideal situation. To repeat, I don’t recommend any exposure to Nutanix. I recommend selling puts and (perhaps) buying calls on this name the most viable way to gain exposure on the long side.I've been writing about Nutanix for a while, and I've never found much to like about the business. Shareholders have been diluted massively over the past several years, and there seems to be nothing on the horizon to suggest that that will stop. It seems the necessary precondition to sales growth has been massive cost growth, and there seems to be nothing on the horizon to suggest that that will stop. In spite of these troubles, the shares remain quite expensive on a cash from operations basis. On the ""plus"" side, these shares are less expensive than they were last year, but they remain objectively pricey in my estimation. Also, I would note that cash from operations isn't a good proxy for the cash that's available to shareholders, as it adds back too many items.All of that said, I understand that there are certain shareholders who have a greater level of faith than I do. They understand that the crowd can drive shares higher in the short term. For such people, I would recommend selling put options as a great way to maintain some exposure here while generating credits for their accounts. There may be less return with this approach if the crowd suddenly drives these shares higher, but there's certainly less risk too."
4378349,104608,2020-10-09T10:57:08-04:00,"Nutanix reported Q4 revenue better than expectations with subscription revenue representing 87% of quarterly revenue.In 2020, subscription revenue represented nearly 80% of total revenue, growing nearly 60%, which bodes well for higher visibility and more recurring revenue.Valuation appears dislocated with the stock trading at only ~2.8x my estimated 2021 subscription revenue.","Even after reporting a better than expected quarter in addition to Bain investing $750 million for growth initiatives, Nutanix (NTNX) has seen their stock continue to pull back. Q4 revenue grew only 9%, though subscription revenue, which represented 87% of Q4 revenue, grew an impressive 65%. Investors should start to pay more more attention to subscription revenue growth since this will drive the company forward over the long-term.In addition, the $750 million investment from Bain could help NTNX invest more into their growth opportunities. By recently becoming FedRAMP certified, NTNX has a greater ability to sell directly to the federal government, whose contracts tend to be stickier and long-term. In addition, NTNX has a significant growth opportunity internationally and the Bain investment could help kickstart the initiative to expand overseas.Data by YChartsAfter quickly popping over 30% after stronger than expected quarterly earnings and the $750 million Bain investment, the stock has retracted quite a bit and is now down slightly since earnings. With the stock still down nearly 35% year to date and valuation now ~2.8x my estimated 2021 subscription revenue, I believe long-term investors should be optimistic about building a position.Subscription revenue was nearly 80% of 2020 revenue and 87% of Q4 revenue, meaning this revenue stream is likely to represent around 90% of revenue in 2021. With a majority of their revenue now being highly visible and recurring, revenue growth will become more stable and faster. When comparing NTNX to other subscription-based companies, their forward revenue multiple of only ~3.2x is cheap and long-term investors should take advantage of this dislocation.During Q4, revenue grew over 9% to $327.9 million, which was nicely above expectations for ~$319.5 million. Nutanix continues to push forward on the journey to becoming a subscription-based company, with subscription revenue now representing 87% of total revenue, up from 65% in the year ago period.Source: Company PresentationSince moving to subscription revenue, the company has seen their revenue growth drastically decelerate and share price take a huge hit. For subscription-based companies, investors are very focused on billings growth. While total company billings only grew 5% during the quarter, subscription billings grew an impressive 29% to $341 million and represented 88% of total billings.Source: Company PresentationGross margin came in at 83.0%, which was above the 80.0% seen in the year ago period. The company also generated $3.6 million in operating cash flow, and while this is still far away from normalized levels, this was better than the -$9.7 million operating cash flow loss in the year ago period.One important aspect of the company is their ability to maintain customer success, even during more challenging economic conditions. At the end of Q4, the company had 17,360 customers, including 920 in the Global 2000 and maintained an impressive 96% customer retention rate. Some key Global 2000 wins in just the last quarter include AIB Group, Cadence Design Systems, Dongfeng Renault, MayBank Singapore, and QBE Insurance. I believe the company's ability to maintain their strong customer base will help with investor confidence in longer-term revenue growth.The two other big changes to the company were the announcement of the company's CEO, Dheeraj Pandey, intent to retire from the company. The company is currently conducting a search effort to identify the replacement CEO. In the meantime, Dheeraj will remain Chairman and CEO until the new CEO is selected and appointed.In addition, Nutanix also announced a $750 million investment from Bain Capital Private Equity in the form of convertible notes. Nutanix intends to use these proceeds to invest in their growth initiatives, which could ultimately lead to a higher revenue and billings growth rate over the long-term.The $750 million capital investment from Bain provides a strong base of capital to invest for long-term revenue growth. In recent quarters, NTNX achieved their FedRAMP certification, thus enabling them to sell directly to the US federal government. This is just one area of growth that NTNX could invest in via the funds received from Bain. In addition, the company will continue to invest in expanding their revenue base internationally. Now that they have moved past the license model, the company will look to grow more in international markets, which remains a relatively small portion of the company's current revenue.This is a rather large investment for a company whose market cap is just over $4 billion. I believe this also signifies Bain's confidence in the long-term prospects of Nutanix and believes by investing a lot in the near-term, this will result in higher growth rates in the future.In addition, Bain was also given two seat on the company's Board, which will be filled by David Humphrey and Max de Groen. With the investment and Board changes expected to become effective in September, the company could potentially start to see benefits in early 2021.For the past several quarters, this transitioned has put a lot of pressure on the company's growth numbers, primarily revenue and billings. Legacy license revenue would be a large upfront revenue input, which ultimately helped improve revenue growth. However, subscription revenues have much higher visibility and are more recurring, thus providing more stable cash flows. While the company is largely behind this massive transition in operating models, I believe the company remain undervalued given current valuation levels.With the company become nearly 90% subscription-based in terms of revenue and billings, I believe the company should start trading like other subscription-based companies. In the past, companies like Adobe (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), and Splunk (SPLK) have transitioned from legacy license/hardware companies into subscription-based companies. All three are examples of stocks now trading at higher revenue multiples, given the highly recurring and visible nature of their revenue streams.Data by YChartsThe company has a current market cap of $4.30 billion and with ~$910 million of cash/investments and ~$460 million of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$3.85 billion.While the company did not provide formal guidance for the year, management did note they expect run-rate ACV to grow in excess of 20% in Q1 2021, which compares to run-rate ACV of 29% growth in Q4. During fiscal 2020, subscription revenue was $1.03 billion, representing just under 80% of total revenue and grew and impressive 59%. Given the rapid transition to subscription revenue and the company's focus on this, I decided to only value the subscription revenue when determining valuation.Assuming the $1.03 billion of subscription revenue remains healthy and grows another 35% in 2021, the company could see subscription revenue of nearly $1.40 billion. Using the current enterprise value of ~$3.85 billion, this implies a 2021 EV/subscription revenue multiple of only 2.75x. Typically, a company with over 80% of revenue being subscription in addition to 80%+ gross margins would receive a higher valuation multiple. Compared to the above peer group, NTNX's stock screens very well.I believe the two biggest things holding NTNX back are negative operating margins resulting in weak cash flow and minimal revenue growth over the past several quarters. The low revenue growth can be explained by the company's decision to transition away from license/hardware revenue. However, investors will continue to look for operating margins to expand before placing a higher revenue multiple for valuation purposes.Given the continued pullback since the company reported earnings, I believe long-term investors should look to add to their positions as the company remains poised for strong long-term revenue growth and margin expansion. The company still has room to grow internationally and within the Global 2000 base (NTNX has 920 customers in the Global 2000). Over time as revenue grows at a higher, more stable level, the company's valuation could also expand.Risks to the company include increased competition from larger players in the market. Typically, larger players can offer lower pricing because of their economies of scale, which could cause increased pressure on NTNX's sales group. In addition, valuation can be challenging for companies who are valued on revenue multiples. If the company were to continue to experience low revenue growth and uncertainty remains around their subscription revenue transition, the company's valuation may remain low."
4351272,98236,2020-06-01T10:53:25-04:00,"Nutanix reported the results of its 3rd fiscal quarter on 5/27.The results were a beat-even compared to the preannounced results that were presented in early May.The results were ahead of the guidance presented before the impact of Covid-19 on the economy were incorporated in the company's forecast.The company was able to leverage its ""End User Computing"" capability to facilitate ""work-from-home"" requirements of clients.The company's transition to a complete subscription software model remains well ahead of schedule making headline metrics not useful in estimating trends in terms of growth and market share.","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.I really do not urge readers/subscribers to trade quarters. It is a fool’s game and the house has a pretty substantial advantage. I get to listen to lots of conference calls, and I get to read more. Most of them are not terribly enlightening, but it is part of the job. Nutanix (NTNX) shares must be the most star-crossed of investments with which I have dealt in the past decade. While the company spent a part of 2017-18 in the golden circle of investor adulation, it has since descended to the purgatory of disdain. Oh well.Thursday, however, I thought the disconnect between the reality of the company’s performance and investor perceptions may have reached an apogee. As I wrote this, the shares were down 8% on a day in which many cloud stocks have appreciated (As I edit this the next day, the shares have made back about half of Thursday's loss). Most of the analysts writing about this name say they are neutral because the company hasn’t provided guidance. That this is not a new thing-guidance was withdrawn when the company preannounced an upside in early May, seems of no account. The shares of this company were punished without much reason when the company was amongst the first to suggest that the various impacts of the Covid-19 virus on the economy would present difficulties in the quarter just reported. That turned out to be true, not just for Nutanix, but essentially for almost every other company outside of security and work-at-home in the IT space.The rationale for a negative reaction to the company’s earnings release or conference call presentation is not immediately apparent to this writer. Indeed, the quarter was really a beat and the outlook that was presented was quite positive. Whether or not the company presented explicit guidance is, in my opinion, less important than some of the other data that was presented during the course of the conference call.Yes, I have recommended these shares for more than some time now…it hasn’t been the most fun for either my Ticker Target high growth portfolio or in terms of my professional attainment. One thing about investing is that you are either right or wrong-no real shades of gray. Whether or not the company has progressed, one invests for share price appreciation, and so far that has been elusive for Nutanix. Readers may therefore dismiss my commentary as wishful thinking. But I think that a logical reaction to the conference call I heard would have been share price appreciation-probably of double digits-and not an 8% share price haircut. It seems to have escaped some commentators that the company, on an apples to apples basis, actually reported growth of around 20% last quarter-better than many other companies I follow, own and recommend in their most recent reporting periods.As mentioned, I own a significant position in the Ticker Target High-Growth portfolio. I have no intention of selling any of that position, and if there is an opportunity to up my current percentage (around 3%) I will take it. I urge readers/subscribers to take the same course, but I acknowledge not being the best of guides on this name. So why might I be right at this point, other than being stubborn about an under performing recommendation? For that a bit of context and a bit of review of this recent earnings release is in order.Nutanix is not valued currently as though it has significant growth prospects. When one cuts through all of the commentary about cash burn, pulled guidance and so forth, the reason to own these shares is pretty straight forward: the company was actually able to turn the difficult environment presented by the Covid-19 virus into a challenge that it met, with results better than had been forecast-a clean beat. There are many reasons for that-some have to do with improved sales execution, others have to do with the acceptance of the company’s technology by its installed base, some have to do with work-from-home solutions and others have to do with the company successfully competing. I am not going to try to encompass any kind of detailed synthesis on all of these points - but I think it is hard to deny that all of this isn’t happening. The negative commentary that I have seen is peripheral and doesn’t suggest that the reasons to buy growth stocks are absent.First of all, Nutanix actually did exceed prior expectations for the quarter it reported. Just for a bit of context. At the end of February, as the impacts of the pandemic were just being seen outside of the US, Nutanix reported a strong quarter that showed sales growth significantly greater than its prior guidance and the then level of current expectations. At that time, the company said that it was seeing some negative effects from closed economies in its Asia/Pac region and that its transition to subscription was proceeding more rapidly than planned. This in turn, would put pressure on top-line projections. The result was a share price implosion. The next day after the shares fell 29%, and by the time the shares made their low on March 16th peak to trough fall was 66%. Subsequently the shares recovered, grudgingly, so to speak, and finally reached $20/share, up 60% from their low point, in early May.On May 5th, the company pre-announced preliminary results for revenues and bookings; the results were in line with prior guidance but above the then current First Call consensus. This was despite the fact that the company had to overcome the issues of all enterprise software companies-a selling pivot of material proportions coupled with many customers who themselves are in the midst of a financial crisis, suffering the effects of the current economy.Subsequent to that time, the company announced a series of significant work-from-home wins that were based on the company’s virtual desktop (VDI) and its Desktop as a Service platform. At the time of the preannouncement, the company announced that it was withdrawing guidance for the final quarter of the fiscal year, and was also suspending its calendar 2021 business model targets.Subsequent to May 5th, the company announced a series of wins highlighting its work-from-home solutions and culminating in a win that showcased the impact of installing its hyper-converged software to improve the performance of a major healthcare provider network. From May 5th through last evening, the share appreciated by 40%, basically catching up to broader IT indices. At this point, after the current pullback, the shares are down 25% YTD, which compares to a gain of 13% for the IGV index, and 23% YTD appreciation for the cloud index.The earnings that were announced were a noteworthy beat. The EPS loss was of $.69/per share was $.17 better than the prior consensus. The growth metrics were all marginally better then pre-announced levels. Specifically, the company achieved 18% growth in TCV (Total Contract Value) revenues and 17% growth in TCV billings. The company saw a nice uptick in major customer statistics with the most broad based metric, users with $1 million of spend growing from 850 to 1132 over the past year. The company’s customer base continued to expand with 16,600 name plates on the books up by 700+ from the prior quarter. The company did indeed see a higher proportion of subscription billings than in Q1, reaching 84% of the total up from 79% in the prior quarter and up by 55% in the prior year. It is this very rapid transition that wound up suppressing reported percentage growth by a few hundred basis point-not very different really from the results reported by may other software companies in the midst of similar transitions. Overall, subscription revenue have now reached 82% of the total, significantly greater than had been previously forecast for this point in the transition.The company reported an operating cash burn for the quarter of $85 million, This is consistent with prior expectations. That said, one of the principle driver in operating cash flow, the increase in deferred revenues, rose by $65 million sequentially or 45%. The basic element of the company’s cash burn is the magnitude of Nutanix’s non-GAAP loss. The loss is mainly a product of the rapid transition to subscription revenue which constrains the total revenue metric and detaches the metric from operating expenses. That started to improve (or really to deteriorate less) slightly in Q3; revenues rose by $31 million, or 11%, while opex rose by 14%. I expect that relationship to reverse and improve over the course of the next year. Sequentially, revenue fell by 8% while opex fell slightly.Nutanix shares were down last Thursday in a relatively strong market for tech stocks. The reason is not the company’s performance vs. expectations which was a beat. And it is highly unlikely that the company will run out of cash and need to raise additional capital. Its current cash balance is $732 million; cash burn was $164 million for the first 9 months of the year and is forecast to contract materially. Capex was $72 million through 9 months and should also be lower going forward.Several commentators have called out the pulled guidance as the cause for the weak share price performance. I am not entirely sure why that is so today and was not so on May 5th - that is when guidance was actually pulled and not in this most recent presentation. I have often commented that guidance is not a contract between management and shareholders regarding future results. It is a forecast, and as forecasts relate to the future by definition they are subject to substantial changes. Much of the time, in an effort to avoid explaining a miss, managements choose to offer analysts and investors a forecast that is often terribly unlikely and then when it is exceeded, it simply serves to show that guidance is not really intended to be a forecast but a floor.In the last several years, as subscriptions and their renewal have become the major forms of contractual relations between software vendors and their customers, guidance has become easier, or less subject to operational vagaries. Indeed, when looking at the valuation of software vendors, it is this transition that has been an important factor in bolstering the increase in valuations - software companies these days rarely miss because their “forecasts” are basically predicated on how much revenue they will recognize from the balance sheet. For the most part, a typical subscription company in a given quarter will recognize about 65% of its reported total revenues from the balance sheet, and another 15% or so from long-term consulting arrangement. It is this fact of the current era that explains part of the reason why so many companies can have difficult quarters during this time of the virus, but still report upsides to EPS and even revenues.For some companies, this process has been somewhat preempted by the introduction of ASC 606 which calls for the recognition of 35%-40% of the total value of a subscription arrangement as revenue in the quarter a deal is signed. But as these companies have very large RPO balances, they are still able to absorb several quarters of less than optimal sales performance without an enormous upset in terms of the reported P&L or even in cash flow. That is not exactly where Nutanix finds itself currently. Its transition to subscription is only 18 months old at this point. The company is continuing to build a substantial balance of deferred revenue - it reached $1.06 billion last quarter of which about half is current, but it does not have an RPO balance which allows other companies to forecast during the time of the virus knowing that most of the revenue they are going to report will come either from the balance sheet or from their RPO balance.None of this is new, and none of this hasn’t been discussed time and time again as the company has explained its business model transition. This is not the only company to pass through this kind of transition and I find it less than reasonable for analysts to reach conclusions that they apply inconsistently.I happen to think that the comments that were made by the CFO with regards to a question by the analyst at Morgan, Stanley were more on point than some range of formal guidance might be. As a shareholder, and listening to the presentation and then watching the shares trade, it is a bit frustrating, even though I am really a long term investor. But for readers/subscribers, the disconnect between this answer and the action of the shares is really an opportunity:It is hard to deny that this is a volatile period and that unless a company is taking revenue from its balance sheet and from long-standing consulting contracts, forecasting is going to be more of a guess. But the number of green shoots here is pretty substantial I would say. Million dollar deals closing early in the quarter. Biggest quarter ever for pipeline generation. Sales curve for first month linearity within bounds. EMEA, starting to show a recovery outside of India and China. 2 Fed deals that pushed from Q3 are now closed. Loss rates better than anticipated. AHV is the hypervisor that Nutanix offers as part of its HCI solution. Here is a description of the offering usually called Acropolis: AHV: The Acropolis Hypervisor The fact is that the attach rate for Acropolis has reached 48%, one of the more significant accomplishments in terms of market penetration that Nutanix has delivered. Basically, if AHV is doing well as suggested, then it is highly probable that Nutanix HCI will have a strong quarter as well.I sometimes wonder why this kind of qualitative information cannot be deciphered with ease, and even a bit of precision. I know the above passage and other conference call responses said to me that the tea leaves for Q4 are quite positive. There are some exceptionally modest expectations that are now part of the consensus. One analyst with a hold rating on Nutanix shares is forecasting that sequential growth will be negative in Q4. Another more prominent brokerage is forecasting 4% sequential growth in Q4 and 15% year on year growth for fiscal ’21. Both sets of numbers strike me as basically contradicting the specific evidence as presented in the above quote from the CFO. Dustin Williams has been CFO of Nutanix for 6 years at this point. My own experience with him has been straightforward and positive. I think I can rely both on what he said specifically on the call, and also rely on the rationale he posited for not presenting guidance.As many readers are aware, Nutanix shares peaked in the summer of 2018 at just above $60/share. Since that time, the shares have fallen and risen and fallen and risen more times than a well-managed yo-yo. It isn’t the kind of share price action that makes for comfortable recommendations. There are those who will say that the issue is one of ineffective leadership. No doubt, the wounds the drove the shares down for much of 2019 were partially self-inflicted in terms of sales execution and inadequate sales capacity. But beyond that, this is a company that undertook two transitions and has remade its offering in a span of 2 years or thereabouts. It’s a great vision, but executing everything right has proven to be a bridge too far.The issue, as I see it, is that while this company has had multiple transitions, and inadequate sales capacity and a lack of sales effective sales leadership, much of that is history and the future looks quite different. One reason why Nutanix has been able to pivot successfully is that its technology resonates strongly with large enterprises, and now that it addressing enterprises with an effective selling motion, it is seeing considerable success, despite the ravages of the virus on the economy and on some prospective Nutanix customers. I might have thought that the operational performance reported for Q3, and the qualitative commentary on the call would have driven valuations; that it has not, at this point is an opportunity, even though it pains current shareholders like this writer to watch the trading.I am not going to try to go through all the perturbations that have driven the share price. Obviously, the combination of dropping hardware as a product offering, and then pivoting very hard from a traditional software model has proven to be a bridge too far for some investors. But beyond that, I think many readers, analysts, and even Nutanix shareholders underestimate the level of product initiative this company has undertaken. The fact that the company had a virtual desktop and a desktop as a service offering fired up and ready to go is an artifact of a very complex and elegant product strategy that I believe to be dramatically underappreciated. While many analysts are pointing out that the transition remains very much a work in progress, there is evidence that a strong foundation for sustained hyper growth at scale has been and is being established. For example, the company has a renewal rate in excess of 97% which compares favorably to that of many other infrastructure companies. Of equal importance is the signs of success in “non-core” Nutanix offerings. Last quarter, 28% of customers had bought at least one non-core offering, up from 20% in the prior year. Q3 bookings of non-core products grew 116% year over year and are now 15% of total ACV.I am not going to provide a commercial for all the different offering and choices that a user can access in dealing with Nutanix. The company has tools as diverse as a DevOps offering, a database operations offering called Era, the AHV hypervisor offering mentioned earlier, the Calm offering which facilitates management and governance in the hybrid cloud and the various end user computer offerings which were instrumental in allowing Nutanix to continue to grow despite the impacts of the pandemic on various areas of the company’s business. Trying to compress the non-core offerings to a sentence: the offerings include products for datacenter services, DevOps and desktops which sit on top of the core HCI offering.In sum, the current success that Nutanix is enjoying-and there is no mistake that it is enjoying current success in its sales motion especially in the context of the upside down economy-relates to a very broad and very capable set of products, coupled with a more focused and disciplined selling strategy. Analysts are missing the forest and the sun-filled uplands because of some backward looking underbrush. I expect a couple of analysts will better understand the opportunities offered by these shares when the company provided fiscal 2021 guidance along with its long-term growth expectations when it holds it virtual analyst day sometime after the release of Q4 earnings which should be in late August.Nutanix has one of the lowest relative valuation in terms of EV/S that is available in the IT space today. I have adjusted my estimates for both revenues and growth rate. Indeed, my current estimate for 12 month forward revenue is less than the consensus-and yet based on the company’s commentary, I think that a rational estimate for forward revenues would show that metric greater than the consensus. In any event, my 12 month forward revenue estimate is $1.38 billion which is growth of 11% from the trailing 12 months revenue. That estimate yields an EV/S of 3.2X. If growth comes to the mid-teens level I think more probable, then the EV/S would be around 3.1X.Given the company’s adjusted growth last quarter which really was around 18%, I am estimating a 3 year growth rate of 28% based on a bounce-back in demand as the economy recovers as well as a continued maturation in demand for non-core components of the offering. There have been some commentators who have said that last quarter’s performance was built on the company’s work-from-home portfolio which they believe will decline in importance. Nutanix has been selling its End User solutions for some years, and they have gradually increased in importance. EUS may not always be as large a component of total revenues as was the case in fiscal Q3; the company’s core will grow faster if the economy shows a positive reversal.The value of HCI to users and its likely strong growth has not been impacted by the virus and is not something properly discounted as part of Nutanix growth rate. HCI has been forecast to maintain a 31% CAGR through 2024. I have attached an analysis from IDC of market trends including share and growth for completeness: Dell strengthens HCI market lead over... everyone - Blocks and Files. This material tends to be subjective, and I think its depiction of the share of Nutanix is likely to be incorrect, But given the very high CAGR of HCI, and the technology offered by Nutanix as well as the company’s very high retention rate and the natural progression of its software transition, my confidence in a 28% revenue CAGR is substantial.Of course the other side of valuation is profitability and free cash flow. Looking at that, one sees elevated expense ratios suggesting huge opportunities for the future. Some of the lifting that needs to be done in terms of a sustained path to profitability will happen simply as a result of the maturation of the company’s installed portfolio of subscription software. Renewals which are just now starting to become significant for the company ($5 million of revenue in Q3 and $10 million in the current quarter), carry very high margins almost by definition. Selling hundred of new accounts every quarter is an expensive proposition, and while that will never actually stop, the proportion of revenues coming from new name accounts ought to decline over time, and that will have a material impact on the ratio of sales and marketing which was 73% of revenues on a non GAAP basis last quarter, one of the highest such ratios I have ever seen for a company of this scale. I think that this ratio could readily decline by 2500 basis points over the next two years, and while the company has projected non-GAAP opex comparable to the $390 million level of this latest quarter, I think some of the cost remediation plans the company has planned, will take opex levels down by a noticeable amount in fiscal Q4, and down further in fiscal year 2021. The growth in opex components essentially came to a halt last quarter, with sales and marketing spend declining marginally. Between the continued growth in deferred revenue balances, my expectation that operating losses will decline, and some proactive steps to manage the change in the captions under “other assets and liabilities” I expect to see the company make good on its forecast on a material improvement in cash burn.The Nutanix story got bad, so to speak, over the span of several quarters for many reasons. Its recovery will probably take a few quarters as well. But investors tend to discount future trends rather than waiting for them to happen. That is what I expect here-not just in the immediate term, but over several quarters. I think that is why positive alpha is a likely outcome for the shares."

Nutanix expects to end the year with software and support revenues of $1.29-1.36 billion, falling short of the Street's forecast of $1.395 billion.Over the past few months, Nutanix has been focused on transitioning to a subscription-based model. It is leveraging the subscription services to attract larger enterprise customers to its platform. In the last year, Nutanix has managed to attract 18 customers with lifetime spend of more than $20 million, compared with 12 customers a year ago.It continues to target this enterprise market by expanding its product capabilities. For instance, it is going deeper with application lifecycle management, containers, databases, and object storage within its DevOps product Calm. It is also strengthening its security capabilities by ensuring Zero Trust cyber security for both on-prem and off-prem offerings. Zero Trust security concept operates on the belief that organizations should not automatically trust anything outside or inside its perimeters and that machines and applications are already compromised. It recently hired a Chief Product Security Officer Indu Keri who will focus on encrypting, micro-segmenting, auditing and analyzing everything in an integrated approach to its Zero Trust security posture.Last quarter, it also made generally available its hyperconverged backup product Nutanix Mine with Veeam and HYCU. The integrated data protection solution provides the power of backup software offerings with the benefits of its platform, including HCI for compute and block storage and files and objects for deep storage.Nutanix allows developers to streamline the deployment of new and rebuilt Nutanix clusters using its REST APIs. It offers its developer community access to pre-defined code samples that operate on various languages including Python, C#, PowerShell and others. It, however, does not have an app-based platform strategy that allows developers to create and share apps within a marketplace. I think Nutanix will need to expand its PaaS capabilities to allow the developer community to become more engaged with its product.Its stock is currently trading at $17.79 with a market capitalization of $3.5 billion.

A new CEO is yet to be named.","PNutanix (NTNX), a pioneer in ""hyperconverged infrastructure"" technologies that have purported to transform the modern data center, is undergoing a sea of changes right now. The company, which has an unusual fiscal year-end in June, has just embarked upon its fiscal 2021 with three major announcements:The markets initially reacted positively to the Nutanix news, but since the September selloff shares of Nutanix are down more than 20%:Data by YChartsLet's not mince words here: the near term will not be easy for Nutanix. Wholesale changes are coming for this company. In addition to the departure of a founder/CEO that has made a definite mark and embodied the company, the revision of sales comp comes with a unique set of risks (but also opportunities) that make Nutanix, which is already amid a multi-year shift to becoming a software company, look like a shaky investment.Yet I remain incredibly bullish on Nutanix for two reasons:The chart below, taken from Nutanix's most recent investor deck, showcases its top-tier rankings by two of the most respected reviewers in the software industry:Figure 1. Nutanix technology rankings Source: Nutanix Q4 earnings deckAt current share prices near $21, Nutanix has a market cap of $4.32 billion; after netting off $720 million in cash and $490 million of debt on Nutanix's most recent balance sheet, its enterprise value is $4.09 billion. That represents a multiple of just 3.1x versus Wall Street's current-year revenue estimates of $1.31 billion. In short, despite the fact that Nutanix is more than a decade old and has reached a >$1 billion revenue scale, I still see the company as in the early stages of claiming what Gartner estimates as a $11.5 billion market for HCI products growing at >20% per year.Figure 2. Nutanix market sizeSource: Nutanix Q4 earnings deckStay long here.To get readers who are new to Nutanix up to speed, in the earlier days of Nutanix post-IPO, the company sold a bundled appliance-with software package and charged customers for both the hardware and the software. The software, of course, is where Nutanix made its margins.Over time, however, Nutanix chose to decouple the software from its hardware and now Nutanix is sold as pure software (meaning that customers can deploy Nutanix on their existing data center hardware, which dramatically broadens and simplifies its sales approach). And instead of selling lumpier license deals, Nutanix is now focusing on subscription revenues and becoming a true SaaS play (SaaS conversions have been richly rewarded in the markets - successful ones like Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) have been rewarded by soaring stock prices).Nutanix is taking a step further by announcing a sales compensation change beginning August 1. Here's how CFO Duston Williams, Nutanix's CFO, described the change (key points highlighted) on the Q4 earnings call:It can't be over-emphasized how critical salespeople are to the lifeblood of a software company: they are the workhorses that drive growth. And compensation dramatically changes results: Nutanix believes that rewarding ACV (annual contract value) instead of TCV (total contract value) will help Nutanix bring up its annual subscription values because its salespeople won't be tempted to lower pricing to sign customers.Aside from higher ACV (which could stem from either fewer discounts or bigger opportunities for expansion that come with more frequent renewal terms), the opportunities from this business model shift is also margin-accretive, because Nutanix compensates salespeople less for renewals than for new business. There are also risks, of course: shorter deal terms means that the risk of churn is higher. Net/net, however, I think this shift will generate more growth and more profits for Nutanix.As CFO Williams noted, the ACV compensation shift will certainly reduce contract lengths (because salespeople are now incentivized to get customers to spend as much as possible within a single year rather than spread over a number of years).Optically, this will look unfavorable for Nutanix in the short term. Investors looking at Nutanix in FY21 with minimal context will think the business is struggling, because billings and cash flow will be impacted. On the cash flow side, to finance the near-term cash compression, Nutanix has brought on a high-profile investor in Bain Capital to take on $750 million of Nutanix's convertible notes. To me, I view the Bain investment not only as an infusion of liquidity at a relatively low cost (2.5% in annual interest, and not due until 2026), but also as a vote of confidence from a blue-blooded firm that doesn't often make investments in public entities. I think it's also useful to highlight some positive trends from Nutanix's most recent quarter.We note that the company's Q4 revenue of $327.9 million still grew at 9% y/y despite the pandemic (plus the revenue/billings compression that comes with the license-to-subscription business shift), and beat Wall Street's expectations of $319.4 million (+6% y/y) by a three-point margin.Also impressive: the company managed to continue growing customers, adding 760 new customers in the fiscal fourth quarter (+22% y/y) and adding them at a faster pace than the 700 it gained in Q3, despite a full quarter of pandemic impact.Figure 3. Nutanix customer growthSource: Nutanix Q4 earnings deckNutanix's software subscription shift is also a source of continued gross margin expansion. Though Nutanix's hardware used to be pulled down by hardware, now the company has a best-of-breed software gross margin of 83% (on a pro forma basis), up three points year-over-year:Figure 4. Nutanix gross margin trendsSource: Nutanix Q4 earnings deckThe richness of Nutanix's gross margin - plus hopefully operating leveraged gained on the upcoming sales compensation shift, which will pay out less for renewals - are hopefully a precursor to very strong profitability/cash flows in the medium-term future.Nutanix remains a firm long-term investment in my portfolio due to its technology leadership plus its opportunities for both subscription growth and profit expansion. At ~3x forward revenues, Nutanix can still be bought at ""entry level pricing"" with tremendous long-term upside for patient investors."
4340249,103480,2020-04-27T12:56:10-04:00,"Shares of Nutanix have dropped more than 45% since the start of the year.
        Investors expect the coronavirus to significantly impact Nutanix's demand, interrupting its plan to return to positive y/y growth this year.
        While it's true that new buys of enterprise infrastructure this year will be few, Nutanix's transition toward software and subscriptions helps to soften the blow.
        The company has a significant cash pile to absorb its planned burn.","This year hasn't been too kind for Nutanix (NTNX), the hyperconverged infrastructure vendor that has been struggling over the past year to show investors that it can return to growth despite cutting off hardware sales and focusing on transitioning to a pure software company. Nutanix's ~45% year-to-date losses are far heavier than the ~13% losses in the S&P 500 and ~26% in the Russell 2000, indicating investors' belief that the coronavirus will have an outsized impact on this company:We'll acknowledge that there's substantial risk for Nutanix on the demand side this year. Companies' priorities have shifted this year to conserving cash through the crisis and quickly setting up remote workspaces for their employees - revamping their IT infrastructure to make it run more efficiently and lower the total cost of ownership (which are Nutanix's main sales pitches to companies wanting to modernize their backend) has fallen lower on the totem pole of priorities. But Nutanix's recent shift away from hardware appliance sales to focus on the value proposition of its software - as a subscription service - prepares the company perfectly for this kind of demand shock. And though we believe the company has sufficient cash on its balance sheet to absorb near-term losses, Nutanix is planning to burn significantly more cash this year than last year, which may irk investors in a jittery market; in addition, Nutanix's full-year guidance for 2020 so far only comprehends the impacts of the coronavirus in Asia Pacific. With the myriad uncertainties facing Nutanix this year, I'm revising my previous bullish stance on Nutanix to a cautious one. Given how steeply the shares have fallen since the start of the year, it's not a bad idea to take small bites of Nutanix stock, but I'd wait for more fundamental clarity before fully diving in.Recall that FY20 is a big year for Nutanix to prove that it can return to billings growth. In Q1, Nutanix's billings clocked in at a -1% y/y decay; but more recently in Q2, which is the quarter ending in January, we saw billings accelerate to +4% y/y, a positive sign for recovery this year:Figure 1. Nutanix billings trendsSource: Nutanix Q2 earnings deckAt the time, Nutanix's full-year guidance still planned for a return to growth this year. Its current guidance plan for 2020 (shown in the snapshot below) calls for $1.29-$1.36 billion in revenue (+4% y/y to +10% y/y) and $1.60 to $1.67 billion in billings (+6% y/y to +11% y/y). Figure 2. Nutanix current guidanceSource: Nutanix Q2 earnings releaseNotice that Nutanix's 2020 guidance, as of now, plans for an acceleration in the back half of 2020 in both revenue and billings, which grew in 1H20 at 2% y/y and 1% y/y, respectively. At the time, however, Nutanix had only comprehended the demand-side impacts of the coronavirus in Asia. CFO Duston Williams, in discussing the guidance assumptions on the Q2 earnings call, noted as follows:Now that we know the coronavirus is a global phenomenon (which at this point has hit the U.S. and Europe far harder than China), investors may be in for a shock when Nutanix next revises its guidance. We have one consoling factor, however, in the fact that Nutanix has been raising its subscription mix as a percentage of total revenue and billings. As of the second quarter, Nutanix's subscription billings and revenue mix has hit all-time highs of 79% and 77%, respectively: Figure 3. Nutanix subscription mixSource: Nutanix Q2 earnings deckHowever, we have to point out one caveat. Nutanix's definition of ""subscription"" can be a bit misleading, as some of the revenues that it labels as subscription are actually recognized upfront and not ratably over the course of the contract. As shown in the chart below, term-based subscriptions (including Nutanix's popular 3-year subscription) get upfront revenue treatment, versus SaaS subscriptions which are recognized ratably more akin to other software companies.  Figure 4. Nutanix revenue recognition details Source: Nutanix Q2 earnings deckNevertheless, Nutanix's greater proportion of SaaS billings and much lower hardware and appliance-based deals will help to cushion the blow of any demand slowdown. We would still expect Nutanix's growth to end up being negative when it revises its guidance, however, given the de-prioritization of infrastructure purchases that will hurt Nutanix's new deals; however, the stock's ~45% decline since the beginning of the year seems to already price in this weakness.There's one other big worry on investors' minds throughout the current crisis: Nutanix's cash burn. As Nutanix has invested into transitioning into a software company and building out a larger sales team, it has continued to burn more cash like a traditional SaaS company. In FY19, Nutanix burned through -$76.3 million in free cash flow, though it had managed positive FCF of $30.2 million in the previous year.This year's planned free cash flow losses, however, are far steeper. Duston Williams, Nutanix's CFO, noted back in February that the company roughly planned for -$250 million in free cash flow burn this year - substantially higher than its FCF losses last year. And with revenue expected to compress this year from the impact of the coronavirus (especially from new term license deals that would bring in large amounts of upfront revenue/cash), we would expect FCF to trend directionally worse than -$250 million this year.The good news - Nutanix's balance sheet is well-capitalized:Figure 5. Nutanix 2Q20 balance sheetSource: Nutanix Q2 earnings releaseAs of the end of January, Nutanix has $819.0 million of cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, against $474.3 million of convertible debt that's not due until January 2023 and bears 0% interest (the conversion rate is set at $48.85 per share, nearly 3x today's share price - making conversion/dilution unlikely, and a cash repayment the more likely scenario). This gives Nutanix a net cash balance of $344.7 million, which should be more than sufficient to float Nutanix through an extended downturn. There's no better way to describe Nutanix's current state than to say it's a mixed bag. Yes, the company's greater mix of software/subscription sales will help to dull the impacts of a virus-driven demand slowdown, but the company's prevailing use of upfront term licenses means that growth is still likely to turn negative. And while Nutanix is well-funded with cash, higher cash burn in FY20 may unnerve cautious investors.The good news is that, with Nutanix having shed nearly half of its value (~$3 billion in market cap) since the start of this year, a lot of this weakness seems to already be priced in. I'd wait for more fundamental clarity and evidence of a rebound before overweighting this stock in my portfolio, however."
4350826,104608,2020-05-29T10:17:05-04:00,"Nutanix reported revenue and billings growth of 11% during the quarter, though subscription revenue grew an impressive 55% and represents ~82% of total revenue.
        The company did not provide updated guidance given the uncertainties in the market due to the global pandemic.
        When looking at a forecasted FY21 subscription revenue, the stock currently trades at only ~3.3x, which is cheap compared to other software peers.","Despite posting a strong quarter in terms of subscription revenue and billings growth, Nutanix (NTNX) saw their stock fall just under 10% the day after earnings. Q3 revenue and billings both grew 11% and came in ahead of expectations, though lower than expected profitability and no FY20 revenue guidance likely pushed the stock lower.The company continues to move along their transition to a subscription based revenue model, shedding legacy hardware and license revenue streams. While this will ultimately make their revenue model more recurring and predictable, it has caused revenue growth to be minimal in the past several quarters. Investors have punished the stock significantly and is down nearly 70% since their 2018 high.As the company continues on their transition, I believe revenue growth will start to meaningfully accelerate as the subscription revenue base becomes a larger portion of overall revenue. In addition, this revenue stream comes with higher gross margins, as signified by the 80%+ gross margin during the quarter, which I believe will become the new sustainable level.The stock was pushed down nearly 10% the day following earnings as investors saw lower profitability and no guidance for the remainder of the year. Given the uncertainty in the economy given the global pandemic, I believe companies should be given a pass for not providing guidance and there is too much unknowns in the marketplace.While revenue growth does remain below other software players, the company posted subscription revenue growth of 55% during the most recent quarter. This revenue stream now represents 82% of the company’s total revenue and is one area investors will continue to focus on. I believe right now, this is the only revenue stream that should matter considering the company is actively transition to subscription revenue and is moving away from hardware and license revenue.With the stock now trading at only ~3.3x a forecasted FY21 subscription revenue, which gives no credit to hardware and license revenue, I believe there is a lot of long-term value in this name. As the company’s revenue stream becomes more recurring and predictable, margins could start to expand, and investors could start to place a higher valuation multiple on the name.During the quarter, revenue growth showed some strength at 11% to $318.3 million, which was above expectations for ~$315 million. The company continues to move beyond their transition away from selling hardware and more towards a subscription-based model. This was evident as software and support revenue grew 18% to $314.5 million and represented almost all of the company’s revenue during the quarter. With hardware now represented a somewhat immaterial amount of revenue, the company will be able to re-accelerate their revenue growth given stronger software subscription growth.Over the past several quarters, the company’s software and support revenue has been negatively impacted by the company transitioning to a subscription model instead of license. With their historical license model, the revenue would be received upfront, thus would be more volatile and less predictable. The new subscription based model will not only be all software, but it will become more recurring and visible, which investors have historically placed higher valuation multiples on. During the quarter subscription revenue increased 55% to $261 million.Source: Company PresentationDespite the company seeing revenue growth remaining very minimal over the past several quarters given the ongoing transition, I believe NTNX has done a great job. Just one year ago, 65% of the company billings were subscription-based, compared to 84% during the recent quarter. In addition, subscription revenue now represents 82% of total, up from 59% in the year ago period. This move will ultimately pan out as the company becomes less dependent on hardware sales and license software sales.Billings for the quarter grew 11% to $383.5.0 million with subscription billings increasing 17% to $379.7 million, representing nearly all of the company’s billings. Now that the company is largely behind their transition, investors will start to focus on the higher subscription growth trends. These trends could continue to persist in the next several quarters given the global pandemic has likely caused more companies to invest in cloud-based software solutions, rather than relying on traditional hardware products.Source: Company PresentationGross margin has also considerably improved as the company moves away from hardware revenue. During the most recent quarter, gross margin came in at 80.7%, up from the 77.1% in the year ago period. The improvement is largely attributed to the company's transition to a subscription model, and I believe the 80%+ gross margin is sustainable as other software subscription models tend to have similar gross margins given the lack of product expense from hardware related sales.The stronger than expected revenue and improved margins during the quarter led to a non-GAAP EPS loss of -$0.69 during the quarter, which was better than expectations for a loss of -$0.85.Given the many uncertainties surrounding the global pandemic, the company declined to provided updated guidance for the year. In addition, the company has many moving parts around their own revenue growth, including moving away from hardware revenue and license revenue, both of which negatively impact revenue growth. While this transition does not look good optically, it will transform the company to a software subscription revenue model, which makes revenue more recurring and predictable.Over time, investors tend to place higher revenue multiples on companies that have highly predictable revenue streams. In addition, the software revenue naturally comes with higher margins and as the company continues to scale, they should be able to better leverage their operating expense base, thus improving margins and ultimately profitability.After reporting earnings, the stock traded down just under 10% as investors saw another quarter of improved revenue growth, though guidance was withdrawn given the uncertainty in the global economic environment. For these two reasons, valuation continues to be challenging as investors have seen several quarters of weak revenue and billings growth. However, as hardware becomes an immaterial amount of revenue and the company continues to transition away from license revenue, I believe the company will start reporting an improved revenue growth, which is more recurring.Over time with the larger subscription revenue base that is growing at a faster rate, investors will start to better assess the recurring revenue and highly visible nature of the new business model, which could ultimately lead to a higher valuation multiple.The stock has been under a lot of pressure over the past year as the company went from a 20%+ revenue growth profile to flat growth over the past several quarters. The transition to a subscription model has definitely taken its toll on the stock, however, the company is poised to have a strong revenue growth profile over the next several quarters. In FY19, subscription revenue was just $650 million, and just this past quarter, subscription revenue grew 55%. Assuming this grows ~65% in 2020 given the faster growth rate in the first two quarters, we could see subscription revenue of ~$1.075 billion. Assuming a more modest 25% growth in FY21, we could see FY21 subscription revenue of ~$1.35 billion.NTNX has a current market cap of $4.45 billion and with ~$900 million of cash/investment and ~$460 million of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$4.0 billion. Using my above FY21 subscription revenue estimate of $1.35 billion, this represents a multiple of only ~3.3x. Compared to the above group of leading SaaS players, a multiple under 4x is cheap.While valuation looks good using this metric, there is one caveat. First, this only account for the company’s subscription revenue, which while representing 82% of total revenue, does not take into account the company’s total revenue stream. Nevertheless, I believe this is a good potential way to value the company given their focus on transitioning to subscription revenue and shedding their hardware and license revenue streams. Over time, the company’s software subscription revenue will contribute nearly all of the company’s revenue growth and we could see revenue and margins improve from here.Given the post-earnings pullback, I have become incrementally bullish around the name and think long-term investors should see the stock double in the next 1-2 years. As the company’s revenue becomes more recurring and visible in addition to potentially accelerating, I believe investors will start to place a higher revenue multiple on valuation.Risks to NTNX include a slower-than-expected transition to software-only sales, though it would have a slight benefit to revenue growth and would negatively impact gross margins. The emergence of more competitors would also impact NTNX's growth."
4343020,35181,2020-05-05T09:27:27-04:00,"Nutanix stock is less than 30% of what it was in 2018. It is currently very undervalued.There are alarm bells that investors should be aware of, including negative free cash flow, negative total common equity, and extremely high SG&A expense.I suggest waiting for the company to complete transformation to subscription and for the pandemic/recession to play out before investing.","Nutanix, Inc. (NTNX) once was considered a very promising high growth stock investment and a leader in the hyper-converged infrastructure market once had a CAGR in excess of 40%.(Source: Nutanix)But the company has embarked on its own transformation from hardware to software subscription at an accelerated pace, ""clouding"" its performance over the short term (Sorry for the pun). Conversion from point-of-sale to subscription gives the appearance of reduced revenue growth and compressed margins until the transformation is complete.This is one reason why Nutanix stock has been beaten up. After reaching an all-time high of ~$60 in the summer of 2018, the stock price has been in decline ever since and now trades near $18.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)While many analysts consider the stock to be severely undervalued at present, I urge investors to be cautious as the pandemic and recession play out. Below I am providing 5 reasons why you might want to hold off on investing in Nutanix this year.Nutanix has a history of negative free cash flow. While it briefly turned positive in January of 2019, it is now plummeting. The CFO indicated in February that the company planned for ~-$250 million in free cash flow in 2020. This was before the full effect of COVID-19 was known or appreciated.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)Nutanix has an extremely high level of SG&A expenses relative to sales, 140% to be exact.Note: SG&A expense margin includes R&D and associated stock-based compensation.(Source: Portfolio123)This means that the company is spending 40% more on SG&A plus R&D than its revenue intake. It is unlikely that Nutanix will have positive earnings for the foreseeable future, and given the current global environment, losses could be much higher than in the past.The management indicated in the Q2 2020 earnings call that they would not slow down on hiring salespeople:I have recently started tracking total common equity as a fundamental factor, specifically looking for companies with negative total common equity. I discovered one company with negative common equity recently. Nutanix is another, turning negative in the most recent quarter.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)This is a situation that I don't normally run across, so I decided to run a backtest of the stock performance of companies with negative common equity. Using the Russell 3000 as the base stock universe, I determined that stocks with negative total common equity have underperformed the Russell 3000 fairly significantly over the last 10 years.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)Excessive stock-based compensation (SBC) is something that almost all software companies have in common. But Nutanix has much higher SBC than most companies. A typical software company will provide SBC within the range of 5-15% of revenue. For the first 6 months of FY20, Nutanix has given out $167 million in SBC whereas revenue was $662 million or SBC which amounts to 25% of revenue.(Source: Nutanix)While some would argue that SBC is not relevant because it is non-cash compensation, it has the effect of making both investors and employees unhappy when the stock is underperforming as is the case with Nutanix.The final point that I would like to make for today is that Nutanix depends almost entirely on partners for sales. And there is little diversification on this front. One partner account for 30% of revenue and 28% of accounts receivable. The second most important partner accounts for 13% of revenue and 14% of accounts receivable.(Source: Nutanix)In normal times, this lack of diversification may not be of concern, but in the present circumstances, the failure of a partner could cause significant harm to Nutanix's business.Nutanix is a leader in the hyper-converged infrastructure market and, prior to the start of its transformation to a subscription-based business model, was growing at an impressive rate of 40% per annum. But the transformation has clouded the company's performance. It may very well be that Nutanix returns to being a high-growth company once the transition is complete and, of course, after the pandemic and recession play out.But, I suggest that investors take a cautious approach. While the company is undervalued at present, it has negative free cash flow, negative total common equity, and an extremely high SG&A expense margin. In addition, the company's SBC is exceptionally high and revenue generation is not diversified among channel partners."
4334976,49191,2020-03-30T11:57:39-04:00,Nutanix is as a market leader in hyper-converged infrastructure trading at an attractive multiple.The transition to subscription and revenue recognition masks the health and stability of the business.Billing expirations represents an underappreciated opportunity in FY21/22 to accelerate billings growth and improve salesforce productivity.Investors should expect volatile reported results in the next couple of quarters.,"Market Overview:Nutanix is a leader in the hyper-converged infrastructure market competing with VMWare. Since its IPO in 2016, Nutanix has transformed its business from a hardware to a subscription software company. Nutanix has upgraded the quality of its revenue with subscription revenue to 77% of revenue (from 29% in FY18) at 81% GM (from 68% in FY18). Meanwhile, the trading multiple of the company is near multi-year lows at 2.1x sales. With an improvement in execution, there is opportunity for Nutanix to rerate at a multiple more commiserate of a successful SaaS company (6-10x) over the next 24-months.Source: KoyfinOver the last year the Nutanix has by impacted by execution challenges as well as impact from transitioning its business model to subscription. Nutanix has sold-off significantly (down 48%) following a weaker than expected guidance for the second half of the year. Given an evolving situation with COVID-19 it is likely results will be volatile in the next quarters. That said certain workloads, such as VDI, will perform very well with the rise in remote work. Investors should look through this volatility and pay attention to the signposts that demonstrate Nutanix is successfully transitioning its business to subscription.Signposts of a Successful Transition:There are several metric investors should carefully monitor as Nutanix goes through a transition to a subscription business model.Nutanix is nearly through the pains of transitioning its business model and tailwinds from this transition will become more apparent.Revenue Recognition Under ASC 606:While 77% of recognized revenue now a subscription, reported revenue results will remain volatile due to accounting standards. The reason is most of Nutanix’s subscription revenue is recognized upfront due to ASC 606. When a customer signs a 3-year term, all three years would be recognized in quarter. Relative to a business which follows ratable recognition, revenue will tend to be overstated and results will be more volatile (more closely following billings). Investors need to understand, this has no impact on the fundamental economics of the business. Reported results may look volatile, however the underlying business is stable with an average subscription contract term of 3.9 years.Source: Nutanix Quarterly EarningsIn addition, Nutanix has replaced a ~5-year device license with a 3-year subscription contract, which has a negative impact on both reported revenue and billings. Assuming equivalent pricing, a 3-year term-based subscription would not recognize the same amount of revenue until it renews after year three. In short, Nutanix has moved 77% of its business to subscription while not (yet) realizing the benefits.This is about to change. Nutanix started ramping its subscription revenue 2 ½ years ago. With an average contract life of just over 3-years, expiring contracts are set to grow substantially in FY21 and FY22. A growing book of expirations is favorable for many reasons:To illustrate how expirations may evolve for Nutanix, let’s assume for simplicity that all contracts are landed as 3-year deals (reported average has been between 3.2 – 3.9 years). Billings landed in FY18 will be set to expire in FY21.Expirations will ramp substantially in FY21 & FY22. This represents a massive tailwind to Nutanix’s business, which should fuel billings acceleration from FY21.While all of this bodes well for Nutanix, there remain several areas investors need to monitor carefully for Nutanix to improve on.Nonetheless, for investors with a longer-term time horizon Nutanix presents a favorable risk/reward opportunity. With accelerating billings growth into FY21, the valuation has room to improve substantially from 2x sales. Today, Nutanix is a as category leader with best in class retention rates, GM%, and a large addressable market. With improving execution and stability, investors can expect upside from a re-rating of the stock."
4326426,105372,2020-02-22T01:29:41-05:00,"Nutanix is a leader in the hyperconverged infrastructure software market and has a significant opportunity to expand sales by offering additional products and services through its enterprise platform.The company remains undervalued as a result of temporarily depressed revenue growth, which is due to a transition away from hardware sales and a shift to a subscription revenue business.NTNX's business performance remains solid, and it is likely to achieve strong growth in coming years as the hybrid cloud market continues to grow and it expand its product portfolio.","Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) is a leader in services for the rapidly growing hybrid cloud market segment. In 2019, the company became deeply undervalued due to stagnant revenue as a result of moving away from hardware sales and switching to a recurring revenue model. The underlying business remains solid though and it is likely to achieve strong revenue growth and margin expansion through operating leverage in coming years, which should see the share price continue to appreciate in coming years.Nutanix provides a range of services which enables infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). IaaS involves virtualized processors, physical servers, networking and storage with databases and applications further up the technology stack enabling platform-as-a-service and software-as-a-service. The major benefits of IaaS include scalability, no hardware capital expenditures, utility style costing, location independence, and the physical security of data center location (no single point of failure).Figure 1: Enterprise Technology Stack(Source: Adapted by author from Gartner)Nutanix has traditionally offered Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) software, commodity hardware and related services. HCI platforms combine scalable software-defined compute, storage, and networking delivered through software tools, using commodity hardware. Its benefits include cost efficiency, scalability, flexibility and security. HCI is the fastest-growing segment in the data center space.Table 1: Nutanix Market Opportunity(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)Nutanix is attempting to expand its addressable market by offering services further up the enterprise technology stack to try and capture some of the shift towards cloud computing and in particular the hybrid cloud. The hybrid cloud market was estimated to be worth approximately $36 billion in 2017 and was projected to grow at a rate of 21.7% annually through to 2025.Nutanix provides an enterprise cloud platform which aims to deliver clients invisible infrastructure and allow IT personnel to focus on higher value add activities. Its hyperconverged infrastructure also helps companies to manage their local infrastructure like a cloud.Nutanix's market opportunity was created by the weaknesses of traditional enterprise infrastructure where specialist IT teams manage different silos of servers, virtualization, storage and networks as each silo has its own proprietary operating system, hardware platform and management interface. As a result, traditional enterprise infrastructure is not agile, is complex to deploy, does not scale and is typically overprovisioned and underutilized. In addition, existing virtualization products are often sold under restrictive enterprise license agreements.Nutanix initially sold its data center software stack on its own branded servers, but customers also had the ability to run Nutanix's operating system on hardware from Dell EMC, Cisco (CSCO), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and IBM (IBM) amongst others. Hardware sales made up 26% of Nutanix revenue in 2017, but this was a low-margin commodity business which Nutanix decided to abandon in 2018 to focus on its software offerings. This has resulted in a drag on revenue growth in recent quarters, but will ultimately lead to improved margins.Nutanix's product suite aims to reduce the complexity and inefficiencies of enterprise IT management by integrating the traditional silos of server, virtualization and storage. Nutanix creates application mobility across private and public clouds, which enables hybrid cloud deployments resulting in increased agility, resilience, security and scalability and lower costs. In 2017, Nutanix's CEO stated:While this shift has better positioned Nutanix for long-term growth, it may be acting as a drag on growth in the short term as it tries to convince customers of the value proposition.Nutanix's operating system now includes a hypervisor, software-defined storage, operations and systems management and networking and automation capabilities. These solutions address a broad range of workloads such as enterprise applications, databases, virtual desktop infrastructure, unified communications and big data analytics.Figure 2: Nutanix Software Suite(Source: Nutanix)Figure 3: Nutanix Products(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)Hybrid cloud solutions tend to be adopted by older companies which have difficulty moving their IT infrastructure to the cloud or companies with specific concerns like data security or compliance. Combining public and private servers allows businesses to store the most sensitive information (identifiable customer information, confidential product details) on their on-site servers and use public servers for data backup and the storing of general business data. In addition, companies may not trust public cloud vendors with their data, particularly when those vendors are offering analytics services.Nutanix continues to achieve strong growth in client numbers with over 13,000 end customers including 780 global 2,000 companies in 2019. Nutanix's revenue per customer has been declining steadily over the past seven years, which is a concerning trend. This may reflect the addition of smaller and less valuable customers in recent years or it could be a result of rapid growth in new customers whose initial purchases are relatively low, but could expand over time. Declines over the past 12 months are at least partly due to a switch toward recurring revenue and the abandonment of the hardware business.Figure 4: Nutanix Customers(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)The lifetime purchase multiple of Nutanix's customers has been rising in recent years indicating that the company is able to increase the value of retained customers over time, which is supportive of growth in the long run. The number of deals Nutanix has completed involving multiple products has also been expanding rapidly, indicating that Nutanix's strategy of expanding its product offering is gaining some traction with customers. Investors should look for accelerating revenue growth and increased revenue per customer in coming quarters as confirmation of the success of the strategy.Figure 5: Nutanix Customers(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)Nutanix is making steady progress in its subscription software business, expanding subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue by 30% over the past two years. In addition, the average subscription length has been increasingly steadily and is now 3.7 years.Figure 6: Nutanix Subscriptions(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)Nutanix competes with a range of companies across product categories, most of whom are significantly larger and more diversified than NTNX, making comparison difficult, although its most similar competitor is probably VMware (VMW). Nutanix's main competitors can be broadly grouped into the follow categories:Table 2: Nutanix Competitors(Source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance)A number of large companies are positioning themselves for success within the IaaS market through acquisitions, including Cisco acquiring HCI software company Springpath and Dell acquiring EMC which owned VMware. Nutanix believes there is a shift in focus toward running the same operating software on both public and private clouds which gives it a strong competitive position. Nutanix's CEO has stated:If larger players with hardware offerings are too focused on their hardware business, this may give Nutanix a significant advantage in the software side of the business.Figure 7: Gartner Magic Quadrant Hyperconverged Infrastructure(Source: Gartner)Table 3: Hyperconverged Software Market(Source: Created by author using data from CRN)In the past, public cloud providers have typically offered homogenous infrastructure services which have not provided customers with adequate control to deliver tiered levels of application performance and availability for varying requirements. Customers have also been largely dependent on public cloud vendors to ensure data security and compliance with regulatory requirements. Most public cloud providers do not allow easy portability of applications and data to alternative providers resulting in vendor lock-in, although this is beginning to change, weakening Nutanix's value proposition somewhat. The leaders in public cloud are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOG) with Amazon by far the dominant provider.The hybrid cloud market is becoming increasingly competitive as companies like Dell, HPE, IBM, Microsoft, Amazon and Google improve their offerings through acquisitions, joint ventures and internal development. Companies that have a full stack offering may be able to create an advantage through seamless integration of services, but there is potential for best-in-breed niche software providers to be successful if they can prevent cloud lock-in and provide companies with flexibility. Closed architectures that prevent mobility of applications and adoption of new technologies across multi-hypervisor, hybrid cloud and container environments results in silos of compute that limit agility and increase costs.Google arguably has the leading technology in this area, but lacks enterprise sensibility which has limited its success so far relative to Microsoft and Amazon. Google is using its Kubernetes container abstraction to give customers portability. Kubernetes is an open-source container cluster manager that abstracts Google's massive infrastructure such that any Google service can instantly access all of the computing power it needs without worrying about the details. Google aims to provide a meta layer to manage infrastructure so that customers can use Google cloud or use a competitor cloud through Google software.One of the inherent risks of Nutanix's strategy is that the markets in which it competes are rapidly evolving and it must ensure its solutions are interoperable with the products of other vendors which generally requires other vendors to cooperate by providing early access to new products. If Nutanix is unable to obtain this access, its product development efforts could be impaired resulting in an adverse impact of the business.Nutanix operates a high gross profit margin business, particularly now that it is abandoning its commodity hardware business. Services is becoming a more important contributor to revenue though which may pressure margins somewhat in the future as services have lower margins.Figure 8: Nutanix Gross Profit Margins(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)Nutanix is yet to achieve operating profitability due to the relatively small size of the business, but operating profits should occur with scale due to the high gross profit nature of the business. Operating profit margins are improving rapidly and are broadly in line with the expectation of an enterprise software company of this size.Figure 9: Enterprise Software Company Operating Profit Margins(Source: Created by author using data from company reports)Operating losses are largely a result of high sales and marketing expenses. This is natural for a high growth subscription software business and these expenses should decline as the business scales and growth declines, particularly if customer retention rates remain high and the average length of subscriptions can continue to be extended.Figure 10: Nutanix Operating Expenses(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)While Nutanix is yet to achieve operating profitability, it has approximately achieved breakeven on a free cash flow basis which is more significant. This is primarily a result of strong and improving operating cash flow and the low capital expenditure requirements of the business.Figure 11: Nutanix Free Cash Flow(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)Figure 12: Nutanix Free Cash Flow and Growth(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)Nutanix's revenue growth rate has declined significantly in the past few years which raises questions about the potential size of its markets. A significant portion of this deceleration in recent quarters can be explained by its shift in business model. Nutanix abandoned its hardware business in 2019, a business which contributed close to 30% of revenue in 2018. Nutanix's shift to a recurring revenue model is also causing a greater proportion of revenue to be deferred acting as a further drag on growth. Nutanix has also mentioned that a lack of investment in sales and marketing and sales staff in recent quarters contributed to weak performance, and it is believed that the sales message became muddled when the company expanded its software offering.Figure 13: Nutanix Revenue Growth(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)Figure 14: Nutanix Deferred Revenue(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)To assess the effect of Nutanix's shift in business model, revenue indices can be constructed which removes the distorting effect of lost hardware revenue and increased deferred revenue. While actual revenue shows little growth over the last two years, revenue corrected for lost hardware sales has increased modestly and revenue corrected for hardware and deferred revenue continues to grow strongly.Figure 15: Nutanix Revenue(Source: Created by author using data from Nutanix)While it is unclear if Nutanix can successfully offer services across the enterprise technology stack or whether it can remain successful as a niche service provider, its current share price affords a safety margin for investors. The company's difficulties as it has abandoned hardware, moved to a subscription business model and expanded its product and service portfolio have been overstated and data indicates that Nutanix's core business has continued to perform relatively well during this period. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis, I believe Nutanix's intrinsic value is approximately 40 USD per share and the company still offers investors further upside."

A subscription will enable customers to control their capital and operating expenditure levels. For Nutanix investors, the lower revenue compressed the stock price multiples. The stock has a value score of just 46. This score is based on such metrics as EV/EBITDA, P/E, P/S, Price/Tangible Book, and EPS predictability.Data courtesy of Stock RoverInvestors could buy Dropbox (DBX), one of my Top DIY Value investing model ideas on the marketplace. Still, Dropbox peaked at nearly $24 following its earnings report, only to close at $17.39. VeriSign (VRSN) shares are also on sale, down ~9% in the last month. Both stocks have higher value, growth, and quality scores.Nutanix posted strong subscription growth on all metrics. The 69% year-over-year revenue growth, to $267 million, is especially promising: Source: NutanixAs its quarterly subscription billings and revenue both approach 90-95%, markets will realize the stock is oversold. In a quarter-over-quarter comparison, gross margin is up slightly:A year-over-year comparison shows a better picture as gross margin topped 78% in fiscal 2019:Nutanix credited Chris Kaddaras for the improved sales execution in the Americas. And so, Chris joined when “we were tiny company back then almost one-third the revenue, one-fourth the number of customers, an appliance business model and a single product in our portfolio. We’ve come a long way since then. The sales force in this time has endured a dramatic transition in the business model, learned to sell software and really strive to master the portfolio selling approach.”Management highlighted its partnership with HP Inc. (HPQ) and Citrix (CTXS) flourishing because of its reliable platform. It won a $3.5 million contract from an existing large, multinational pharmaceutical company.The lower fiscal 2020 guidance is a disappointment. Instead of $1.65 billion to $1.75 billion in TCV billings, this will be $1.6 billion to $1.75 billion instead. Management blamed the faster transition to subscription (cutting the outlook by $25 million to $30 million) and expectations of the coronavirus hurting full-year results. Nutanix also said its operating loss will be $550 million.Technology investors may look optimistically to Adobe (ADBE) successfully transitioning to a subscription model over the last few years for its creative suite of products. Microsoft (MSFT) did the same with Office 365. But the near-term third-quarter guidance is a concern. Nutanix is forecasting a 7% sequential decline in implied bookings. Conversely, by Q4, bookings will increase 25% sequentially.Stock Rover calculated a 93% margin of safety on Nutanix stock. Simplywall.st is far more pessimistic. It characterized the stock as having low future value:The site also forecast a fair value of $16.81, below the recent closing price of $17.50. Analysts are behind the ball on this stock, with an average price target of ~$38. But analysts did not update their view on the stock in nearly two weeks.Source: TipRanksIn my view, the market corrected the stock valuation to its fair value. And although the stock does not have much upside from here, it has the potential to rebound. Here are my assumptions:Source: finbox.ioGiven the heightened bearishness for stocks right now, investors may select better companies that do not have near-term issues. A quarter from now, Nutanix may revise its outlook higher. Investors may either bet on that or pay the premium for that news."
4317419,76115,2020-01-16T16:44:26-05:00,"Nutanix has had a rocky year, especially in terms of revenue growth.The stock is still down since my last article after a roller coaster bottoming.But, I'm starting to see the inklings of the turnaround coming to fruition. I'm willing to hold off till this upcoming earnings to see follow-through.","Back in March, I analyzed the lowered guidance Nutanix (NTNX) issued for its FQ3 '19 quarter. Management admitted to letting off the Sales & Marketing gas pedal and losing momentum on its lead gen pipeline. The company had unfortunately realized it too late and reaped the harvest of lower growth. Basically, momentum was lost and wouldn't return immediately due to the dynamics and lag of S&M and revenue realization. I expected about three-to-four quarters before Nutanix would gain the momentum back.(Source: datacenterknowledge.com)Well, it's here.The ability of management to correct the mistake of a year ago will be one of the primary drivers of turning around the stock. If management was able to get back to basics with its Sales and Marketing, we should see improvement in billings and, thus, improvements to revenues once those new billings are realized.Data by YChartsMany investors are focusing on the hardware to software transition as the reason for the stock's terrible performance over the last year, but that's not the center of the problem. The problem was very clearly diverting investments away from the S&M expense line once it saw its lead gen snowball. If the company and stock's problem were the continued hardware to software transition, gross margins would not be moderating at software levels.(Source: Nutanix 10-Q and 10-K filings)No, the fact is gross margins are at the point where any continued transition is not meaningful. The meaningful shift occurred back in FY2018. This can be further depicted by the company's 10-Q outlining the substantial decline in hardware revenue from FY2018 to FY 2019.(Source: Nutanix FY2019 10-Q)With hardware-related revenue at 27% of overall revenue in 2019 (versus 57% in 2018), the hardware transition is not a compelling reason for poor performance. 80% gross margins are the typical software margins of other software subscription companies. CyberArk (CYBR) hovers around 85% gross margins while Facebook (FB) averages about 82%.Nutanix has arrived at software industry gross margins.Now even when you consider non-portable software revenue as a related line item to hardware (as the company defines it as ""includes sales of our enterprise cloud platform when delivered on a configured-to-order appliance by us or one of our OEM partners.""), you can see the transition away from it along with hardware nearly matches the increase in Subscription revenue. The problem returns to not keeping the foot on the pedal of Sales to increase Subscription revenue faster than the decline of hardware and hardware-related revenue. If anything, the plan should have been to push harder on software subscription sales as management knew it would forgo growth in the hardware portion of its business (but, now I'm Monday morning quarterbacking that decision - this problem had been well established a year ago).The transition from hardware to subscription is a catalyst to improve gross margins, but it would not change the sales and marketing aspect of growing its subscription business. Therefore, the sole focus of the company today should be generating leads for future sales. The question I'm looking to evaluate today is: has the company done what it said it would do, and has it changed the top line? Similar to what my previous article asks, has management fixed the problem too late?(Source: Nutanix's Earnings Press Releases)It's clear, based on the above table, the company has reaccelerated spending on sales and marketing. It truly believes this is the issue at hand. I do too, as I stated in my last article:The final question now becomes, has it paid off in terms of revenue?(Source: Nutanix's Earnings Press Release and Yahoo Finance)So far, it hasn't. The company has only tread water over the last four quarters. FQ2 is when I questioned whether it was too late, and even with analysts' estimates for $341M in Q2 revenue, it will only amount to 1.71% year-over-year growth. However, this could be the start of the turnaround coming to fruition. As I discussed in my prior article, it took more than four quarters to produce higher revenue growth once sales spending was ramped.This is why Nutanix's next earnings will be critical. If it can show outsized revenue performance against analyst estimates for the current quarter and provide guidance for FQ3 showing meaningful growth, investors may start to pile on. However, it's essential to keep in mind we are now entering a period where the company will lap its weak performance in FY2019. This is why it will be important to follow the patterns of quarter-over-quarter growth rather than year-over-year growth. Due to IT seasonal spending, FQ2 to FQ3 usually sees slight Q/Q growth (remember NTNX's fiscal year doesn't align with the calendar). Analysts are currently expecting $352M in revenue for FQ3. This would be 3.2% quarter-over-quarter growth. Comparatively, past FQ2 to FQ3 growth has been 5.5% and 1%. If the company delivers this kind of guidance, it will prove the resurgence in S&M spending is delivering a turnaround.But, there's one more metric we can check on, and that's 'Billings for software and support.' Billings is a predictor of future revenues, and if Billings is increasing, we can expect revenue to grow as well.(Source: Nutanix's Quarterly Slide Decks)It appears Billings are making a turn as the decline starting in FQ2 2019 has reversed in FQ1 2020. Again, I would like to see the continued growth of billings before I dive into the stock. The turnaround is just starting to take hold, but with management's track record not being rock-solid, investors could once again be taken by surprise.I'm willing to wait till the next quarter until I go long unless the market presents another opportunity in the $20s. At which time, I may initiate but not go all in. Management has proven it can perform, but it also has shown it can miss some critical red flags like sales spending, especially at this juncture in its young life. I'm willing to take this one patiently and continue to watch."
4320209,102101,2020-01-30T12:57:22-05:00,Nutanix has a fair shot at improving its competitive positioning in the HCI space.Its go-to-market narrative has to focus on new demands from large enterprises.Investors have priced in near-term weaknesses due to earnings/expectations mismatch.I find valuation attractive at this point due to the improved value proposition of its products.,"Source: Channel FuturesNutanix (NTNX) has the potential to keep winning in the HCI (hyper-converged infrastructure) space. It needs to focus on improving its ROIC by approaching sales and marketing from a technical point of view. This means more focus on enhancing product value proposition versus brand marketing to keep opex inline. Enterprises are focused on driving down their TCO (total cost of ownership), not adding new devices to the hundreds of connected appliances they already have. If Nutanix can refine its go-to-market narrative, it will remain competitive in the heavily contested HCI space.The company is transitioning to a pure SaaS model, which means lumpy and unstable quarterly results and more marketing and sales spend to convert existing customers to its subscription service.For FY'20, Nutanix is guiding for ACV growth of 25% for software and support billing. Recording such high growth in the HCI space during a period of huge volatility and competition is enviable. Nutanix's recent product updates will drive its value proposition. As a result, I continue to remain bullish on Nutanix's offerings.Nutanix has a strong pipeline of products to drive growth. However, its operating expenses are getting out of line. This is a bet on market share acquisition in the HCI space. However, it is an expensive bet given the presence of other competent players like Dell (DELL), VMware (VMW), and HPE (HPE). Nutanix has been losing market share due to its fixation on marketing-led growth. It has the products to compete effectively in the HCI space. Products like Calm for automation, Era for databases, and Frame for desktop as a service will help close in on Dell's lead in the HCI space. However, if Nutanix is entering those RFPs alongside Dell, HPE, and VMware, it is safe to assume it won't be entering them at a cheap cost.As the chart below indicates, opex is bloated. This raises the probability of a sharp sell-off if growth guidance isn't above the Street's expectations. When gathering data for this analysis, the chart below stood out as the possible reason for the recent volatility. After digging deeper, I realized Nutanix needs to focus more on improving its product portfolio, which it has done. However, this might have been done a little bit late, given the strong momentum of Dell.The HCI space isn't a high ROIC space due to competition. Therefore, Nutanix has to temper its spending spree to balance growth and profitability. If it doesn't begin to place more emphasis on sales efficiency, Nutanix will continue to be dragged alongside competitors suffering from the storage industry weakness and volatility.Nutanix's macro and competitive positioning are average. This was highlighted during the last earnings call.Competitors are cutting spend in light of unfavorable macro headwinds in hardware storage. However, Nutanix is riding the wave of its cost-fueled growth in cloud storage and HCI.Nutanix's growth is enviable in the volatile HCI space. While it remains susceptible to sector volatility, its SaaS transition and focus on large enterprises will continue to drive volatility. Throw in macro uncertainty, and the subdued sales multiple is justified. As a result, its valuation is attractive at the current price point. I expect the valuation to become more attractive as the SaaS revenue becomes a more pronounced percent of overall revenue. This will also lead to a superior gross margin and improved cash flow down the line.Nutanix has the highest trading volatility in its peer group. It remains susceptible to the strength of the DELL/EMC/VMware trinity.Also, its huge opex suggests weak pricing power near term. This will make it difficult for its EPS, profitability, and value factors to improve. Buying a stock solely on its growth factor is risky if it faces stiff competition in its industry. However, the payoff can be huge if efficiency initiatives come in above expectations, given the weak outlook.The risk-reward dynamics suggest an options-like play (call options) would be appropriate to have some skin in the game. I would prefer to opt for call options to play the long-term game as it is unclear how much opex will be needed to acquire more market share. The lack of profitability and historical VaR suggests there is a lot of volatility to contend with down the road.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4309303,105256,2019-11-26T16:08:02-05:00,"For the last few weeks I've been promoting the idea of riding the rips. I think now that this powerful rally is well accepted the market could favor relative laggards.Of the group reviewed, the charts favor Nutanix, Square, Home Depot and Splunk.The VIX is now below 12; it just makes sense to do some low-cost hedging. Cash is the cheapest hedge; trim some long-held positions.We are approaching my 3,150 top, and now it seems like Phase 1 will get approved. I now have no concrete reason why the market may sell off. That means people won't be psychologically prepared for it.","Yesterday morning, I had the notion that it might make sense now to look for names that may have been poorly treated by the market. By poorly treated I mean stocks that the market had misread their earnings and under a bit more review would have been found to be innocent.Take Nutanix (NTNX), they are rocking today after a great report. They say global spending on cloud is up. NTNX has fallen quite a bit over the last year or so. The big problem, actually two problems, is, first, the transition from a hardware-software ""go to market"" to a purely cloud-based subscription service. As the hardware portion of the sales goes away, it drives down the revenue; however, the software is where all the profit is. The last earnings report also showed some lumpy contract wins which really spooked the bulls. We have seen other young companies that have lumpy sales with delayed contracts. A great example is Arista Networks (ANET), which I am going to leave alone today but I think is a buy too. Let's chart NTNX, and see where it might go...Source: tradingview.comI can't believe I am saying this, but with the stock being up 5 points now, from a chart point of view, there is only about 4-5 additional points to the upside. Don't get me wrong, an inverse head and shoulders is very bullish, but it looks like the chart has already sniffed out the rally. If you look at the bottom of the formation which is the ""top"" of the head, you see that the low was about $17, then if you go up to the neckline, you have about $27ish. If you subtract the bottom from the top, you get 10 points which take us up to $37ish for an interim top. Could NTNX go higher? Of course. But we need more data, an analyst meeting, and new product announcements to take us higher. I think there might be a risk that NTNX falls to the right shoulder near $29ish. Let's wait a few days to decide to get in.The Bed Bath And Beyond (NASDAQ:BBBY) bull case has elements similar to the emerging recovery of General Electric (NYSE:GE). The new CEO of BBBY who has been fingered as the savior of BBBY is Mark Tritton. Mark was once Chief Merchandising Officer of the resurgent Target (NYSE:TGT). The similarity to Larry Culp, CEO of GE, is striking. Once the CEO of Danaher (NYSE:DHR) and credited with its fantastic growth over many years, it is Culp that is now widely credited with righting GE and putting it on a sustainable path. In the beginning, there was hope but also skepticism that he could get actually make a difference so late in the game. Similarly, Mark Tritton has a big task in front of him, but there seems to be optimism that he is the right man for the job. There have been reports of major and repeated call option buying in this name, meaning that market participants are expecting results pronto. We now have a new upgrade from Bank of America Merrill Lynch with a $20 PT. It promptly popped 5% yesterday and looks like there is more room to run. While BBBY has been improving for a while, it is up about 16% while the overall market is up about 25%. Let's see what the chart says...Source: tradingview.comWow, this is the 2nd negative surprise. The chart is not too exciting looking. Even though BBBY is up like 6% now, it looks like the stock is struggling at this level. I would wait for either the price to fall to the trendline of $13ish or wait for BBBY to break above $15. We seem to be in no man's land.We recently made note that Square (NYSE:SQ). It broke above a meaningful interim top of $66.37. I stated that since that level was broken significantly, it was likely that SQ was going back to the yearly highs. We aren't there yet, but SQ has been toying with the $69 level this week. Now we have an exciting upgrade from a Macquarie analyst, based on the Square Cash app and its torrid growth justifies a PT of $105! That is pretty close to its all-time high. I have felt for a long time that market participants have not been giving SQ their due. Let's see what the chart says...Source: tradingview.comFinally, a bullish chart, what a relief for me since I have been touting SQ for a long time. We see a long-established uptrend (first ascending line), then we have an accelerating uptrend (Second diagonal), and we have a huge gap down that will pull the price up like a magnet. Aside from my own bias, you can look at the chart to decide. I can make a long-winded defense of SQ from the fundamental side. I don't think that payments are the only reason that SQ is an excellent risk. I believe in the narrative that small business is doing much better than what is being tracked by economists. Main Street is doing better than Wall Street. SQ is a fantastic champion of small business, not just about low cost and convenient point-of-sale tools, but its lending business. In any case, the chart agrees and I am relieved. SQ is a BUYSplunk (SPLK) beat on revenue and earnings in their just-released earnings report; they also raised fiscal year guidance. SPLK is another young company that has had lumpy sales. The fact that they raised guidance goes a long way to reassure investors that have been burned before. It jumped more yesterday when Argus Research pointed to SPLK as an ideal acquisition target. It is a best-of-breed big data tool that can surface machine generated data. SPLK can be used in enterprise application performance to cyber-security, among other uses. Let's look at the chart and see where it could run...Source: tradingview.comClearly, SPLK is breaking out. This means there is no overhead resistance. Hard to figure out where it can go, but the chart pattern seems to have a periodicity of about 18 to 20 points. That would take us to about $158 to $160ish. Argus Research had their PT at $157. This is also the average PT among 39 analysts that cover it. The outlier has a PT of $202. Just beware that SPLK has popped about 18% in just a few days.American Express (AXP) has been in business news the last few days because it is making big cash rewards to retailers to incentivize them to carry the AMEX card. I applaud the more aggressive stance by the C-Suite of AXP, if not the exact tactic. Based on the strength of Square Cash app, you might think that I would be an AXP bear, but I think there is tremendous room in the Fintech space. I think AXP could raise its profile both at the register and in the stock market. If the Phase One trade deal comes through, then the AMEX card or at least the brand and service could find a more companionable environment in China. Right now they have to be in a joint venture. Phase One is purported to free up the financial sector in China. The chart says:Source: tradingview.comYou have a nice inverted ""head and shoulders"". When you count the lowest point of the ""head"" to the neckline, you get about 8 points. That should get you to the previous high, not that big a pop, but this is not a high beta name. This is more of a slow money situation, but if they do get freed up in China, this could be a runner.My final name is Home Depot (HD). This name has been on my radar to pull the trigger. Finally, HD has started turning. I think stock market participants unfairly dumped HD. Check out the chart...Source: tradingview.comI think HD will offer a chance for alpha now. I don't think it's going to charge back to old highs in a week. I think that if you are looking to find a stock that can work with all aspects of homebuilding - new homes, old homes, sales, renovations - HD offers a 2.5% dividend so it qualifies even for conservative investing as well.Chesapeake Energy (CHK): Scotiabank analyst upgraded from a Sector Perform to an Outperform.My Take: As you may recall, we observed insider buying after the ""Going Concern"" filing. I was very tempted to pull the trigger then. So the fact that a known name iBank is upgrading this dicey name has my attention. Who doesn't love an underdog? It's trading for pennies. Obviously, you don't put anywhere near significant money on something like this. If you have bet on football for 100 bucks, then yeah throw a few bucks at this one. I still will have this name on my radar and looking for another confirmation, so for me, it's not a buy yet. I will keep you posted, but I am even more interested.AIG's (NYSE:AIG) Fortitude Re goes to Carlyle and T&D Holdings for $1.8 billion.StubHub sold to Viagogo by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for $4 billion.The bottom line, the real market participants are looking to transact business before the year ends.Revolve Group (RVLV) 12/4CrowdStrike (CRWD) 12/9Fiverr (FVRR) 12/10Chewy (CHWY) 12/11Grocery Outlet (NASDAQ:GO) 12/17*Slack (WORK) 12/17RealReal (REAL) 12/25My Take: I want you to be cognizant of the fact that these names could come under selling pressure next month. Whether you own them now, or are looking at them from an investment perspective, you should plan around these dates. They don't always fall with the lockup expiration, just be aware.The VIX is under 12; you can create a 12 by 18 call spread with a January expiration for just under $300 per contract. Please don't over-hedge. If you are a first-timer, don't hedge more than 2-3%. You should also include a put spread on the SPY. At this point, the chatter is that the deal is really happening, so I have no idea what could sell this market. I am at this point working off of the notion that 3,150 is probably the highs for 2019. The way the rally is running, we may just hit 3,200, which was my original top. We are heading for an overbought condition as well. So this is just trading hygiene. The best hedge is cash. Please chip off a few shares of each older position you are in, in your trading account. The goal is building a 25% cash cache minimum.I added to my Anaplan (PLAN), DocuSign (DOCU) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) calls. I spread my Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) and DOCU calls. I am looking to go long on the VIX today or at least before the week ends. I swept some cash out of my trading account and bought more GE equity for my investment account."
4318047,103480,2020-01-21T11:04:37-05:00,"After a painful FY19 for Nutanix, the hyperconverged company has returned to flat revenue growth again in Q1.The reason for Nutanix's declines in FY19 is due to the company's removal of pass-through hardware. Prior-year comps are about to get a lot easier for Nutanix.Nutanix's software-only conversion has been a tremendous windfall to margins, where pro forma gross margins have shot up above 80%.Nutanix remains a ""best-of-breed"" company with technology leadership in a very critical market for hybrid cloud services.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha’s service for professional investors. This article was highlighted under our Tech vertical. Find out how you can get access to the best content on Seeking Alpha here.There's a lot to like about Nutanix (NTNX), the infrastructure software company best known for its ""hyperconverged"" technology that combines separate server silos into a single system to make backend IT more efficient and cost-friendly. As the company continues to execute into fiscal 2020, and continues its focus on delivering its solutions as a subscription - turning into a true SaaS company and away from its prior history as a partial hardware vendor - investors should keep an eye on this stock to reclaim its prior heights.Data by YChartsThough shares of Nutanix have risen ~10% in the first few weeks of 2020 alone, the stock still remains well below its 2019 peaks above $50. Amid the noise from new IPOs, investors have largely forgotten about Nutanix and the incredible turnaround it has fostered in its core business. The bullish thesis for Nutanix, in my view, rests on several key pieces:Despite these strengths, Nutanix's stock price has a lot of catching up to do - giving investors a broad opportunity to buy into the stock at modest values. Nutanix stands to gain tremendously as investors shift their view of the company as a software company, which is where the stock's biggest opportunity lies.For investors who are relatively unfamiliar with Nutanix, the chart below gives a good overview of how the company's business model has evolved since its IPO in 2016. At the outset, Nutanix was sold as a packaged appliance. Clients wishing to apply hyperconverged infrastructures in their data centers typically bought Nutanix essentially pre-loaded onto a standard server, typically a commodity Intel (INTC) product. Over time, however, Nutanix wished to give its clients more freedom with how to deploy the company's solutions - today, Nutanix is delivered as a free-standing subscription service, and is compatible across hardware platforms.Figure 1. Nutanix subscription shiftSource: Nutanix Q1 earnings deckThere are many pieces of ""evidence"" that Nutanix is now a full software company. Key here is the company's gross margin. As a hybrid hardware/software company, Nutanix had gross margins in the ~60s, but ever since the company stopped including hardware revenues in its results and shifted to selling subscriptions, the company has seen massive lifts in gross margin. In the company's most recent quarter (1Q20), Nutanix notched an 80% pro forma gross margin, one point higher than the year-ago quarter:Figure 2. Nutanix gross margin trendsSource: Nutanix Q1 earnings deckEven among high-growth software peers, >80% gross margins are enviable - and certainly not commonly achieved by any hardware company. Nutanix's billings mix also continues to weigh gradually more toward pure subscriptions: in Q1, the company increased its subscription billings mix by two additional points to 73%, and expects to end the year above 75%:Figure 3. Nutanix subscription billings mix trendsAlso important to note: Nutanix has reached the point where its subscription transition is no longer a headwind to revenues. Recall that virtually every software company that has made the decision to shift toward subscription-based revenues has typically hit a period of declining revenue due to tough prior-year compares. Nutanix's prior-year compares are especially tough because they include lumpy, one-time hardware revenue.After several sequential quarters of decline in FY19, Nutanix returned to +1% y/y growth in 1Q20 - though its original guidance, as well as Wall Street's guidance, called for roughly -2% decay.Figure 4. Nutanix 1Q20 revenue growthSource: Nutanix 1Q20 earnings releaseEssentially, the worst is over for Nutanix. Other software companies like Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK) that have been able to execute successful subscription transitions have seen large post-transition bumps in share price; we'd expect Nutanix to be able to enjoy the same.Despite Nutanix's strengths and continued transition toward becoming a pure SaaS play, its stock still doesn't trade like a software company. Nutanix currently has a market cap of $6.76 billion. After netting off the $908.8 million of cash on its balance sheet against $458.9 million in convertible debt, the company is left with an enterprise value of $6.31 billion.Versus Wall Street's consensus revenue estimate of $1.40 billion for the current year, Nutanix currently trades at just 4.5x EV/FY20 revenues - a bargain when considering most other SaaS companies have broached double-digit revenue multiples. Note as well that consensus calls for Nutanix to achieve 26% y/y revenue growth in FY21 to $1.77 billion in revenues - against Nutanix's FY21 revenue estimate, the company trades at just 3.6x EV/FY21 revenues.These bargain-basement multiples suggest that a good portion of the market still views Nutanix as a hardware company - despite the fact that it has achieved >80% pro forma gross margins and is nearing a ~75% subscription billings mix. The key opportunity for investors lies in realizing Nutanix's software attributes before the rest of the market catches up and re-rates Nutanix shares up in-line with software peers.With the company's most recent Q1 data suggesting no slowdown in the software transition (Q2 results will be released sometime in February), investors should heavily consider adding Nutanix to their portfolios while the stock is still trading at ~40% below its all-time highs."

The bigger story, however, was in the growing traction.Source: Nutanix 1Q 2020 PresentationSource: Nutanix 1Q 2020 PresentationThe growth in customers becomes even more important when considered in the context of the growing subscription component of Nutanix’s business.Source: Nutanix 1Q 2020 PresentationFurthermore, gross margin stability adds another feather in the management’s cap.Source: Nutanix 1Q 2020 PresentationSimply put, despite Nutanix asking its customers to transition to a subscription-based model, they are willing to pay top dollar and the market continues to grow for the company with newer customers joining in.The management also noted remarkable strength in North America, helping them witness growth. What was even more pleasing was the progress Nutanix saw with HPE:Source: 1Q 2020 Nutanix Earnings Call With Nutanix primarily competing against VMware (VMW) (which has the blessings of Dell), the strength of growth from the HPE partnership pits Nutanix in the competition for the long run.In June 19, we had noted:Source: Nutanix: Starting To Look AttractiveOver the last couple of quarters, not only has Nutanix – HPE partnership started to deliver well but also is coinciding remarkably well with Nutanix’s timelines for a move towards an asset lite model.Another encouraging aspect of Nutanix's performance is the company's growing partner ecosystem:Source: 1Q 2020 Nutanix Earnings CallWith the HPE partnership, Nutanix has effectively managed to establish the following:Since Nutanix is much smaller than VMware and is still independent, Nutanix is also likely to attract a premium for becoming a possible takeover target. (We had talked about Nutanix's standalone value and as a potential acquisition target here.)ConclusionWe continue to like Nutanix as an under-rated investment play in the growing hybrid- and multi-cloud markets market. As the base case, we think the company still has another 30% upside, with the downside risks dwindling as the company’s sales planning focus continues to shift towards leveraging a strong partner (hyperscaler) ecosystem."

        ""Trifecta"" should penetrate EMEA in 2020, assuming margins are strong.
        Subscription business continues to demand incremental SG&A.","Nutanix offers an enterprise cloud platform that converges silos of server and storage into an integrated solution. Among its solutions are various software product families, such as Acropolis and Prism. Acropolis includes its distributed storage fabric delivering enterprise-grade data management features, as well as a built-in hypervisor and an application mobility fabric enabling application placement. A US company, it also has extensive operations in EMEA and Asia-Pacific.We apply the EV/sales ratio of 4.5x to the revenue base of $1.315 billion, which results in the target price of $45.Strong guidance beat: Nutanix meaningfully beat its own guidance across the board, with software and support billings, software revenue, and margin / EPS all coming in above the guide. Specifically, TCV revenue came in at $305 MM, beating by about $15 MM and accelerating 300 bps from 6% Y/Y growth during the previous quarter. TCV billings were $370 million, beating guidance by about $15-$20 MM, also showing acceleration from the previous quarter, by approximately 200 bps.Large deals on track: NTNX signed the second highest number of large deals ($500K+) in a quarter, with subscription growing to 73% of total billings, accelerating by 200 bps. Recall that the company's goal is to have at least three quarters conversion within the next year.See Americas as the strongest region for 2020: We believe that enterprise-related business will continue to strongly outperform the commercial business. In addition, the federal segment is also outperforming. No other region transitioned better from selling hardware to marketing cloud-based software on a subscription basis. Subscription business continues to demand incremental SG&A: With the transition from hardware to SaaS model continuing, we believe that incremental marketing (SG&A) expenses may lead to some bottom line misses in 2020, though we don't expect this to obscure the larger revenue story.Solid acquisitions portfolio and more likely to come: Source: Company websiteAt this point, we see Nutanix channeling at least half of its free cash flows toward tuck-ins, like in the chart above, or perhaps into even more actionable deals. Possible dividend in the future: With the revenue growth trending well and outperforming expectations, we believe that the Board may consider instituting a dividend around 2021-22. While the dividend would not be immediate, the discussion itself may play out well into the stock traction in the coming months. ""Trifecta"" should penetrate EMEA in 2020, assuming margins are strong: Management asserts that software and services portfolio covers the trifecta of data plane, control plane and management plane. In our opinion, this is the key to the EMEA traction in 2020, provided that the cloud service models, similar to the graph below, stay in line.Source: medium.com.Macro risks: Economic slowdown has a risk of harming Nutanix's business. Tariff risks: The trade threat is substantially tied to macro risks, which is mainly manifested via tariffs; hence, there is inevitable caution that companies have toward investments as a result.Technological risks: Failure along any step in the supply chain can lead not only to business slowdown, but to a branding risk, from which NTNX may struggle to recover.Regulatory risks: The tech sector cannot escape these risks, particularly when it comes to NTNX's SaaS model."
4290469,104608,2019-09-09T08:28:00-04:00,"Nutanix reported a solid Q4 earnings with revenue coming in over 2% ahead of consensus expectations.While management’s Q1 guidance still shows revenue declining, subscription billings remains well above expected subscription revenue.When only looking at subscription revenue, the stock trades at under 3x FY21 subscription revenue, well below comparable SaaS peers.","Since reporting disappointing Q3 earnings in late May, Nutanix (NTNX) saw their shares decline by over 40%. However, Q4 results were a positive surprise and management provided a solid guidance for FY20, giving investors hope the stock can reach their previous 2018 high of over $60 a share.Since reporting Q4 earnings and providing FY20 guidance, the stock is up just under 20% and I believe there is a lot of upside remaining left in this name. While overall revenue did decline 1% to just under $300 million, this was above consensus expectations for revenue decline of 3% to just over $293 million. What remains an important element for this company is their subscription revenue, which grew nearly 72% to $196 million, representing over 65% of total revenue. While this does just depict the positive aspect of the company’s revenue growth, investors should place a higher emphasis on this figure as this is the direction management is heading towards.Data by YChartsNTNX has struggled over the past year for two main reasons. First, management noted they are shifting away from hardware sales and instead will eliminate pass-through hardware revenue. Second, NTNX has pushed customers to purchase subscriptions rather than upfront licenses. Subscription revenue is spread out over a longer period of time compared to the large upfront revenue seen with licenses.Investors have punished NTNX for seeing their overall revenue growth decelerate quite significantly, though we should start to look at what revenue growth may look like in the next few quarters and years once these revenue headwinds begin to lap.While there is still a lot of concern over revenue growth and what the appropriate revenue multiple should be for valuation, I believe investors should continue to focus on two things, the company’s rather impressive transition to a software subscription model and the magnitude of billings growth. NTNX remains one of the top competitors, if not the leader, in a competitive hyperconverged infrastructure market. Even after the recent post-earnings pop, I believe NTNX remains a buy at these levels as we could either see the revenue multiple start to expand or the company become a takeout target.During Q4, NTNX saw their software and support revenue grow by 7% to $286.9 million and total revenue decline by 1% to 299.9 million. Hardware revenue continues to be a drag on the company’s revenue growth but now represents less than 5% of total revenue. The other main drag to revenue growth is the company’s transition to a subscription-based model instead of selling licenses. With subscription revenue, the revenue stream is typically highly recurring and visible as the revenue stream is spread out over the contract life. This compares with license revenue which is lumpier as the total contract is typically recorded in a single quarter. As the company moves away from licenses, they have seen revenue growth slowdown, as there is less upfront revenue recognized.Source: Company PresentationDuring the quarter, subscription revenue grew nearly 72% to $195.6 million and represented over 65% of total revenue. This means the remaining revenue groups declined quite significantly. Non-portable software (license) declined by nearly 45% to $82.2 million and now represents only 27% of revenue. Hardware revenue also declined to only $13.0 million for the quarter and represented under 5% of total revenue.As NTNX continues on their journey of getting rid of hardware revenue, which they are a few quarters away from doing, and eventually lap some of the large license revenue declines, we could start to see revenue growth return to double digit growth.Billings for the quarter declined 6% to $371.7 million, though subscription based billings actually increased 30% to $263.3 million and represented over 70% of total billings. While the total dollar value of billings continues to decline, this is heavily impacted by both license and hardware billings. License billings declined nearly $68 million and hardware billings another $23 million. While this is definitely not a clear comparison, if we were to eliminate half of the license billings decline and the full hardware billings decline, we could have seen a $57 million benefit to billings, brining overall growth to just under 10%.Source: Company PresentationAs expected, gross margins continue to improve and reached 80% during Q4. This is very impressive and among the highest gross margins of software companies. While revenue growth remains under pressure, the transition away from hardware revenue has a positive impact to margins.Source: Company PresentationNTNX’s customer cohort is also a big driver of their future growth. Traditionally, they have focused on the enterprise market, leaving the middle market companies largely untouched. However, NTNX has placed a lot more emphasis on the middle market and has initiated several internal sales programs over the past few quarters to place more emphasis on this large market opportunity.At the end of Q4, NTNX had over 14k customers with 810 from the Global 2,000 client list. Their net expansion rate remains very impressive at 137%, meaning customers increase their purchases by 37% the next year after initial purchase. This goes hand in hand with their average lifetime purchase multiple of 11.7x, meaning after a customer’s initial purchase, they go on to spend 11.7x that amount over their lifetime with NTNX. This multiple continues to rise over time as customers continue to go back to NTNX and increase their spend.Source: Company PresentationManagement provided guidance for Q1 which includes software and support revenue of $290-300 million, implying another quarter of revenue decline (revenue in the year ago period was $313 million). It should be noted that while this revenue does not include hardware revenue, it includes license revenue which continues to decline rapidly.Software and support billings are expected to remain well above revenue at $360-370 million and are a good indication of future revenue growth. Management also noted hardware should be 3% or less of total billings, which will help gross margins reach ~80%.Another area of potential growth could come from NTNX’s recent FedRAMP certification update, which could enable to company to receive contracts from the federal government. While this could be a revenue stream more suited for the following year, earning the FedRAMP certification could open the doors to longer-term contracts.I believe there is a little conservatism baked into management’s Q1 guidance as they do not want to disappoint investors with their lackluster revenue growth. Subscription revenue growth continues to remain healthy and has increased as a percentage of total revenue. This trend will continue for the next several quarters and we could see some upside to guidance.Valuation remains very challenging for this name as some investors see declining revenue growth and question why this name deserves to trade at a revenue multiple above 2x. However, when just looking at the company’s subscription revenue (the recurring, highly visible revenue stream), we can see how undervalued NTNX remains. Over time with the larger subscription revenue base, investors will be able to better assess recurring revenue and visibility, leading to a higher valuation.While total revenue for FY19 was $1.2 billion, subscription revenue was just under $650 million, representing ~52% of total revenue and grew 96% during the year. While this growth rate is inflated because management is pushing more contracts to be subscription rather than license, it paints a picture of more recurring, faster growth, highly predictable revenue stream. In Q4, subscription revenue grew nearly 72% and represented over 65% of total revenue.Data by YChartsEven as the transition to subscription revenue ultimately means overall revenue declining for another quarter or two, we could see meaningful acceleration in revenue growth for the out year. Using the $650 million in subscription revenue for FY19 and assuming a 60% growth for FY20 (remember, Q4 just grew 72%), we could see FY20 subscription revenue of $1.04 billion. Although there will be other forms of revenue (some hardware and license as well as professional services), I will only be focusing on the subscription revenue.NTNX has a current market cap of $4.3 billion and with ~$935 million of cash/investment and $430 million of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$3.8 billion. Using by FY20 subscription revenue of $1.04 billion, this represents a multiple of ~3.6x. Compared to the above group of leading SaaS players, a multiple under 4x is relatively cheap.Using my FY20 subscription revenue base of $1.04 billion and growing this a modest 25% in FY21, at which that point subscription revenue would likely represents a vast majority of overall revenue, we could see subscription revenue of $1.3 billion, representing a multiple of just 2.9x.Though this valuation metric is a bit unique, it only gives credit to the subscription revenue base and not the entire revenue stream. By just valuing the highly recurring and visible revenue stream, the company remains undervalued and underappreciated. At under 3x FY21 subscription revenue, NTNX should be on everybody’s radar as a buying opportunity despite the recent pop in the stock price. Optimistically speaking, we could eventually see the company trade at an overall revenue multiple closer to 4x, which would imply a subscription-only revenue multiple above 5x, closer to some of the other leading SaaS-based companies.Risks to NTNX include a slower-than-expected transition to software-only sales, though it would have a slight benefit to revenue growth and would negatively impact gross margins. The emergence of more competitors would also impact NTNX’s growth."

While this has impacted the stock quite significantly over the past year, the company is approaching ~75% of total revenue deriving from subscription services.Q1 revenue declined ~1% overall, however, this includes the company's legacy hardware and license revenues, which they are moving away from. If we were to only look at software and support revenue, which represents ~95% of total revenue, this grew 9%. Looking even closer at the numbers, Q1 subscription revenue increased an impressive 72% to $218 million.As the company continues on their transition, I believe revenue growth will start to meaningfully accelerate as the subscription revenue base becomes a larger portion of overall revenue. In addition, this revenue stream comes with higher gross margins, as signified by the ~80% gross margin during the quarter, which I believe will become the new sustainable level.Data by YChartsImmediately following a strong Q1 earnings, the stock shot up ~30% as investors are starting to see the benefit of a full-subscription revenue model. However, in recent weeks, the stock has pulled back ~10% as investors have started to take some profits off the table. Nevertheless, the stock remains ~45% below their all-time high and with the transition moving along rather quickly, I believe the company's valuation has some room to expand.Investors have punished the stock over the past year as overall revenue growth has decelerated significantly and in some cases has actually declined. However, with the transition starting to become the majority of revenue and billings, the company's overall growth is likely to accelerate and cause investors to become more bullish on the name.Though there is still a concern around revenue growth, valuation remains attractive compared to other leading software companies who deploy the subscription revenue model. If we were to only look at potential FY20 subscription revenue, the company currently trades at ~6x FY20 subscription revenue, well below some of their peers. Valuation looks even lower if we look at the overall company's FY20 revenue, as my analysis only looks at the more recurring and highly visible subscription revenue.At this point with the stock now trading under $35, I believe it is a good opportunity for long-term investors to pick up shares. As the company continues to move along their transition, I believe investors will start to place a higher revenue multiple on the overall company and we could see the stock start to approach the all time high level of ~$62 at some point this year.During the quarter, total revenue only grew ~1% to $314.8 million, though the company continues to transition away from selling hardware and more towards a subscription model. Software and support revenue grew 9% to $305 million and represents ~95% of total revenue. While hardware revenue represents less than 5% of total revenue, the continued decline in revenue still has a drag on the overall company growth.In addition, the software and support revenue has been negatively impacted by the company transitioning to a subscription model instead of license. With their historical license model, the revenue would be received upfront, thus would be more volatile and less predictable. The new subscription based model will not only be all software, but it will become more recurring and visible, which investors have historically placed higher valuation multiples on. During the quarter subscription revenue increased 72% to $218 million.Source: Company PresentationWhile NTNX has done a good job shifting to a subscription model, there is still room left to go. For example, only ~50% of Billings and ~40% of revenue were subscription based in the year ago period, however, this has increased to ~73% of Billings and ~65% of revenue. While this has been a successful journey to date, the company still has room to go, which could help improve their valuation as the subscription revenue eventually becomes the model.Billings for the quarter declined ~1% to $380 million, though subscription billings increased by 41% to $276 million and represented nearly 75% of billings. Even though the total billings value actually declined, again this can be attributed to the impact from license and hardware billings exiting the company.Source: Company PresentationGross margin has also improved the past few quarters and Q1 was no exception. Gross margin came in at 80.1%, better than the 78.6% in the year ago period. The improvement is largely attributed to the company's transition to a subscription model, and I believe the 80%+ gross margin is sustainable as other software subscription models tend to have similar gross margins given the lack of product expense from hardware related sales.Source: Company PresentationNTNX continued their success in expanding both their customer growth and lifetime purchase multiples. Ending Q1, the company had nearly 15k customers, which grew 30% from the year ago period. In addition, the company also has 840 of the Global 2000 Companies as customers. Even as the company further penetrates the G2K list, these customers ted to spend 12.5x throughout their relationship when compared to their initial purchase. Essentially this means that the G2K customers are very willing to renew and expand contracts with NTNX, as demonstrated by their 76% repeat customer bookings.Source: Company PresentationManagement provided guidance for Q2 which includes software and support revenue of $330-335 million with software and support billings of $410-420 million. While the company continues to shed their legacy hardware and license revenue streams, I believe management continues to provide somewhat conservative software and support targets, which I believe they will continue to beat. In addition, gross margins should remain ~80%.For the full year, software and support revenue is expected to be $1.30-1.40 billion with software and support Billings of $1.65-1.75 billion. Even though guidance seems somewhat conservative, I believe management was prudent in delivering numbers that they will able to beat throughout the year. Notably, gross margin for the year is expected to be ~80%, demonstrating the company's continued focus on shifting to subscription revenue.Valuation continues to be challenging for this company has many investors continue to see revenue and billings growth decline, though this includes the hardware and license revenue, which the company is no longer focusing on. Subscription revenue represented nearly 70% of Q1 revenue and grew 72% compared to the year ago period, demonstrating the opportunity the company has within this revenue stream.Over time with the larger subscription revenue base that is growing at a fast clip, investors will start to better assess the recurring revenue and highly visible nature of the new business model, which could ultimately lead to a higher valuation multiple.Data by YChartsWhile the transition to subscription revenue has significantly impacted the stock over the past year, the transition has been moving along and the company is better positioned to take advantage of the subscription model. For valuation purposes, we can look purely at the subscription revenue base. In FY19, subscription revenue was $650 million and assuming this grows ~65% in FY20 (Q1 growth was 72%), we could see subscription revenue of ~$1.075 billion.NTNX has a current market cap of $6.7 billion and with ~$900 million of cash/investment and ~$470 million of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$6.3 billion. Using my above FY20 subscription revenue estimate of $1.075 billion, this represents a multiple of ~5.9x. Compared to the above group of leading SaaS players, a multiple under 6x is relatively cheap.This valuation metric is a bit unique as it only gives credit to the subscription revenue base and not the entire revenue stream. By just valuing the highly recurring and visible revenue stream, the company remains undervalued and underappreciated. At under 6x FY20 subscription revenue, NTNX should be on everybody's radar as a buying opportunity despite the recent pop in the stock price. Optimistically speaking, we could eventually see the company trade at an overall revenue multiple closer to ~6-7x, which would imply a subscription-only revenue multiple near 10x, closer to some of the other leading SaaS-based companies.Risks to NTNX include a slower-than-expected transition to software-only sales, though it would have a slight benefit to revenue growth and would negatively impact gross margins. The emergence of more competitors would also impact NTNX's growth."
4294368,104099,2019-10-01T09:57:50-04:00,"The shares of Nutanix Corp. remain morbidly overpriced in my view. In addition, dilution continues apace.
        While the transition seems to be going well, it remains the case that the more the company sells, the more it loses. This can't continue.
        For those still not convinced, I offer what I think is a reasonable call option. This offers bullish exposure at far less risk in my view.","Since my first “take the money and run” article on Nutanix Inc. (NTNX), the shares are down about 52%. Thirty six percent of that loss has occurred since I published my second bearish article on the name. This puts me on the horns of a dilemma. While it’s nice that bearish calls have worked out well, at some point, even the most flawed company can be a great investment. For that reason, I need to check in on the name again to see if now is a good time to buy. For those who can stand stand the suspense I’ll come right to the point. Nutanix remains a flawed company. In spite of that, the shares remain morbidly overpriced. For that reason I suggest that investors stay away from this stock. That said, for those who remain committed, I suggest call options as an alternative strategy here. They offer much of the same upside as share ownership does, at a fraction of the cost. They are thus a less risky approach in my view.Nutanix is a company in transition in a couple of significant ways. First, the company is shifting away from hardware sales and will therefore eliminate the pass through hardware revenue. Additionally, the company is shifting to a subscription model from a straight up license model of revenue.I'm generally biased to assume the worst about transformations for a host of reasons. That said, even I will admit that the transformation here has been impressive for a host of reasons.First, the company seems to be succeeding at increasing the subscription portion of revenue per the following slide. In particular, Q4 subscription revenue is up a whopping 72% relative to the same period a year ago, and up fully 17% from the previous quarter. As impressive in my view is the fact that revenue decline was relatively muted, in spite of a 64% decline in hardware sales from last year to this. This suggests to me that, ceteris paribus, revenue would have actually increased in the fourth quarter of 2019 relative to the same period a year ago. Source: Nutanix Q4 Earnings presentationSecond, in the face of the transition, customer loyalty remains as high as ever, per the following slide.Source: Nutanix Q4 Earnings presentationAll in, I think a reasonable story here is that 2019 is a year of significant transition for Nutanix. We can assume that if Wall Street is short sighted enough to punish the shares for one year of poor performance, it will be just as myopic when they compare 2020 to 2019. Given that 2019 saw negative revenue growth, this comparison will obviously be much easier. In spite of a transition that's working out well so far, in my view, the problems I’ve written about here in my previous two articles remain. While revenue continues to grow at a very decent clip over the past seven years (up at a CAGR of 69%), net loss continues to bloat during the same time (up at a CAGR of 46%). The question I’ve asked in my past two articles remains unanswered: if growing revenues won’t lead to net income, what will?! I’ve run a correlation on revenue and income for this company and found a very strong negative relationship (r=-.88) between the two. This suggests that the more this company sells, the more it loses. If I were a Nutanix long, I’d urge management to slow the sales effort somewhat, given the eccentric tendency of this company to grow losses as it grows sales.Source: Company filingsThe reason for the disconnect between revenue and net income is, of course, ever growing costs. Sales and marketing, R&D, and General and Admin have grown at CAGRs of 65%, 62%, and 58% respectively. Given that growth in all of these expenses should be expected to grow as the company grows, Nutanix is on a kind of treadmill. To maintain customer interest, it needs to maintain robust sales and R&D efforts. In my view, if these expenses slowed, so would revenue.It should also be said that a significant potential cause for the share price erosion might be the significant dilution that shareholders have experienced over the years. Over the past two years, the share count has grown at a CAGR of ~8.6%.This situation may improve as the company continues its efforts at transformation. After all, subscription revenue has a much higher margin than pass through hardware, for instance. This is evidenced by the fact that gross margin has leapt fully 10 points from FY 2018 to FY 2019. In my view, though, investors wouldn't be harmed by waiting for confirmation. The market had great expectations for Nutanix earlier this year, and the shares were taken down when those expectations weren't met. I would suggest people would be wise to take a lesson from what happens when great expectations aren't met. I would suggest people wait until we have even more proof of a transition. As I’ve said repeatedly, and no doubt tiresomely, even a troubled business like Nutanix can be a great investment if the price is right. The problem is that the shares remain morbidly overvalued in my view.When looking at the stock in my latest bearish piece on Nutanix, I was able to talk about the morbid valuation on a price to free cash flow basis. That avenue is no longer open to me, of course, because there is no free cash flow present. For that reason, I’ll chart the price to operating cash flows. I'm using price to operating cash because that is the only way that I can derive a denominator on which to base a comparison to price. Unsurprisingly, on a price to operating cash flow perspective, the shares are morbidly expensive.Source: GurufocusPlease note that ""operating cash flows"" include non-cash expenses that are economic costs to shareholders (share count dilution, depreciation etc.). For that reason, it could be said the valuation is even more rich than it appears in the chart above. In my view, this is the definition of expensive.Some may quibble that this measure of relative value may not be as meaningful because other companies (like Netflix, for instance) have risen a great deal in price in spite of negative cash flow from operations. I would suggest that that is a naive perspective for a few reasons. First, it is an example of the anchoring bias, which has done so much harm to so many investors over the decades. Analogies to other companies are often fraught with problems, as the analogues are more dissimilar than similar (Netflix, for instance, being worth ~23 times Nutanix's market capitalisation, may be a component of some index that Nutanix isn't, and that will create a disparity in valuations). Second, and perhaps more importantly, Netflix may be great proof for the argument that sooner or later negative cash from operations harms returns. In other words, the argument ""Netflix proves that negative cash flow doesn't matter"" would be much more compelling if Netflix itself hadn't dropped ~30% in price over the past year. In my view, it is likely the case that cash from operations doesn't matter until it does.Some Nutanix longs may remain unconvinced by my reasoning. They may feel as optimistic as they did 36% ago. It may be that the transition will succeed and will drive shares higher. I can understand that some people hold out that hope, given how well the transition seems to be going. But there's a big difference between hope and reality in markets in my view, and I also think there's little harm in waiting for more proof. For those people who want to remain long, I would recommend switching out of the shares and into call options. These offer much of any potential upside here for far less capital at risk. This switch is especially compelling because there's no loss of dividend income from the switch.At the moment, January Nutanix calls with a strike price of $25 last traded hands at $4.21. Switching from the shares to these options would allow the speculator to gain most of any potential upside from these shares while only exposing ~16% of the capital at risk. In my view, investing well is as much about preserving capital as it is about seeking gains, and therefore getting the upside for 16% of the risk makes sense. If the shares rally, the investor will enjoy that gain. If, as I suspect, the shares continue to fall, the call owner will suffer, but far less than the shareholder here.Although there's evidence of a transition, the story of Nutanix remains largely unchanged in my view. The more the company sells, the more it loses. In addition, share count continues to grow, suggesting that dilution will remain a problem into the future. The stock itself remains very expensive on a price to operating cash flow basis. Unfortunately, we can no longer judge it based on free cash flow, as there is no longer any free cash flow. Not to beat a dead horse, but I would recommend that people wait for more proof of a profitable turnaround. For those people who remain hopeful, I would suggest that they sell their shares and switch to call options. In doing so, they will gain exposure to any potential upside here at a fraction of the capital at risk. In my view, that’s the definition of prudent investment."

It is quite conceivable that Nutanix stock could reach its all-time low of $15 before any kind of rebound occurs, especially if SaaS stocks continue to deflate as they have been in the recent past.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Excel)While Nutanix is severely oversold at this time, I have some difficulty considering this as a buying opportunity. Sales growth has fallen dramatically over the last two years, from 85% to 12% TTM. The deceleration in growth can partially be explained away by the company's transition to a subscription-based model and poor sales execution, but I'm not convinced that Nutanix is going to turn on a dime, certainly not this year at least.The company fails the Rule of 40 and has very excessive SG&A expenses that I have a hard time justifying based on financial performance. Therefore, I give Nutanix a neutral rating with the intent of revisiting this stock later in the year. If the stock forms a base and revenue growth returns, then it might be worth buying some stock as a speculative play.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of forward gross profit/enterprise value versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 82 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV, ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database and the most recent gross margin TTM. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Nutanix is sitting well below the trend line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is modestly much lower than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Nutanix is significantly undervalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.High growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40 is a metric for software companies that help them balance growth and profitability. The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.There are several different ways of calculating the Rule of 40:Growth - The standard growth metric is to use the Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) growth rate. For my Rule of 40 calculation, I use percentage sales growth TTM. There are three reasons for this: (1) ARR is not always available; (2) most SaaS companies grow not only organically but also by acquisition; and (3) many companies are in the middle of a transformation to SaaS and have a significant amount of product sales.Profit - I have seen many variants for the profit metric. Some analysts use EBITDA margin, others use operational cash flow margin or free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as I believe that is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.Nutanix's revenue grew by 12.3% for the most recent twelve months, a big fall from the 85% revenue growth at the start of 2017.(Source: Portfolio123)Some of the deceleration in growth can be explained away by Nutanix's transformation to a SaaS business model and poor sales execution discussed later.Nutanix has a free cash flow margin of -2.9% for the most recent twelve-month period.(Source: Portfolio123)Nutanix's YoY revenue growth was 12.3%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was -2.9%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 12.3% - 2.9% = 9.4%Since the Rule of 40 calculation comes out substantially lower than 40%, I conclude that the company has work to do in order to balance growth and profits.As an investor, one wants to make sure that if a company doesn't score well on the Rule of 40, it is at least not burning cash. Unfortunately, Nutanix is, in fact, burning cash. One can tell by examining the SG&A expense relative to sales.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)In the case of Nutanix, the SG&A expense is 115% of the total revenues. This means that Nutanix is spending more on SG&A than its revenue intake, which is generally not a good sign except for extremely high revenue growth stocks. It is also apparent that Nutanix reduced its level of spending in 2018, just when the company was starting its transformation. The company made a gross error by not appreciating the impact that SaaS conversion would have on sales.I have developed a scatter plot that shows forward operating income/EV versus forward sales growth for all of the stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The forward operating income for my purposes is before depreciation and amortization and is calculated as follows:Forward Operating Income = Forward Sales - Cost of Goods Sold TTM - SG&A Expense TTMThe forward versions of Cost of Goods Sold and SG&A expense are assumed to be the same as the trailing twelve months versions.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The operating income is negative and well below its peers. This company either needs to improve revenue growth without increasing sales and marketing expenses or needs to cut sales and marketing expenses without impacting revenue growth. Neither option seems practical in 2019.Shift to SaaS - The transformation into a SaaS business model has caused three revenue-related issues. The first is a high level of customer churn and renewal delays due to customer uncertainty. The second issue is one of perception that revenue is slowing. Subscription revenue is spread across the length of the contract, not recognized upfront as would occur with a perpetual license. The third issue is that sales staff have to be trained on the benefits of the new sales model and software. Otherwise, sales suffer.Poor Guidance - Management clearly blew guidance for the most recent quarter with revenue coming in $2 million below the low end of its guidance.Competition - While YoY revenue decreased by nearly 1% last quarter, Dell EMC VxRail (NYSE:DELL) doubled YoY revenue.Nutanix stock has dropped by more than two thirds in little more than a year and is now approaching an all-time low of $15. Normally, I would consider this a contrarian buying opportunity. But the company is far off meeting the Rule of 40 and is spending more on SG&A than it is bringing in with sales. This level of spending can't be justified based on company performance.I see three reasons for the poor stock price. The first reason is the shift to a subscription model which temporarily affects sales growth and compresses margins. The second reason is poor guidance given by management. The third reason is that Dell VMWare is executing perfectly while Nutanix is stumbling.While the company transformation will eventually result in stable sales growth, the second and third reasons are a bit more difficult. Management has made more than one mistake (sales execution and guidance) and a change at the top may be necessary, perhaps bringing in someone with experience in SaaS. Competition with Dell may be the most difficult obstacle to overcome. I suggest waiting to see some improvement in revenue growth before changing my opinion on this stock. Right now, I give Nutanix a neutral rating."

The embattled Silicon Valley company has been on a sliding curve all year, with investors lamenting the lack of top-line growth and low visibility around the software-only business model shift. However, perceptions warmed considerably after Nutanix reported strong beats in Q4 and offered a more upbeat outlook for the fiscal year ahead. Since reporting Q4 results, Nutanix is up more than 30% from year-to-date lows:Data by YChartsRecall that Nutanix is still at well under half of its previous all-time highs above $60, and I believe this Q4 bounceback represents a buyable turning point for this company.Nutanix set the gears in motion for its software shift more than a year ago. The company announced that it would be eliminating pass-through hardware revenues from its top line, causing an optical drag on quarterly revenue performance. At the same time, the company was increasingly pushing its customers to purchase subscription-based software instead of term licenses, also creating another revenue drag - because when software is purchased on subscription, the revenues are spread out over a longer period of time instead of being recognized upfront.These circumstances led Nutanix to report its first-ever revenue decline in Q3 - which, as a previously high-flying tech IPO, investors cringed to see. However, as Nutanix's subscription mix continues to climb and as lower-margin hardware revenues have gradually thinned from Nutanix's results, investors have begun to see the benefits of a more stable revenue base and richer margins. Nutanix is, in effect, getting a pass to persevere through a period of weaker revenue growth as it shifts its business model in the footsteps of other great software companies like Autodesk (ADSK) and Adobe (ADBE).Make no mistake - revenue growth was still negative in Q4, as it was in Q3. Nutanix doesn't expect the situation to rectify by Q1 either, where the company's guidance of $290-$300 million in software and support revenues falls below 1Q19's revenue of $313.3 million:Figure 1. Nutanix guidance updateSource: Nutanix 4Q19 earnings releaseBut as pass-through hardware gradually fades into the distant past for Nutanix, it should face a period of easy comps in FY20. Wall Street consensus, in fact, is predicting Nutanix to return to positive growth for the full year FY20, with the consensus revenue estimate at $1.38 billion for the year (per Yahoo Finance), representing +12% y/y growth over FY19's revenues of $1.24 billion.Nutanix's pipeline also looks healthy enough to support the renewed bullish sentiment. In late August, Nutanix circulated a press release confirming that it was in the process of obtaining FedRAMP certification for its Xi Cloud Platform, which helps clients set up hybrid cloud deployments. FedRAMP certifications - which allow software vendors to strike deals with federal government agencies - have in some cases led to huge nine-figure deals, as in the case of Salesforce's $100 million contract with the Department of Health and Human Services, signed in 2016. Needless to say, obtaining FedRAMP would open a huge untapped market for Nutanix ad be highly accretive to revenue growth.Taken from the press release:In a nutshell, the future is looking a lot brighter for Nutanix relative to a stormy FY19. Investors have finally accepted the fact that Nutanix's negative revenue growth wasn't an expression of weak end-customer demand or sales execution issues, but simply due to the dual facts that hardware revenues are shedding and that software revenues are being recognized over longer stretches of time. Stay long here and buy on recent strength.Let's now dive deeper into Nutanix's fourth-quarter results:Figure 2. Nutanix 4Q19 earnings resultsSource: Nutanix 4Q19 earnings releaseRevenues declined -1% y/y to $299.9 million, keeping on pace with last quarter's -1% y/y decline; however, unlike last quarter when Wall Street was expecting 3% y/y growth, Nutanix beat expectations handily this quarter. Analyst consensus pegged Q4 revenues at $293.5 million, or -3% y/y.In addition, Nutanix reported billings of $371.7 million, down -6% y/y. It's important to note, however, that the subscription portion of Nutanix's billings is up 30% y/y to $263 million, as shown in the chart below. In addition, the elimination of pass-through hardware also impacted Nutanix here, falling from $36 million in 4Q19 to just $13 million this quarter. The ~$23 million decline is worth roughly six points of growth - so absent the impact of hardware, Nutanix's billings would have been flat. For a company that raised its subscription billings mix from 65% in Q3 to 71% in Q4, this is quite an accomplishment.Figure 3. Nutanix billings trendsSource: Nutanix 4Q19 earnings deckAnother metric that tracks Nutanix's subscription progress is the rapid growth of its annual contract value (ACV), which represents all the revenue that Nutanix has effectively ""locked in"" for the year ahead. In Q4, Nutanix's ACV saw tremendous 61% y/y growth - also illustrating how nascent Nutanix's subscription efforts are.Figure 4. Nutanix ACV trendsSource: Nutanix 4Q19 earnings deckNote as well that Nutanix has held on to a high 137% net expansion rate - meaning that on average, its customers tend to upsize their purchases by 37% in the year following their initial deployment. With a large install base of over 14,000 customers and an ACV that tends to grow at ~40% each year excluding new business, Nutanix has built quite a powerful engine for rather passive growth.Nutanix's software transition has also benefited its margin profile. Pro forma gross margins hit 80.0% in Q4, up 230bps from 77.7% in the year-ago quarter. These high gross margins not only illustrate Nutanix's favorable unit economics, they also put Nutanix in the highest echelon of software gross margins, which tend to fall between 70-80% on a pro forma basis (that is, excluding stock comp and other non-cash charges).Looking ahead to Q1 of next year, Nutanix expects these margin improvements to stick - its Q1 guidance calls for ""approximately 80%"" pro forma gross margins. In addition, the company's Q4 pro forma EPS of -$0.57 also beat Wall Street's expectations of -$0.64.The fruits of Nutanix's software transition are beginning to show more clearly in the form of a rapidly expanding ACV and heightened gross margins. As Nutanix's difficult compares from hardware (as well as a lower subscription mix in the prior year) fade into the background in FY20, and as new initiatives like a possible government deal fill Nutanix's upcoming pipeline, we expect sentiment to keep improving on this beaten-down stock."

Click here to find out more »Just 3 months ago, Nutanix (NTNX) saw its share price tumble over 33% from $50.09 following a weaker-than-expected financial guidance for its fiscal third quarter. The company provided a third-quarter revenue guidance of between $290 million and $300 million, well below consensus estimates of $348 million. As financial results of the third quarter were released on May 30, investors were again left reeling as revenue was registered at $287.6 million, falling below the already lower-than-expected estimates. This quarter also marked a 1% top line decline year-over-year.The fourth-quarter outlook too remains gloomy with expected loss per share of 65 cents on revenue between $280 to $310 million, falling short of Wall Street's estimates of 49 cents per share on revenue of $332.9 million. Accordingly, Nutanix closed at $28.07 on Friday morning, marking a 44% drop from just a quarter ago.Is this huge selloff an opportunity to buy in at an attractive valuation, or should investors steer clear away from a tumbling business? In light of all the noise, here are the key takeaways that investors should be concerned with.Previously operating as a hardware company, Nutanix is in the midst of transiting to a subscription-based revenue model. As enterprises are increasingly moving toward hybrid cloud environments, they demand the same form of licensing flexibility within the private cloud deployments that they get in the public cloud. By adapting to the market trends, Nutanix expects subscription-based sales on its software to provide the company with a steady revenue flow and improved operating leverage in the long run. In the short run, the restructuring of its revenue model has resulted in temporary negative year-over-year revenue growth.The transition towards a subscription model has been a painful one so far, with Nutanix citing the need to allow sales leadership time to affect change and redevelop their sales strategy. This further compounds the problem the company cited last quarter, where capital misallocation away from lead generation was starting to hurt its sales pipeline. In the Q2'19 earnings call, Nutanix’s CEO Dheeraj Pandey stated that the company has “not kept pace with our bullish sales hiring goals,” and said it started taking actions in December and January to reallocate dollars toward demand generation and marketing.In the 3Q’19 earnings call on Friday, Dheeraj heavily emphasized that Nutanix’s transition to a subscription model is ahead of schedule. Let’s take a closer look.Source: Nutanix 3Q'19 Investor PresentationIn 3Q’19, subscription billings and revenue accounted for 65% and 59% respectively, in contrast to the 41% and 28% registered in 3Q’18. More recently, these percentages were 57% and 46% respectively in 2Q’19, demonstrating a strong quarter-on-quarter growth of ~800bps and ~1300bps. In the investor presentation released, Nutanix expects subscription to take up over 80% and 75% of all billings and revenue respectively by CY’21/2Q’22.Looking at how fast Nutanix is growing its subscription business model, especially in the most recent quarter, reaching the targeted 80% and 75% milestone seems extremely plausible, backing Dheeraj’s claim that the transition is ahead of schedule. 26% of total billings remain as non-portable software, which the company has traditionally licensed to the user for the lifetime of hardware appliances. Assuming a four to five years lifespan of off-the-shelf servers, along with Nutanix’s revamped sales strategy, it won’t be long before these customers can be converted to a subscription model.Data from Nutanix 3Q'19 Financial ResultsOperating expenses (OpEx) as a percentage of revenue has substantially increased from a year ago. While OpEx constituted 75% of revenue in Q3’18, it has almost doubled in percentage point to 145% of revenue in Q3’19. The increase in sales and marketing (S&M) expenditure was a large contribution towards the leap, from 43.8% of revenue in 3Q’18 to 85.4% in 3Q’19.This massive increase in OpEx can be attributed to two factors as stated above: transition to a subscription model and improvement in sales pipeline and hiring. In the previous two earnings calls, CFO Duston Williams cited that sales leadership changes have occurred at the worldwide and Americas level. Re-educating sales reps and channel partners on the new subscription model is also a likely cause of the increased S&M spend.Though high OpEx is to be expected to remain over the next couple of quarters as Nutanix continues its restructuring, investors should not be overly concerned. Higher S&M and R&D spend, while incurring a higher burn rate for the company, is necessary for its transition to a SaaS business model. Furthermore, purposeful increase in expenditure is indicative of management’s strategy towards a larger, more sustainable recurring revenue stream through rebuilding its sales pipeline and lead generation. A healthy net cash position of $489 million and largely positive operating cash flow for the past few quarters are also positive indications that Nutanix can comfortably complete this transition.Legacy networking hardware and software titans, including Oracle (ORCL), Cisco (CSCO) and IBM Corp. (IBM), have all once embarked on the painful journey towards subscription models. Internally, Nutanix has shown that it is on the right path and adapting to the needs of the market.Source: Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Hyperconverged Infrastructure Nov'18Nutanix was listed as a leader in both “The Forrester Wave: Hyperconverged Infrastructure” in 2018 Q3 and the “2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Hyperconverged Infrastructure.” Based on Gartner’s Nov 2018 Magic Quadrant, Nutanix edges its competitors in VMware (VMW), Dell EMC (DELL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Cisco as the company with the most complete vision within the Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) industry, as well as having the highest ability to execute it.According to a market research report by MarketsandMarkets, the global HCI market is expected to grow from $4.1 billion in 2018 to $17.1 billion by 2023, at a CAGR of 32.9%. According to a separate CRN report, hyperconverged system sales grew at 52.7% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2018, generating $1.93 billion in revenue. In determining the market share leaders of this expanding category, CRN offers two ways to rank vendors: by the brand of the hyperconverged solution or by the owner of the software providing the hyperconverged capabilities.Data from CRN's Top 4 Hyper-Converged Infrastructure Market Share Leaders ReportBy both measures, Nutanix ranks in second place in terms of market share, displaying market leadership position in this category. VMware, Nutanix’s closest competitor which is also a subsidiary of Dell Technologies, edges Nutanix to be crowned the top software provider in the HCI market.There has been growing concern over VMware rapidly forming partnerships with hardware providers and channel partners, most notably with Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN). Dell Technologies recently announced a partnership with Microsoft to provide Azure VMware Solutions built on VMware Cloud Foundation and deployed in Microsoft Azure. Meanwhile, Amazon and VMware are making their jointly developed VMware Cloud on AWS service more widely available by opening it up to Amazon’s partner network as well as AWS’ own sales force.That being said, given the rapidly expanding HCI market (32.9% CAGR over the next 5 years), there is definitely more than sufficient space for 2 vendors. While VMware may have the front foot, Nutanix isn’t far behind either. Just over a month ago, HPE and Nutanix announced a global partnership to deliver an integrated hybrid cloud as a Service solution to the market. With Nutanix already establishing its dominance as one of the top 2 players in the HCI market, consumers and channels partners alike would benefit from the optionality of having multiple vendors for their different needs.Source: Nutanix 3Q'19 Investor PresentationAdditionally, Nutanix has under its portfolio unique Essentials and Enterprise product offerings, including Calm, Files and the recently acquired Xi Frame. As part of its vision to provide a holistic enterprise data platform, customers could favor Nutanix for the complete package it offers. While the percentage of deals involving one or more of such Essentials and Enterprise products only stands at 23% as of 3Q’19, these product offerings do differentiate the company from its competitors.To examine Nutanix’s relative valuation to a set of 30 enterprise software companies, the companies’ expected percentage growth in revenue over the next twelve months (NTM) were plotted against its enterprise value-to-NTM revenue (EV/S) multiple.Plotted using data from Capital IQ. Expected growth rate of CLDR was adjusted from 76% to 20% to account for the effects of its merger.Based on the best fit line plotted, Nutanix appears slightly overvalued as compared to the mean based on its 6.4% expected growth rate and 3.5x EV/S multiple. However, the company has a much lower expected growth rate as compared to its peers, and this relationship may not be perfectly linear. What we can infer is that Nutanix’s EV/S multiple is likely to increase should its expected growth rate increase over the next few quarters.To examine Nutanix closer within the HCI market, VMware and NetApp (NTAP) were selected for comparison. Larger players in the HCI market, such as Dell EMC and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, were omitted due to HCI being a relatively small fraction of their business model.Data from Capital IQWhile NetApp appears to be least expensive at 2.0x EV/S, it suffers from poor revenue growth and gross margin.Meanwhile, VMware has better expected revenue growth and gross margin at 11.1% and 85.8% respectively. An operating margin of 22.6% also demonstrates much higher profitability as compared to Nutanix at -39.8%, and EV/S multiple is more than double that of Nutanix at 7.2x.As Nutanix is still in the process of converting to a predominantly subscription business model, gross profit margin will continue to increase. Assuming the company can recover from its poor sales outlook caused by the imbalance in lead generation spending, revenue growth would progressively normalize towards higher levels (~20%) over the next few quarters, and we would then expect Nutanix to trade at multiples nearer to that of VMware.This presents an opportunity to go long on a company facing temporary headwinds due to its restructuring. While revenue and earnings are not expected to recover sharply within the next few quarters, the rapidly expanding HCI market provides time and room for Nutanix to restructure. Patient investors will be rewarded when Wall Street regains confidence in the company’s long-term trajectory."

Blow-ups can come in all shapes and sizes and can mean all kinds of different things to different investors. To say that Nutanix (NTNX) has been one of the worst equities to hold this year is an understatement. It is down no less than 39% YTD and has suffered through 2 severe blow-ups. About 2 weeks ago, the company announced the company’s Q3 results, and the shares plunged for the second time, losing 19% on the Friday after the earnings release, with little signs of a bounce since that time. Indeed as I write this on a Friday morning, Nutanix shares are noticeably weak, perhaps as a sympathetic reaction to the problems expressed by Broadcom (AVGO), although the correlation between Broadcom and Nutanix is not readily apparent. But then again, it is also possible that the shares are suffering from a false news headline to the effect that the company guided down again-which it hasn't since it released its earnings. The share price implosion is a blow-up by any standards-but the question is did investors mis-interpret, did that panic, or is there something really wrong in the land of this Hyper-Converged pioneer. No prizes for guessing my answer.I have recommended these shares for some time now-years in fact, I own them personally and for clients and have every intention of continuing to do so. On a short term basis, the shares have made a new 52 week low, and this has seemingly engendered further selling-the level of fear and uncertainty surrounding these shares has reached a frightening level.In the wake of the conference call, and subsequent discussion on the pages of SA and elsewhere, and certainly amongst some of the subscribers to my investment blog, Ticker Target, I recently had the opportunity to speak with company management (in fact the Manager of Investor Relations) to try to get some more in-depth commentary regarding where Nutanix is and what its outlook might be. I think there is lots of mis-information in the environment and this mis-information has created an outstanding investment opportunity. No, Nutanix is not a company without issues-but the issues are certainly being addressed and the last quarter’s results were far better than may have met some eyes.I think the role of analysts in helping readers/subscribers to form an investment decision is to interpret financial statements in a nuanced and objective fashion. We can all read headlines-but headlines are really not descriptive as to what is happening within a business. Sooner or later, the details matter. The question is-what happened at Nutanix last quarter and what does that mean in terms of analyzing the company’s future.Nutanix time on the cross really started when the company released earnings for its fiscal Q2 and acknowledged issues with its selling motion and the available resources it had in terms of pipeline creation. At that point, the shares went from $55 to $33. Subsequently, the shares recovered to a degree and reached $43 in the wake of an analyst meeting that reaffirmed strong growth targets and suggested progress was being achieved in terms of remediating both the issue of sales resources, and sales execution.That stability didn’t last long, as the shares reacted to what was perceived as a revenue miss in terms of Q3 results. The company had forecast that revenues for the quarter were going to reach $290-$300 million; actual results showed revenues of $288 million. Billings, which most analysts focus on as an indication of the strength in the selling motion, were $346 million, below prior management guidance of $360-$370 million.Guidance for the current quarter was for revenues in the range of $280-$310 million and for bookings in the range of $350-$380 million. These are somewhat broader ranges than is typical for company forecasts, and reflect a more than usual uncertainty regarding the quarter. The guidance was notably lower than prior published consensus analyst forecasts indicated by First Call.  That guidance yielded a flock of downward analyst estimate revisions and a couple of ratings downgrades.There are some very specific qualifications that should be considered before concluding that Nutanix “missed” and that the 18% share price reaction was warranted. There were two discrete factors that brought reported revenue results below the consensus. The first of these, and completely straight forward, is that the company had $8 million less of hardware revenues and bookings than it had forecast. This should be of no consequence to investors. Hardware revenues are pass through and have no gross margins. The company decided some time ago to exit the hardware business and to let its partners sell hardware on which its software runs. It really makes no sense, whatsoever, to consider hardware revenue of any significance in evaluating the performance of this vendor. Some of the so-called “guide-down” is a function of forecasting lower hardware revenues. This is graphically depicted in the company's slide deck which is linked here. The other factor is the vexed issue of the transition to subscription billings. This is a vexed issue because some investors and commentators refuse to acknowledge that it is happening and that it has very specific, and basically positive consequences over the longer term for the company. Nutanix has had a variety of consumption options for its software. It is possible that some SKU's have had as many as 20 consumption options according to the CEO. These have included term licenses, portable licenses, device licenses etc. These consumption arrangements were those that were popular with users at the time they were made available.Some time ago, the company announced its transition to subscription license arrangements and that transition has gained in velocity over the past year. The company at the time when it was seeing overwhelming demand growth for its products, did not really attempt to elucidate either the cadence or the financial impact of the transition. That was most certainly an error in judgement, but one that had nothing whatsoever to do with the operational performance of the company.Fast forward to this most recent quarter. 65% of total bookings and 59% of total revenues are coming from subscription arrangement. These arrangements recognize revenues in accordance with ASC 606. I do not think anyone contemplated the cadence of the acceptance of subscription revenues by the user base and by new clients. The sequential growth of subscription revenues in Q3 was huge-essentially subscription revenues were replacing revenues from non-portable license arrangements. My interview with the company focused on the quantification of the impact of the transition. Essentially, the company has determined that the difference in reported revenues in Q3, as compared to revenues that would have been reported absent the transition was about $10 million.Simply put, on an economic basis, the kind that analysts are supposed to calculate, Nutanix revenues were the equivalent of $306 million and not the $288 million actually reported. In other words, based on what the company had forecast when it provided Q3 guidance, and considering the business on an apples to apples basis, the quarter was a beat and not a miss. Is this an intellectual exercise with no relevance in the investment world? At some point, investors will be driven to look at what is actually happening in the Nutanix business, and not the picture being presented by headline. But it seems obvious that the time for such consideration hasn’t yet arrived.When looking at Nutanix as a business, there is reality and then there is there are fears. The fears at this point are overwhelming; the reality is far from dire-at least for a company whose EV/S valuation is now less than 2.7X, an extraordinary metric for the growth potential of this business.Nutanix has had sales execution issues. The issues are composed in part because of lower than anticipated sales productivity, because of issues with sales leadership, and because of issues with sales resources. Those issues are real and are being addressed. New customer bookings only accounted for 25% of the company’s business last quarter, and that is down from 29% in the previous year, and probably below the target for a company such as this which thrives on new customer capture.The company has made sales management changes in the North American geo, and in turn, the new head of the geo has replaced a substantial number of regional and district managers and made other organizational changes as well. Our interlocutor suggested that most of the personal changes necessary to improve sales performance in North America have been made, and it would be reasonable to start to see improvements in that geo as the year progresses.For some quarters, Nutanix had been below its sales force hiring plan, and that was one factor the company has cited in its weaker performance in terms of pipeline generation. This is not a figment, and indeed, the CFO had pointed out the shortfall on several conference calls as early as on the call one year ago. There was supposed to be a “full court press” in hiring to make up the shortfall back then and it didn’t happen in any visible fashion until this last quarter. Last quarter, the company made up some ground in that regard and hired 50 new quota carrying reps but inevitably it will take 6 months or more before these new hires achieve a level of productivity high enough to move the needle.The company has made progress in generating new pipeline. Overall, as was expressed on the call, and reemphasized to me by the investment relations manager, Nutanix grew its pipeline by 40% last quarter, the highest percentage growth in more than 5 years. That said, pipeline growth is not the same as orders and revenues, and it will be some time period before the level of pipeline conversion becomes apparent. It is a hopeful, but not dispositive sign.The company has had issues with its selling motion. Some of those clearly relate to the complexity of the different consumption models. Not all sales folks have been successful in making a transition to selling subscriptions and explaining alternative consumption models. Over time, as more of the company’s products are only available on a subscription basis, with different subscription time periods, the complexity of the offering will be ameliorated.The company may have not closed some sales last quarter because of the multiple transitions that were underway in the company’s sales management. That is what was said on the call and reiterated to me. Company management reiterated that its bookings were disappointing, and should have been stronger. But the other side of that is that at this point the company has made the requisite changes, and presumably going forward, friction in the selling process will abate.But I think that it easy to exaggerate the issues involved with the company’s selling processes and complexity. The company did close the largest new order in its history-a $6 million sale to one of the big 4 accounting firms which had been using a different brand of infrastructure. The company booked an “expand” deal worth $4 million with a large French hospitality business that includes a substantial suite of non HCI solutions. The company’s ACV metric grew by 69%, which is not bad for a “blown” quarter. Overall, 23% of the deals last quarter had offerings that were beyond the company’s core HCI platform.Overall the quarter saw Nutanix close 50 deals of greater than $1 million and 8 of those were worth more than $3 million. A year ago the company had a 33% adoption rate for its hypervisor, Acropolis. That has now reached 42% and continues to increase.The company did not fix its sales execution issues in whole last quarter-but neither were the results terribly disappointing. Part of what is ailing Nutanix relates to the care and specificity of setting expectations rather than to some material deterioration in the company’s operational performance or deterioration of its competitive positioning or final demand. I will try to address those concerns in the next two sections of the article.If there is one single concern that investors seem to have relating to Nutanix, it is the company’s positioning vis-à-vis Dell (DELL). Dell, and its subsidiary/affiliate, VMWare (VMW) offer an alternative HCI solution-one that is not surprisingly composed of all Dell solutions and which includes the VMW hypervisor called ESXi, Dell hardware and vSphere, preconfigured in a single appliance called VxRail. A couple pf things to note-VxRail is a successor product to what is called VSPEX Blue. This is important to note for readers mainly because it muddies the statistics that Dell reports. Much of the business that VMW talks about is not net new, but a replacement of older Dell appliances with newer ones. To a certain extent, what is being reported by Dell when it talks about triple digit growth for VxRail is not the adoption of Dell HCI but the replacement of 13 prior generations of VMWare/EMC infrastructure, including infrastructure composed of non-flash memory components.That is not to say that the combination of Dell and VMWare aren't and will not be formidable competitors in the HCI space. Michael Dell has a strong record of achievement over the years. I am old enough to remember when Round Rock, TX was barely a bump in the road north of Austin. Today it is a city with 123,00 people and the headquarters of Dell Technologies. Forbes ranks Mr. Dell as the 17th richest individual on its 400 list. Dell is a force to be reckoned with, but it is easy to exaggerate its competitive capabilities.Indeed, when reading that VxRail had “triple digit growth” and then concluding that Dell is the 600 lb. gorilla in the space isn’t really accurate, any more than reading that Oracle’s cloud offerings are growing at some prodigious rate. Oracle is really not competing effectively with Workday (WDAY). Dell has advantages to be sure and some users like to buy preconfigured appliances from a single vendor like Dell, but Nutanix also has a fair number of substantial advantages it brings to the table and which resonate with users.I believe, however, that many investors have a conception that Dell is now focused on the hyper-converged space and that this means that Nutanix will be unable to reach its objectives. I believe that as an investment, Nutanix suffers substantially because of this perception, and that in the wake of the two quarterly “misses” that Nutanix has sustained, a substantial belief has arisen to the effect that Nutanix’s losses have come at the hands of Dell.I do not want to suggest that I am some authority on evaluating products in the IT space. As the saying goes, I know enough to be dangerous-and not more than that. For readers who want to look at the 3rd party evaluations of Nutanix and Dell, I have linked the Gartner survey here. Other surveys are linked here.Perhaps a better way of understanding the competition is a blog that Nutanix has published called “Say Goodbye to the vTax.” Yes, it is a commercial-the author obviously works for Nutanix. One thing readers will see, if they click the link is that essentially all of Nutanix wins are either replacements of VMware or bake-offs against VMware. Most VxRail wins are simply upgrades from one generation of EMC hardware/software to the current generation. Another aspect of the Nutanix advantage is ease of use and simplicity. Is that true-well the references cited say it is and I am not about to argue. Another conspicuous advantage is that of Total Cost of Ownership-Nutanix can look higher priced until all of the add-ons and “true-ups” one pays with Dell are considered. Another advantage is the arising Nutanix ecosystem which has solutions that are beyond HCI infrastructure. But finally there are those users who are anxious to avoid lock-ins, and anxious to avoid single vendor architectures.As I said at the outset of this article, it is based on my interview with company management. I would not expect any company to acknowledge that they are losing market share or do not have a more functional solution when compared to their competitors. But I think that quite a bit that has been written about Nutanix and its competition with VxRail is simply ill-informed and reaches unlikely conclusions.In April, HPE (HPE) and Nutanix decided to develop a partnership to offer Hyper-converged infrastructure. What is interesting, particularly, about that is that 18 months ago, Hewlett had bought a significant competitor in the space, SimpliVity. I have linked to a couple of press releases regarding the partnership. Again, they are press releases and subject to hyperbole and inaccuracy, but the fact is that the partnership has been driven because HPE customers wanted the opportunity to use Nutanix software. I think that is a pretty solid bit of evidence that users consider the Nutanix software offering and its hypervisor something that is something they want to acquire. (The Nutanix hypervisor is actually free.). It is possible that this combination which includes 2 HPE consumption models-both the GreenLake managed service and a prepackaged appliance, might, over time, yield a 10% customer for Nutanix.For what it is worth, I expect that looking at the landscape of HCI on a holistic basis, Nutanix has been and continues to gain market share. It has advantages of functionality, simplicity, TCO and multiplicity of choice that are hard to duplicate by a large incumbent. Once the company develops a comprehensive set of appropriate sales practices and backs those practices with appropriate resources, the competitive advantages of Nutanix will become apparent.I want to close this segment by commenting on an announcement made by Nutanix during its conference call that is related to competition, but not related to Dell. The company has previewed what it calls Xi Clusters. Xi Clusters will deliver the Nutanix infrastructure directly on AWS EC2 bare metal instance. From time to time some analysts write about the world going to the cloud and the trend to cloud eating into demand for use of HCI infrastructure. There is little doubt that one of the killer use cases these days is the lift and shift of legacy applications to the cloud. This offering (Xi Clusters) is indeed designed to facilitate that kind of movement-but with Nutanix. It is a one-click way of moving on-prem apps to a public cloud data center and should be a significant demand driver for Nutanix. I have linked to the announcement here for those interested in more details.I am not going to try to write some treatise concerning the demand pattern for IT hardware. Again, others have taken surveys, and engaged consultants. But the fact is that most of the available data suggest that HCI demand continues to grow rapidly, and the reason for that is that it is essentially replacing the prior standard of converged infrastructure. Maybe the percentage growth in demand would be greater if there were a better environment regarding IT hardware spending. But basically, as users decide to modernize their infrastructure, they modernize it with HCI and that is the growth story. The largest win of Nutanix last quarter was just such an instance where the Big 4 accounting user decided to replace its legacy infrastructure with HCI.Overall, last quarter 75% of Nutanix sales were to existing customers who were expanding their usage of Nutanix within their organization. Most of that is the expansion of Nutanix HCI solutions outside of its initial deployment to other divisions and departments, and is really not terribly correlated with the demand growth for IT hardware.Like most analysts, I have seen some surveys that reflect some slowdown in overall IT demand that has suggested a 1H slowdown followed by a recovery in 2H and more so in 2020. I think it is a mistake to try to conflate high level cyclical trends with the specific performance of Nutanix, or some of the other smaller IT vendors who are more dependent on market share changes, than on some other metric in terms of their growth. I do think that last year was a year in which market conditions were a tailwind. That tailwind is no longer there, but I think it is an error to try to correlate current IT demand trends with some of the past cyclical trends in the space, and try to forecast the results of Nutanix correlated to what might be considered an IT hardware demand proxy. This just isn’t the same as constructing a scenario of Cloud Titan capex and correlating that to Arista (ANET) revenue growth.The latest market share statistics come from IDC. They are to be sure a lagging indicator. But they show a 57% growth in the market, with essentially Nutanix keeping pace in terms of market share based on just sales of HCI software. I am not going to try to debate how market share is, or ought to be measured and I am not sure that even the people who put together the IDC survey would really be in a position to try to compare apples to apples. But the least that can be said with regard to end demand for HCI systems is that it continues at very rapid rates, with no real signs of a cyclical slowdown.What is happening in gross terms is that the market for converged systems is growing by 15% and within that overall statistic, the market for hyperconverged systems is growing at 57% and has reached about $2 billion/quarter. Dell is involved in both converged and hyperconverged while Nutanix is just involved in hyperconverged segment. Much of Dell’s growth in hyperconverged is a function of migration; none of the growth of Nutanix is a function migration as it has no converged systems installed base to migrate.The latest 3rd party surveys on the HCI market show the CAGR to be a blistering 38%. This study was published at the end of April. The report is worth reading as it makes the case that the HCI solution can be an alternative to public cloud deployment. Given that Nutanix now has a foot in both camps so to speak, it suggests one reason why its growth ought to resume at a robust pace once the impact of the transitions is past and the sales execution paradigm becomes stable.Since Nutanix cut its guidance in the call at the end of May, and even before then, much has been published about the company’s opex spending in the midst of what is perceived as its revenue drought. Is that justified? Does the management of this company have a plan to reach profitability?First of all, one of the things that happens in the midst of a transition to subscription revenue, is that expenses as reported, essentially remain constant, while reported revenues decline. This is not a phenomenon unique to Nutanix, but is consistent for all companies that have made the transition. Indeed, because of the adoption of ASC 606, this has become a slightly lesser factor in terms of reported results than heretofore.But more basic, I think, is the fact that far from spending too much is that Nutanix has not optimized its sales resources to take advantage of the HCI opportunity. Yes, over time, it would be reasonable to expect that the company to improve its sales efficiency. But it has underspent that metric for some period of time, and that has been a factor in its current revenue performance. One can either believe or disbelieve the latest HCI growth forecast cited above. But if it is right, or even partially right, it would be very dysfunctional for this company to attempt to under-invest in lead generation and overall salesforce infrastructure.Last quarter, the company’s opex was $416 million on a GAAP basis, or $329 million on a non-GAAP basis. That is up substantially from opex of $276 on a GAAP basis in Q3-2018, or $237 million on a non-GAAP basis. On a sequential basis, which is perhaps the clearest comparison, operating expense rose by 14% sequentially. But it should be noted that the company has forecast that opex will grow by just 4% sequentially, and most of that is a function of the additional sales headcount that was just added, and the effects of Q4 seasonality on overall spending.This company, at various times in the recent past, has shown a great deal of expense discipline, and indeed perhaps too much expense discipline to optimize its growth and land and expand strategy. The company continues to introduce technology at a breathtaking pace-and that is not hyperbole. I am not going to recapitulate all of the new products and services the company is launching or has recently launched. No doubt, not all of those services will achieve marketplace acceptance. But some of the newer products are seeing substantial uptake. As noted earlier, one of the larger deals cited on the conference call this quarter called out a $4 million term based subscription booking for services outside the core HCI platform.Over the past years, I have had the opportunity to speak with the company CFO on a couple of occasions. The fact is, that like many CFO’s in the IT space, he is well versed in balancing growth and spending, and I have no reason to believe that this discipline has been lost in the past few quarters. In many quarters, the conference call transcript has indicated that the company has not spent its expense budget-sometimes based on hiring issues, and sometimes based on prudence in the wake of sales execution issues. The company has already put on the expense brakes and it is likely that the jaws of the scissors will relax in coming quarters.The company reported an operating cash burn last quarter of about $36.5 million, reversing the level of cash generation of $38.5 million in the preceding quarter and $13.3 million the preceding year. Essentially all of the negative variance both sequentially and year on year can be related to rise in subscription billings which as mentioned defer billings as compared to non-portable licenses and the rise of SaaS revenues. Overall, the 69% year over year growth in ACV as compared to the 55% growth in deferred revenues is an indication of the pressures on cash flow from the development of SaaS and subscription bookings. ACV continued to grow at consistent rates in Q3 and should suggest that the company’s longer term profitability has not been really compromised.An investment in Nutanix shares has been one of the poorest choices to have made so far in 2019. I am painfully aware of just how difficult it has been to hold the shares, let alone buy them. The shares seem star-crossed, at least in part, with valuations having fallen prey to everything from real concerns about sales execution and sales resources, to ignorance regarding the issue of a transition to a subscription revenue model and finally (at least on Friday June 14th) to a spurious headline about the company reducing its outlook. It would be comic relief, if it weren’t so painful to live through.Nutanix shares are not likely to take off and soar in the short term. No one who reads this should expect that. The company has not communicated effectively with investors-it still isn’t really providing all of the metrics such as an ACV forecast that other companies in transition have been able to provide. The other side of that is of course the valuation. At this writing, the shares are priced at 2.7X EV/S, a metric at the same level as Commvault (CVLT) and well below the level of VMWare. Growth without profitability and cash flow generations is useless-but equally true is that a company building a base of unbilled backlog is substantially understating its economic well-being.I do not make a habit of either catching falling knives or making excuses for failing businesses. And I would be the last to suggest that Nutanix hasn’t made its share of unforced errors. But it is sill a leader, if not the leader in one of the most significant transformative technologies to come along in recent years. And its vision and execution beyond the hyper-converged space is substantive and is likely to produce sustained revenue growth for years to come.A year ago this time, Nutanix was judged as being incapable of doing wrong and now it is judged incapable of correcting its ills. As is typical in these situations, the conventional wisdom has gotten out of hand, I believe. One thing to note is that with the array of technologies the company has brought to the market, its value to potential acquisitors has gotten greater. Of course I have no idea if lightening will strike-but there is a lengthy list of businesses who could create substantial revenue and cost synergies with these assets.As bad as Nutanix shares have performed over the past 12 months and since the start of the year, the opportunity for the coming quarters has gotten greater. The management team does need to execute and there are those who believe that its management is more focused on products than growth and profitability and sales execution. I can’t prove just how this movie turns out, but at this valuation, my bet would be that management will be able to do well for its shareholders going forward and that the recent past will not be prologue to additional disappointments."
4269644,105197,2019-06-19T08:00:00-04:00,"Nutanix’s stock has taken a beating due to the company’s business model transition to subscription and sales planning issues.Despite Nutanix’s technology leadership, the company’s growth appears to be getting hampered due to the lack of a dedicated relationship with the large server or cloud players.We note a significant similarity in Nutanix’s current state and Red Hat’s situation before the IBM deal.In case a similar merger was to come through, Nutanix’s stock price could return up to 80% from the current levels.","Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) was a favorite of the markets until a while back when the company came out with issues of sales planning-led growth weakness. What seems to have compounded the issues for Nutanix is the transition to a subscription-based model, further depressing revenue and worrying the street. We think the stock may have been oversold with the stock falling almost 50% since its Q2 2019 earnings.The markets also do not appear to be accounting for the partnership between Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Nutanix in the hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) market. In April 2019, the companies announced a partnership where Nutanix’s software would be bundled and sold along with HPE’s hardware through HPE’s GreenLake. The resultant hybrid cloud as a service will be managed by HPE.While this partnership may appear to be another industry association aimed at benefiting from a vertical bundle, there is more to it than meets the eye. HPE’s current offering, SimpliVity, is available as an HPE specific appliance. We also note that HPE remains a distant third in the HCI market behind VMware (VMW) and Nutanix.Given HPE’s laser focus on growing its $2.5 billion GreenLake business even faster, the partnership with Nutanix could mean that the company is willing to endorse a product that has been better than HPE’s own offering to help further accelerate GreenLake’s adoption. While some may consider HPE to be offering SimpliVity revenue as a sacrificial lamb to increase adoption of the GreenLake business, we see this also creating the second pole in the HCI market.In addition, we also find stark similarities to where Red Hat was prior to the IBM (IBM) announcement to acquire Red Hat (RHT) and draw a parallel with Nutanix. Overall, we think, at the current juncture, Nutanix presents a low-risk bet that can deliver stellar returns.We begin by looking at Nutanix’s core market, that of hyperconverged infrastructure and then build out our analysis of how much returns could be expected of the company’s stock and at what level of risk.HCI started out as modules that contain virtualization, storage, compute and networking infrastructure, aimed at simplifying scale-up for data centers with standardized workloads. However, the scope of HCI has evolved to become more software-oriented and capable of running commodity hardware. HCI, thus, now extends beyond that of data center simplification towards enabling hybrid/multi-cloud environments. While pure play hybrid cloud systems should be able to provide for integrating multiple cloud assets, HCI was more geared towards elevating private clouds to the level of abstraction and consumption of a private cloud. With the convergence of HCI and hybrid cloud management, Nutanix has emerged as an important player in the cloud integration business. In the HCI market, the company has been a clear technology leader.Source: 2019 Nutanix Investor DayIn our series ‘Masters Of Cloud’ (part 1, part 2, part 3), there was a significant reader interest in us looking at Nutanix. While we had acknowledged Nutanix as a notable player, the reasons for not considering the company were:Source: Q3 2019 Nutanix Earnings PresentationThis rapid shift in business did not just surprise us but was even ahead of management anticipation. Furthermore, Nutanix’s CFO stated that this transition also caused some friction in the field selling and the need for continued education of the subscription offering could extend sales cycles for the company. To top it all off, the company states expectations of more than normal volatility in quarterly results on account of this transition.VMware, Nutanix's most prominent competitor, has three levels of partner engagement for its VMware Cloud Foundation:Nutanix lacks this level of engagement. We believe that while the approach of keeping systems open is the logical way forward, the lack of bundling also hurts market share.In a perfect world, customers should have a friction-less environment to make the best choice for themselves. However, the real world is dominated by channel partners, who will rather sell the highest commission products as opposed to what may be the best for the customer (classic agency problem!).Thus, to address all the three issues highlighted above, a simple solution for Nutanix would be to find a larger company to partner with symbiotically.However, the challenge is likely to be that who could be Nutanix’s knight in shining armor. The HCI market broadly has four players: VMware, Nutanix, Dell, and HPE; Dell is VMware’s parent, and HPE and Nutanix secured a tie-up earlier this year.Considering that the HCI market has been expanding and overlaps with the virtualization market, we look at the other potential partners. Our list consists of the usual suspects from the public cloud world, given a partnership with them is what is likely to help Nutanix best.Source: IBM Investor RelationsConsidering the dynamics laid out above, we believe the potential of Nutanix’s technology and the wave of consolidation and alliances in the hybrid cloud space could push the company towards a merger. Although the merger may be resisted by the management, we try to establish the value of the company on a standalone basis and as that of a potential target.Why do we think a merger could be on the cards?By Nutanix’s management’s admission, the transition to subscription is unpredictable and is likely to take a few quarters to play out. In addition, customer education is another challenge that may also dampen sales growth. The nature of Nutanix's commentary over the last couple of quarters has a strong resemblance to Red Hat management’s commentary in the quarters before IBM announced its intent to buy Red Hat. Source: Earnings transcripts from Seeking Alpha, Author analysisThe Red Hat storyThe Nutanix storyIn addition to the similarity in narratives of large hardware and services companies (IBM, in case of Red Hat, and HPE, in case of Nutanix) partnering with technically competent, sales inefficient companies, there are also some differences:In view of the challenges outlined, in addition to valuing it as a merger candidate, we also estimate Nutanix’s valuation as a standalone company.Standalone basisFor fiscal 2019, the company could report total revenues of $1.3 billion (this 12% y/y annual growth will imply that the Nutanix reports Q4 revenue of $360 million, ahead of its guided range of $280-310 million). While we feel this is a bullish assumption, the company’s growing pipeline of leads and partnerships could help achieve this number. Stepping into the next year (2020), with the benefit of stability in sales and giving Nutanix the advantage of its leading technology, we look at a range of possibilities:Source: Company filings, Author estimatesWe believe that 2020 revenue growth range of 10-20% captures a conservative range of Nutanix's growth as a standalone company (after considering the subscription transition also).The factors that line up against Nutanix's sales growth are:The factors that can act as a tailwind to revenue growth are:HPE was at a $100 million per quarter run rate as of the fourth quarter of 2018, growing at almost 70% y/y. Considering the alliance with HPE, if Nutanix’s improved go-to-market is able to win just 10% share from HPE and 2% from VMware (run rate of 730 million/quarter in the fourth quarter of 2018, growing at 86% y/y), Nutanix could add $20-25 million for the quarter and $80-100 million for the next year. At Nutanix’s base revenue of $1.3 billion, this translates into 6-8% growth from the HPE partnership alone. Furthermore, assuming that the y/y sales decline for Nutanix are likely to be arrested. If the company could even do 2-3% y/y growth (ex-HPE), we arrive at 10% y/y growth for 2020 or our bear case.A small step-up in Nutanix’s share gain from either of the competitors or even a small improvement in the company's selling process versus our bear case can easily propel the company's revenue to a 20% growth. However, we think the base case of 15% may be a more realistic number given that Nutanix is one of the more expensive solutions in the market, and the macro-economic weakness has not been helping.Thus, we feel comfortable about a 14-15% upside from the current levels, on a standalone basis.As an acquisition candidate Qualitatively speaking, in addition to enhancing Nutanix's sales capability, the synergies in such a case would arise from the vertical integration that Nutanix would bring on top of the infrastructure that the buyer would have. Not only is it difficult to estimate the synergy benefits arising from such a situation but also is the price at which this deal may occur. In order to arrive at the potential returns, we look at the Red Hat and Nutanix’s stock price performance.Data by YChartsThe fall in Red Hat's stock price in June 2018 and the steep increase in October 2018 are the highlights of the graph.Data by YChartsThe drop in Nutanix's stock price post Q2 results this year has been even more spectacular than Red Hat's fall post Red Hat's Q1 in June 2018.We note that after reporting Q2, Nutanix’s stock fell from $50 to $34. Post Q3, the stock again fell from $34 to $28. Going back to 2018, Red Hat had fallen from $170 to $134 after reporting its Q1 and from $143 to all the way to $117 before the announcement of the IBM deal at $190 per share.Source: Yahoo Finance, Company filings, Author estimatesIBM's offer for Red Hat at $190 was at a 30% premium to Red Hat's average closing price of the last six months prior to the deal, $147. Considering Nutanix is a smaller and a more niche play on the HCI market than Red Hat was, we apply a 20% premium to average of Nutanix’s stock price over the last six months (Dec. 18 - May 19) of $42.6, which comes out to $51 per share or at an equity value of $9.5 billion.Compared to IBM’s offer of $34 billion, the number is much smaller, and so is Nutanix. At $34 billion, the Red Hat deal was valued at a price to sales multiple of a little over 10 times and at $9.5 billion, Nutanix would be valued at a little over 7 times price to sales.We believe the risk-reward profile of Nutanix’s stock has turned favorable with a potential downside of 18% versus a potential upside of up to 82%. Barring macro risks from the trade war, we expect significant return either from a sales turnaround by way of enhanced partnerships or from a potential buyout."
4276308,99986,2019-07-21T23:18:36-04:00,"Despite the fact that the software group is more than 10% above its October 2018 highs, Nutanix is 60% below its 2018 highs.The company has seen a rapid deceleration in its revenue growth rate, from exceptional levels of 80% two years ago, to negative in the most recent quarter.Nutanix may be able to put together some sort of bounce if the market remains strong, I believe the best course of action is to take profit into strength.","While most investors could have thrown a dart at the software group (IGV) to pick stocks and come away a winner this year, the two exceptions have been Nutanix (NTNX) and Avaya Holdings (OTC:AVYA) which were decimated in the face of a strong market. The weakness in both names is not surprising, given that both have decelerating revenue growth, with Nutanix's being the most pronounced. Unfortunately, many investors pounced on Nutanix, hoping it would play catch-up with the more loved names like Twilio (TWLO) and Coupa Software (COUP), but this is not how the market generally works. The laggard in a sector with inferior fundamentals is not going to share the same success as the leaders, as it is nowhere near the same class. To apply this logic to a real-world example, this is like an NHL GM drafting Brendan Leipsic of the Capitals and hoping he'll turn out to be an Ovechkin because they're both left-wingers on the same team. It just doesn't work that way. It is entirely possible that Nutanix can play a little catch-up if the overall market remains strong, but I believe any sharp rallies are a chance for investors to take their profits (or narrower losses) and run.(Source: TC2000.com)As we can see from the above chart of the software group on the left and Nutanix on the right, Nutanix is locked in an intermediate downtrend and can't even stay afloat with a powerful sector move to aid it. It is one thing if a stock can't maintain its uptrend in a flat market, but it's entirely another when a stock is continuously making new lows with the market making new highs. Fundamental analysts will come up with every reason under the sun why the stock is undervalued and will surely join the rally very soon, but the price action ultimately tells the story. If funds are bolting out of Nutanix at the pace they are despite a rising overall market, there's no reason we as investors should stick our neck out. By looking at fund ownership statistics the past year and a half, we can see that fund ownership is now trending down, with a drop of 55 funds holding Nutanix in the most recent quarter alone. The two-year chart of fund ownership I've built below shows that the trend has changed abruptly since Q3 2018, and this has coincided with the continued deceleration in revenue growth. To be clear, companies without positive earnings per share [EPS] can be attractive long ideas if sales growth is robust. However, if that sales growth goes out the window like in the case of Nutanix, the strength of the investment thesis quickly begins to weaken.(Source: Author's Chart, Investors.com)Taking a look at revenue growth rates below, we can see just how dramatic this deceleration discussed above has been. Revenue growth rates were previously incredibly high at 80% year-over-year, but have come all the way down to a negative year-over-year print in the company's fiscal Q3 2019 report. This deceleration is not expected to halt just yet, with estimates for Q4 2019 currently at $293.2 million, a nearly 4% drop-off from the $303.8 million reported in Q3 2018. This is a significant U-turn, and it's difficult to see any path to positive earnings per share with such a dramatic slow-down in revenues. While earnings per share losses were narrowing between FY-2016 and FY-2018 improving from (-) $1.10 to (-) $0.62 in EPS, they are now widening yet again, and this trend is not expected to change either. FY-2019 EPS is expected to come in at (-) $1.58, with FY-2020 EPS estimates currently at (-) $1.99.As mentioned earlier, negative EPS is not a massive issue as it often takes quite a few years to move to profitability, and in many cases, up to a decade or longer. The problem is that if there are no earnings, there have to be sales to interest the majority of growth funds. When there's neither, it's hard to justify an investment. When it comes to Nutanix, growth investors plowed into the stock as we can see from fund ownership, thanks to exceptional rates of revenue growth, and they've had to plow back out due to the complete erosion of this growth over a two-year span.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)If we examine the chart of annual earnings per share below, we can see that net losses in earnings per share had begun to narrow for FY-2017 and FY-2018, but now are widening yet again. For my strategies at least, this is not ideal. If I am watching growth stocks for potential purchase, I prefer to see net losses narrowing over the next year or two if earnings are not on the table yet. In terms of Nutanix, this is no longer the case. FY-2019 earnings are expected at (-) $1.58, with FY-2020 earnings estimates at (-) $1.99 currently. While impossible to extrapolate off of this trend, it's difficult to imagine Nutanix having positive earnings per share until at least FY-2022.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)While there are several fundamental analysts lined up suggesting that Nutanix has been a buy since $30.00, and continues to be a buy at current levels, I am much less convinced the stock is an investor's best friend here. Short-term traders may be able to find some opportunities in the stock if they are nimble and willing to sell into sharp rallies, but I prefer my investments where I can sit back and let them work, not worry about the next overhead resistance where trapped buyers might be looking to trim positions. Nutanix has a mountain of overhead supply from its breakdown this prior year, and the first logical resistance area comes in at $35.10 where it broke down. Past significant support levels can become resistance levels when they are re-tested, and this area is represented by $35.00 for Nutanix.The good news is that Nutanix is expected to regain some top-line momentum in FY-2020 and that gross margins are improving with the shift away from their prior pass-through hardware sales model. The other good news is that the company is seeing sequential gains in customers, with another bump last quarter of 6%. The bad news is that stocks in bear markets tend to push past what are fair valuations, and trying to find the bottom in stocks based on valuation can be very difficult. Stocks with negative momentum, negative sentiment, and negative top-line momentum currently are generally not the best buy-the-dip opportunities. Until we can see a material turnaround in top-line growth, I do not see Nutanix as an attractive investment at current levels. It may be an opportunity for bottom-fishing swing traders, but it's not something I would park in my portfolio if I see resistance 30% higher, and potential downside of another 20% if the overall market weakens, or Nutanix registers another miss. Instead, I much prefer leaders in the sector like Twilio, where there are not investors with large losses waiting to hit the bid at higher prices.Taking a look at the technical picture, we can see that the stock broke down from a $35.00-65.00 box, and is now trying to build a new base between $24.00-29.00. If the stock were to push higher out of this base, it could quickly gain some short-term momentum, but I believe that rally has a good shot at failing into the $35.00 area where the 40-week moving average (blue line) is headed.(Source: TC2000.com)As we see from the below chart, Nutanix is scraping along the bottom of a weekly downtrend and could make a run to the mid-point of this channel if we see a decent beat or guidance lift on the next report. However, the stock is going to need lots of work technically before I'm convinced it's going on a sustainable run, not just a strong bounce that swing traders might be able to sell into.(Source: TC2000.com)Nutanix may be a leader according to some fundamental analysts, but true leaders show leadership both in price and fundamentals. Even if Nutanix does have a leading product, and if it's just going through some growing pains as it switches to a subscription model, I've never found it wise to get involved until a company is beginning to show signs of a turnaround. Based on Q4 revenue guidance reflecting another quarter of deceleration and forward earnings estimates reflecting wider losses, it is too early for me to be interested in getting involved here. The bulls are going to want to see a strong beat vs. the current estimates of $293.2 million in revenue for Q4 which will be reported in late August, or a strong lift on forward guidance that suggests a return to positive year-over-year growth of higher than low single-digits.To summarize, I disagree entirely with the notion that Nutanix is a leader that is a compelling buy at current levels. I am entirely open to the possibility of a 30% rally back towards the $35.00 level, but I believe any rallies of 30% or larger are opportunities to sell a chunk of one's position into this strength. There are no promises that these rallies will occur, but there is guaranteed to be those who bought at higher levels who are delighted to get out at a much narrower loss. My favorite investments are those where I'm being paid to wait in times of growing pains (yield), or where earnings are on the table, and the stock is showing leadership from both a fundamental and technical standpoint. As Nutanix does not meet either of these criteria or comes remotely close, I see the stock as an avoid in favor of buying the dips when they arise on the true leaders in the software group."
4248877,76115,2019-03-14T16:12:55-04:00,Nutanix dove 33% on a 15% downside guide for Q3.Management indicates lead generation spend is the cause and it's working to focus capital toward it again like it did in 2016-2017.The question is: will this execution error be too deep a hole to dig out of or does the company's reputation afford it the ability to mimic earlier results?,"Two weeks ago, Nutanix (NTNX) dove on weak guidance. What specifically drove the poor guidance is the focus. Instead of the expected sales of $347.5M, according to analysts' consensus, the company issued a $295M number - a downside guide of 15%.And this was enough to create a 33% drop in the stock.This seemed a bit excessive, but to understand the drop, we must understand the reasoning behind the revenue guide. There will still be year-over-year growth with the current guide, but the sudden deceleration is a hefty cause for concern.Let's start with the easy info: an explanation from management on why guidance was so far under expectations. This is from CFO Duston Williams on the recent earnings call:The basis, it appears, was a misallocation of capital spending away from lead generation and, indirectly, sales.Looking at Q2 2019 and comparing it to Q2 2018, we can try to understand just how much of a problem this was and help us determine whether this is the major reason for the guide. Since lead generation is not its own line item, I'll be using the Sales and Marketing line.(Source: Nutanix's 2019 Q2 Earnings Report)We can take the above table one of two ways:So, to determine this, let's examine all the quarters in 2018 and 2019 and see if there's a trend downward and/or a resurgence of spending heading into this quarter.(Source: Nutanix's Quarterly Earnings Reports)After entering fiscal 2018 (post Q1), spending in S&M didn't accelerate until Q2 of 2019 - the just reported quarter. It appears, though, it has now turned up the heat, and if fiscal 2017's 75% increase in S&M is any indicator, then the company should be able to produce significant revenue growth results (as revenue growth from 2016 to 2018 was 115%).(Source: Nutanix's 2018 10-K)This result from 2016-2017's S&M spending should allow investors to be more comfortable with the analysis from management for its lack of spending in the same area it drove revenue from last time. In other words, the company has seen results from driving lead generation in the past and it knows it shifted capital away recently, causing revenue growth to slow. This is a pretty direct correlation and shifting capital toward this again should regain lost growth.What gives me confidence, this isn't a larger, competitive issue for Nutanix, is the continued add-on deals and upselling it has accomplished with its current customers. However, it won't be enough to drive revenue growth back to the level the market was pricing into its stock anytime soon. As I pointed out above, the increase in S&M spending took several quarters across two fiscal years to show results. This thought process is in line with the color the CFO had to add on the call:While I draw some similarities between CyberArk (CYBR) and Nutanix as they both grow and operate with subscription software, the difference for Nutanix is the problem isn't a quick one-quarter fix, like when CyberArk was able to pull in the missed business into the following quarter. The kind of spend Nutanix is facing precedes revenue growth and will take significant time. This was a deep execution error on the part of management compounded by not being able to see this coming until the deceleration of growth came to light. Knowing the lack of spend in this area was going to hurt future growth and fixing it before it became apparent in growth is one thing but shifting the spend and not realizing what's happening underneath is another thing and questions the ability of management.The stock price will depend upon how much further the company can upsell its current customers while it waits for lead generation to kick in as it once did. Most of its revenue growth in the next few quarters will need to come from this, as the new sales leads take time to form, negotiate, and sign. The company has gone from 3,770 customers at the end of 2016 to 10,610 at the end of 2018 - all while increasing S&M by 75% from 2016 to 2017. If the company can produce similar results again, then the stock will find itself ahead in the next 12 months.The risk is the size of the hole the company has put itself in, especially in the competitive hyper-converged infrastructure ('HCI') sector. This is my main concern - can the company produce these type of results again now two years later? In the technology industry, this is a lifetime. Perhaps the leadership position of Nutanix will allow its reputation to proceed it and gain on the foundation it built.Right now, the stock looks a bit like a trap, but I still see opportunity down the line. Dipping your toe in here to start a position could be the first step for your investment or perhaps letting the price action play out a little longer and looking for a bottom to form would be the less risky approach. Overall, the company likely will recover from this execution mistake but it won't be for several quarters as this kind of correction requires upfront investment in order to see results."
4267616,103480,2019-05-31T14:24:24-04:00,"Shares of Nutanix sold off sharply after reporting dismal Q3 results that dramatically missed Wall Street's revenue estimates.Surprisingly, Nutanix's revenue growth slipped negative for the first time ever, after growing at 17% y/y last quarter (and in the ~30% y/y range last fiscal year).This decline, however, is largely prompted by the company's shift to subscription-based deals. Subscription billings comprised 65% of this quarter's total, up eight points sequentially.Over time, subscription-based deals will increase customer lifetime vales as well as Nutanix's own profitability.","There doesn't seem to be a bottom for Nutanix (NTNX), the once-highflying vendor of hyperconverged infrastructure (NYSE:HCI) tools that has turned enterprise virtualization on its head and given legacy giant VMware (VMW) a run for its money. After falling precipitously all year, shares of Nutanix dropped another 15% toward new 52-week lows on the back of a poor third-quarter earnings release, marked by a surprise revenue decline and a heavy miss to Wall Street's estimates:Data by YChartsUnfortunately for Nutanix, it's likely to get worse before it gets any better. Investors are wanting clarity on whether the company can sort out its sales issues and continue to position itself as an infrastructure disruptor in the market. There's no doubt that Nutanix is still considered a ""best in breed"" vendor; the company has been anointed as recently as November by industry analyst Gartner as the category leader in HCI, with VMware and DellEMC far behind. The company has also notched a high net promoter score (NPS) of 90. The question, however, is whether Nutanix can turn its uncompromising technology leadership into sales growth, especially at a time when global IT leaders might be slowing down their purchases.Over the long term, Nutanix's subscription shift and continually improving margins give the company a strong foothold; and should shares deteriorate meaningfully further, I'd imagine that Nutanix would attract the attention of its larger competitors as a potential M&A target. The company's current ~$5 billion market cap, after all, is a pittance to pay for ~$1 billion in annual revenues and considerable technology R&D assets. In my view, investors shouldn't buy the dip immediately, but keep an eye out for an entry point in Nutanix. Investors need clarity that the company isn't facing any serious sales execution issues, and that any near-term headwinds caused by the subscription transition can eventually pave the way to revenue growth in the future.Investors are understandably spooked that Nutanix's revenue growth turned negative for the first time ever - a scary position to be in for a recent IPO who, as recently as last year, was posting strong 30-40% y/y growth rates. Here's a look at the company's billings and revenue trends:Figure 1. Nutanix billings/revenue resultsSource: Nutanix Q3 earnings deckRevenues slipped by -1% y/y to $287.6 million, missing Wall Street's mark of $297.2 million (+3% y/y) by a four-point margin. Similarly, billings also saw a -1% y/y decline to $346.0 million.It's incredibly important to realize, however, that the mix of Nutanix's underlying revenue is a huge driver behind this revenue decline. You'll recall that Nutanix made a decision last year to eliminate pass-through hardware revenues (which carried much lower margins) and focus on selling software only; and more specifically within software, focus even more on driving subscription sales. Nutanix is not the only company to pivot to subscription sales; notable examples of success include Adobe (ADBE) and Autodesk (ADSK).Yet as software investors know, the initial phases of a transition to subscription revenues often is accompanied by revenue declines. The reason is simple: one-time sales that used to provide a huge immediate boost to revenues are now deferred over longer periods of time. Customers pay less upfront, but they do pay more over time - hence why subscription businesses are said to increase their customers' lifetime values. It's also a more profitable business model, as renewal deals are less costly to pursue than new business (and much more likely to succeed). Speaking of renewals, we note that Nutanix has a huge 140% net retention rate - meaning that of last year's customer cohort, the average customer ended up purchasing 40% more.We should appreciate the fact that Nutanix's shift to subscription sales has occurred perhaps a bit faster than management expected, hence the reason why Nutanix underperformed relative to its own guidance. Subscription billings made up 65% of this quarter's total - that's up eight points sequentially, and very close to the company's long-term target of 80% to be achieved within two years.Figure 2. Nutanix subscription billings mixSource: Nutanix Q3 earnings deckHere's some further color from Duston Williams, Nutanix's CFO, on the subscription transition during his prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call:In effect, the subscription transition has created a lot of optical noise in Nutanix's financials. Multi-year deals often don't show up in billings, and certainly not in revenues. We need to focus on fundamental business drivers - the fact that Nutanix landed 820 new customers in the quarter, including a large $8 million new deal and a $3 million renewal with am agency of the U.S. Department of Defense; as well as the fact that Nutanix reported a 40% y/y growth in pipeline leads.As previously mentioned, it's likely to get worse before it gets better for Nutanix. Investors want to see more clarity on the company's growth trajectory, which at the moment is muddled by a rapid subscription transition. Long-term investors, however, should take comfort in the fact that Nutanix is still adding customers, signing large deals and building its pipeline.The other point that is necessary to make is that Nutanix is no Tesla (TSLA): Nutanix can afford to make the long-term decision to defer revenues into the future because its cash position is well cushioned.As of the end of Q3, Nutanix has a total of $934 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet, netting out against $430 million of debt - indicating a net cash position of $504 million:Figure 3. Nutanix balance sheetSource: Nutanix 3Q19 earnings releaseAnd unlike other cash guzzlers in the software sector, Nutanix was FCF positive. However, in the nine months in the fiscal year-to-date, Nutanix has burned $43 million, most from the recent quarter, compared to the $23.7 million of positive FCF in the year-ago period:Figure 4. Nutanix FCFSource: Nutanix 3Q19 earnings releaseWe note as well that as Nutanix continues its pivot into subscription software, its margins have seen tremendous improvements as well, further bolstering the company's cash flow. Pro forma gross margins clocked in at 77.1% this quarter, nearly a ten-point jump from 68.4% in the year-ago quarter.My long-term view on Nutanix remains constructive; however, sentiment against the stock is likely to be weak in the near term. Once Nutanix is able to ""train"" investors and analysts to ignore the near-term noise surrounding its subscription transition and convince them that the underlying business is healthy, the shares should form a base and rally again."
4246538,86786,2019-03-05T21:52:14-05:00,"We shorted Nutanix into earnings; now we want to predict its post-earnings movement.After earnings, we typically run both a gap analysis and sentiment analysis; I report these findings for NTNX.In short, the gap predicts short-term (2-3 weeks) downward pressure; sentiment shows quarterly downward pressure.I recommend dropping NTNX if you can; if not, consider the recommended protective strategy or income generation strategy.","Nutanix (NTNX) just reported its Q2 2019 earnings, and the stock is down over 30% in response. Several other Seeking Alpha contributors have done good jobs on explaining the post-earnings outlook, but I believe I can add something unique to the analysis. Let me begin by stating that I flagged NTNX as a short opportunity into earnings as early as February 20.On February 26, I recommended in my newsletter an earnings trade on NTNX. I calculated a 78% probability of a selloff on earnings with a convex (read: risk < reward) payoff profile. The recommended play was a simple long put option strategy, with Jul19 $55 puts.As per the results of NTNX’s historical post-earnings movements, I also recommended taking profit right after the earnings selloff. However, this does not imply that the gap in NTXN’s chart is an area gap. In fact, most gaps of this size (i.e., creating a new trading region) and of high volume tend to be breakaway gaps.Still, some post-earnings gaps like these lead to sideways trends. Others partially fill. And each stock has its own gap patterns.After an earnings report, I typically run at least two analyses. The first is a gap analysis, complete with backtests on the stock in question. The second is a sentiment analysis.Today, we will look at both of these analyses. In conjunction with the more fundamental analyses in the recent articles on NTXN by other SA writers, my analysis can help you get an idea of where NTNX is heading next. It is important to know that these analyses are orthogonal to traditional analyses, and thus we need not give more weight to either form of analysis.Let’s begin with a quick lesson on post-earnings drift. After earnings, guidance and sentiment explain more variance than financial factors. The split is roughly 60% guidance, 40% financial data updates (e.g., EPS).Each stock reacts differently, but this split works in general for the US stock market (China’s market shows the opposite pattern). In addition, some stocks almost completely ignore one factor. This is common, for instance, in tech stocks that are high in debt but within a growth phase; Netflix, for example, moves on guidance and subscriber numbers, largely ignoring revenue and EPS surprises.Still, another general rule for post-earnings drift is that positive earnings tend to lead to upward drift, while negative earnings do not lead to downward drift. Thus, negative earnings make a stock’s post-earnings movements more difficult to predict. Still, sentiment is statistically strong in predicting the movement of a stock in the following quarter; gaps help in predicting more short-term trends.Let’s begin with the gap analysis because gaps are more important movers of stock in the short-term. Down gaps that bring a stock to a new low tend to be breakaway gaps. This is especially true on high volume days, which is what we are seeing in NTNX’s chart:(Source: Stockcharts.com)The pre-gap and post-gap candlesticks are also important in the gap analysis. A red candlestick followed by another red candlestick on the gap day is the second more bearish pattern. Typically, we see a few more days of selloff after this form of gap.But that is the general gap theory; some stocks act differently. We should test the theory on individual stocks if we have the capability. Unfortunately, NTNX has few gaps of this type, giving us a small sample for the backtest.Here is the result of shorting this type of gap and holding for one day:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Yahoo Finance)Here is the result of holding for one week:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Yahoo Finance)After the first week, the trend begins to reverse, with NTXN retracing the selloff. After three weeks, NTXN makes a 100% retracement, but we see no pattern after the retracement – in other words, the gap analysis fails to produce useful information in predicting NTNX after the stock returns to its post-gap price.Because of the small sample size, I bootstrapped the data by relaxing the constraints on the gap. The backtest shows similar results, implying that the small sample set is not giving misleading results. Here are the results for the one-day short strategy:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Yahoo Finance)The main difference in this backtest is that it predicts the stock’s retracement to be slower. After two weeks, the short position is still profitable:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Yahoo Finance)One reason for this profitability is that post-gap downward movements are fiercer than the retracements. Like the earnings short, the post-earnings gap short is convex. Still, NTNX tends to finish retracing the post-gap selloff after three weeks, erasing the gains of the short position:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Yahoo Finance)The takeaway is that NTNX typically falls for a couple weeks after this sort of gap. Investors holding NTNX and questioning whether to hold or sell would be advised to sell. You can repurchase your shares in the second or third week after the gap to get a better price, on average.But again, purchasing after the retracement does not imply that the stock will rise to fill the gap. You can see that the 15 day return on the short position is roughly the same as the one-month return:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Yahoo Finance)To get a better idea of the movement after one month, we should read into management sentiment. Sentiment acts orthogonally to financial and fundamental data. It helps explain the variance of post-earnings stock price movement but should not be used exclusively.I created a lexical analysis algorithm to read through a company’s earnings calls and calculate a sentiment score, as per the current best practices in financial lexical analysis. Because the sentiment score itself is meaningless on its own, we will calculate the change of sentiment quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.Quarter-over-quarter, sentiment for NTNX is down over 66%. Year-over-year, sentiment is down 76%. This is highly bearish.We will take a look at the statements flagged by my algorithm in the recent earnings call.-Admission of a weakening macro environment and its negative effect on company stability. CEO Dheeraj Pandey is downplaying concerns by discussing whether OpEx or CapEx is the more important metric, but this statement is one of “metric of choice,” not necessarily a forward-looking statement. Still, this is open to interpretation – but the macro fears cannot be easily dismissed.-Comparison to past weakness in the company’s business cycle. The implication is that NTNX will suffer for some period before getting back on its feet. NTNX fell to a relative low in 2017 and did not see its earnings rise until early 2018. The analogy was framed to be one of eventual recovery but it also indicates short-term weakness.-Emphasizing small wins. NTNX has $444M in debt, making a $2M quarterly excess of cash and short-term investments insignificant when you back out. Cash is up, but so is debt; net equity is falling, while debt is rising:(Source: Simply Wall St)-The vast majority of earnings calls contain more positive statements than negative statements. This is why we cannot look at sentiment outright and must compare it to past sentiment values and – sometimes – to those of the general market and/or sector. When management precedes a positive earnings call with warnings that their statements could be wrong or contain much risk, I am always reminded of a proud athlete mentioning his sore feet before competing. Management seems to be preparing for a bad quarter but still must manage investor expectations with optimistic words. The sentiment score for NTNX’s recent earnings call is 73% lower than the market average. Not only is the positive-to-negative statement ratio 1:1, but the positive statements are often worded in a way to downplay fears and imply short-term bearishness or uncertainty. This, in short, is the summary of NTNX’s most recent earnings report; management wishes to remain positive, but they do not actually have much positive to say at this point.My pre-earnings analysis of NTNX was bearish for fundamental, technical, seasonal, and statistical reasons. While our earnings trades are short-term, much of the pre-earnings analyses still apply after earnings. For readers not subscribed to my newsletter, I present some of the important takeaways from the pre-earnings analysis.One of my backtests revealed a consistent NTNX seasonality pattern. February to April, NTNX tends to underperform. March and April present negative Sharpe ratios, and NTNX tends to fall roughly 10% per year during this time.Staying out of NTNX during these three months produces excess gains:(Source: Damon Verial; data from Yahoo Finance)It is possible insiders are aware of this pattern. Insider buying almost completely stopped the quarter before this 30% fall in the stock. Insider buying, like sentiment, is a reliable predictor for excess gains over the following quarter:(Source: Nasdaq)I also cited concerns over NTNX’s consistent pattern of seeing its operating expenses keep pace with revenue. In this context, earnings will have problems reversing course from its downward trend. The latest earnings report solidifies this trend for another quarter:(Source: Simply Wall St)One of the technical sell signals I found in the pre-earnings analysis showed strong statistical significance in predicting selloffs. The signal is too short-term to say anything about NTNX now, but you can keep an eye on it for future decisions. The RSI(2) popping below 20 typically leads to one week of downward momentum:(Source: Stockcharts.com)I concluded from these factors, among others, that the overall thesis is highly bearish. After calculating the probability of a selloff and the risk/reward profile, I found NTNX to be a good earnings short trade.Following this review, the sentiment analysis, and the gap analysis, I conclude that NTNX’s selloff is most likely not temporary. In the short-term, this gap appears to be a breakaway gap. After a few weeks, the gap reverses, but sentiment, seasonal, and fundamental factors imply downward pressure.If you are holding NTNX and do not wish to sell, I recommend married puts to protect you through NTNX’s mini-bear season:These options only cost $185, allowing you to limit your loss to $170 (plus the premium of the option) per 100 shares.If you want to generate income while waiting for NTNX to return to its post-gap price, which should happen in three to four weeks, according to the gap analysis, try this strategy:Roll this over when the short options expire. You will profit from both time decay and any volatility rush that occurs. If you have any questions about these strategies, contact me (my newsletter chat is preferable, but you can DM me too).Happy trading."
4253972,104608,2019-04-11T11:14:59-04:00,"Recent Q2 earnings were solid, but management's guidance fell below consensus expectations.Analyst day provided encouraging long-term growth targets and a $3 billion 2021 billings goal.Valuation continues to remain depressed despite the company transitioning more towards a software-only, recurring revenue business model.","After reporting strong Q2 earnings and Q3 guidance that fell below consensus estimates, Nutanix (NTNX) held an upbeat and positive analyst day for investors. Management was positive about their long-term growth trajectory and talked about the potential for $3 billion in billings by 2021, led by new areas such as new products in Essentials & Enterprise and potential software and services refresh opportunity.Post Q2 earnings, the stock dropped over 30% as investors questioned the long-term growth trajectory. Over the past few weeks, investors have regained their confidence in the company and their ability to deliver growth. NTNX has been on a long transition moving from a company selling both hardware and software to one that is solely focusing on their software growth. This has been a challenging aspect for the company, especially for their salesforce, who have had to change selling tactics amidst a transformative period.Data by YChartsInvestors seem to be largely concerned with management's $3 billion software/support billings by 2021. Considering the downward guidance for the coming quarter, it initially seemed challenging for NTNX to reach this goal. However, during their analyst day, management laid out their path to the $3 billion target. In addition, management discussed their ability to transition into a more recurring revenue business model and demonstrated how companies who have higher recurring software sales tend to receive a premium forward revenue multiple. I believe over time, NTNX will continue to post strong revenue growth rates, and as the company shifts to a more recurring business model, we should start to see their multiple expand a few turns.Although NTNX reported strong Q2 earnings, management provided softer than expected guidance for Q3 and the rest of the year, which caused investors to question the long-term growth sustainability of the company. This ended up being a perfect time to host an investor day, just weeks after management's weaker than expected guidance. The upbeat investor day helped reassure the long-term thesis, and investors should not be concerned about the future growth of NTNX.During management's presentation, they talked about their total TAM of $186 billion in 2019 and how 2/3 of deals won are from competitive takeouts versus traditional infrastructure players (Source: Company Presentation). The main competitors continue to remain Dell EMC and VMware (VMW), and according to Gartner, NTNX continues to remain the leader.Source: Company PresentationAlso during the investor day, management went into detail about their $3 billion software and support billings target by 2021, which compares to ~$1.5 billion in FY19. The biggest expansion for their billings target comes from both new products in Essentials & Enterprise ($0.5 billion opportunity) and from potential software and services refresh ($0.4 billion opportunity). The positive long-term outlook should reinforce NTNX's long-term growth potential as they see a path to their billings doubling by 2021. The hyper-converged infrastructure market remains largely un-penetrated and investors should be excited about NTNX's market leading position.Source: Company PresentationIn addition, NTNX continues to trend towards a more recurring revenue model led by software sales. The above chart does a great job depicting where NTNX was in terms of recurring revenue and the path they are headed to. As the company's revenue stream becomes more recurring and predictable, investors should expect NTNX to be valued at a higher premium, much like their comparable peer group.The rest of the investor day went into greater detail of product applications and potential market disruption opportunities. Management left investors feeling much better about the long-term growth potential and erased some of the fears left after their recent Q2 earnings call. Over the long-term, I believe NTNX will continue to shift their business model into a software-only business, with higher recurring revenue. As this mix shift progresses, I believe NTNX will earn a premium multiple more in line with their peer group.During Q2, NTNX grew their software and support billings by 37%, which again decelerated from Q1 growth of 50%. However, software and support billings are now at a $1.2+ billing run-rate and investors should begin to expect some deceleration over time. Total revenue grew 17%, which actually accelerated from 14% in Q1. Revenue growth included $78 million from hardware. The challenging part with NTNX is they are shifting away from hardware sales, which naturally will drag down the revenue growth of the company,Over time, as the company moves away from hardware and into a pure-software company, they should be seen as more favorable in the investing community. Typically, software-only companies receive a higher multiple due to their more predictable and measurable revenue streams, compared to the lumpier flows of hardware sales. However, when a company moves from a hardware/software combination to software only, they forgo their hardware sales, which makes the year-over-year comparable tougher to beat, thus making revenue growth artificially lower.Source: Company PresentationIn my opinion, it is challenging to value NTNX based off of total revenue. Instead, I use a more forward-looking approach and only view the company's software revenue for valuation purposes. Yes, the hardware sales does provide solid top line growth; however, this low-margin revenue and growth potential does very little to drive valuation.For Q2, software and support revenue grew 42%, a rather impressive pace for a company approaching a $1.2 billion run-rate software revenue path. In addition, as the company continues to shed their hardware sales, gross margins continue to expand. Q2 gross margins were $76.8% compared to 63.5% in the year ago period. At this point, I believe gross margins on a purely software-only company will eventually eclipse 80%+.As NTNX continues to shed their hardware sales, we should expect overall margins to improve, in terms of both gross and operating. In addition, as NTNX continues to scale, they should be able to decrease their operating expenses, such as R&D and S&M. The one caveat with this (which I discussed in a previous article) is that the quicker NTNX loses their hardware sales, their revenue growth will be artificially lower. However, this means gross margins would come in higher than expected, which was also seen the past two quarters.NTNX’s customer cohort is also a big driver of their future growth. Traditionally, they have focused on the enterprise market, leaving the middle market companies largely untouched. However, NTNX has placed a lot more emphasis on the middle market and has initiated several internal sales programs to place more emphasis on this large market opportunity.At the end of Q2, NTNX had nearly 12,410 customers, up from 11,500 in Q1. Of these customers, 760 were from Global 2,000 clients, which is an increase of 40 compared to 720 in Q1. Growing the middle market cohort will give NTNX a great opportunity to become the mainstream HCI name for companies of all sizes. In addition, NTNX experiences significant revenue growth from existing customers. Global 2,000 customers continue to have a strong and increasing traction, with total lifetime purchases increasing 11.0x compared to the initial purchase. As NTNX continues to penetrate both the enterprise and middle market customer base, they will be able to have better insight into their revenue, much of which is rather sticky.Source: Company PresentationManagement also provided some guidance for Q3, which includes revenue of $290-300 million, which was well below consensus estimates for ~$350 million. Management noted the lower guidance was largely due to lower than expected sales generation leads in the early part of the year, as well as slower than expected sales hiring. However, management appeared to remain confident that their current sales ramping problems have been internally addressed and the pipeline should continue to grow into Q4.Source: Company PresentationSoftware and support revenue is guided to grow in the high-teens compared to over 40% over the past several quarters. Management addressed this issue and noted that the weaker-than-expected sales force and pipeline was largely attributed to the lower growth. Gross margins are expected to remain in the high-70s, and I believe this will trend closer to 80% over the course of the year.Although Q3 guidance was weak, the stock was beaten down on Friday and likely reflects a multiple more in line for a company with mid-teens software revenue growth. At this point, I believe NTNX will surprise investors to the upside by building a stronger-than-expected pipeline through the remainder of the year, setting the company up well for a strong 2020 performance.The strong commitment to transitioning into a software-only company will help expand gross margins while maintaining strong top line growth. Over time, the company and investors will have greater insight into revenue streams, which will ultimately be recurring. Many software-only companies typically trade at premium revenue multiples compared to other technology companies specializing in software and hardware.Software and support revenue was ~$900 million in FY18, growing at a 47% rate. This demonstrates one of the fastest revenue growth rates in the market for a company at this scale. However, it appears software revenue will start to decelerate over the coming quarters, quicker than what investors had originally expected.Data by YChartsWhile the above peer group spans across several areas of software technology, it depicts where forward revenue multiples are across a group where revenue consistently grows 30%+ and is comprised mostly of recurring software revenue. Despite the weaker than expected guidance, NTNX deserves to be trading at a revenue multiple closer to the peer average. NTNX traded more in line with the peer group over a year ago, however, as the company continues their transition away from hardware sales and has seen a bit of inconsistency in guidance, their revenue multiple has compressed.I believe NTNX remains very undervalued given the company's transition to a software-only model and significant margin expansion. As the company completes this transition over the next 9-12 months, investors will begin to value NTNX as a software-only company, which typically comes with a higher revenue multiple premium. Over the long-term, I believe NTNX will become more deserving of a ~10x forward revenue multipleRisks to NTNX include a slower-than-expected transition to software-only sales, though it would have a slight benefit to revenue growth and would negatively impact gross margins. The emergence of more competitors would also hamper NTNX’s growth."
4248042,103480,2019-03-12T11:30:30-04:00,"Shares of Nutanix have crashed more than 30% after revealing disappointing guidance for the third quarter.Growth has been in deceleration mode. This quarter, revenues grew only 17% y/y, and next quarter revenues are expected to grow only in the low-single digits.Despite a near-term sales execution problem, Nutanix's technology still remains unique enough to attract Fortune 100 buyers.Over the long term, Nutanix's shift toward software billings should give the company momentum to recover.","Wall Street is a fickle bunch. Last year, hyperconverged storage infrastructure provider Nutanix (NTNX) was the talk of the town, with the company's plan to minimize hardware sales and shift to a software-only billings model encouraging a massive rally that at one point took Nutanix's market cap above $10 billion. At one point, Goldman Sachs (GS) had referred to Nutanix as a ""once-in-a-decade"" opportunity.This year, however, Nutanix has been shunted squarely to the penalty box. Ever since reporting Q2 earnings and revealing a disastrous guidance for Q3, Nutanix shares have lost more than 30% and are now trading at near 52-week lows.Data by YChartsThe question now weighing on investors' minds: is Nutanix worth entering at new lows or is it a value trap? In this article, we'll examine the situation Nutanix is facing and the opportunities it has to recover. In my view, while the bullish case for Nutanix has been made weaker, that is counterbalanced by the stock's much lower valuation.At present trading levels, Nutanix has a market cap of $6.11 billion. After netting out $934 million of balance sheet cash and $430 million of convertible debt, the company's enterprise value is $5.61 billion. For reference, that valuation represents a multiple of just 3.55x EV/FY20 expected revenues of $1.58 billion, based on Wall Street consensus gathered by Yahoo Finance. That kind of multiple makes Nutanix look more like a hardware company - when, in fact, one of the driving reasons behind Nutanix's deceleration has been its pivot to software.It may take time for Nutanix to regain the market's trust, but stock prices are now low enough to merit an entry in a company which still holds technology leadership over the converged/hyperconverged infrastructure and storage spaces. Stay long here and wait for the rebound.Let's first discuss the elephant in the room: Nutanix's guidance. The modesty of Nutanix's revenue ranges was downright shocking. Most software and technology stocks follow a similar, predictable pattern when it comes to guidance - pointing to a somewhat conservative range that implies mild deceleration from the current quarter, and then proceeding to beat the top end of that range when the results actually come out.Nutanix broke the rules of this playbook when guiding its third quarter, shown in the snapshot below:Figure 1. Nutanix 3Q19 guidanceSource: Nutanix 2Q19 earnings releaseFor some context around these ranges: In 3Q18, Nutanix had posted $289.4 million in revenues, so the range of $290-300 million represents 0-4% y/y growth. Needless to say, that's not incredibly inspiring for any company, much less a technology company. Wall Street, on the other hand, had modeled a consensus of $347.6 million in revenues (+20% y/y), actually implying acceleration over this quarter's 14% y/y growth rate instead of seeing growth crashing down to the low-single digits.The story holds for billings - which, arguably, is the better barometer of Nutanix's business health as it presents a longer-term view of deals signed. In 3Q18, Nutanix had billed $351.2 million, so its expected range of $360-370 million represents 3-5% y/y growth - only slightly better than the revenue story.Nutanix didn't drop the guidance bomb without adequate explanations as to drivers. On the Q2 earnings call, CEO Dheeraj Pandey noted the following three factors behind the slowdown:In a nutshell, Nutanix is dealing with a slew of problems: not enough leads, not enough salespeople, and deals slipping in the Americas, which is Nutanix's biggest market.Despite the doom-and-gloom attitude around Nutanix right now, however, we have to note that not all is lost. Nutanix isn't the only software company to report sales execution issues. It's a common growing pain in mid-cap tech stocks as they transition into becoming multi-billion dollar run rate enterprises. One of the most similar situations we can point to is data visualization leader Tableau (DATA), which shed 50% of its market value after a particularly poor guidance outlook in February 2016. Investors were worried about sales execution, slower spending cycles and longer deal closings, and rising competition from players like Microsoft PowerBI (MSFT) and Qlik.Data by YChartsAt the time, shares of Tableau dropped to $40. In the three years since then, however, shares of Tableau have roared in nearly vertical ascent and are now trading at triple its trough value. That's an incredible annualized CAGR of about 45%. Looking now in hindsight, it would have been extremely prudent to buy shares of Tableau on the dip. We can look to the recovery factors in Tableau to have confidence in buying Nutanix on its own dip.The most important trait that Nutanix and Tableau share is a reputation for being best-in-breed in their fields. Though Tableau was and continues to be pitted against cheaper alternatives, its first-mover advantage in BI dashboards and data visualization has earned it a hardcore following among both technical and non-technical users.Nutanix has had a similar experience in the storage and hyperconverged infrastructure space. In a nutshell, Nutanix has pioneered a category that makes data storage and computing far more efficient and cost-effective. In the modern ""big data"" world where data volumes have swelled, solutions like Nutanix are vital in any organization's IT stack.The easiest way to see Nutanix's dominance is on the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Hyperconverged Infrastructure. Gartner, the leading software industry research firm, published an annual ranking of vendors in multiple categories, and Nutanix has yet again been named the undisputed Leader (furthest to the top and to the right) ever since Gartner created the category in February 2018.Figure 2. Nutanix Gartner November 2018 rankingSource: Nutanix sales websiteThe strength of Nutanix's brand is made even more evident by the scores of blue-chip companies that purchase its technology. The company ended its most recent quarter with more than 12,400 customers (920 of which were net-new adds in the quarter), and new client wins included energy giant Apache Corporation (APA) and construction titan Komatsu (OTCPK:KMTUF).Sales execution issues are part of the growing pains that every mid-cap company faces in its transition. A great product, however, can continue to sell itself even after growing through rough patches. In my view, Nutanix's category leadership will allow it to push through the current weak sales cycle and recover in a Tableau-like fashion.And despite the focus on Q3's weak guidance, it's easy to forget that Nutanix is still achieving tremendous progress on its goal of becoming a pure software company. Here are the key highlights on this front coming out of the second quarter:Figure 3. Nutanix 2Q19 key metricsSource: Nutanix Q2 earnings deckKey to note is that while Nutanix's overall revenues only grew by 17% y/y this quarter (it beat Wall Street expectations by about one point, by the way), underlying software revenues actually grew 42% y/y. That represents barely any deceleration from last quarter's 44% y/y growth in software revenues.We can see as well that this revenue shift has also had a magnified impact on overall margins. Nutanix's gross margin soared to 76.8% this quarter, up more than 13 points from last year's 63.5%. A mid-70s gross margin effectively puts Nutanix in-line with most SaaS peers. The fact that Nutanix trades at a hardware-like valuation multiple but produces software-like margins is one of the key imbalances in its lowball valuation.In Q2, note also that 57% of Nutanix's billings were subscription-based, up six points sequentially from 51% in Q1 and up substantially from FY18's 41%. The company is marching steadily toward a long-term goal of 70-75% subscription billings by mid-FY20.Nutanix's dizzying fall from grace presents a tremendous opportunity for investors willing to bet on the long-term future of a company that has a clear product vision but stuck with near-term sales weaknesses. While the risk of severe slow quarters is certainly weighing on the stock, it's safe to say that expectations have plunged low enough that Nutanix may be able to achieve some upside surprise. Stay long on this stock and continue to build a position at 52-week lows."

This is the second consecutive quarterly report that, despite operating in the fast-growing cloud and datacenter sector, confirms the business faces plenty of headwinds. With Nutanix stock at the risk of breaching 52-week lows, should technology investors bottom-fish at these levels?Nutanix closed a number of big deals with customers in the quarter, but it was not enough to beat consensus revenue estimates. Revenue barely changed from last year, falling 0.6% to $287.62 million in the quarter. It lost $1.15 a share on a GAAP basis and lost $0.56 a share (non-GAAP). Markets are unwilling to patiently wait for the company's long-term growth story to play out. As sales transition from hardware and towards software, whose contract is shorter and dollar value is smaller, investors are selling first and asking questions later.Source: NutanixThough the shorter subscription contract length lessens the revenue per customer, the high margin subscription revenue growth of 110%, to $168 million, should continue growing in the quarters ahead. Subscriptions accounted for 65% of its billings, up from 41%. The demand to move to a hybrid cloud will give Nutanix more predictable revenue over time. Throughout the life of the contract, customers may buy other offerings.The shift to a subscription model will raise the revenue deferral rate, hurting upfront quarterly revenue recognition. This is also having a negative impact on sales. The company said:Source: SA TranscriptNutanix forecast subscriptions accounting for over $80 of billings within two years (CY 2021):Source: NutanixGiven the historically steady growth in subscriptions, this target mix is achievable. What investors should demand over the next two quarters is the company winning bigger contracts. This would reverse the negative free cash flow of $59 million in Q3 and bring the company to profitability.Investors holding Adobe Systems (ADBE) or Autodesk (ADSK) will have seen this story before. Revenue growth rates lag for several quarters before re-accelerating. Although Nutanix does not have the massive install base that Adobe and Autodesk enjoy, the customer shift to subscriptions will increase profit margins. Yet the near-term trade-off is unpredictable quarterly revenues and uneven top-line strength. Strategically, investors could write calls or sell puts to harvest the elevated near-term volatility in the stock. As the stock price settles, investors will have a lower average cost base with the plan of holding the stock for at least a year.Nutanix forecast fourth-quarter billings between $350 million and $380 million, revenue between $280 million and $310 million, and gross margin of 77%. To accelerate the subscription growth, the company added over 50 sales reps in the third quarter. If effective, the newly added staff, along with new leadership, will help the company work through the subscription transition and the pipeline. The new leadership will not reverse the fourth quarter underperformance but should start to pay off after that.With the stock down over 20% in the last week to price in execution risks, investors could speculate that the weakness ahead is priced in.Per simplywall.st, Nutanix shares have an intrinsic value based on the future cash flow of $45.68.This is above the $39 average price target Wall Street analysts have on the stock (per TipRanks). Investors seeking a greater discount to account for further potential downside risks ahead could wait for another sell-off. The stock is at risk of falling to $23-25. This would price in Nutanix facing delays from big customer orders and sales staff taking longer than normal to drive sales."
4246434,103711,2019-03-05T13:08:37-05:00,"NTNX flopped after reporting earnings, and possibly rightfully so.Long term investors have no reason to doubt the long term thesis.My 12 month price target is $70, or over 100% upside.","Nutanix (NTNX) crashed after reporting earnings as management appears to have encountered some hiccups in execution. If one believes that management can fix their errors and regain the growth of the past, then shares appear to be very cheap - but this is a big if. Given their top tier software offerings and track record (aside from this mishap), I believe management deserves the benefit of the doubt, for now. Shares are a buy.NTNX is a software technology company which helps customers manage their variety of cloud platforms (public cloud, private cloud, distributed cloud), from data utilization to security and beyond. Given the increasing push toward the cloud as well as reality that customers are likely to continue having multiple cloud platforms, the market for NTNX is large and growing - a perfect recipe for a growth stocks, or so it seems.At first glance NTNX reported strong results, as revenues grew 17%, and after removing pass-thru hardware sales, software and support revenue grew 42% YOY. Gross margins expanded from 64% to 77%, making me optimistic that future operating margins may be high as well. The problem, however, was in their guidance.NTNX guided for Q3 to have between $290 and $300 million in revenues - which would be a huge disappointment considering that Q3 from the previous year had revenues just under $290 million. That would be a huge deceleration in growth and would imply negative growth sequentially, which would be far from the norm as we see below:(2019 Q2 Presentation)Management indicated that the reason for the poor outlook was due to “inadequate marketing spending for pipeline generation and slower than expected sales hiring.” While management says that they have already taken actions to address these issues, investors have little to go off on other than their word. A break in growth is typically a nightmare scenario for a high flying growth stock with no signs of profitability. Why am I nonetheless still bullish on NTNX’s prospects?Despite the rather serious near-term setbacks, investors still have reason to be optimistic about the long term thesis. NTNX was again named a leader in the 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Hyperconverged Infrastructure:(2019 Q2 Presentation)NTNX is the vendor of choice for 760 of the Global 2000 and 68 of the Forbes 100 - confirming their status as the market leader:(2019 Q2 Presentation)While they indeed have strong competition from the likes of VMware (VMW) and others, the fact that they have one of the best offerings gives investors hope that this is just an execution issue, and not a product issue (not to downplay the seriousness of execution issues).NTNX continues to boast their ability to cross sell to their existing customers. As we can see below, NTNX has a broad array of offerings - customers are typically going to start from “core” and from there NTNX can cross sell products from the right two columns:(2019 Q2 Presentation)Within “core,” NTNX has seen an increasing amount of purchases moving up from their AOS to AHV offering:(2019 Q2 Presentation)As far as cross selling goes, NTNX has seen steady improvement in being able to sell more than just core, as seen below:(2019 Q2 Presentation)While one can definitely make the argument that NTNX may have become overly reliant on cross selling to existing customers (leading to the poor guidance), I am hopeful that once they can fix the issues regarding lead generation, they will be able to resume growth again, accelerated by cross selling.As many long time NTNX investors might know, they are undergoing a transformation towards a recurring revenue model and are estimating to have 70-75% subscription billings within 2 years:(2019 Q2 Presentation)Of their $335 million in second quarter revenue, only $38 million was from the non-recurring pass thru hardware. The continued transition toward a subscription style business has in turn led to a dramatic rise in gross margins, which at 77% was much higher than 64% a year prior.While their guidance is no doubt disappointing, I think it’s still too early to count them out, as the long term growth thesis looks to be still intact, for now.NTNX does not have earnings thus we can only value based on sales. Because NTNX is guiding to see pass-thru hardware sales diminish over time, we should use sales net of pass-thru hardware. For the past 4 quarters, that’s $1.07 billion. Management has guided for 183 million shares outstanding for the next quarter, thus at recent prices near $33.70, that’s a $6.17 billion market cap. While some might want to point out that they have net cash on the balance sheet and thus we should use enterprise value instead, I argue that net cash should not be subtracted because they are not currently profitable.NTNX trades at 5.77 times trailing software and support revenue, which is very cheap. Granted, growth will be nonexistent the next quarter but prior to this setback they were growing software and support revenue at rates upwards of 40%.What is a more reasonable price to sales multiple? In looking at peers, I assume that NTNX should be able to have at least a 25% operating margin in the future. Assuming a price to earnings multiple of 25, that would equate to a price to sales multiple of 6.25 times.This suggests that NTNX is very cheap in the event that they can return to their former 40% growth rates.My 12 month price target for NTNX is $70, or 12 times trailing sales. This is a step down from my previous target of $80 but still represents over 100% upside. In order to reach this target, NTNX will have to prove quickly that this quarter’s errors are really behind them and they are able to resume their rapid growth rates of the past.I suspect many NTNX shareholders may have a sour feeling in their mouths (including your author). Not that it changes things, but I should point out that insiders are particularly hurt by the recent stock price decline.As we can see below, NTNX insiders own a significant portion of shares outstanding:(2018 Proxy)In particular, co-founder and CEO Dheeraj Pandey owns over 31.4% of Class B shares, good for 6.6% of total shares outstanding (based on 183 million shares outstanding). Management is highly financially incentivized to right this ship - the large insider ownership is a real plus in the current sea of red.NTNX’s quarter was terrible - there’s really no way to cover it up. However, I remain confident in the long-term thesis and view this as a buying opportunity. Shares are a buy with over 100% upside."

The company is on the right track to becoming profitable in the near future.Revenue growth slowdown is only a temporary event and stems from the diminishing hardware sales, which is a part of the management's strategy.While certain risks, such as increased competition, still exist, Nutanix remains the leader in the HCI segment.Therefore, the latest correction provides a solid entry point with low risk and high upside potential.","Over the last year, Nutanix (NTNX) stock has entered and exited my portfolio due to rapid changes in the market conditions, mixed quarterly results, and significant price movements. In more detail, I opened a long position in NTNX at the beginning of February 2018 at $32 and sold my shares 4 months later, in June, for $55 as the stock had rallied 70% by that time. The primary reason for selling the shares was the not so impressive performance that the company demonstrated in Q3. To remind, the company missed on EPS and showed signs of revenue growth slowdown. NTNX data by YChartsSince that time, the stock has dropped to the levels of January 2018 but has still been watched by me. However, the current pullback may finally present another attractive opportunity to buy NTNX, especially with positive Q1 results being demonstrated by the corporation. Although certain challenges exist, the bullish thesis is based on the company's fast financial improvements that are likely to lead to Nutanix becoming a profitable company in the nearest future. Let us review this thesis in more detail.Nutanix reported its quarterly results on November 27, beating on EPS by $0.14 (-$0.13 vs. -$0.27) and on revenue by $8 million. Notably, the main growth driver in the quarter was the company's transition toward the software-focused business model, which we will discuss later in more detail. The pace of financial improvements is one of the major points that make Nutanix attractive for investment at the moment. The company is actively pursuing the aim of becoming a profitable corporation, which seems to be coming to fruition sooner than expected, evident by the huge degree of EPS surprise in the recent quarter: the net loss turned out to be more than 50% smaller than expected by analysts. The major highlights in the quarter were all related to software revenue growth: software and support billings increased by 50% year-on-year to $351 million, revenue grew by 44% to $281 million. Even more impressive are the numbers for subscription revenue, as this soared a hefty 104% year-over-year. With around 4 years of average subscription contract length and 90% retention rate, Nutanix is building a solid basis of recurring cash streams through subscription-based sales.(Source: Q1 earnings slides)The success of the software division signifies management's solid execution on the plan to shift the company's business model toward the one concentrated on software and support rather than on hardware sales. This will likely bring Nutanix several benefits, including higher margins and more stable earnings. Hence, non-GAAP gross margin went up by solid 17 percentage points, reaching 79% in the latest quarter. It can be predicted that with the continuing increase in the portion of subscription-based revenue, Nunanix will expand its margins even further in the near future. This will contribute positively to the corporation achieving profitability in the coming years.(Source: Q1 earnings slides)The crucial point that should be made regarding the software business is the one that can make Nutanix a surprisingly favorable investment: the general slowdown in the corporation's total revenue is only a temporary situation which roots in the same shift toward a software-centric business model.The picture below explains the situation in a clear way: in Q1 2019, Nutanix reduced its hardware sales from $81 million to just $32 million, which was the part of the management's plan. If the hardware revenue remained on the same level year-over-year, the company's total revenue growth would amount to more than 30%. It is seen that the portion of hardware sales has become almost insignificant over the last year. (Source: Q1 earnings slides)As a result, the continuing improvement in the other revenue streams will become significantly more evident next year, which means revenue growth will start to accelerate again. Therefore, Nutanix will likely bring a positive surprise to most investors in FY 2020.As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, one of the main reasons to be bullish on Nutanix is the company's fast transition toward being a financially viable company. In other words, the corporation's pace of moving the business to profitability is encouraging, which shows the management's vision works more than well at the moment.Hence, net loss per share has continued to shrink from the moment the company became public in 2016. For instance, in Q1 FY 2017, Nutanix demonstrated net loss of $0.37 per share. In Q1 FY 2018, the number went down to negative $0.16, and the loss of $0.13 achieved in the recent quarter is yet another improvement. While the degree of change seems to be slowing at the moment, this can all be attributed to the diminishing hardware sales, which, again, is just a part of the company's strategy. Moreover, the general trend remains to be exceptionally positive.(Source: the author's calculations based on quarterly reports)If the trend continues over the next 1-2 years, Nutanix will be on the right track to demonstrating positive EPS already in FY 2021. However, I would expect acceleration in EPS growth over the period, due to the aforementioned transition toward the software-centric business model. It is clear that the hardware sales, which still account for a significant portion of revenue for Nutanix, are associated with the much lower return on sales, compared to software-related sales.Moreover, maintaining hardware business is likely to require a significant amount of fixed costs which could be eliminated in the near future. This would have a relatively high positive influence on the company's EPS. From here, a significant upward potential arises for the stock price.Additional focus should be made on the stock's performance during the recent selloff in the market. While many tech shares experienced major declines due to relative overvaluation and lack of investor confidence, NTNX performed not as negatively as many other securities.Hence, since October 2018, the level of return has basically fluctuated near the level of 0%, which is not so bad compared to the returns of S&P 500 (SPY) and other indices. This could mean that, in general, institutional investors were not willing to abandon their positions in Nutanix even in the times of low confidence, which shows that NTNX could soar significantly on any positive news. This is something that has been seen over the past days - NTNX surged about 10% on a slight hint of the market's rebound. Therefore, while the situation in the broader market could still remain uncertain in the nearest future, an investment in Nutanix could be a position with a relatively low downward potential.NTNX data by YChartsThe hyperconverged infrastructure segment, where Nutanix operates, is a promising area of technology which grows rapidly due to the significant number of benefits that it can bring to the companies implementing HCI. These include such perks as flexibility for the data centers, scalability, and lower operational costs due to higher efficiency.With the demand for HCI increasing over time, more companies can be expected to try to enter the market. For instance, NetApp (NTAP), HPE (HPE), Cisco (CSCO), and VMware (VMW) already offer comprehensive HCI solutions which bring economic benefits to suppliers and clients. Therefore, the risk of competition can become more evident in the future in case the trend in the overall segment remains positive.However, Nutanix has positioned itself as one of the leaders in the HCI from the early years of the technology's existence, which means the company has an early-mover advantage. For instance, the recent Gartner Magic Quadrant for HCI named Nutanix as a genuine leader in the field, which shows the corporation continues to be ahead of its rivals in most aspects. This should ensure that more potential clients will choose Nutanix's solutions over other offerings, and as a result, the corporation will continue growing its subscription-based cash flows, helping the stock deliver solid results in the coming years.(Source: Nutanix website)Regarding actual stock price targets, it is almost impossible to set an exact number at the moment, as the company is still in its early stages of development. However, my estimate is that by 2020, when the company is expected to achieve at least a break-even point in terms of profitability, the stock can easily return to the highs of 2018; namely, the level of $60-65, which defines a solid upside potential of up to 50%."
4245942,21815,2019-03-02T10:22:04-05:00,"Nasty shock out of the blue at Nutanix leaves investors groping around for explanations.For now, given that there is a lot that is going right as well, we give management the benefit of the doubt.But apart from holding our position (still well in the black), we're not inclined to add until the smoke clears up a bit.","Nutanix (NTNX) was performing very well in the SHU portfolio, but the Q3 guidance was a bit of a rude awakening. What to do with the shares?A company like Nutanix, which runs on substantial valuation multiples, can't afford to have an execution failure, especially since the company isn't profitable and isn't expected to be profitable for some time to come.Yet, that is what happened, and the big question, of course, is whether this was a one-off or whether there is something more structural going on.Here is what happened, according to management. In 2017, they really increased spending on lead generation, by a whopping 75%. This paid off in 2018, and then a number of things happened:In our view, the pressures here come from their product proliferation as the company has developed and introduced numerous new products in the last couple of years.This has created both cost pressures, as well as the enticing opportunity of selling these new products to existing customers, leading to neglecting lead generation.The good thing about this is that this looks like an internal issue, which seems to be remediable. The company is correcting that since December and will continue to correct that (Q2CC):But this is of course adding cost, and perhaps that has something to do with the fairly abysmal EPS guidance for Q3 (a loss of $0.60). From the Q2CC:Somewhat reassuring is that 75% of that increase is just the run rate. Also, management argues there won't be a similar increase in spending from Q3 to Q4, so this seems to be a one-off.There is also of course the possibility that this merely looks like an internal issue, but that there are wider factors at work. There are some reasons to look here, as competitor NetApp (NTAP) also suffered from weakness, which they blamed on a market slowdown. Management isn't buying that (Q2CC):Or perhaps there are competitive worries? This too was dismissed by management (Q2CC):The company has indeed considerable external validation from Gartner (Q2CC):There are perhaps some mitigating forces as the company has gone through several changes in the last 18 months or so:Of course, the sales force also has to deal with these changes, and this might have dulled their message a bit and reduced their productivity, or as management (quoting former Intel CEO Andy Groove) put it (Q2CC, our emphasis):There is more bad news to come, though:On the latter (Q2CC):The spend issue was a global issue so the impact on EMEA leads is yet to appear.One might wonder whether there were any positives in the quarter. Well, some we have already mentioned:For Q3, from the earnings PR:That's indeed quite a shock, it means a non-GAAP loss of over $100M and revenues falling well short of expectations, with revenue expected to be $331M and EPS at -$0.25.One worry would be the fact that the company is loss making and profitability isn't in the near future perspective. However, fears should be allayed considerably when contemplating the above figures which show a market improvement in cash flow.These figures don't yet include Q2 results and this quarter was not quite as good, but also no reason to panic (Q2CC):The company isn't going to run out of cash anytime soon as they closed Q2 with cash and short-term investments of $966 million, up $1 million from Q1. The company has also $429.6 million in convertible notes outstanding.Enterprise value is roughly $5.5 billion; with revenue roughly at $1.3 billion, it's selling at 4.2x fiscal year 2019 (ending in June) sales. That is not expensive.The company still has a lot going for it, and if it can restore the new deals pipe, it has lots of up-selling opportunities as well with a host of new products that are only in the first stage of generating traction.But investor confidence has been understandably shaken and this will take considerable time to restore. An analyst even exhorted that they bring the promoted EMEA sales wonder Chris Kaddaras to the analyst day and next earnings call.And that's provided that management's diagnosis is the correct one and there is not some more fundamental shift (and/or deceleration) going on in the market.Since we're still well in the black in this name, we're going to give them the benefit of the doubt and sit it out, but we wouldn't be buyers of a new position here."
4232465,104905,2019-01-10T09:15:00-05:00,"Nutanix is a fast growing software company that is not sufficiently appreciated by the market.Total revenue growth is compressed at the moment but will most certainly accelerate in the next quarters.Gross margins are expanding and the company, while still operating at a loss, has great future profitability potential.On top of that Nutanix is one of the most innovative, founder-led companies in the enterprise IT space and has a lot of optionality.","For me, my best investments have often evolved around visionary founder-leaders. Especially in new and emerging fields, the importance to side with the right people can not be overstated. As Steve Jobs said: “Innovation has nothing to do with how many R&D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R&D. It’s not about money. It’s about the people you have, how you’re led, and how much you get it.“I think Dheeraj Pandey, CEO of Nutanix, is a person who really gets it. Pandey graduated from the highly competitive Indian Institute of Technology (IIT, Kanpur), where he was adjudged the “Best All-Rounder Student Among All Graduating Students in All Disciplines”. He then ventured to the US with only $900 dollars in his pockets and ultimately founded Nutanix. In less than 10 years Nutanix reached $1 billion in annual revenue, faster than any other software company founded in the past 20 years, Salesforce, Palo Alto, Workday included. It’s a fascinating story. And I think it is just at the beginning.Nutanix is a leader in the HCI market. According to IDC, overall revenue from hyper-converged systems sales grew 78.1% year over year during the second quarter of 2018. This growth is simply mind-boggling. It’s safe to say, that HCI is a very important emerging market in the enterprise IT space. And if you look at the bigger picture – IT infrastructure as a whole – the opportunity is mouthwatering. Pandey estimated that CAPEX in IT infrastructure is currently around $200 billion per year and OPEX (where Nutanix’ products will offer most cost reductions) amounts to more than $400 billion per year.But what is HCI and what is Nutanix doing? I will resist copying a generic definition of the HCI-market, for the simple fear of completely losing readers' interest in a matter of seconds. In essence, Nutanix is selling software solutions to companies that will make their hardware (think datacenter and servers) much more efficient and easier to use.In my view, what you have to know as an investor is this: Nutanix claims that their products create ROI (return on investment) for customers as fast as 3 months. This means when a customer buys Nutanix’ products he will save so much money from using it that he can expect to earn back the cost in a timeframe of as little as 3 months. Of course, the savings won’t stop there but will continually benefit the customer going forward. This won’t happen so quickly with every customer but it should give you an idea of the customer appeal of Nutanix’ solutions.What also resonates with customers is that they don’t have to spend huge amounts up-front with Nutanix but can “buy slow and pay as they grow“. This is one of the essential advantages of the (public) cloud and a big reason for the explosive growth of the cloud-businesses of Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT). Nutanix is bringing this advantage to on-premise company datacenters, which explains why they coined the terms “private or enterprise cloud“ for their products.Nutanix is trying to bring a consumer-grade experience to enterprise solutions. In this context, they are looking at solutions to blur the lines between the private and the public cloud (creating a “hybrid cloud“), ultimately making infrastructure invisible for the customer, and, therefore, further reducing complexity and costs for the enterprise. The endgame for Nutanix would be to become the operating system of the cloud, which would make Nutanix not only the top pick for 2019 but possibly the top pick for the next decade. To keep expectations in check, it has to be said, however, that becoming the OS of the cloud is, at this point, more a dream than reality and, if ever achieved, still many years away. But there are other great reasons to be invested in the stock.The reason why I think Nutanix is a great investment for 2019 is very simple: It is almost guaranteed that we will see accelerating revenue growth every quarter from now on. That is because the company decided to stop selling “pass-through“ hardware (that is hardware from 3rd parties that they sold at 0% margin together with their software) in 2017. While in Q1 2018 these “pass-through“ hardware sales made up 29% of total sales, they are now (Q1 2019) only accounting for 10% of total sales. This obviously creates tough comparisons for the beginning of 2019, when 2019 sales (mostly without the hardware-portion) are compared with hardware-rich 2018 sales – in Q1 2019 total sales only grew 13.4% because of this. However, as every quarter passes this coming year the comparisons will become easier and easier, ultimately pushing the overall revenue growth rate back up to the growth rate of their software business. How much is that you may ask?Software and support revenue grew 44% in Q1 2019 and almost reached the $1 billion mark for the last twelve months. Arguably an even more important metric to look at is software and support billings. Billings are what your customers already paid you even if you haven’t provided your services yet (think of advance payments for subscription contracts). Accounting rules state that billings can only be recognized as revenue when the service is actually provided (until then they are accounted as deferred revenues). However, in the real world billings are what you get as a company; this is the money that is actually in the bank. In my opinion, there is no reason not to treat it like revenue today, especially, in Nutanix case where the services will be rendered with almost 100% certainty.Software and support billings grew 49% in Q1 2019 and deferred revenue (that’s the part of billings that is not allowed in the official revenue numbers) grew a whopping 72%. What is even more encouraging is the roadmap laid out by management. They believe to reach at least $3 billion in software and support billings by July 2021. Bear in mind that today the company trades at approximately $8 billion market cap. That would be a 2.7 forward (2021) price to sales ratio for a company with way over 70% gross margins and substantial profit potential.Speaking of gross margins, they have exploded since the company decided to move out of zero margin hardware sales: from 62% in Q1 2018 to 76% in Q1 2019. This trend should continue for the next couple of quarters. Having said that, the company doesn’t seem to be in a rush to become profitable anytime soon. While a positive trend is visible – from 2016 to 2018 the operating margin (on a Non-GAAP basis) improved from -17% to -13% to -8% – in the most recent quarter operating margin went down both yoy and sequentially.More encouraging for investors is that the company is cash flow positive for some time now, which is no surprise since deferred revenue (remember, that’s cash they already received from customers) is always added back in the cash flow statement. Thus, cash flows paint a much healthier and truer picture of the business. Free cash flow margin reached a bit over 6% in the most recent quarter.What should also reassure investors who worry about the lack of profitability is that the company has around $930 million cash and $430 million of debt (convertible senior notes with 0% interest), leaving a healthy $500 million net cash position.At this stage, there are good reasons to try to amass as many customers as possible. And Nutanix has succeeded with this so far, adding close to 1,000 customers per quarter in the last two years. They currently stand at 11,490. What is even more impressive is that they achieved an average Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 90 in the last 4 years. This kind of customer satisfaction is almost unheard of, but it goes to show that Pandey’s customer-centric approach is working. It also explains why Global 2000 customers that have been customers for more than 18 months spend, on average, approximately 10 times more with Nutanix today than with their initial purchase.The company is not only resonating with customers, but also employees seem to enjoy their time. According to Glassdoor, Nutanix has a 4.2-star rating, 83% would recommend them to a friend and 94% approve of CEO Dheeraj Pandey, which, by the way, further solidifies the theory that he is a wonderful leader.As already stated, the company has a current market cap of around $8 billion. If you take out the $0.5 billion net cash position the enterprise value computes to $7.5 billion. Since hardware sales will lose importance going forward (and have never added value because of 0% gross margins anyway) I think it is more accurate to calculate the EV/S ratio with only software and support revenue. TTM software and support revenue stand at $985 million currently, yielding an EV/S ratio of approximately 7.6. I assume that the company will grow these revenues by approximately 45% in 2019, giving us $1.43 billion in sales and a forward EV/S of 5.2. Am I the only one who believes that a company growing at around 40% (presumably at least for the next three years) and gross margins quickly approaching 80% looks very attractive from a valuation standpoint? I believe they have great potential to see a considerable multiple expansion in 2019 and beyond.But this low valuation has also been a reason of concern to me. Usually, when valuations are relatively low compared to other companies the market has a good reason. In Nutanix’ case, I struggled quite a bit to find a really compelling reason for the compressed valuation for some time now. My current understanding is that the marketI’ve already talked to the first point, which should be alleviated in the next quarters. As to the last two points, I think they are valid reasons for some concern.As you can see on this Magic Quadrant graph by Gartner, the HCI space is very competitive. Many very respectable and well-established players reside in that desired right top of the graph. However, if you look closer at the competitive landscape you will realize that this is really a two-horse race. Nutanix and VMWare are the market leaders in HCI software with around 34% of the market each (Nutanix is slightly edging VMWare by 0.1% actually). It's certainly reaffirming to know that Gartner believes that Nutanix is the top dog in HCI. Be that as it may, I believe that the HCI market is big enough for more than one company to thrive. At the same time, it also has to be said that since Nutanix is definitely not the overwhelming market leader in the space, they probably deserve a somewhat smaller valuation multiple than other companies that are more dominant in their niche. Still, I think a 5.2 forward EV/S multiple is too low for their prospects.Finally, there is the issue of investor confusion. Not that their technology is not already complicated enough, constant changes in the business (adding new products at a rapid pace, changing their market strategy from hardware+software, to software-only, to mainly SaaS in the future) makes it sometimes hard to get a grasp of what’s really going on inside. Additionally, Pandey – a techie by heart – often uses lingo that sometimes seems to increase confusion among investors (the one writing here included). Nutanix is definitely not the easiest company to follow.Having said that, all their recent changes can be explained pretty easily: Regarding the shift to SaaS, as many software companies before them, Nutanix has figured out that they can increase their long-term profits and their stickiness by charging customers through subscriptions – this should be a welcome change by investors. It should also not confuse investors that they started their business by selling hardware and software in a bundle. After all, they were a total nobody at the beginning and somehow had to get their software to customers. It was only logical to form convenient packages of hardware and software to get a foot into customers doors. Now that they have that foot in the door it makes commercial sense to do away with the zero-margin hardware business and become more hardware agnostic, expanding their overall market opportunity.As regards to their ever-expanding product portfolio: While it brings uncertainty and the potential of wasted development efforts, it also brings the company optionality. Also, who can blame them for being innovative in such a competitive field – that’s what they have to do. Many of their new products could be billion-dollar businesses on their own one day. However, it should also be said that the company’s aforementioned goal of reaching $3 billion software and support billings by 2021 was set with only their core HCI-products in mind. If they are successful with new product lines they will just be the cherry on the top of an already great investment opportunity."

The company offers an enterprise cloud platform that leverages web-scale engineering to converge computing, storage, networking, and virtualization into a highly scalable, resilient software-defined solution based on commodity hardware components. It is the market leader in hyper-converged infrastructure, as recognized by Forrester Wave and Gartner, for the company’s 10-point lead in market share compared to its closest competitor. However, competition from major diversified computing infrastructure vendors such as Dell/EMC, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and HPE is heating up. At a lofty 6x EV/ revenue multiple, there isn’t much margin for error, and we think the risks outweigh the reward going forward.Revenues for 1Q19 came in at $313.3M, up 14% YoY and above consensus of $305M, driven by Hardware Pass-through and Services revenues that were above expectations. Software and support billings came in at $351M, an increase of 50% YoY. EPS was reported at -$.13 above consensus of -$.26. The primary driver for this earnings beat was operating expenses coming in at $272M versus the expected $280-290M with lower-than-anticipated hiring the key to the opex shortfall. Product revenue of $224.3M was a 2% increase YoY above the expected $221.8M. Support and service revenue increased by 57% YoY to $88.9M, $5.4M higher than consensus. Revenue guidance for 2Q19 $325-335M beat consensus by 1%.The company is continuing with its plans to remove pass-through hardware revenue from its P&L by 4Q19. Billings in pass-through hardware are forecasted to be in the range of 5-10% in any given quarter. The company is guiding 2Q19 gross margin of 78-79%. Regardless of the product mix, the company assures investors the gross margins will remain in the high seventies.Management expects that subscription revenues will make up 70-75% of total billings by FY21, up from 1Q19's 41%. Overall, the company expects that a significant portion of its business will be recurring in nature. The trend of lower margin hardware pass-through business is decreasing, and the higher margin subscription sales increasing is an encouraging one. The company also improved transparency via a reorganization into four segments — subscription, non-portable software, pass-through hardware, and professional services.Key risks to Nutanix are: Nutanix provides unique value in the way it reimagined IT infrastructure. Competitors have realized the challenge from Hyperconverged infrastructure and are racing to catch up. Nutanix maintains the 10-point lead in this category in market share terms. Nutanix also boasts an impressive 90% customer retention rate. That, combined with the company’s net promoter score of 90, suggests competition will have a tough time taking market share. To reach its stated goal of at least $3B in billings by FY21, Nutanix will need to increase its penetration into America’s global 12,000. Penetration currently stands at 15%.While we do like the Nutanix growth story, we don’t think valuations are warranted – the stock currently trades at ~6x EV/ revenue. With competition from the likes of Dell/EMC, Cisco, and HPE also heating up, the Nutanix story isn’t without risks, and we’d much rather stay on the sidelines for this one."
4245681,104905,2019-03-01T11:06:20-05:00,"Nutanix just reported a very disappointing quarterly earnings report, especially regarding guidance for Q3 2019.
        Management admitted to problems regarding lead generation spending, sales hiring, their business transformation and potential confusion because of their increasing product portfolio among sales personal and customers.
        Their $3 billion software and support billings target for 2021 is seriously in doubt and most likely not achievable.
        Proftability has taken a big hit and will be even more under pressure in the next couple of quarters. The company will also drop below it's own profitability and growth yardstick the ""Rule of 40"".
        Nutanix is not my top pick for 2019 anymore.","Did someone recently write that Nutanix (NTNX) was his top stock pick for 2019? Who? Me? Well, I think I have to put that call to the trash.Nutanix just reported their second quarter 2019 earnings results and, to be honest, there isn't too much to like about it. In my glowing Nutanix-article, the main part of my thesis why they would be such a good investment in 2019 was that it ""is almost guaranteed that we will see accelerating revenue growth every quarter from now on"". Using the phrase ""almost guaranteed"" in investing? I should have known better.Why was the quarter so badly perceived, sending shares down 25% in after-market trading as of this writing? I think most of that has to do with very disappointing guidance. I know, I just wrote two articles about Twilio (TWLO) and Square (SQ), arguing that companies like to low-ball estimates to give them enough room to beat and raise. But this argument probably needs some more nuance. Company's like Twilio and Square are hyper-growth companies with tremendous business momentum and have a track record of beating and raising. Unfortunately, after yesterday's call, Nutanix does not belong to that category.After just meeting the top-range of guidance for Q2 revenue of $335 million (usually they beat that easily), Nutanix, shockingly, guided for $295 million revenue in Q3 2019 (at the mid-point of the guidance range), only up 2% yoy and down almost 12% sequentially, for the first sequential revenue decline in the company's public market history. The same goes for billings guidance which calls for 4% yoy growth and an 11.6% sequential decline.Because of the removal of hardware sales, however, yoy growth rates don't show an apple to apple comparison when looking at total revenue and billings. Thus, it is better to look at software and support billings, which I singled out as one of the most important metrics to follow. The company doesn't provide guidance for their all-important software and support revenue and billings but already showed a considerable growth rate decline in billings in Q2 2019, growing only 36.7%, which is down from 59.9% in Q2 2018 and 49.4% in Q1 2019.Since in Q3 2018 hardware sales made up approximately 21% of revenue and 17% of billings and today hardware sales account for around 11% and 9% respectively, growth in software and support revenue and billings would amount to approximately 16% and 14% in Q3, respectively, according to guidance (assuming that the revenue and billings mix doesn't change from Q2 2019).It should also be noted that the move to a subscription model impacts near-term revenue growth negatively because in the old model revenue was typically recognized up-front and in the subscription model revenue gets mostly recognized ratable, which leads to lower revenue in the short-term but higher deferred revenue.Source: Nutanix Investor Relations.That explains why deferred revenue growth was actually one of the bright spots in the earnings report with 63.2% yoy-growth. However, even the deferred revenue growth rate has slowed down sequentially from Q1 2019 where it came in at 71.6%.Even though the transition away from hardware sales and the transition to a subscription model explain some part of the growth deceleration from a financial perspective, they do not explain all of it – far from it.As CFO Duston Williams put it:We can only speculate what all the reasons for this deceleration really are but management provided some reasons in the call:One important issue that was raised multiple times was some mismanagement regarding lead generation spending that were impacting the sales pipeline. According to the CFO they over rotated their spending to the existing customer base and large customers and underspent on new customers.Another issue that resurfaced from the previous earnings call was their inability to achieve their sales hiring goals which also affected their sales pipeline. CEO Pandey also talked about ""a few opportunities"" to improve the sales execution in the Americas region but sounds more like a minor issue in my opinion.Probably the biggest distraction to Nutanix' sales force, which finally seems to be showing up in the results, was their recent business transformations from a hardware and software sales model to software-only to software-subscription, and their vast expansion of product offerings. In my previous article, I talked about how that tends to confuse investors. Add Nutanix' sales force and customers to that list of confused people. I totally underestimated the impact of these severe business changes. Here are some snippets from the conference call where Pandey addresses this issue:The problem is that these issues don't sound like they will be solved in a heartbeat. It will probably take many months to get this straight again and in the meantime, the company and the stock could suffer. Sales issues like these are major distractions and could also have negative impacts on their competitive positioning going forward. Nutanix' biggest competitor, VMWare (VMW), just reported over 60% license bookings growth in their competing vSan HCI-product. Is VMWare already profiting from Nutanix' struggles?We also saw in the recent quarter that the transition away from hardware revenue isn't going as planned. The company targeted to bring down hardware as a percentage of total revenue down to 5% eventually. The company started this process in Q1 2018 when hardware was still 29% of revenue and gradually decreased this percentage every quarter to 10% in Q1 2019. However, in Q2 hardware sales as a percentage of revenue inched up 1 percentage point again to 11% of revenue. Does that indicate that the company is struggling to transition away from hardware? And combined with the fact that growth is slowing, does that mean that this software only approach is maybe not resonating as well with customers as they have predicted? Unfortunately, this wasn't addressed in the call but it should be watched closely in the future.Another big problem I had with the quarter was the company pushing back their expectation to achieve $3 billion in software and support billings by 2021. Nutanix' has been reiterating this promise many times in the past, even stating that this target will be met on their HCI-product alone, which led many investors following this company, including me, to believe that they will probably surpass that target easily. Now, the company believes that they will probably need to push back achieving that milestone by ""a quarter or two"".The problem is that when a company starts backing down from its growth estimations, there is usually more bad news to follow. And doing the math here doesn't make me more confident.The company ended 2018 with $1.16 billion software and support billings. To reach $3 billion in 2021 that meant growing by an average yearly rate of 37.2%. Since the company grew 54% in 2018 this didn't seem impossible to achieve. However, since Q4 2018, when growth was 66%, the company reported growth of 49.4% in Q1 2019 (which could have been a seasonal anomaly since the company only grew software and support billings by 23% in Q1 2018) and 36.7% now in Q2 2019. That means the company already dropped below the necessary average yearly growth rate to achieve $3 billion in 2021. What is even worse is that looking at Q3 guidance this growth rate will have to drop even more severely. And who knows how long it will take the company to get back on its growth track again? Management will talk more about their $3 billion-goal on Investor Day in March but to be honest I can't see them reporting something positive on that front that is also convincing. To not become too pessimistic, it has to be said that reaching this $3 billion-goal is not a make-or-break issue for this company and investment. But if a management team constantly reminds their investors about some lofty long-term target and then already slashes it three years in advance it should raise some eyebrows.What should also raise investors eyebrows is Nutanix' profitability outlook. Now, I have no problem if a company is investing in growth and pushes out profitability as long as they see great growth opportunities and have high gross margins. But if a company basically stops growing their top-line and triples their Non-GAAP loss per share outlook both sequentially and yoy, alarm bells start ringing in my head.The company also announced that they would dip below their ""Rule of 40"" target over the next couple of quarters with the objective to return to 40 as soon as possible. I never was a big fan of this metric, which combines the revenue growth rate (in Nutanix' case software and support revenue) with the free cash flow yield, and states that a value above 40 is ""good"" and below 40 is ""not good"". (Who says that and why? It sounds so arbitrary to me.) Anyways, management takes this Rule of 40 framework as their guideline and falling below their own profitability yardstick is not a good development. It's no shame to fall below Wall Streets expectations, it's a different story if you don't meet your own.I wouldn't go as far as to say that Nutanix' investment thesis is broken. One quarter doesn't make a trend and even though their business transitions and sales force issues are serious distractions to the business and are impacting growth and cash flows, these things can be resolved. I still think that Nutanix is a very innovative company, has a great leader in Dheeraj Pandey, great products and lots of optionality.But those things can not hide the fact that this quarterly earnings report was a real dud. Their sales pipeline, business transition and product confusion problems probably won't be resolved quickly. Q3 will see things worsen considerably and I don't believe that Q4 will reverse that trend dramatically to the positive side. I didn't get into valuation yet, their TTM EV/S based on software and support revenue is approximately 4.6 which looks cheap. But who cares? Of course, valuation goes down if the business deteriorates. That should not be a reason to buy. I don't see any meaningful upside for Nutanix' shares in the immediate future, my thesis of accelerating top-line growth just broke completely, and it's certainly not my top pick for 2019 anymore. But I have been wrong about them before so don't take my word for gospel.I didn't sell shares of Nutanix yet and haven't decided what to do but it is very likely that I will reduce my position or sell out completely in the future. I definitely won't add on this weakness.If you like what you just read, consider following me so you get notified when my new articles come out and you can read them before they hit the paywall.

4213672,104608,2018-10-24T00:05:51-04:00,Both Nutanix and BlackLine remain at depressed levels even after the recent technology correction.These companies are among the leading software names in the market with significant growth potential in upcoming years.Valuations have dipped well below recent highs and provides investors with the opportunity to purchase shares on sale.,"Though Nutanix (NTNX) and BlackLine (BL) do not compete against each other, both of these names have been beaten up pretty bad over the past few weeks as the market saw a slight correction. Both of these names are leading software players in their respective industries and have the potential for significant market share gains over the next few years. Over the past few weeks, both NTNX and BL saw their forward revenue multiples compress by ~4-5 turns while the S&P 500 only compressed ~1 turn.The significant divergence between them was largely focused on investors trading out of higher multiple, already profitable names year-to-date. NTNX and BL had both performed very well and it was not a huge shock to see profit taking at those levels.NTNX data by YChartsYTD, the S&P 500 is up just over 3% and though NTNX and BL have significantly corrected in recent weeks, they both have still generated large amounts of alpha. However, their current valuations have been very suppressed and pushed down too low. Long-term investors should be jumping all over these opportunities to purchase long-term winning names.I have previously written a few articles on NTNX which goes more in depth about the market opportunity. Nutanix continues to be the leader in the HCI market, with revenues growing nearly 50% this past quarter. As NTNX phases out their pass-through hardware sales, they will begin to focus solely on their software business, which generates higher margins and has much greater visibility into future revenues. NTNX announced this transition in Q1 and the company has seen a relative smooth transition so far.During Q4, NTNX grew their software and support billings by 66%, which slightly decelerated from 67% in Q3. Investors should expect slight deceleration from a $1 billion+ revenue company growing billings at this rate. However, the mere ~1 percentage point deceleration is an impressive feat in itself.Total software and support revenue increased 49% for the quarter, and 47% for F18. Software revenue reached ~$900 million for F18 and with growth still near 50%, this is one of the fastest software companies out there. Management’s commitment to their software-only approach will cause increased investments in order to grow their market share.Rather than focusing on profitability, management talks about their placement in the Rule of 40, that is revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin. Companies who grow their revenues at this high of a rate will inevitably decelerate their growth rate as they strive to become profitable. The Rule of 40 suggests that as a company matures and begins to focus on profitability, the summation of revenue growth and free cash flow margin above 40 signifies a strong company. NTNX reported a Rule of 40 value of 51 for the year, placing them at the high end of the software company spectrum.Source: Company PresentationGross margins remained very healthy at 78% and I would assume these margins will continue to expand towards 80%, especially as the company generates more software revenue, which has higher margins.As the company sheds their lower margin, slower growth hardware sales, investors should expect higher gross margins. The one caveat with this, which was somewhat seen this past quarter, is that the quicker NTNX gets rid of their hardware sales, their revenue growth will be artificially lower. Since they would no longer record their hardware sales, their top line might take a slight hit to the growth figure. However, this means gross margins would come in higher than expected.Source: Company PresentationBillings are a great proxy for the company’s transition to software revenue. The more software billings the company generates, the more future revenue will come from software sales. The below above is a great depiction of the company’s transformation over the years and as you can see, F19 shows a very low percentage of billings coming from hardware sales. In essence, by the end of F19, the company will have minimal hardware sales left to get rid of. Because of this transition and management’s strong commitment, I firmly believe NTNX should be valued as a software-only company.BL continues to remain the leader in the relatively small and under appreciated accounting software market. They reported another solid quarter of earnings and continues to demonstrate why they deserve to trade at a premium multiple compared to other market leading software providers.BL reported another solid quarter of revenue growth and positive earnings. In Q2, revenue grew 32%, reaching $55.5 million, which beat consensus estimates by ~3%. BL continues to grow their top line at a very impressive pace, which is just one of many reasons why they deserve to trade at a premium multiple for the foreseeable future.The company's operations is all software, or SaaS, based. Essentially this means they will have very high gross and operating margins because the cost of sales remains low. Having no hardware sales in their business model affords them this opportunity to maintain high margins. A majority of BL's expenses will continue to come from R&D and S&M. These expenses typically remains very high for company's in growth mode and they seek to continually enhance their product and bolster their sales efforts.BL's near 83% gross margin improved by almost 300bps y/y, a very impressive feat considering where gross margins stand. In addition, BL was able to generate positive operating income, compared to over $600k loss during the same time period last year. This is significant improvement y/y and operating margins will continue to expand as BL's cost structure improves over time.Some of BL's opportunities for further growth include expanding international operations and further penetrate into middle market sized companies. For Q2, management noted their EMEA regions once again had a solid growth, now representing over 21% of total revenues, up from ~19% last year. Management also talked about how middle-market growth represents 16% of revenue and growth remains solid and on pace. Both of these demonstrates the company's dedication and investment in growing areas of the business which will in turn drive future growth and profitability.Source: Company PresentationThe chart above does a great job depicting how profitable customers become over the long-run. Essentially, the average customer from 2012 now spends 3.7x their initial contract valued. It is a very positive sign that each year of progression sees a higher revenue multiple. This essentially means that customers are satisfied with BL's products and are inclined to spend more each and every year, further driving revenue growth and profitability.BL reported EPS of $0.01, which was 2 cents better than consensus' estimates for a $0.02 loss. This marked the company's fourth consecutive quarter of profitability as they remain on track to become profitable for the year. For some investors, this may be difficult to understand. Why would someone invest in a company that doesn't make any money?BL's operations are built around a subscription based model, much like your Netflix account. Their products, once integrated into their customer's architecture, become relatively difficult to replace in terms of opportunity costs. In addition, BL spends a lot on R&D and S&M as they continue to rapidly expand their impressive 30%+ top line growth. If the company wanted to become profitable and grow at a much slower rate, this would not be a problem for them. BL will continue to invest in their business as they expand internationally and into the middle market.These names should not be compared against each other on an apples to apples basis. NTNX is still in the midst of transition to software-only sales, whereas BL is already fully software. In addition, BL is the clear market leader in a relatively untapped marketplace, where as NTNX faces a little bit more competition from legacy players. Nonetheless, both of these names should trade at a much higher forward revenue multiple than their current valuation.NTNX EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe past few weeks have wreaked havoc on both of these names, with NTNX's multiple compressing in half and BL seeing a ~4x turn compression. At face value, NTNX seems like a long-term value play and BL may still seem a bit expensive. The two charts below demonstrate some of the faster growing software-only names in the tech space and their relative forward revenue multiple.NTNX EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsNTNX Revenue (Annual YoY Growth) data by YChartsFor NTNX, their forward revenue multiple of 4.5x for a company growing their software sales at 50% makes their current valuation sound relatively cheap. On a software-only basis, NTNX's 50% growth rate is among the highest of the below software-only peer group, all of which have premium revenue valuations. I believe NTNX continues to trade at a discounted level because of their ongoing transition to software and their excellent returns since going public (which makes them an easier target for profit taking).The second highest growth rate in the above chart is BL, growing their revenue nearly 45%. However, their valuation is only in the middle of the peer group. The disconnect between BL and the higher-trading peer group is somewhat due to profitability/cash flow and the other part due to the unknown factor. BL competes in a largely untapped market whereas some of the other competitors compete in industries that have demonstrated significant demand. As BL continues to grow into their market and define the leadership in the accounting software market, their valuation will continue to trade at a premium, even expanding from current levels.Overall, both of these names now trade at significant discounts due to the correction over the past few weeks. Although it is unknown whether or not this correction has reached the end, NTNX and BL provide investors with a great opportunity to purchase long-term winners at a cheap valuation."
4225014,104608,2018-11-28T05:56:58-05:00,"Nutanix reported another strong quarter with software and support revenue growing 44%.The company remains ahead of schedule with eliminating their pass-through hardware sales, which now represent only 10% of revenue and 8% of billings.Valuation has contracted over the past three months. With the stock down over 30%, however, long-term outlook remains very positive.","Nutanix (NTNX) has been under a lot of pressure over the past few months, down over 30% over the past three months. The contraction has been greater than a majority of the tech stocks under pressure, namely the higher valued names. However, NTNX reported a very strong Q1 earnings and reassured investors of their long-term strength and market opportunity.Total revenue increased ~14% to $313.3 million, although this included $104 million of eliminated pass-through hardware revenue. Software and support revenue reached $280.7 million, an increase of 44% y/y and gross margins improved to 78.6% (compared to 77.7% last quarter and 61.9% in the year-ago quarter).NTNX data by YChartsNTNX was initially trading up ~10% after hours, though this has come back a bit. As they continue on their path towards transition to a software-only model, NTNX should begin to see their valuation reflect a more positive sentiment with valuation re-rating higher.As NTNX phases out their pass-through hardware sales, they will begin to focus solely on their software business, which generates higher margins and has much greater visibility into future revenues. NTNX announced this transition last year and I previously wrote an article going through this transition and how NTNX should now be valued. The recent pullback provides a great opportunity for investors to build and increase their holdings in the leading HCI player.During Q1, NTNX grew their software and support billings by 50%, decelerating from 66% in Q4; however, software and support billings are now at a $1.4 billion run-rate and investors should expect billings to decelerate over time. Total revenue was up 14%; however, this included $104 million from eliminated pass-through hardware sales. Software and support revenue reached $280.7 million, representing nearly 90% of revenue and growing 44% y/y.Source: Company PresentationAfter management discussed their vision of a software-only company a year ago, NTNX has taken great strides in accomplishing this. The chart above shows hardware revenue represents only 10% of total revenue, down from nearly 30% a year ago. Hardware billings are only 8% of total billings, down from 25% a year ago.In addition, NTNX has seen their gross margin drastically improve over the past four quarters, reaching nearly 80% the past two quarters. As NTNX continues on their path towards become a software-only company, gross margins should continue to expand and I believe they will be able to maintain gross margins near the 80% level.Source: Company PresentationRather than focusing on profitability, management talks about their placement in the Rule of 40, that is revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin. Companies who grow their revenues at this high of a rate will inevitably decelerate their growth rate as they strive to become profitable. The Rule of 40 suggests that as a company matures and begins to focus on profitability, the summation of revenue growth and free cash flow margin above 40 signifies a strong company. NTNX reported a Rule of 40 value of 54% for the quarter, placing them at the high end of the software company spectrum (note: the chart below is from a previous investor day and is not updated through the most recent quarterly results).Source: Company PresentationAs NTNX continues to shed their hardware sales, we should expect overall margins to improve, in terms of both gross and operating. In addition, as NTNX continues to scale, they should be able to decrease their operating expenses, such as R&D and S&M. The one caveat with this (which I discussed in a previous article) is that the quicker NTNX loses their hardware sales, their revenue growth will be artificially lower. This was seen this quarter as overall revenue grew only 14%, compared to software/support revenue growth of 44%. However, this means gross margins would come in higher than expected, which was also seen the past two quarters.NTNX’s customer cohort is also a big driver of their future growth. Traditionally, they have focused on the enterprise market, leaving the middle market companies largely untouched. However, NTNX has placed a lot more emphasis on the middle market and has initiated several internal sales programs to place more emphasis on this large market opportunity.At the end of Q1, NTNX had nearly 11,500 customers, with 720 of the Global 2,000 customers. Growing the middle market cohort will give NTNX a great opportunity to become the mainstream HCI name for companies of all sizes. In addition, NTNX experiences significant revenue growth from existing customers. This is demonstrated by customers who have been with NTNX for more than 18 months on average spend over 4x their initial purchase. Global 2,000 customers have an even stronger traction, with total lifetime purchases increasing 10.6x compared to the initial purchase. As NTNX continues to penetrate both the enterprise and middle market customer base, they will be able to have better insight into their revenue, much of which is rather sticky.Source: Company PresentationManagement also provided some guidance for Q2, which includes revenue of $325-335 million, or growth of 13-17% compared to revenue of $287 million in the year-ago period. Guidance includes the elimination of pass-through hardware sales, which will likely be similar to the $104 million in Q1. Billings are guided to $410-420 million, or growth of 15-18%, which includes the elimination of pass-through hardware sales.For Q2, NTNX remains bullish on their gross margin, guiding to 78-79%, which is similar to the past two quarters. As NTNX continues to transition to a software-only model, their gross margin should remain near the 80% mark. In addition, management is guiding to 180 million shares and a non-GAAP EPS loss of $0.25 (compared to 175 million and a net loss of $0.13 in Q1).The strong commitment to transitioning into a software-only company will help expand gross margins while maintaining impressive top line growth. Over time, the company and investors will have greater insight into revenue streams, which will ultimately be recurring. Many software-only companies typically trade at premium revenue multiples compared to other technology companies specializing in software and hardware.Software and support revenue was ~$900 million in FY18, growing at a 47% rate. This demonstrates one of the fastest revenue growth rates in the market for a company at this scale. During Q1, software and support revenue grew 44% and represented nearly 90% of total revenue. As the company continues to eliminate their pass-through hardware sales, their valuation will ultimately reflect a software-only model, thus, a higher revenue premium.In order to properly value NTNX, I looked at a variety of fast-growth software companies who trade at premium revenue multiples compared to the greater market. The list of peers include: New Relic (NEWR), ServiceNow (NOW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Red Hat (RHT), Splunk (SPLK), Atlassian (TEAM), and Workday (WDAY). All of the peers are considered leaders in their respective industries, hosting both strong revenue growth rates and consistently high gross margins.NTNX EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsTo be conservative, I used FY18’s software and support revenue of ~$900 million and assumed a rather significant deceleration to 40% for the full year (Q1 was 44% growth). This results in a conservative software revenue of ~$1.26 billion for FY19. A further deceleration to 35% for FY20 would result in software and support revenue of ~$1.70 billion.With a current market cap of ~$7.3 billion and net cash of ~$530 million, this gives NTNX an enterprise value of ~$6.8 billion. Using my conservative ~$1.70 billion software-only revenue in FY20, NTNX currently trades at a 4.0x conservative FY20 revenue multiple. My analysis also results in a 5.4x FY19 multiple, which compares to a peer group average of 9.8x.To be even more conservative around share count, I assumed there will continue to be a larger share count dilution each quarter. In Q1, total shares were 175 million with management expecting 180 million shares by the end of the year. For my analysis using FY20 numbers, I assumed 190 million shares, nearly 10% dilution from Q1's share count.With NTNX trading at 4.0x FY20 revenue, I believe this multiple could expand closer to the average peer group over the next 18-24 months. Assuming NTNX trades at a 7.0x multiple, still below the current peer group average of nearly 10.0x, NTNX would have an enterprise value of ~$11.9 billion. Backing out a more conservative $500 million of net cash results in a market cap of ~$12.4 billion. Using a conservative 190 million shares, this results in a price target of $65, a 45% upside to Tuesday's after-hours price of $44.50.I believe NTNX remains very undervalued given the company's transition to a software-only model and significant margin expansion. As the company completes this transition over the next 9-12 months, investors will begin to value NTNX as a software-only company, which typically comes with a higher revenue multiple premium.Risks to NTNX include a slower than expected transition to software-only sales, though it would have a slight benefit to revenue growth, and would negatively impact gross margins. The emergence of more competitors would also hamper NTNX’s growth."
4212928,21815,2018-10-20T07:26:56-04:00,"We see several tech shares off their highs by 20%, 30% or even 40% in short order, seemingly without any deterioration in their business outlook.The likely culprit: algos violently de-risking portfolios.How should retail deal with these situations? We have a few ideas.Despite significant opportunities opening up, we're not yet buying.","US markets have been on one of the longest bull markets in history, rising almost in a straight line between March 2009 and today:There have been the inevitable wobbles on the way, with the euro crisis (2011-12), taper tantrum (2013), the sudden Chinese devaluation (2016 and again early 2017) and now it looks like we're in one of these wobbly periods once again.This isn't exactly a surprise either, as there are plenty of risks:It's understandable that volatility is increasing when faced with these risks, especially when coming off a period of eerily calm markets. However, these risks aren't exactly new and markets always have to climb the proverbial wall of worry.But there is something else going on as well, look for instance at the following graph:In the space of 7 weeks, one of high-flying stocks of our SHU portfolio, Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), is basically crashing from $60+ to well below $40 and the available explanations seem thin. We sum up some deliberations:There are two argument that we can come up with to make at least some sense of this:One could also argue that the territory above $60, or even above $50, was a little exuberant, although the shares are actually not terribly expensive on a sales multiple, given the revenue growth (in the order of 50%) and the near complete transition towards a software only company.NTNX EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsAnd while the company does have substantial debt of $429M (convertible notes), this is hardly life threatening as they have twice as much cash and short-term investments and generate positive cash flow:NTNX Total Long Term Debt (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe graph below itself should be supportive of the share price:NTNX Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsIn short, we are puzzled by the share price crash in Nutanix. The most logical explanation is a sort of violent sector rotation, but this has hit Nutanix much harder than most other tech names as the Nasdaq is still close to all-time highs.A final explanation could be the spending of Nutanix on new solutions like its Xi platform or other ones like Calm, Era, Frame, Beam, Sherlock, and Epoch.NTNX Research and Development Expense (TTM) data by YChartsHowever, R&D spending is actually down compared to revenues, and if one is worried about increasing competition, perhaps its not such a bad idea to open up new revenue streams.In any case, cash flow is improving suggesting the company has no problem, although there has been quite a substantial dilution:NTNX Shares Outstanding data by YChartsBut still, competitor NetApp (NTAP) isn't nearly as volatile:It has been hurt by the tech selloff, but basically in line with the market. However, there are more 'victims,' it's a similar story with Alteryx (AYX):Once again, the graph makes a mockery of any rational market hypothesis. The fortunes of Alteryx haven't really changed in the space of a mere month, but the price has crashed pretty violently nevertheless.We wrote earlier about the dizzying number of opportunities for the company and we can assure the reader that they are all still there, sitting pretty.We have to admit that we found the run-up to $60+, although on the basis of better than expected quarterly figures, a little over the top. So once again, one could argue that this is at least letting some air out of the stock. But how much air is enough?Retail investors can't win against these algos, they're like the weather, basically. One cannot really predict these either, unless someone convinces us of the contrary.Protection in the form of puts is expensive and subject to time decay. There are actually instruments (called turbos or sprinters) that don't have this feature, but these are not available on American exchanges.The strategy we propose is to have a base position and trade around that. This really isn't fool proof either, but the worst that can happen is that you sell a part prematurely, in which case you have cash which is always handy, especially in a volatile market.You could also buy back prematurely (or buy the wrong stock altogether), but that's a general problem, not one that is a special feature of this strategy.Another way to deal with this, which is pretty similar, is to sell out of the money covered calls when the shares have rallied strongly, or sell out of the money puts when the shares have cratered.The worst that can happen then is that you'll be called out, in which case you either made a nice profit or are forced to buy shares at what you'd considered pretty bargain prices. There are worse things in the life of the retail investor.The third way to deal with this is simply to sit the volatility out, at least as long as you consider the company's fortunes to be unchanged. This is the Buffett way, but we warn you of several dangers here:Which is why we think trading around a core position is pretty useful. Given the graph, we would normally feel little hesitation in buying more Nutanix for the SHU portfolio, even if we 'forgot' to unload some at $60+ (or even $50+; in fact, we didn't unload anything).Our worry is not so much Nutanix, at least not at $38. Our worry is the general market. Any broader selloff isn't likely to leave Nutanix (or Alteryx) shares untouched, even if they have already been taken to the cleaners."
4245974,104608,2019-03-02T13:35:56-05:00,"Nutanix reported another solid Q2 earnings; however, guidance fell well below consensus estimates which drove the shares down over 30%.Their transition to a software-only approach will continue over the next several quarters which makes y/y comparisons not on an apples-to-applies basis.Valuation is just over 4x 2020 revenue, well below the software peer group despite NTNX being one of the top leaders in the HCI market.On a somewhat conservative 2020 revenue basis, we can see the shares have significant upside to Friday's closing price, which could include a potential takeover premium.","Nutanix (NTNX) posted another strong quarterly earnings; however, guidance for Q3 fell well below consensus estimates. NTNX has been on a long transition moving from a company selling both hardware and software to one that is solely focusing on their software growth. This has been a challenging aspect for the company, especially for their sales force who have had to change selling tactics amidst a transformative period.Post-earnings, the stock had the weakest performance since going public, dropping over 30% on Friday. While this seems like a tragic downfall, the company remains in a somewhat solid position considering the re-rating of their valuation. Despite the weaker than expected guidance, management has a history of being conservative and has the potential to beat their initial guidance for the upcoming quarter.Data by YChartsInvestors seem to be largely concerned with management's previous $3 billion software/support billings by 2021. Considering the downward guidance for the coming quarter, it seems very impractical NTNX can reach this goal. At this point, I do not believe NTNX will reach the $3 billion target; however, the 30% decline offers a great buying opportunity for a company which will continue to grow revenue well above industry average and whose valuation is well below where it should be.Just like a majority of other software technology names, NTNX's shares were under pressure during the last quarter of 2018. Shares were down over 40% from their recent highs before largely recovering those losses in a period which seems to have been an oversold market.After posting a strong Q2 earnings, management informed the investing community of a weaker than expected Q3, which drove the shares down over 30% on Friday, the weakest one-day performance in the company's history. I believe now is a great buying opportunity for a stock that was oversold and has significant upside potential over the next few years.During Q2, NTNX grew their software and support billings by 37%, which again decelerated from Q1 growth of 50%. However, software and support billings are now at a $1.2+ billing run-rate and investors should begin to expect some deceleration over time. Total revenue grew 17% which actually accelerated from 14% in Q1. Revenue growth included $78 million from hardware. The challenging part with NTNX is they are shifting away from hardware sales, which naturally will drag down the revenue growth of the company,Over time, as the company moves away from hardware and into a pure-software company, they should be seen as more favorable in the investing community. Typically, software-only companies receive a higher multiple due to their more predictable and measurable revenue streams, compared to the lumpier flows of hardware sales. However, when a company moves from a hardware/software combination to software only, they forgo their hardware sales which makes the year-over-year comparable tougher to beat, thus making revenue growth artificially lower.Source: Company PresentationIn my opinion, it is challenging to value NTNX based off of total revenue. Instead, I use a more forward-looking approach and only view the company's software revenue for valuation purposes. Yes, the hardware sales does provide solid top line growth; however, this low-margin revenue and growth potential does very little to drive valuation.For Q2, software and support revenue grew 42%, a rather impressive pace for a company approaching a $1.2 billion run-rate software revenue path. In addition, as the company continues to shed their hardware sales, gross margins continue to expand. Q2 gross margins were $76.8% compared to 63.5% in the year ago period. At this point, I believe gross margins on a purely software-only company will eventually eclipse 80%+.As NTNX continues to shed their hardware sales, we should expect overall margins to improve, in terms of both gross and operating. In addition, as NTNX continues to scale, they should be able to decrease their operating expenses, such as R&D and S&M. The one caveat with this (which I discussed in a previous article) is that the quicker NTNX loses their hardware sales, their revenue growth will be artificially lower. However, this means gross margins would come in higher than expected, which was also seen the past two quarters.NTNX’s customer cohort is also a big driver of their future growth. Traditionally, they have focused on the enterprise market, leaving the middle market companies largely untouched. However, NTNX has placed a lot more emphasis on the middle market and has initiated several internal sales programs to place more emphasis on this large market opportunity.At the end of Q2, NTNX had nearly 12,410 customers, up from 11,500 in Q1. Of these customers, 760 were from Global 2,000 clients, which is an increase of 40 compared to 720 in Q1. Growing the middle market cohort will give NTNX a great opportunity to become the mainstream HCI name for companies of all sizes. In addition, NTNX experiences significant revenue growth from existing customers. Global 2,000 customers continue to have a strong and increasing traction, with total lifetime purchases increasing 11.0x compared to the initial purchase. As NTNX continues to penetrate both the enterprise and middle market customer base, they will be able to have better insight into their revenue, much of which is rather sticky.Source: Company PresentationManagement also provided some guidance for Q3, which includes revenue of $290-300 million, which was well below consensus estimates for ~$350 million. Management noted the lower guidance was largely due to lower than expected sales generation leads in the early part of the year, as well as slower than expected sales hiring. However, management appeared to remain confident that their current sales ramping problems have been internally addressed and the pipeline should continue to grow into Q4.Source: Company PresentationSoftware and support revenue is guided to grow in the high-teens compared to over 40% over the past several quarters. Management addressed this issue and noted the weaker than expected sales force and pipeline was largely attributed to the lower growth. Gross margins are expected to remain in the high-70s and I believe this will trend closer to 80% over the course of the year.Although Q3 guidance was weak, the stock was beaten down on Friday and likely reflects a multiple more in line for a company with mid-teens software revenue growth. At this point, I believe NTNX will surprise investors to the upside by building a stronger than expected pipeline through the remainder of the year, setting the company up well for a strong 2020 performance.The strong commitment to transitioning into a software-only company will help expand gross margins while maintaining strong top line growth. Over time, the company and investors will have greater insight into revenue streams, which will ultimately be recurring. Many software-only companies typically trade at premium revenue multiples compared to other technology companies specializing in software and hardware.Software and support revenue was ~$900 million in FY18, growing at a 47% rate. This demonstrates one of the fastest revenue growth rate in the market for a company at this scale. However, it appears software revenue will start to decelerate over the coming quarters, quicker than what investors had originally expected.Data by YChartsThe above peer group demonstrates software companies which have achieved superior revenue growth rates over the past few years. Included in this list is NTNX, which continues to be a leader in the HCI industry. Despite the weaker than expected guidance, NTNX deserves to be trading at a revenue multiple closer to the peer average. Although the above chart does not reflect updated revenue guidance, NTNX currently trades at nearly 4.5x 2020 revenue, well below the peer group.At this point, I believe there are two outcomes for the company. Either sales return to strong growth as hardware sales continue to phase out and software sales remain strong. This will naturally re-rate the stock higher and become more desiring of a higher multiple. If this does not happen, I believe NTNX could become an acquisition target for larger software company looking to accelerate their growth and become a leading player in the HCI industry. By pure speculation, a potential acquisition could come from the likes of IBM (IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), or another leading software player.I believe NTNX remains very undervalued given the company's transition to a software-only model and significant margin expansion. As the company completes this transition over the next 9-12 months, investors will begin to value NTNX as a software-only company, which typically comes with a higher revenue multiple premium.Risks to NTNX include a slower than expected transition to software-only sales, though it would have a slight benefit to revenue growth and would negatively impact gross margins. The emergence of more competitors would also hamper NTNX’s growth."
4211220,104099,2018-10-11T21:02:19-04:00,"Since I last wrote about the company, it has posted full year reviews and restated financial statements for 2017 and 2016.In my previous article, I recommended calls for people who insisted on staying long. The calls have done relatively well (i.e. less badly), demonstrating their power to reduce risk.I think the combination of expensive shares and poor financial performance will continue to harm shareholders. I recommend continuing to avoid the name.","Since I wrote my bearish piece on Nutanix (NTNX) a few months ago, the company has posted their latest 10-K and the shares are down about 28%. While that’s somewhat gratifying, I must now look in on the company again to see if it is reasonable to remain pessimistic about the name. After all, this company presents a very different risk-reward profile now that the shares have dropped so much. A terrible investment at $55 may be a great investment at $35, so I must review the name to see if marginal investors would be wise to buy. Also, since my article came out, the company has restated their financial numbers for 2017 and 2016 and I’ll comment on this change also. There’s nothing nefarious in this restatement. The company simply adopted the ASC 606 revenue recognition standard and this needs some comment.On August 1, 2017, the company changed its revenue recognition policies to align with the FASB rule generally referred to as ASC 606. This has resulted in no changes to the cash flow statement, but has caused the company to restate elements of the income statement and balance sheet for 2017 and 2016. Without getting too technical, this standard tries to present a more “principles based” approach, as opposed to the “rules based” approach that has traditionally been a part of GAAP accounting for years. There are several advantages to this approach. For instance, this change should allows for greater comparability between companies that report under GAAP and those that report under IFRS. In addition, a principles based approach is more flexible, allowing companies to account for revenue, assets etc. in a manner that is relevant to their industry. This flexibility is also a drawback, though, in that it allows for greater management discretion. Giving managers greater leeway in deciding what gets reported doesn’t always work in investors' favor.Relative to the previously stated financial statements, revenue, gross profit, and net loss are all changed significantly from the previously stated figures in 2017 and 2016. For instance, revenue has been restated 10.3% higher, in 2017 and 13.15% higher in 2016. Improvements were also seen in gross profit (up 18% in 2017, and up 21% in 2016) and net loss (reduced 17% in 2017, and 35% in 2016). Whether this change to a principles based approach is “good” or “bad” depends on your particular use of financial statements. I don’t believe the change is, on balance, a positive for small shareholders, but I see the benefits also.In some sense, though, the change to ASC 606 is irrelevant. In my view, the financial statements still reflect a company that continues to bleed red ink. Over the past six years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 83%, while the net loss is up at a CAGR of 37%. In fact, I ran a correlation analysis on revenue and net income over the past six years and found a very strong negative relationship between revenue and net income (r=-.87). This prompts the question “if growing sales at this rate doesn’t lead to profitability (or at least reduced losses), what will?”At the same time, investors have been massively diluted over the past six years. The share count is up at a CAGR of about 30% over the past six years.Source: Company filingsAs I’ve said many times, a high quality business can be a terrible investment if the investor pays too high a price for it. This gets to the idea that price paid for a stock is one of the, if not the most, important variables in determining the success of the enterprise. With that said, the valuation has improved massively, but it remains quite rich in my view.As an aside, one of the reasons I like looking at price to free cash flow is that free cash is not affected by accounting changes like ASC 606. At the moment, the best that can be said is that the shares are less expensive on a price to free cash flow basis than they were this time last year. That’s where the good news ends in my view. Investors are still paying more than 200 times free cash flow for their shares. In my view, this is massively expensive and must end in further losses for investors.Source: GurufocusIn my previous article about the stock, I recommended that investors who insisted on staying long, reduce their risk by switching to calls. I specifically recommended January calls with a strike of $60. At the time, these calls were sporting a bid-ask spread of $4.8-$5.30. At the moment, those calls sport a bid-ask spread of $.55 and $.70, so they have dropped in price by approximately 85%. The investors who purchased one call for every lot of shares have lost about ~$4.70 per call. That’s terrible, but it reminds us of the benefit of calls over stock ownership, since share owners have lost about 3.5 times as much. I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Call ownership can be a far less risky way to “play” certain companies at certain prices.I’ve looked at a strategy of using calls as a means to gain access to any share bounce from here and unfortunately I haven’t found any. The problem is that as the shares drop in price, calls remain relatively expensive on a percentage of price basis. In other words, the most reasonable calls are priced at about 20% of the price of the shares themselves. In my view, that is too high a premium, and thus it makes little sense to use calls as a proxy for share ownership at these levels.The shares have dropped just under 30% in just under 3 months and that dramatic price move put the company back on my radar. A company priced at $39 is definitionally less risky than one that was priced at $55 when I first wrote about the business. While $39 is a less bad price, and the people who buy at $39 will suffer less than the people who bought at $55, the shares are still currently overpriced. Even with the change in accounting rules, revenue growth and net income have been strongly negatively correlated for years. This prompts the obvious question about what will happen to turn this relationship around. Additionally, the market remains very optimistic about these shares, bidding them at over 200 times free cash flow. For all of these reasons, I must recommend that investors continue to avoid this name."
4213204,103711,2018-10-23T07:30:12-04:00,Technology stocks have sold off harder than the rest of the market.NTNX is now trading at low valuations despite very strong growth run rates.NTNX benefits from the increased development of the cloud because it essentially is the operating system of datacenters.NTNX is a strong buy and potential double over the next year.,"Nutanix (NTNX) is a fast growing tech name which somehow finds itself trading at just over 7 times my definition of core sales. NTNX is basically the operating system of data centers. Shares are a strong buy amidst the market volatility as this is a growth train which is just getting started.This has been a volatile market. I believe that we are witnessing a market crash but in waves: instead of the entire market falling at once, certain sectors are falling one at a time.Right now, it looks like that sector is technology. We can see that NTNX has fallen hard from its highs:It is very often that only after such dramatic drops like this do certain companies get on my radar. However, even at its highs, I found that NTNX still was arguably undervalued. This is a best of breed business which has just started its huge growth runway. This chance to buy NTNX at such a depressed valuation is nothing other than a gift - let’s now look at the fundamentals of their business.NTNX, as they state in their 2017 10-K, is focused on “breaking down artificial walls in IT departments.” More specifically, NTNX is in the business of the “software defined data center,” which I like to think about as operating systems for data centers - think cloud.To explain their business proposition simply, we need to first understand that “cloud” is an umbrella for many different kinds of cloud. The public cloud is the most recognizable, such as those provided by Amazon’s AWS (AMZN), which is scalable due to being able to simply purchase more service from your provider. There is also the private cloud, which is more secure:(Nutanix Beam Talk)Companies usually have a mix of several cloud platforms which creates a problem: how do you allow all platforms to coexist? NTNX is the magic that glues everything together. We can see below one of their products called “Beam” allows customers to manage cost and compliance across all their cloud platforms:(Nutanix Beam Talk)This is incredibly useful: for example, Beam can tell customers if they are underutilizing one cloud platform and overutilizing another. NTNX plays a very important part in acting like a data center’s (or several) operating system and plays an increasingly important role as data usage needs continues its inevitable trend higher.As can be expected by a top tier company in a top tier industry, NTNX is seeing rapidly growing financial results. First let’s see evidence of their best of breed product and service.As we can see below, NTNX customers tend to start with a small purchase before realizing that they need much more:(FY2018 Q4 Nutanix Presentation)For global 2000 customers, we can see the average lifetime purchase multiples below:(FY2018 Q4 Presentation)NTNX uses this “pay as you grow” selling strategy in order to get customers to try out their superior products, then gradually increase the scale of cooperation later. These charts are highly indicative of value-add that NTNX brings to their customers.NTNX has been quickly decreasing their exposure to “pass-thru hardware” revenues and focusing on their software as a service (‘SAAS’) revenues:(FY2018 Q4 Presentation)This is a good thing because SAAS revenues are more recurring with higher margins.Their software and support revenue is growing at eye opening 40-50% run rates:(FY2018 Q4 Presentation)As NTNX moves towards dropping their hardware revenues, gross margins have continued to increase towards a Sky-high 70%:(FY2018 Q4 Presentation)Perhaps the main knock is that NTNX is not yet profitable. They did see their net loss for the past 12 months drop from $379.6 million to $297.2 million.Deferred revenue also continues to grow:(FY2018 Q4 Presentation)For those who do not know what deferred revenues are, let’s first discuss the difference between “revenues” and “billings.” When NTNX sells new products to customers, they receive billings. However, they only record revenues when they provide the service to the customer. The difference between billings and revenues is called deferred revenues and is carried on the balance sheet as a liability until the service is provided. This is one case where liabilities are not always bad as a larger deferred revenues balance (larger liability balance) is representative of future revenues.NTNX is clearly firing on all cylinders and I expect this to continue moving forward due to their strong execution and focus on customer satisfaction.NTNX has a healthy balance sheet with over $930 million in cash and short term investments. With no long term debt, some may feel it prudent to consider this “net cash” or deductible from their market cap in determining valuation. I however feel that we cannot just simply deduct this cash because they are still not producing positive free cash flow and may still need to fall back on this cash if they cannot issue shares to fund their growth. That said, they nonetheless have a strong balance sheet and there’s no red flags here.NTNX is projecting the next quarter to have 176 million shares outstanding, so they currently trade at a market cap of around $6.8 billion. Total revenue for the past twelve months is $1.2 billion, which grew 37% over the previous year. Subtracting our hardware revenue, however, and the remaining software and support revenue totals $898 million and grew 47% over the previous year. NTNX is projecting the next quarter to see software and support revenues to grow 40-45% YOY. Basically what we have here is a high-flying software company selling at 7.6 times “core revenues” (my term for their SAAS business). I argue this is very cheap, but some readers might be wondering - should we be concerned about the lack of profits? How can a stock without profits be argued to be cheap?In order to answer this question, we need to consider the profitability of other more mature software names. Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOG) both have very high gross and operating margins as we see below:We can see their price to sales valuations below:I believe that it is only a matter of time before the high revenue growth at NTNX allows it to break through in terms of profitability and achieve high operating margins to go alongside its already high gross margins. Due to their higher operating margins, FB tends to trade at a higher price to sales than GOOG. I don’t think NTNX will be able to achieve the same kind of operating margins as FB but the 25% margins at GOOG look reasonable, especially considering NTNX has higher gross margins at 70% and rising.If we use the roughly 6 times price to sales of GOOG as a benchmark (and for the record, I consider GOOG to be undervalued), then NTNX begins to look very undervalued considering they are still growing sales above 40% annually.My 12 month price target for NTNX is $80 per share, or roughly 15 times their core sales. This multiple would shrink to 9 times sales next year if NTNX really can keep growing at a 40% run rate. This price target may actually be still conservative given the high level of growth we are seeing here.As we can see below, NTNX insiders own a significant portion of shares outstanding:(2017 NTNX Proxy)In particular, co-founder and CEO Dheeraj Pandey owns over 22% of Class B shares, good for 6.6% of total shares outstanding (based on 176 million shares outstanding). All directors and executives cumulatively own approximately 16.8% of shares outstanding. Companies which are run by so called “owner-operators” tend to perform better because management is even more incentivized to create shareholder value as they are significant shareholders. I should point out to current NTNX shareholders that this also means that one shouldn’t give too much weight to insiders like CEO Pandey selling stock as this would be very justified diversification measures for his own portfolio.NTNX is operating in an industry which benefits from the cloud movement by reducing the barriers that all the different cloud platforms present. With shares trading at less than 8 times sales, shares are a strong buy with about 100% upside.If you liked this article, please scroll up and click ""Follow"" next to my name to not miss any of my future articles.

4225372,103480,2018-11-29T09:35:04-05:00,"Shares of Nutanix rallied sharply after announcing strong Q1 results.Though revenue growth slowed down to 14% y/y due to the company's elimination of pass-through hardware, this revenue is now of much higher-quality.The subscription mix within Nutanix's billings has now hit 51%, up from 31% in the prior-year quarter.Given the removal of hardware, Nutanix's gross margins and profitability have also shot up tremendously.","At one point during the October crunch, hyperconverged infrastructure vendor Nutanix (NTNX) traded at just half of its all-time highs. Nutanix has long been one of the poster children of the growth technology sector, with shares rising sharply this year after Nutanix announced its decision to pivot into a software-only business model. That strength continued this quarter, as Nutanix announced its strongest-ever subscription billings mix. The company's transition to a subscription revenue base has prompted investors to value its revenue streams more akin to a SaaS company.Like most richly valued growth stocks, Nutanix shares fell sharply in October and November. However, the stock's post-Q1 rally looks like the perfect catalyst for an early 2019 rebound. Nutanix is still 33% below all-time highs, and in my view, investors should hold on for the rebound:NTNX data by YChartsThere's no doubt that the Nutanix of today is a much stronger company than it was last year. Having eliminated hardware revenues and leaned more into recurring customers, Nutanix has eliminated the lumpiness of prior-quarter results. It has also elevated itself above what many consider to be a commoditized storage sector. Nutanix's products now provide a value-added service across an array of different workloads (the mix of Nutanix workloads as of the end of Q1 is shown in this infographic below):Figure 1. Nutanix workload mixSource: Nutanix info sheetCompanies like VMware (VMW) and Dell (DVMT) are still struggling to catch up to Nutanix, which has consistently been named a Leader by Gartner in the HCI industry. It's worth noting as well that Nutanix has gained more of a reputation as a serious, best-in-breed vendor. Nutanix customers have always been able to choose among different hypervisors when deploying virtualization solutions, (VMware remains the king of this space, and its hypervisors are typically the most popular). Over time, however, the popularity of Nutanix's built-in Acropolis hypervisor has dramatically risen, as shown in the chart below:Figure 2. Nutanix Acropolis install mixSource: Nutanix Q1 earnings deckIn my view, Nutanix is well-positioned to become the pre-eminent hybrid cloud vendor that helps enterprises manage workloads and infrastructures that have to reside across both cloud and on-prem servers. Let's dive into Nutanix's strong first-quarter results. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 3. Nutanix 1Q19 resultsSource: Nutanix Q1 earnings releaseRevenues grew 14% y/y to $313.3 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $305.2 million (+11% y/y) by a comfortable three-point margin. At face value, this growth rate appears weak - wasn't Nutanix growing in the 40-50% range previously? We have to recall, however, that Nutanix has carved out the hardware portion of its total revenues. The chart below gives an excellent visual representation of its billings and revenue mix and the intentional shrinking of hardware revenues:Figure 4. Nutanix top-line mixSource: Nutanix Q1 earnings deckAs such, investors should focus on the 44% y/y growth in software and support revenues to $281 million. Nutanix also closed out Q1 with 11,490 customers, up 47% y/y and representing a net addition of 880 customers over the end of Q4. The company's customer base has also gradually started shifting into larger and larger deals, signaling its acceptance by blue-chip firms: the company closed 100 deals larger than $500k in the quarter, up 47% y/y. It's worth noting as well that since eliminating pass-through hardware revenues, Nutanix has also tilted more heavily into subscriptions. The company's subscription Billings imx hit 51% this quarter, up twenty points from 31% in the year-ago period, and it hopes to achieve a 70-75% mix by the first half of FY20. Nutanix's shift into a software-only business isn't just about growth: this transition has a hugely beneficial impact on margins as well. As seen in the chart below, gross margins rose to 79% this quarter, up sharply from 62% in the year-ago quarter:Figure 5. Nutanix gross margin trendsSource: Nutanix Q1 earnings deckIt's worth noting that a high-70s gross margin gives Nutanix the same or better unit economics compared to most SaaS companies. The only gap left for Nutanix to achieve a SaaS-like valuation (at present, Nutanix trades at under 5x forward revenues, which would typically be considered cheap for a company growing software revenues at ~40% y/y) is for Nutanix to achieve a higher mix of recurring and subscription revenues. NTNX EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsOperating cash flows also jumped to $50 million in the Q1, quintupling over $10 million in 1Q18 and achieving a record 16% OCF margin (up twelve points from a 4% margin in 1Q18). Nutanix's pro forma EPS of -$0.13 in the quarter also resoundingly beat Wall Street's consensus of -$0.27. Investors would be wise to continue loading up on Nutanix shares and awaiting the stock's full rebound to the $50-$60 level. Q1 gave us a clear indicator of where Nutanix is heading. The company is becoming a value-added software powerhouse, which has consistently been able to bring in larger customers and sign them up for recurring deals. Along the way, its improved margin profile has also allowed Nutanix to achieve tremendous cash flow growth and achieve a so-called ""Rule of 40"" score of 54.The biggest challenge for Nutanix is to maintain this narrative into FY19. The primary risk to investors is if Wall Street catches any whiff of a slowdown in Nutanix's software growth story. In order for the stock to keep rallying, the company must be able to continue showing improved subscription billings mixes and strong revenue retention rates. Given recent trends, however, these concerns are minor. In my view, Nutanix has reached an inflection point that will allow it to become a next-generation VMware (VMW). Relative to its market potential, Nutanix's current ~$7 billion market cap is still a diminutive size. While Nutanix stock will likely continue trading in a volatile pattern in the near term, its eventual direction is up."

Here is the SHU portfolio in terms of chronological order of purchases as on September 4, 2018:The reasons for this stellar performance are surprisingly simple:We always like to start with a five-year overview of some important metrics:NTNX Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsYou see that the revenue growth (despite giving up most of the hardware sales, which were 25%+ of revenues less than a year ago) is quite impressive, and operational improvements have started to come in more recently.Much of that is a result of the decline of hardware sales (from $81 million in Q1 to $36 million in Q4), which hardly generated any margins. With respect to this, revenue growth has been impressive despite the loss of hardware sales. From the earnings deck:Hardware sales were still 12% of revenue in Q4 (down from 29% in Q4 2027), but this will fall to 5% next year:Can they keep the growth up? There are a number of growth drivers:There is no doubt about the market tailwinds in HCI (hyper-converged infrastructure), growing at a CAGR of 42% between 2016 and 2023. There are simply too many advantages attached to HCI in terms of saving resources, scalability and ease of use.The company has a very solid position within the sector. In fact, it has a deal with what is its greatest competitor, Dell (DVMT)/VMware (NYSE:VMW), selling Nutanix software on Dell servers since 2014. Nutanix has a number of advantages, like:These give the software a flexibility that is difficult to match for the competition.There is rather unabated growth here:In the top left-hand side graph, you see that in a four-year period, the company has more than ten-folded its customer base. Growth here isn't likely to change anytime soon.The company is not only landing new (and ever bigger) customers that keep revenues growing, it's also selling them ever more services in the familiar land and expand strategy. And this is working:Of course, to keep the motor of ""land and expand"" running, Nutanix needs to come up with new stuff to sell. But that's exactly what it's doing - the company spends nearly 30% of revenues on R&D (and embarks on the odd acquisition) to keep a steady stream of new products like:We'd better leave the description of these products (and others) to the company (here). While the company's core system is hypervisor-agnostic, the sale of its own hypervisor is also progressing nicely:Then, there is the upcoming Xi platform, which is going beyond its normal turf and taking on public cloud companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).This project ran into some engineering complexities, and its scheduled release later this year might slip. From Bloomberg:But if Nutanix is successful (where companies like HP failed), it could materially increase its TAM, so this is a development that investors will follow with considerable interest. And CEO Pandey doesn't exactly lack ambition, nor confidence. From Bloomberg (our emphasis):With the liberation from hardware (""portable software""), and also as a result of the upcoming introduction of the Xi cloud platform, the company is gradually moving to a SaaS business model. From the Q4CC:This would improve the visibility of revenues and earnings.The headline figures are understating growth:On the latter:Deferred revenue (+71% y/y) outgrew revenue growth (+20.3% y/y) by a wide margin, even if we factor out the decline in hardware sales. If we take software and support revenue, it grew by 49% y/y.The difference between the two is in large part the decline in hardware sales, so you should not get scared about any headline slowdown in revenue growth.The shedding of the (essentially zero-margin) hardware business has had a pretty dramatic impact on gross margins, which have improved from 62% in Q1 to 78% in Q4, and are probably set to increase a little more in fiscal year 2019.Below, one can also see a steady improvement in operating margins and operating cash flow.While this stuff will continue to vary quarter to quarter as it has done in the past, the trend is clearly up.The company is still making losses, especially on a GAAP basis, but this isn't much of a problem as long as it keeps on investing in the future (and getting a return on that) and is not bleeding cash.And with nearly 80% in gross margin, there is a lot of potential profitability should Nutanix start to scale back some of these investments, most notably in R&D:NTNX R&D to Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsNTNX EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsSince there are no earnings yet, or much EBITDA to speak of, valuation has to be based on a sales multiple. We don't know about you, but we were pleasantly surprised when we pulled the above figure up.We knew when we bought Nutanix for the SHU portfolio last year that the shares were remarkably cheap - exactly how cheap you can see in the graph above. However, we assumed the stock price increase and the change in perception of Nutanix as a software company would have taken care of that. It did, but not really to the extent we feared - a pleasant surprise.We even think that there is room for multiple expansion if market sentiment in general and technology stocks in particular remain favorable.We see numerous reasons to still be bullish on Nutanix:There are risks that the company's Xi platform might disappoint, new competition might emerge with better solutions, market sentiment (or that of the technology sector) might shift... the usual stuff.But we have no reason to see this as anything other than a long-term winner, and we're staying with our position in the SHU portfolio, even if that's now quite substantial given the 150% rise since purchasing these shares last year."

Earlier this week, news broke out the Google would look to join the HCI market, competing directly against NTNX. However, despite much speculation and NTNX share taking a 10%+ hit, Google denied these reports. NTNX share recovered a bit on Tuesday, but there still remains a lot of upside to the company who reported a very strong Q4 earnings report and F19 guide.NTNX data by YChartsDespite closing this past Friday at $52.50, NTNX traded down to $46.43 on Monday, falling nearly 12% on reports that Google was looking to join the HCI market. On Tuesday, Google adamantly denied these reports, yet NTNX closed Tuesday at $49.65, still down over 5% from Friday's close. On top of another very strong earnings reports, NTNX continues to the scale the ranks as not only the leading HCI player, but a leader among all software companies. Their valuation still reflects some soon-to-be-legacy hardware sales, whereas I believe their price should be determined solely on future software-only revenue.On Monday, rumors of Google joining the HCI market swirled around, causing quite the stir for NTNX's stock. NTNX ended up trading down 11.5% for the day, putting their share down ~30% for the year at the time. However, on Tuesday, Google denied the reports of them building customized appliances, which would have in theory competed with NTNX. The rumors on Monday indicated that Google would build out custom computers that combine server, storage, and networking, thus, directly competing with NTNX's HCI platform.On Tuesday, Google denied these reports, noting ""We can confirm that we are not building customized appliances for external sale…we value our partnerships highly and can also confirm that we are not competing with our partners in this area"". After Google released this statement, NTNX shares rebounded and traded up over 8% for the day, recovering to $49.65 at market close.However, NTNX shares are still down 5% from Friday's $52.50 closing price, thus, representing a ""free"" ~6% upside (this assumes NTNX had traded flat since Friday due to no negative news). Combined with another very strong earnings report, NTNX is poised to continue their dominance in the HCI market.NTNX grew their software and support Billings by 66% in Q4, which was a slight deceleration from 67% growth in Q3. However, investors should expect this slight deceleration to occur due to the law of large numbers. NTNX now has software and support billings of $1+ billion.Total software and support revenue increased 49% in Q4, bringing the total software and support revenue growth to 47% for F18. Software revenue reached ~$900 million for F18 with grow still near 50%. NTNX remains one of the fastest growing software companies in the tech world, however, their current revenue multiple does not show this. Management's commitment to their software-only approach will cause increased investments in order to continue to grow their market share.Rather than focusing on profitability, management talks about their placement in the Rule of 40, that is revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin. Companies who grow their revenues at this high of a rate will inevitably decelerate their growth rate as they strive to become profitable. The Rule of 40 suggests that as a company matures and begins to focus on profitability, the summation of revenue growth and free cash flow margin above 40 signifies a strong company. NTNX reported a Rule of 40 value of 51 for the year, placing them at the high end of the software company spectrum.Source: Company PresentationAs NTNX transitions to a software-only company and gets rid of their legacy hardware revenue, gross margins should actually increase as this transition occurs. Currently, gross margin is 78%, which is still a very powerful margin. Over time, this margin should continue to expand, and I believe this will reach 80%+ during F19.Though NTNX will continue to deconstruct their lower margin, slower growth hardware business, there is one caveat to this which was slightly seen this past quarter. The quicker NTNX gets rid of their hardware revenue, their revenue growth will appear slower (because there is less additional revenue coming from their legacy pass-through hardware sales). The faster transition would cause revenue growth to be slower than expected, but gross margins should come in higher than expected, because the lower margin hardware revenue is no longer there.Billings remains a great proxy for NTNX's transition to software-only revenue. The more software billings the company generates, the more future revenue will come from software sales. The below chart is a great depiction of the company's transformation over the years and as you can see, F19 shows a very low percentage of billings coming from hardware sales. In essence, by the end of F19, the company will have minimal hardware sales left to get rid of. Because of this transition and management's strong commitment, I firmly believe NTNX should be valued as a software-only company.Source: Company PresentationMore recently, NTNX announced their largest ever deal, a $20+ million deal with the Department of Defense. This is a significant step for NTNX as they continue to drive their leadership position in the enterprise market. For Q4, this deal was one of five worth more than $1 million in the U.S. Federal vertical, and one of 46 worth more than $1 million overall. These larger deals indicate increasing momentum among larger customers as they gain more confidence in NTNX's software-only approach.Management has strongly committed to their transition to software-only revenue and with the impressive combination of top line growth and gross margins, NTNX deserves to be traded as a software-only company with a premium multiple. However, NTNX continues to trade at a slight discount to their software-only peers, even after backing out current hardware revenue.Software and support revenue was ~$900 million in F18, growing at 47%. This demonstrates one of the fastest revenue growth rates in the market for a company at this scale. For Q1, management expects another strong quarter of revenue growth with total revenue between $295-310 million, which implies software and support revenue growth of 40-45% y/y. In addition, management expects 94-95% of total billings to come from software, a slight increase compared to Q3's guidance.In order to properly value NTNX, I looked at a variety of fast-growth software companies who trade at premium revenue multiples compared to the greater market. The list of peers include: New Relic (NEWR), ServiceNow (NOW), Okta (OKTA), Proofpoint (PFPT), Red Hat (RHT), Splunk (SPLK), Atlassian (TEAM), and Workday (WDAY). All of the peers are considered leaders in their respective industries, hosting both strong revenue growth rates and consistently high gross margins.NTNX EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsTo be conservative regarding NTNX, I used F18's software and support revenue of ~$900 million and assumed a rather significant deceleration (given management's Q1 guidance for 40-45% growth) of 35%. This results in a conservative software revenue of $1.215 billion for F19.With a current market cap of $8.47 billion and net cash of ~$500 million, this gives NTNX an enterprise value of $7.97 billion. Using my conservative $1.215 billion software only revenue in F19, NTNX currently trades at a 6.5x conservative forward revenue multiple. This compares to the peer group average of 12.1x. However, the majority of the peer group trades within the 7-11x range, so for another conservative point, I will discount the peer group average.Assuming NTNX trades at a discounted peer group average multiple of 11.0x, this would imply an enterprise value of ~$13.4 billion. Backing out net cash of ~$500 million, this would also imply a market cap of ~$13.9 billion. With 171.2 million shares outstanding, this would imply a target price of $81 representing a 63% upside from Tuesday's closing price of $49.65. I will admit, this is an aggressive approach given NTNX's revenue multiple is several turns below the discounted peer group average.Another way to look at valuation is to assume NTNX's software revenues grow by 40%, which would still imply a 7 percentage point deceleration and would be at the low end of management's guidance for Q1 (which has historically been a seasonally slower quarter). At a 40% software revenue growth, this gives us F19 software revenue of $1.26 billion, representing a 7.2x forward revenue multiple.Assuming this multiple slightly expands to 8.0x over the next 12 months, this would give us a target price of $62, representing a 25% upside from Tuesday's closing price of $49.65.Risks to NTNX include a slower than expected transition to software-only sales, though would have a slight benefit to revenue growth, and would negatively impact gross margins. The emergence of more competitors would also hamper NTNX's growth."
4203757,25120,2018-09-03T10:18:29-04:00,"Nutanix continues to grow very rapidly, having become a billion dollar business within a decade since being founded.Strong growth is very impressive, although losses remain quite steep.Forward billing multiples are not unreasonable, yet lack of operational leverage or slower growth creates too much of a risk to buy at these levels.That does not automatically make shares a short as growth has been strong for a long time, the future is bright, and M&A potential remains there.","Nutanix (NTNX) has been an IPO high-flier which attracted my interest this time two years ago when the company went public, as I concluded that investors were aggressively pricing in revenue growth rates, making the risk-reward no longer compelling in my view. That caution has proven a bit too conservative, mostly as the company kept up its very impressive growth rates in the two years to follow.That does not mean that progress has been moving forward equally. After going public at $16 in 2016, shares quickly doubled only to fall to the IPO price again by spring of 2017. Shares doubled again that summer, and ever since have doubled again.My previous caution has proven to be too conservative as the market and the technology sector at large have seen continued momentum. In fact, shares have doubled again to levels at $60 recently.Nutanix provides an enterprise cloud platform, which converges silos of servers and storage into an interaction solution, accessible to public cloud services. This is the so-called hyper-converged infrastructure model, which is rapidly adopted by organisations these days.The benefits of the solution are that of agility, mobility and security, in essence, the best of multiple worlds regarding costs, flexibility, and accessibility from any device.Since its founding in 2008, Nutanix has delivered on solid revenue growth although this was accompanied by losses on the bottom line. The company was valued at $2 billion (in a private round) in 2014, as an initial plan to go public in 2015 failed but succeeded a year later. At the $16 offer price, the enterprise valuation came in at close to $2 billion at the time.The company has grown rapidly in recent years. Sales hit $241 million in 2015 and were up 84% in 2016 to $445 million. Operating losses narrowed in relative terms from 49% of sales to 37% of sales in 2016. Revenues grew by 72% in the fiscal year of 2017 (as reported in August of 2017), with billings being up 55% to $990 million. In part because of elevated stock-based compensation, operating losses rose to 55% of sales again as the company reported a very steep operating loss of $427 million.That did not seem to worry investors too much. A change in the revenue recognition (that of elimination pass-through hardware sales) means that revenues of $1.16 billion marked 36% growth on an annual basis (as reported) while operating losses narrowed from $348 million to $280 million.With $230 million of that operating loss being the result of stock-based compensation, the company is close to breaking even on a cash flow basis, yet this practice is very dilutive for investors nonetheless.With the share count having surpassed 171 million shares by the end of the fiscal year of 2018, those shares were awarded a $9.6 billion valuation at $56 per share, or about $9.3 billion on an enterprise valuation if we account for $350 million in net cash being held.The reason for the growing enterprise valuation is the continued solid growth being reported, and finally, some progress was made in reducing GAAP (relative) losses, as multiples remain somewhat elevated. Working with a $9.3 billion enterprise valuation and a $1.16 billion annual sales number, shares go for 8.0 times sales.As the company guided for 50-55% growth in first quarter billings, those billings are seen at $380 million, plus or minus $10 million, running at a rate of $1.5 billion already. This reduces the annualised billing multiple to 6.2 times annual billings.Worrying enough is that the company sees (adjusted) losses at around $0.27 per share for the quarter, working out to roughly $50 million for the quarter. With stock-based compensation running at approximately $200 million per annum, the company is still losing about $400 million on a GAAP basis at the moment.Having grown to become a +$1 billion company within a decade is an impressive outcome as this achievement should not be underestimated. Hence, one can argue that a 6.2 times forward billings multiple looks rather compelling, that is if current 50% growth rates can be maintained and operating leverage will become visible on the bottom line in the coming years.If you doubt this vision, strong growth makes it a dangerous short at the same time as well. This is despite the fact that current losses are rather steep, running at a rate of $400 million a year, or about $2.00-2.50 per share.What is clear is that the market is growing rapidly, and the solutions of Nutanix are clearly in demand, with the company still growing at a very impressive growth rate. One can question if the losses ""subsidise"" the sales growth, but in all honesty, I have to give Nutanix the benefit of the doubt as its solutions have real traction among customers.Furthermore, the sales multiples, especially in relation to still >50% billing growth, actually look very reasonable in comparison to multiples at which other players trade. It must be said that more established payers like VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Red Hat (RHT) are firmly profitable, making the comparisons a bit more complicated.VMware is valued at close to $54 billion on an enterprise basis, valued at around 6.5 times sales, which is in line with Nutanix. Sales growth in the low double digits is much less impressive, yet it is able to post operating margins (GAAP) as high as 23%. Red Hat is valued at around $26 billion, which is equivalent to 8.0 times annualised sales. These sales grow at a very solid pace of around 20% as GAAP operating margins in the mid-teens look very strong as well.Given the multiples at which Nutanix trades, as seen above, shares remain a dangerous short. This is not just given the quick growth, as M&A action in the sector at large remains among the possibilities as well. On the long side, I see no compelling margin of safety as the billing multiple seems reasonable in relation to growth, yet reality is that the company continues to bleed money as an unexpected growth slowdown could hit the valuation multiple attached to these billings in a big way."
4207811,104556,2018-09-24T04:50:15-04:00,"Nutanix stock has seen a big pullback over the past couple weeks due to concerns about competition.Because the company is difficult to understand, the valuation looks pretty reasonable.The underlying business is firing, and software billings growth is incredibly strong.","Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), provider of hybrid cloud infrastructure, has seen its stock pull back over 25% for a few immaterial reasons. The underlying business is still performing well, but the market’s fears about competition are unwarranted.Whenever I catch myself finger-pointing at the market’s inability to see what I see, I try stop and think for a moment. The market is not stupid. There is wisdom in crowds. But from time to time, the pendulum swings a little too far in one direction. In other words, the market may be directionally right but wrong in magnitude.Other times, the market is not even so much as directionally right. Of course, this happens less often, but I believe that is the case here with Nutanix.To be fair, Nutanix is difficult to understand. For instance, this is the first sentence from the company's 10-K:Most people might respond, “So what you’re saying is the company does computer stuff?”Don’t even get me started on hypervisors, multi-cloud governance, and hyperconverged disaster recovery.And to layer on top of this, Nutanix has been transitioning to a software-only model rather than bundling in zero-margin hardware. After a full year, it has eliminated a vast majority of what management calls “pass-thru hardware” but it warps the numbers. The company looks like it did 21% revenue growth in the last quarter, which would leave investors wondering what all the hype is about.But that's the just the tip of the iceberg...Earlier in the week, Nutanix stock took an 11% dive on rumors that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was getting into hyperconverged technology. At first glance this seems like big news - one of the biggest, strongest companies in the world entering a subsector where Nutanix made its name.But think about it. One of the big reasons why Nutanix has been successful is because it is cloud agnostic. There is no chance of enterprises being locked in to a particular public cloud. From Google’s point of view, why would it get out of its circle of competence to battle Nutanix, one of its partners? That’s right - over a year ago, Nutanix formed a partnership with the Google Cloud to provide some its newer products through a public cloud channel.These partnerships are not out of the ordinary, as Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS struck up a deal with VMware (NYSE:VMW) not too long ago. The fact of the matter is that these public cloud titans need partnerships with hyperconverged players, as they provide the crucial link between on-premise and cloud. It just wouldn’t make much sense for Google to backtrack and get into HCI (hyperconverged infrastructure). Fortunately, a few days ago, Google issued a statement denying any claims to enter this space. But it just goes to show that investors don’t fully understand the dynamics at play here.What’s more is the market’s concern over the competitive landscape. There is one chart, specifically, that I think investors are worried about.(Source: SDX Central)As you can see, it looks like Dell (DVMT), which is teamed up with VMware, is blowing Nutanix away. However, I don’t think this tells the whole story.First of all, this market share calculation includes hardware. When looking at software only, Nutanix comes in a close second to VMware at 33% and 37% respectively. It is beyond me to comment on every detail of calculating market share between Nutanix and competitors, and I don’t believe it is rather material to the investment thesis.Why, you might ask? Well, because it is a clear duopoly. It’s between Dell-VMware and Nutanix. No one else is close. And it looks like Dell is doing incredibly well because it has such a huge customer base to sell into. After those customers stop upgrading to HCI, it will be interesting to see if the company can land new clients.(Source: Gartner)When asked about VMware as a competitor on last quarter’s earnings call, Nutanix’s CEO Dheeraj Pandey said the biggest difference between the companies was that VMware is obsessively competitor-focused, whereas Nutanix is obsessively customer-focused. I’ll put my money on the latter ideology every day of the week.The market’s reaction to Nutanix’s last quarter was rather muted. But I think it goes back to how difficult it is to understand the company holistically.Revenue grew 21%, looking like a massive deceleration from 57% a year ago. Adding back the $95 million in eliminated “pass-thru” hardware, revenue stayed just as strong though, growing 58%.The big surprise was just how much gross margins expanded. Management guided for 73.5% gross margins, but they came in at 78%.Moreover, software and support billings were very strong, growing 66% to $359 million. Just as impressively, deferred revenue shot up 71% and accelerated sequentially on a year-over-year basis. This is a result of the bigger deals the company is booking. On the conference call, management noted a $20 million deal with the Department of Defense.This also helped the company become free cash flow positive in a fourth quarter for the first time since going public.Furthermore, it seems like Nutanix is not having a problem gaining customers. In 2018 alone, it added 3,600. That comes out to 51% year-over-year customer growth, since the latest count is over 10,600. To my eye, the company is firing on all cylinders. It just takes a little energy to dig.Certainly, investing in Nutanix requires taking some risk. A strong competitor in VMware cannot be ignored. However, a clear duopoly limits the possibility of both companies vying for market share so rigorously that a third company swoops in and steals the crown. Of course it’s possible, but in the meantime, a duopoly is healthy to keep both companies on their toes, innovating furiously.Nutanix has also not shown much in the way of operating leverage. With a 15% increase in gross margins, one might assume a little more dropping to the bottom line than a 1% increase. However, we have to take the revenue slowdown into account as well. Free cash flow swung positive, which is more important at this stage for the company.Another risk is Nutanix’s playbook from here on out. For example, here is a list of all its new products: Xi, Calm, Epoch, Era, Files, Sherlock, Flow, Beam, Frame... and I've probably missed a few. It is nothing short of ambitious. You might be thinking, “And how is that a problem?” Well, it’s not yet, but it could be. If the company is pulled in too many directions, its brand may not resonate with customers or it might not be able to finish all of its innovative ideas.Not too long ago, I would have added the steep valuation as a risk factor. But now I think it is rather reasonable. Using 10% revenue growth, management’s most conservative estimate, for twelve months from now, we get just under $1.3 billion in sales. Seeing as the market cap is $8 billion today and Nutanix holds about $930 in cash, the enterprise value comes out to about $7.07 billion. This leaves the EV/FTM ratio at about 5.4x. For a company that is growing software billings at a rate of almost 70%, this is a pretty fair valuation.Nutanix is a company that is difficult to understand. Concerns over fierce competition are overblown, and its business is firing on all cylinders. Buy it while you can at these prices. Hopefully, the market will catch on soon.Author’s Note: Please scroll up and hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button so you can get these articles before they hit the paywall.

4204010,98236,2018-09-04T17:02:24-04:00,"Nutanix reported the results of its fiscal Q4 last Thursday after the market closed.Q4 results were a beat on reported revenues, a significant beat on EPS, and a very significant beat on bookings.Q1 guidance was said to be disappointing and indeed the headlines looked like a guide-down. Looking a bit further suggests that the company was guiding up and by a noticeable amount.The company is increasing the percentage of its bookings that it classifies as deferred revenue. It has also eliminated almost all pass-through hardware revenues a bit earlier than expected.The company announced a flock of new products in May and its Xi platform will yield a crucial growth component for the company by the end of the year.","One of the worst headlines an investor in hyper-growth tech can read is that one of his/her holdings has reduced guidance and is gapping down. What could possibly have induced corporate management to conclude that the environment had worsened? Or has the company encountered a sales execution issue or is the guide-down a sandbag? But I am inclined to imagine, that even worse for many holders of Nutanix (NTNX) shares might be the realization that the so-called headline of ""guide-down"" really is exactly wrong - and, in fact, the company was using its guidance to represent the strength of its business and Friday's share price action was based on a mistaken premise. In fact, that is the case as I will explore in the balance of this article. Nutanix reported a blow-out quarter and raised its growth metric noticeably above the prior consensus. It does take a bit of digging and interpretation to find the details, but really not all that much.Nutanix shares reacted sharply to a headline that while technically correct, was actually precisely inaccurate. Overall, the shares were down more than 7% on Friday, although the shares were up by more than 15% for the month of August compared to a net change during the month of 8% for the IGV.Looking at year-to-date performance, Nutanix shares are up by 62% when compared to the increase in the IGV of 28%. I think that it is this gap in year to date performance between Nutanix and the IGV that has and will likely continue to influence share price performance, even when news items, objectively considered are positive.There are doubtless some readers who believe that Nutanix shares are overvalued or excessively risky. In my opinion, Nutanix shares are an outlier in terms of valuation because they are quite cheap. In fact, the number of software companies that have growth rates of greater than 50%, revenues of more than $1 billion, and 80% or higher gross margins are not going to cost any reader much, if anything at all, in the way of fingers or toes. And if there are many software vendors that have such a rich and varied product portfolio, at the scale of this company, they do not leap readily to mind.I own Nutanix shares and have done so for a considerable time period - indeed most of the very short life of this company as a public vendor. And I did choose to bulk up on my holdings Friday. I think when investors are given the chance to buy a position in a company whose growth acceleration is palpable at a discount, then it is an opportunity not to be ignored. Nutanix is a category leader in hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) and that remains its heartland and the source of many of its new customers. But the company has already broadened its product offering substantially, and it is using its liquid resources, as well as internal development, to substantially expand its footprint in the market and to pursue an ever-rising TAM for its set of offerings.The company is now just a few months from releasing the first incarnation of its Xi technology in general release. Xi has the potential, I believe, to augment the base of the company meaningfully and is clearly not yet included in any operational projections. For readers interested in a more technical evaluation of Xi and its role in the IT infrastructure space than I can provide in this article, I have provided the link to a general purpose article on the subject.I will comment a bit more about Xi and the space it is to enter later in this article, but amongst the other positive elements of the conference call, the indication of progress in the release of Xi was a highlight - at least for this writer. And so too was the company's reaffirmation of 3-year growth targets of between 40-45% in terms of bookings and revenue growth. Again, there are very few companies, and certainly none with the valuation of this one, that have chosen to forecast that level of growth, over that time scale with 80%+ gross margins from a billion dollar revenue base.I will call what Nutanix reported a blow-out, but it might be well to have some points of reference before trying to draw a conclusion regarding the company's operational performance. At the headline level, the company reported revenues about 2% above the prior consensus. Service and support revenues grew by 49% to $268 million, while service and support billings, which I consider to be the most significant metric to consider in evaluating the progress of Nutanix grew by 66% to $359 million. Adding back the zero-margin pass through revenues of $95 million show that apples to apples revenue growth was 58%. Perhaps the most important comparative metric to consider was that total billings for the quarter reached $395 million compared to the prior analyst consensus of $372 million.In addition, the company wound up eliminating hardware revenue at a cadence greater than had been forecast. Hardware revenue has had for Nutanix has zero gross margins; as a result of the change in mix, and the over-attainment in service and support revenue, gross margins were almost 78% compared to a prior forecast of 73-74%. And that difference drove the significant over-attainment on the earnings line with a reported loss of $.11/share compared to the prior forecast made by the company of $.20-.22. The company doesn't forecast all of the metrics that it reports. But looking at the ones it does forecast and considering the other important metrics that provide insight into the health of the business suggest that this quarter's attainment really was significantly greater than planned levels and greater by what I would consider a substantial amount.The company added almost 1000 new customers to its base; it now has 10,610 customers. It booked the largest transaction in its history with a DoD user this past quarter, who signed a $20 million deal. That particular deal produced $12 million of deferred revenue; the company recognized $8 million or just 2% of its total revenues from the transaction last quarter. While not explicitly a correlation, it seems that as Nutanix sells larger deals to larger users, its bookings growth is coming in noticeably above forecast and that more of those bookings are being recorded as deferred revenues rather than recognized at the time of an installation.The company continues to see adoption of its hypervisor offering, a key component of its competitive positioning. Last quarter, 35% of its new nodes were shipped with the Nutanix hypervisor compared to 33% of nodes the prior quarter. Hypervisor adoption obviously drives larger deal sizes and goes a long way in solidifying long-term customer engagement. And the cohort analysis that Nutanix provides showed that its repeat purchase rate amongst its global 2000 customers rose to 10.1X from 9.6X in the year-earlier quarter. That said, there are still many large users NOT yet using Nutanix including half of the Forbes global 10 and 34 of the Forbes Global 100.As mentioned, the non-GAAP loss came at $0.11 per share compared to the prior First Call consensus forecast of a loss of $.22 per share. The company's GAAP operating expenses grew by 41% year on year; greater than the increase in reported revenue but significantly below the increase of 49% in product and support revenues. On a non-GAAP basis, operating expenses were $256 million, consistent with the company's prior forecast and up by 10% sequentially compared to the 17% sequential growth in adjusted revenues, after eliminating pass through hardware.The company generated a small, but noticeable positive result in terms of cash flow last quarter. Operating cash flow was up markedly from year-earlier results, and free cash flow was a positive as compared to a negative in the year-earlier period. The company's cash flow benefitted from the very substantial level of deferred revenue growth which grew by $90 million or 17% sequentially and by 72% year on year.Did Nutanix really guide-down? I think most readers who take a careful look at the numbers will come to the conclusion that the headline writers got it wrong. But first the specifics. Prior to the earnings release, the First Call consensus for this present quarter had been for revenues of $309 million and a non-GAAP EPS loss of $.23. The company has now forecast that it will generate revenues of $295-310 million with a non-GAAP EPS loss of $.26-.28. That looks like a guide-down and that is the way it was reported. However…Nutanix also forecasts some other significant components of its expected financial performance that are probably of more importance in understanding the outlook for the company and in evaluating how it is doing versus prior expectations. The company forecast that it would achieve bookings growth of 50-55% in the current quarter. That compares to a prior consensus expectation for 50% bookings growth.The company also forecast that its hardware component of total revenues would fall to 5-6% of the total compared to a prior forecast of 7%. This reduced the amount of revenue the company will report at the mid-point by about $6 million. And the company forecast that it would have a bill to revenue ratio of 1.26X compared to the prior consensus forecast by analysts of 1.21X. Essentially, the company is forecasting that while its bookings growth is accelerating compared to prior expectations, more of those bookings will be recognized in revenue over time, rather than up-front. This results in about $12 million less revenue and less gross margin as well, than otherwise would be the case.Finally, it should be noted that the CFO commented that as Nutanix has grown and as its orders have become larger, the company has seen a more seasonal factor in its revenues and bookings. Basically, the growth forecasted in Q1 is happening despite a seasonal headwind, and the growth that should be anticipated in Q2 will see a seasonal tailwind.Overall, adjusting for the two elements described above and not trying to figure out what normal seasonality might look like, looking at the Nutanix forecast on an apples to apples basis, would yield a revenue forecast of a bit more than $320 million and that compares to a prior expectation, as mentioned above of $309 million. And the gross margin from the greater level of deferral of license revenue would have resulted in an additional EPS forecast for fiscal Q1 of about $.07. This would have made the forecast loss for the period of between $.19-.21, significantly better than the prior consensus EPS loss of $.23. These revenues and gross margins will obviously be recognized, and indeed, the customers will have already paid the amounts to receive their software and support; but they will simply happen in later leading to greater growth in subsequent periods.I think it is worth noting that Nutanix management felt that it was important enough to include a restatement of the company's minimum forecast of $3 billion of bookings by fiscal 2021. To reach that goal will require a CAGR of 38% for the next few years, and that is no guide-down compared to current expectations but a guide-up. In fact, the current revenue consensus for fiscal year 2020 which has growth of just 29% will have to be revised up meaningfully to be congruent with the forecast provided by management. The CEO, in talking about the projection for $3 billion, actually mentioned that he thought some of the new products offerings, including Xi, might be layered on top of that attainment. I think just using 38% growth for 3 years for modelling purposes, supports a much higher current valuation than Friday's or for that matter Thursday's share price represents.There will, no doubt, be readers who don't like this re-working of revenue and profit and loss projections. I recognize that some investors prefer to see an unencumbered profit and loss presentation - but the fact is that this company sells a significant amount of software that is not attributed to any discrete hardware (portable software is the term Nutanix uses for that metric), and the revenue recognition standards are such that a substantial amount of that business will show up as deferred, regardless of the nature of the remaining transaction obligation.Finally, while Nutanix doesn't forecast cash flow metrics and trying to do so is not without its difficulties, the very strong increase the company has forecasted in bookings, coupled with the almost complete elimination zero-margin pass through hardware from the revenue mix, is going to help to drive cash flow growth more rapidly than some of the cash flow estimates I have seen. Cash flow is not something that one often sees identified as a share price driver, but for a company such as this, which has and will continue to have a business model that generates far more cash than reported earnings, it should be an important tool in the analysis of the company's progress.Did Nutanix really guide down? The headlines scream they did so and the headlines apparently were the factor in Friday's share price decline. But carefully considered, the company is suggesting faster top-line growth over an extended period. The company, with its current forecast of gross margins, has also probably erred on the side of conservatism when it comes to its EPS projection. Almost certainly, the company is going to surpass 80% gross margins based on its projected revenue mix, even though it is starting to generate some subscription revenues from its newest products. In the meanwhile, it seems to me that trying to evaluate Nutanix through the use of headline metrics is like trying to evaluate the relative performance of an automobile by looking at just a single component of performance such as horsepower, without considering all the elements that automobile aficionados use in evaluating the potential of various automobiles.I first started evaluating this company a bit more than 2 years ago when it only offered HCI and a hypervisor. That is still its core offering, and the outlook for that business is better now than might have been the case back then I wrote my initial article. I have linked here to a recent IDC analysis regarding the growth and competitive positioning of the companies within the HCI space. I should note that Nutanix hotly denies that it either growing more slowly or has a lower market share than the combination of VMware (VMW) and Dell (DVMT). Part of the argument concerns OEM sales, which obviously carry lower revenue per unit than the sales of a full system including hardware. I have also linked to the initial Gartner study on the HCI space which names Nutanix as the leader, with positive mention for its systems management capability, and for its Xi cloud service. It is also considered to be offering a superior choice of hypervisors to its users.As an investor, rather than a buyer of HCI solutions, I am not too sure it really matters if Nutanix is first or second. I think there is almost certain to be more than a single winner surrounded by satellites of losers, a view I tried to express when I recently reviewed the quarter of VMware. The investment thesis for Nutanix shares is grounded in its leadership position in the HCI market. At the least, the third-party studies linked here validate its leadership position and its ability to execute.The view presented by the third-party analysts, which seem reasonable to accept, is that Nutanix probably has a more simplified structure in terms of what it offers users. Obviously, VMware, which has constructed its solution under the aegis of EMC and now Dell, has lots of moving pieces and it can be a bit daunting for users to figure out which offering is optimal. Not all VMW users are going to buy its whole offering which can be massively complex, given the relationship with AWS and the relationship with Pivotal (PVTL). But obviously, both Nutanix and VMware are closing lots of business and so are some of the smaller or less focused competitors and there is no reason to think that won't continue into the future.The CEO summed up his competitive positioning by saying that Nutanix has positioned itself to be the Switzerland of clouds. It is a strategy that can and will resonate with users, I believe, and it helps explain the company's competitive success.But these days, Nutanix is in the process of becoming far more than an HCI vendor. I do not propose to go through all of the company's new offerings. The company CEO, Dheeraj Pandey, is clearly an industry visionary, and it is not uncommon to see him wax lyrical about the future of computing and the role of Nutanix in that future. That can be interesting reading, perhaps, but I will try to stick to the specific solutions that the company is offering that really have quantifiable market potential.The new products of note that are likely to drive growth going forward include Frame, Era, Beam Calm, Sherlock, and Epoch. Frame is a very recent acquisition that delivers desktop as a service from multiple clouds. Frame is going to be offered within Xi Cloud services and it is initially going to be available on AWS and Azure. For those readers interested, I have linked here to a third-party analysis of the acquisition.Nutanix Era was introduced by the company in May. It is a PaaS offering that is designed to automate and simplify database management. Beam, which is an optimization tool for the cloud was also introduced in May. Whether it is really groundbreaking as the company self-described the offering, I have no way of really evaluating.Calm is a somewhat older product that has apparently been quite successful. It provides users what the company describes as Application Centric Automation. Again, I am not really able to evaluate Calm as a management tool versus the many other offerings in the space - its success has most likely evolved because it is part of a bundle that is offered by the company.Sherlock is a Nutanix project still in development. It is designed to create an offering in the Internet of Things. It was previewed at the company's user group meeting called NEXT 2018. It has been typical for the company to make many product announcements during these events, and I assume the company will do again in November when it holds its international version of NEXT.The aforesaid products and services are lots of products to launch and will take the company into new markets against new competitors. Not all of them will be successful. And not all of them will be successful enough to really move the needle. But part of the value in owning Nutanix shares is that the company is willing to make investments in new areas of IT infrastructure that offer investors the opportunity to hit another home-run beyond that of HCI.And in that regard, I think the opportunities with Xi are likely to be substantial and could well maintain the company's growth rate above 50% for a couple of years. The first incarnation of Xi in terms of a product is called Leap Disaster recovery. Disaster Recovery is one of the larger spaces in the IT infrastructure world. Most users have purchased appliances to perform their back-up and recovers chores. Once upon a time, Dell and its Data Domain deduplication offering dominated the space. These days, Dell offers something called an All-In-One data protection appliance, while CommVault (CVLT), HPE, and other vendors participate in the market. The most relevant study in terms of market size is linked here and shows that the market size will reach about $6 billion by 2023, with a CAGR of 21%. I have linked here to a pictograph for any readers wanting to see some representation as to how Xi is supposed to work. It is quite different than what is available from most other vendors currently and it involves no hardware.Over the course of the next several years, I expect that Nutanix will gradually see its revenue generation migrate to multiple sources as compared to the current emphasis on hyper-converge and hypervisor software. It is a major reason why I think Nutanix shares, despite their heady performance over the past couple of years, have much further potential.Nutanix is not without risks. The biggest risk as I see it is trying to do too much too soon. One analyst on the latest conference call, lamented, seriously I suppose, that he couldn't quite keep up with all of the strategic initiatives of this company. There is more than a kernel of truth in that. Managing so many initiatives designed to produce deliverables for demanding users on a tight time scale can be a daunting undertaking. It would not be surprising to see some initiatives fail and others reach market behind schedule - Xi is an example of this company announcing a product before it was really available for shipment.It is also true that Nutanix is going to wind up competing with a gaggle of different vendors, some of whom are partners today. While co-option is the norm in the IT space, that doesn't make it easy or always lead to successful outcomes.Finally, the competition with Dell/VMware is not without its challenges. I think there is more than enough market for both vendors to thrive. But from time to time, there will be Nutanix users who are captured by VMW (and vice-versa of course) and there will be rumors of excessive price competition. And as Nutanix expands its offering, the competition with VMW will become more extensive and undoubtedly nastier. It's part of what happens when a vendor expands its footprint.I have tried to make a case for investing in the shares of Nutanix at Friday's closing price and at this time. In terms of the standard valuation metrics, only the EV/S will be of a great deal of use in terms of comparative analysis. The company has forecast 176 million outstanding shares, and at Friday's closing share price, that yielded a market capitalization of $9.9 billion and an enterprise value of $9.4 billion. The new consensus for reported revenue over the 2019 fiscal year is about $1.35 billion that yields an EV/S of a bit less than 7X. On a headline basis, the $1.35 billion in revenues represents growth of 17% from the revenue reported for the July ending fiscal 2018. On an apples to apples basis, which adds back the pass-through hardware revenue of $169 million that has been excluded from the reported revenues, the growth in 2018 was actually 57%, and that accelerated slightly to 58% in Q4. I think that it is reasonable to value Nutanix based on an ""as adjusted"" top line growth rate of 50-55%, with some potential upside to that estimate.Given that more than 95% of the company's revenues will be coming from software, I think it is reasonable to believe that full-year gross margins will be in the low-mid 80% range. Management has forecast that operating expense for Q1 will reach $280-290 million, up from the $258 million reported this past quarter. I personally doubt that the company will be able to spend at that cadence, unless Q1 bookings are well ahead of forecast, and carry noticeable commission accelerators. Overall, I think non-GAAP operating expense for the year will be around $1.30 billion, and with gross margins of $1.15 billion, the operating loss for the year will be around $150 million. That is an operating loss margin of 11%. On the other hand, full-year billings are trending such that they should reach about nearly $1.75 billion in total, which would create an addition $400 million of deferred revenue, creating free cash flow of $200 million or a free cash flow yield on current valuation of about 2%. A free cash flow yield of 2% for a company with growth of greater than 50% is a very reasonable valuation.The investment case for Nutanix rests partly on its relative valuation as it starts reporting as a pure software company. And it rests as well on an understanding that the company is generating lots of deferred revenue with a book to bill ratio considerably greater than almost any other software company of significant size. But it is also a function of the longevity of the company's hyper-growth status, based on its strong market position in the HCI space, its growing position in selling its own HyperVisors (Acropolis), and the host of new products that should start to produce revenue of significance going through 2019. It is my view that this is a name that fits the bill for almost all investors in the growth IT space and as such it will continue to produce positive alpha."
4203523,103480,2018-08-31T18:41:16-04:00,"Nutanix shares lost ~5% after reporting Q4 earnings beat, but fell on in-line guidance for the first quarter.Nutanix has historically been a conservative guidance giver, so there's little doubt the company can continue its immense growth trajectory in FY19.Nutanix signed its largest-ever deal in the fourth quarter, upwards of $20 million.The company is both a growth story and a cash flow story, as margins continue to improve reflecting Nutanix's shift into pure software.","It's been a while since investors have cheered an earnings release from Nutanix (NTNX), the maker of hyper-converged systems that increase both the speed and total cost of ownership of a traditional enterprise server pool. As Nutanix's scale grows larger (since its 2016 IPO, Nutanix's revenue base has nearly tripled - a humongous accomplishment for a technology that was not so long ago considered experimental), investors begin to fear the effects of deceleration.Yet, Nutanix still remains the darling of the IT sector when it comes to backend server infrastructure. It is the envy of VMware (VMW), whose competing hyper-converged offerings have gained some traction in the markets, but is far from receiving the ""best-in-breed"" acclaim that Nutanix has. No need to even mention HPE SimpliVity (HPE), which is a distant laggard in this race. In my view, Nutanix's reach into its addressable market is far from overextended, as the company is tackling a multibillion-dollar TAM in a product category that barely existed five years ago. It's not often that Goldman Sachs (GS) acknowledges a stock as a ""once-in-a-decade"" opportunity, but it gave Nutanix this recognition last year.With Nutanix having now closed out its fiscal 2018, it's a good chance to take stock of the company's accomplishments this year and review the bullish thesis going forward. Recall that Nutanix's big pivotal moment came this year when it decided to shift to software-only billings. Previously, Nutanix's revenue base also included ""pass-through hardware"" revenues that bore very low margins. Now, Nutanix is focused on becoming a hardware-agnostic software platform for running an enterprise server infrastructure. This hardware-agnostic approach is, in part, what is responsible for Windows' rapid rise in the 90s, as PC makers of all flavors flocked to Windows' operating system and Microsoft (MSFT) enjoyed taking a hefty cut of each sale.It's also worth noting that Nutanix crossed the $1 billion revenue mark in FY18, hitting $1.16 billion in revenues (+37% y/y) even after the elimination of pass-through hardware revenues. It hit this billion-dollar revenue mark in less than a decade of existence, and it did so without straining its cash balances. This fiscal year, Nutanix also broke positive free cash flows - a stark reversal for a company that was once feared for its heavy losses.Moving forward, Nutanix's next leg of growth relies on moving down-market, as the company is already in place at many Fortune 500 companies. Recognizing the opportunity in covering a wider ground, Nutanix also announced an initiative called ""Velocity"", a new program for reseller/channel partners that will help to accelerate the company's push into the mid-market. Nutanix relies heavily on resellers to cover less prominent prospects - and for the large part, their sales efforts are ""free"", so this represents an incredibly accretive opportunity for Nutanix in the coming years.In my view, Nutanix still remains a strong buy. Though shares are already up more than 60% in the year to date, the stock has traded largely flat since March, when the software-only announcement was widely broadcasted and investors began viewing Nutanix as more of a high-multiple software play.NTNX data by YChartsThere are very few companies that have attained a scale like Nutanix in such record timing, indicating the sheer utility and criticality of its product in the IT landscape. New products to be introduced later in the calendar year, such as the disaster-recovery-as-a-service product Leap (a competitor to Datto, which received a high-profile buyout offer from Vista Equity Partners earlier this year) further strengthens its technology leadership and cross-sell potential. Nutanix's moat remains deep, and dips in the stock should be viewed as buying opportunities.Here's a look at Nutanix's Q4 results:Figure 1. Nutanix Q4 resultsSource: Nutanix investor relationsRevenues grew 20% y/y to $303.7 million, edging out over Wall Street's expectations of $300.6 million (+19% y/y) by just over one point and propelling the company's first-ever $1 billion-plus year. It's worth noting that, in accordance with the shift to software-only deals, hardware pass-through billings became a very small (9%) portion of total billings, down from 25% in the year-ago quarter.Software-only billings, on the other hand, grew to about half of Nutanix's billings mix, and software and support services billings together showed impressive 67% y/y growth. Total billings, on the other hand, grew 37% y/y.Given that billings are the more forward-looking indicator of revenue growth, the near-40% billings growth rate is a far better barometer of Nutanix's top-line growth than its 20% revenue growth this quarter, which is colored by the elimination of pass-through hardware. The bill-to-revenue ratio, a custom metric that Nutanix just started reporting, ticked up to 1.23x (from 1.17x in the prior year) in FY18, indicating that more and more billings are being pushed into deferred revenues. Nutanix's revenue pipeline and backlog is extremely healthy.In addition, note that Nutanix signed on its largest-ever client in the quarter, which brought ""greater than $20 million"" in billings for the quarter. Nutanix mentioned that the customer was an agency of the Department of Defense. Total deals worth more than $1 million clocked in at 23. 21 of these deals were also greater than $2 million. Just because Nutanix is concentrating more down-market doesn't mean that its success among large enterprises and public sector clients has gone stale.Nutanix also showed healthy performance on the bottom line. Largely as a function of its shift to higher-margin software and services, Nutanix saw strong gross margin improvements to 77.7% (on a pro forma basis), up more than 15 points from just 62.6% in the year-ago quarter. When it first went public, analysts feared that Nutanix would become a commoditized play, more in-line with low-valued storage stocks. A 78% gross margin, however, hardly indicates a commoditized play.Nutanix's pro forma net losses (which largely exclude stock-based comp, along with other smaller items) also shrank to just -$19.0 million in the quarter, a much better loss than -$26.0 million in 4Q17. Pro forma EPS of -$0.11 also showed huge upside to Wall Street's forecast of -$0.21.As an added cherry on top, Nutanix also achieved positive free cash flow this year:Figure 2. Nutanix FY18 FCFSource: Nutanix investor relationsAgain, Nutanix was once a company that some investors avoided due to heavy losses. In FY18, Nutanix has been able to hit $30.2 million in positive free cash flow - despite losing the same magnitude of FCF in the prior year.In my view, the bullish thesis for Nutanix remains as valid as ever, especially given that the stock has barely seen any movement over the past few months while the rest of the technology sector has soared. Nutanix still maintains a wide advantage next to its closest peer, VMware, especially as it prepares Xi cloud services and prepares to make a bigger push into subscription deals. Stay long on this name. A balance sheet with ~$500 million in net cash ($934 million of cash, less $429 million in convertible debt), plus positive free cash flow, is another added plus that gives Nutanix the flexibility to make smart acquisitions. Stay long on this name."
4186643,104608,2018-07-11T13:05:09-04:00,"Nutanix is the undisputed leader in the hyper converged infrastructure, a rapidly growing area for large enterprises.Investors are not appropriate valuing the company based on their revised software-only model.Recent 15% pullback provides a great opportunity to take advantage of this undervalued, high-growth name.","Nutanix (NTNX) is the undisputed leader in the hyperconverged infrastructure, or HCI, market. Enterprises have slowly shifted from owning independent storage, compute and networking hardware pieces to having a fully integrated stack. This process, known as hyperconverged, has resulted in a significant market share opportunity that is rapidly growing. NTNX has transformed their business model from selling their software on top of customized hardware to a software-only model, compatible on all types of commodity hardware. However, investors have not made this transition and are still valuing NTNX on the basis of a combination of hardware and software sales.After hosting a solid analyst day in early March, NTNX saw strong investor support as their stock rose 10% and after releasing their Q3 earnings, they saw another 10% appreciation. Since NTNX announced their intentions of transitioning to a software-only company, their stock has skyrocketed. NTNX is up over 150% the past year and nearly 50% YTD, making them one of the top-performing stocks so far.NTNX data by YChartsHowever, a recent 15% pullback has offered an attractive entry opportunity from a valuation standpoint. This has caused NTNX’s revenue multiple to dip from greater than 9.0x to a current 8.6x. Though NTNX is still in the midst of transitioning from a hardware to a software-based company, they should deserve a revenue multiple more in line with comparable software companies, which will be discussed later on.Prior to announcing their transition to a software-only company, NTNX sold their HCI offering on top of a hardware platform. This standardized hardware hosted their unique HCI software and could be easily deployed to any type of customer. Rather than charging more for their product because of the increased costs associated with the hardware, NTNX charged customers their costs for the hardware. In other words, if a customer bought $100 of product from NTNX under their old operating model, and let’s say the hardware costs NTNX $20, then the customer was only charged $20 for the hardware. Thus, gross margin for hardware sales was 0%. The reasoning behind this operating model was for customers to enjoy the software rather than worrying about extra costs associated with hardware.One of the issues NTNX was having with providing the hardware was making sure the hardware was compatible with their customer’s current hardware. Rather than dealing with the intricacies associated with assuring NTNX hardware could be easily integrated into other pieces of hardware, NTNX made the shift to focus on their software. Their software is compatible on all commodity hardware, meaning no matter who manufactures the hardware pieces, the software is able to effectively sit on top of it and function properly. This transition will make customer deployment even easier as each individual customer can choose which hardware is most compatible with their current infrastructure, and simply add NTNX software on top.The transition to software has two main implications for NTNX. First, as the amount of hardware sales phases out over time, NTNX could grow at a lower rate. Though hardware sales earned no gross profit, they were accretive to top-line growth. However, software sales are relatively easier to make and are more recurring in nature, thus, more predictable. The other implication of the software transition is higher margins. NTNX reported gross margins of ~63% in F17 and has seen gross margins of 61.9%, 63.5%, and 68.4% for the past three quarters, Q1-Q3, respectively. This trend is likely to continue as software sales have minimal input costs compared to hardware. That being said, the one worry investors may see is a potential underperforming top-line growth (due to elimination of hardware sales) but higher gross margins. Net, this should have a neutral to positive effect on earnings.Though transitioning to a software-only operating model, NTNX would be the first company in the HCI market to operate such a way. Not only is their software a leading platform in the market, but by becoming the only software-only player, this will give them the first-mover advantage.Let’s start with their Analyst Day back in March. Management discussed their estimated $200 billion TAM as the number of use cases for HCI continues to increase (Source: Company Presentation). Companies typically use HCI for either Tier 1 or non-mission critical applications. Critical applications, those essential for running day-to-day operations within the business, are typically still hosted within one of several silos in an on-premise infrastructure. Management also forecasted $3 billion for targeted billings by 2020, nearly 40% CAGR growth. Management also provided a longer-term operating model compared to a typical software/subscription model based company, something NTNX is transitioning to. Forecasted revenue growth of >30% complements forecasted gross margins of >75%. Both gross and operating margins are forecasted to expand in tandem as software plays a more prominent role in their operations.Source: Company PresentationTheir Q3 earnings report showed top line growing 41% with management guiding Q4 revenue of $295-300 million, representing 17-19% top-line growth, a relatively conservative figure. However, gross margins were guided to 73-74%, well above last year’s Q4 62.6% margin. Hardware sales still represented 22% of total sales, but management is confident this figure will continue to diminish. Software and support/services revenue represented the remaining $226.8 million of Q3 revenue, representing 54% growth compared to last year. I will discuss more about my revenue expectations in the valuation section.Another recent important piece of news was NTNX’s introduction of their new velocity program. This new channel partner program is targeted at middle-market focused firms (Source: Company Website). NTNX historically focused on the enterprise market through their internal sales department. However, as NTNX continues to penetrate the Global 2k customer base, the need to move down market towards non-Global 2k customers arises. Below is a chart that shows the company's Global 2k Customer Base.Source: Company PresentationThe chart above shows the Global 2k Customer Base is 55% penetrated, and while there is still room to grow within these larger enterprises, the growth won't be as quickly. In order to cope with this, NTNX announced their velocity program, aimed at middle-market sized companies. The chart below shows the Non-Global 2k Customer Base, one that has significant room to run.Source: Company PresentationThe move to non-Global 2k customers will enhance top-line growth and will further establish NTNX as the number one HCI player. Their new velocity program gives NTNX a direct route to the middle market customer through a trained channel partner. Many companies use these channel partners to generate sales as the partners will not only have detailed knowledge of NTNX’s product offerings, but the channel partners are integrated into the market and have a long history of selling to clients. The mid-market channel partner program will surely expand NTNX’s customer base at a quick rate, all the while maintaining strong top-line growth and consistent margins.The transition to software gives NTNX the opportunity to receive a higher revenue multiple, given the recurring and stable nature of software and subscription-related revenue. Prior to the software transition, NTNX historically traded at 3-6x revenue, because more of their top-line was dictated by hardware sales, thus, a lower revenue multiple. More recently, NTNX’s software sales have experienced a significant 54% growth, as demonstrated above.During the Analyst Day, management provided a compelling chart, showing how technology companies compare when looking at the Rule of 40. This is a common way to visually see how a fast-growing company is performing, as the Rule of 40 measures revenue growth rate plus FCF yield. As long as those two percentages add up to 40%, the company is viewed as being on the right track. Management also provided the average revenue multiple of different cohorts that were measured in the below chart.Source: Company PresentationThe average revenue multiple for the above companies varies greatly; however, NTNX would likely fall in the ~8.2x range (as demonstrated by the blue shaded area). Taking a closer look at other fast-growing software competitors, including New Relic (NEWR), ServiceNow (NOW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Splunk (SPLK), Atlassian (TEAM), and Workday (WDAY), we get a different picture of where revenue multiples are. All of those listed companies are growing top line 25%+ through 2019 and are great indicators of how other fast-growing software companies are being valued.NEWR EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsGiven NTNX’s software and support/services business is growing 50%+, they deserve to be trading at least in line with this comp group. Through Q3, NTNX has software revenue of $441.9 million and support/services revenue of $188.4 million. Assuming a conservative 35% growth for these two segments for Q4 gives us software and support/services revenue of $174.4 million and $68.9 million, respectively (from $129.2 million and $51.0 million last Q4). This results in total software and support/services revenue for F18 of $616.3 million and $257.3 million, for total non-hardware revenue of $873.6 million.To throw out a conservative F19 estimate, let’s assume only 30% software growth, which would be a massive deceleration for a company solely focusing on software sales. A F19 30% top-line growth would result in ~$1,135.7 million in software sales. At a 9x multiple, which is slightly below the 8.2x multiple for companies passing the Rule of 40 and compares to the average 10.7x multiple for the above comp group, an enterprise value of $10.2 billion is calculated. If we take into consideration net cash of $923.5 million, we get a market cap of just over $11.1 billion. With 166.8 million shares outstanding from their Q3 earnings release, this results in a target price of $67, representing a 26% upside to Monday's closing price of $53.14.The 9x multiple is a good estimate because although NTNX has the target of only selling software, it will take a few quarters before all of their hardware sales are off their books. However, the 9x multiple applied is well below their software-only peer group.The recent 15% pullback in NTNX represents a very attractive entry point, especially as the company continues their transition to a software-only company. Software sales are more recurring and predictable compared to hardware sales, which is why software companies often receive a premium multiple compared to hardware companies. My above conservative valuation assumes a significant deceleration in growth coupled with improving margins from the transition to hardware.NTNX is a volatile name and often trades in swings of +/- 3-4% on a daily basis. Near-term headwinds include a potential slower than forecasted transition to software, which would put downward pressure on margins. Also, it is challenging to predict how investors will view future earnings reports. As previously discussed, the quicker NTNX moves to software-only, top-line growth will look artificially lower because of the reduced hardware sales. If the top line comes in a bit softer than estimated, I would expect a rather large margin beat, which would further signify NTNX’s long-term viability as a software-only company."
4177829,24555,2018-05-29T14:07:01-04:00,"Despite a single-quarter EPS miss due to added personnel, including sales teams, top-line growth is stronger than ever.The company's transition from hardware, to software-centric focus is already starting to pay off much earlier than expected.A small share of the $90 Billion plus Global 2000 market for Cloud services, will add significantly to top-line growth.","Shares in California based Nutanix Inc. (NTNX), developer of enterprise cloud operating system software, have recently undergone a mild correction, taking the price from an all-time high of around $60 a share just over 9 trading days ago, to $52.50 at the last close. The price correction in my view, is overplayed, and offers opportunity to buy into a medium-term price target of around $61, which represents around 8x Enterprise-Value-to-revenue (EV/Sales) based on projected full-year 2019 sales, level with close competitors Splunk, Palo Alto Networks, et al.I maintain a bullish stance on Nutanix, for a number of reasons, which I will try to explore further in this article. First, some quantitative numbers...Sales revenue in the most recent quarter grew by an impressive 43.9% (relative to the same quarter in the previous year). Operating margin however, grew by a lesser enthusiastic 4% (more on this in a moment). Current debt-to-equity in the business is presently 91% which is relatively high compared to industry peers, which average 23%. This is buffered to some way by the Sales/Employee metric, which currently stands at $383,150/employee, relative to the industry average of $290,250/employee. Moreover, the annual revenue growth rates for Nutanix are 49.8%, 82.0%, and 158.9% over one, three, and five years respectively (source: portfolio123). There is enough proof in management's capability of delivering continued innovation and growth within the company.The balance of this article will provide a 'qualitative' thesis of why I believe Nutanix provides strong, sustainable potential for continued growth in its stock price, interspersed by occasional pullbacks (as experienced in the past couple of weeks), with a medium-term price target of at least $61 a share going toward 2019.Analysts covering Nutanix, are net positive, despite the recent downturn in EPS and share price. The reason for this are justified, as it is overwhelmingly agreed than the company is transforming with gusto - supported by a significant increase in the sales-force, aiming to capture a slice of Global 2000 companies' cloud needs - into a software-only business. This clear-cut objective, voiced numerously by the company CEO, is on track.Jefferies & Co.'s John DiFucci, recently reiterated a Buy rating, quoting that the results were ""solid"" and the company ""continues to execute its transition to a pure software business where it will decrease its pass-through hardware sales.""Simon Leopold of Raymond James reiterated an Outperform rating, raising his price target from $58 to $64, quoting that ""we suspect expectations were high, so the stock might face short-term pressure, particularly with higher expenses and lower EPS"".The sales drive in Nutanix is supported by adding a substantial 480 employees to the workforce, during the most recent quarter. Of these, 60 were in sales. Naturally, the added expense in personnel has led to a rise in operating expenses, which are the majority cause in pulling the EPS numbers down, while top-line sales (thanks to the added sales force) exceeded projections/estimates. This detail is the main driver for why analysts (and investors like myself) remain positive on the stock.Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America Merrill Lynch had been anticipating the increase in hiring for the past six months, and confirmed Nutanix management's focus on sales as a good thing in the long-term.It is clear then, that the increase in billings, adding to a sustainable top-line revenue, justifies the higher cost of operations, personnel, and marketing budgets.Adding support to the theses (and largely bullish consensus from analysts), I want to delve deeper into what the actual target market for Nutanix is, where it aims to build revenue precisely, in order to support the growth in software-only products/services, and more importantly, what Dheeraj Pandey, the CEO himself, had to say...In terms of revenue 'growth', the software-centric model has transpired into a 50% annual billings growth, and a 40% annual revenue growth. Of the company's top four deals within the $5 million plus category, 75% were software-only. The nimbleness of shifting focus on software-only growth is further voiced by Katy Huberty (Morgan Stanley) quoting how she has been ""surprised by how quickly Nutanix has been able to grow its software business"". Moreover, she added, should her long-term bull case play out, Nutanix's penetration into the data storage and server market will be on par with that of VMware, Inc. (VMW)The objective in combining server, storage, and virtualization software, into one unit (one machine), is what allows Nutanix, a pioneer in the field, to carve out a strong, sustainable market. In the context of achieving this objective, CEO Dheeraj Pandey told Bloomberg its challenges ""has less to do with products,"" but the 'how' of engineering. ""How do you break things down, how do you do smaller releases, how do you have multiple parallel streams of engineering going on at the same time?"", Pandey said.The target market for Nutanix is centered primarily on generating large deals within the Global 2000 group of businesses, in order to achieve the expected growth in future revenues. The company is perfectly positioned (in terms of innovation, engineering, sales, and brand) to productively target the 2,000 companies, which account for a total addressable market of over $75 billion. In addition, the cloud sector and systems management provide an additional stream of some $15 billion. Penetrating a realistic, small percentage of this market would be a net benefit to Nutanix. Put into perspective, current annual sales revenue is $1.08 Billion.Nutanix has begun to support file protocols, which enable currently active sales reps to target both NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and Dell/EMC file environments this year. In addition, the introduction of Nutanix's ""Calm"" and ""Prism"" capabilities, servers and storage IaaS opens up a new opportunity with the introduction of Xi Cloud Services (Xi website). Xi Cloud Services provide a native extension to the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud Platform, delivering an integrated public cloud environment that can be instantly provisioned and automatically configured.While most analysts are positive on Nutanix, I believe KeyBanc's revised price target of $61 is the most realistic objective, implying an 8x EV/Sales multiple, which places NTNX similar to that of competitors Splunk Inc. (SPLK), and Palo Alto Networks Inc. (PANW). Nutanix closed Friday at $52.50 per share, offering a 'buy-on-current-dips' opportunity, ideally hedged by technology ETF (XLK)."
4177132,103480,2018-05-25T12:08:23-04:00,"Nutanix vacillated between losses and gains after reporting Q1 earnings that beat on the top line but missed on earnings.At the moment, Nutanix is a pure growth story. Its earnings are of secondary importance as it chases market shares in a niche it dominates.The better indicator of profitability is the fact that Nutanix has greatly improved its free cash flow, and is able to sustain its losses without raising outside capital.The shift to eliminating hardware revenues hasn't slowed down Nutanix's growth and has also boosted gross margins.","Nutanix (NTNX), the new-age storage vendor and dominant player in hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI), has been one of this year's best performers. Shares have rallied more than 50% in the year-to-date period alone. And over the past 12 months, Nutanix shares have tripled from all-time lows in the mid-teens.NTNX data by YChartsNutanix is a perfect example of how quickly a narrative can turn in the high growth technology industry - and a convincing case study of why companies with the strongest IP should be bought and held for the long term. At this time last year, Nutanix was in the dumps as investors questioned whether Nutanix's product was truly differentiated and whether it would face margin erosion over time as competition from the likes of HP Enterprise (HPE) and VMware (VMW), newly controlled by another tech conglomerate in Dell-EMC. The thinking was that these much larger and well-funded competitors would end up edging Nutanix out of a market it essentially created.Yet, this is not what happened. Nutanix continued to dominate the HCI market as it conceptually began gaining popularity in the IT community, with competitors still in the game but earning less favorable reviews from customers. Gartner, the leading software industry analyst, recently published its first-ever Magic Quadrant for Hyperconverged Infrastructures and named Nutanix as the leader - not only validating the space as a whole, but also anointing Nutanix as the chief thought leader in the space. These rankings carry plenty of weight with IT buyers.At the same time, Nutanix announced two quarters ago that it would be focused on its software revenues, and less on selling hardware pre-packaged with software, enabling its shift to becoming more of a platform company.Hardware companies obviously trade at lower valuation multiples than software companies, mostly due to their lower gross margins and greater volatility in earnings. So as Nutanix began to grow its margin profile and shift more into a software-only billings model, its valuation began to expand dramatically, and the stock is now currently trading at 7.5x forward revenues, as shown in the chart above.But is Nutanix expensive? It's not cheap, but in my opinion, Nutanix is still an excellent investment for the long-term. With revenue and billings growing at ~40% and ~50%, respectively, and with the company turning the corner on margins and profitability, the trajectory for it one or two years out is fantastic. Nutanix's shift from being a packaged widget (hardware plus software) company into a software platform that's essentially hardware agnostic is also another major growth driver. Like Microsoft (MSFT) in the '80s, Nutanix can really start taking over the market once its software is widely distributed across many OEMs.Stay long on Nutanix and buy any pullbacks. Looking at Nutanix's valuation in terms of a near-term revenue multiple is a bit misleading, especially with a company whose billings growth suggests years of ""hypergrowth"" on the revenue side for years to come. Instead look at this company as one that can become a staple of the IT sector, as VMware and other similar companies before it.Here's a look at Nutanix's full Q3 earnings results:Figure 1. Nutanix Q3 resultsSource: Nutanix investor relationsTotal revenues grew 41% y/y to $289.4 million, showing barely any deceleration from the 42% y/y growth Nutanix saw last quarter despite the elimination of pass-through hardware revenues (pass-through hardware being the OEM's revenues from the hardware appliance on which Nutanix software is loaded). Wall Street was only looking for $279.0 million in revenues, or +35% y/y, making this quarter a respectable five-point beat.What's even more impressive still, however, is the fact that Nutanix's billings growth rate absolutely eclipsed its revenue growth. As Nutanix shifts into becoming more of a software play, the billings metric will come into even greater focus, as it measures the revenue pipeline one year out and is a good indicator of long-term growth. This quarter, Nutanix grew billings to $351.2 million, up a stunning 50% y/y:Figure 2. Nutanix Q3 billingsSource: Nutanix investor relationsThe billings-to-revenue ratio this quarter was 121%. Nutanix, beginning this quarter with its guidance for Q4, began adding a guidance note about the billings-to-revenue ratio. In Q4, Nutanix expects a 125% ratio versus the current 120% that Wall Street is modeling. When billings consistently outpaces revenue, both from a percent growth and pure dollar standpoint, Nutanix is effectively closing deals and adding to the long-term revenue pipeline more than it's recognizing in that quarter's revenues. In effect, the revenue growth percentage isn't telling you the full story - billings growth is a more holistic picture of how much traction Nutanix gained with customers in the quarter.Note also that 83% of this billings figure was due to software billings; the hardware portion has decreased y/y to just 17% of the mix. Duston Williams, Nutanix's CFO, noted on the earnings call that as the software portion continues to grow to eventually overtake the entire billings portfolio, the billings-to-revenue ratio will continue to increase.Despite the growth upside, Nutanix missed slightly on bottom-line expectations. Q3 pro forma EPS of -$0.21 missed analyst consensus of -$0.23 by a hair. In my view, however, this is much less important as Nutanix is trending in the right direction. On the cost side, Nutanix's gross margin improved 750bps to 67%, up from 59.5% in 3Q17, largely due to the software transition. Total operating expenses also only grew 27% y/y to $276.1 million to support 41% revenue growth.While Nutanix is still posting large losses from a GAAP standpoint, I'm more swayed by the fact that its margins are moving in the right direction rather than putting too much weight on a single quarter's miss. Nutanix's profitability, at this point, barely matters. What's important is that the company is sufficiently liquid to fund its losses. And in that regard, Nutanix exceeded expectations as it managed to become essentially free cash flow breakeven this quarter:Figure 3. Nutanix FCFSource: Nutanix investor relationsThe bottom line on Nutanix shares: the company is still firing on all cylinders as it achieves above-expected revenue and billings growth, despite the elimination of hardware revenues and a largely increased focus on software-only deals. Shares may see some turbulence over the next month as the company enters into a period with few catalysts for the stock, but any pullbacks in the shares should be bought.Looking longer term, there's no substitute for a company that has widely been regarded as the clear market leader in a space that is becoming essential for information technology. With the company's billings growing at a ~50% clip, Nutanix is growing into a behemoth, and it's still early days for the company. Stay long on this fantastic name."

This offering helps application owners with the unexpectedly high costs of their cloud services and the lack of visibility and control of their service consumption.Nutanix recently completed the acquisition of Netsil, a provider of application discovery and operations management that enables state-of-the-art observability in modern distributed cloud environments. It plans to add Netsil's technology to the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS software to help customers secure applications as well as identify and fix performance issues. San Francisco-based Netsil was founded in 2016 by Cam Nguyen, Harjot Gill, Shariq Rizvi, and Tanveer Gill. It had raised $5.7 million in seed funding from Moment Ventures, Engineering Capital, Mayfield Fund, Plug and Play, and StartUp PHL.In March this year, Nutanix announced its intent to acquire Minjar, maker of cloud management service Bitmetric for an undisclosed sum. Nutanix plans to use Minjar's technology to bolster its Nutanix Calm automation and lifecycle management product, as well as Xi Cloud Services, a native extension to the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud OS software.

4186880,104556,2018-07-12T10:45:03-04:00,"Nutanix has gone through a radical business model change in the past three quarters.Revenue has slowed as a result but the earnings leverage, particularly on the gross margin side has been quite impressive.Focus on the billings growth and the customer satisfaction as you track this investment.","The advent of cloud computing has been revolutionary for businesses over the past decade, and in 2017, Statista pegged the overall market at a staggering $130 billion. Clearly, IT departments have fallen in love with the cloud and for good reason; in comparison, on-premise data centers are expensive and difficult to maintain. However, the reality is that the cloud is not suitable for every computing need. As a result, the modern data center has become a hybrid of both on-premise technology and the cloud. Being able to pick and choose is cost efficient and helps businesses solve problems more quickly. This is where Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) thrives.Nutanix’s adaptability, customer satisfaction and strong software billings growth make this an interesting IT investment.Nutanix specializes in hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI), essentially “a data center in a box.” The company’s technology combines all the components of a data center, including computing, storage, networking and virtualization. Nutanix brands itself as an “enterprise cloud operating system,” which means its software enables IT departments to seamlessly utilize a hybrid computing environment.To give a surface-level example, picture your smartphone. If you have an iPhone, the operating system allows you to open apps, send messages and so on. Imagine using the cloud to access and save huge files while being able to save high security files right on your phone. Broadly, that is the gist behind Nutanix’s operating system, you get the best of both on-premise and multi-cloud environments.This operating system is all wrapped up in commodity hardware boxes. As a somewhat recent development, the company announced three quarters ago that it would stop reporting revenues from hardware and focus on software and services revenues. This was a welcome change because Nutanix’s bread and butter is really in the software.Its technology works with any off-the-shelf hardware and this is one of the main reasons for the company’s success. Nutanix’s customers can continually update their systems with the latest hardware while maintaining the software’s capabilities. This flexibility is key because customers are not locked into expensive, proprietary hardware deals.Nutanix pioneered the hyper-converged space and is a Gartner leader, though some reports have the company second-fiddle to DellEMC. But Nutanix is not settling. In its most recent press release, management announced three new products, including its first SaaS offering. Moreover, in the last two reports, Nutanix publicized two new acquisitions that it would integrate into its current and new product innovations.All that is to say that Nutanix has had a history of adapting to the ever-changing market environment. From creating the product category to begin with to changing business models during a high-growth phase to continuously innovating and pleasing customers, this company has shown it moves quickly.And it is clear Nutanix is solving a major problem. Total customer count ballooned from 1,168 in Q2 of 2015 to an epic 8,870 in Q2 of 2018. Started in just 2009, nine years later, the company has almost 9,700 paying customers. Plus, these customers love the product. Nutanix boasts a 92 NPS (net promoter score) out of 100, which is basically unheard of compared to the industry average of 54.This love for the company has also translated into the financials. At the eighteen-month mark, Nutanix customers, on average, spend four times more than they did initially. In the latest quarter, revenues grew 40% year over year and in the same period operating losses narrowed from 22% of revenues to 12%. At first glance, year-over-year revenue growth appears to have decelerated quite a bit from the 70% range two years ago. But dig a little deeper and you realize this is because the company now excludes hardware revenues as mentioned.Source: Nutanix Investor PresentationOn the plus side, this is part of the reason why margins have been drastically improving. What is more, in the latest Investor Day presentation, the company noted if all sales reps were “fully-ramped,” billings could have been $180 million more than the $509 million of the first two quarters. Importantly, billings growth, a more objective measure of demand, has been very strong. In the latest quarter, this number grew 50% to $351 million. And here’s the kicker, software-specific billings grew even faster at a 62% clip. While not quite as spectacular as Zscaler’s (NASDAQ:ZS) 73% billings growth, it is surely nothing to sneeze at.To take a step back to focus on gross margins, the last report tallied them at 68%, up from 61% in the year prior. The company also guided on this front for Q4 all the way to 74% at the high end. If reached, this means that the dramatic shift in the business model will result in 1300 bps gross margin improvement in just 5 quarters. Obviously, revenue slows as a result, but that is still impressive.As the transition to a software-only model continues, investors may realize the valuation is still reasonable. Analysts estimate 2019 revenues to be about $1.35 billion and Nutanix’s market cap tips the scale at $9.4 billion. Because of a convertible offering a few months back, the company has about $900 million in cash, resulting in an enterprise value of $8.5 billion.In my opinion, Nutanix will beat analyst estimates on the revenue front, but let’s use their numbers for some conservatism. This means the forward EV/sales ratio is around 6.3x. Granted, revenue was guided for 18% growth in Q4, but I believe that is serious sandbagging. But still, for being a category disruptor, 6x sales seems fairly reasonable.The company is surely not without risks though. Nutanix is up against some deep-pocketed companies like VMware (NYSE:VMW) and DellEMC. Dell has even been shown to be taking market share. However, I suspect that Nutanix’s move to software-only sales has something to do with the discrepancy.Another risk is the unintended consequences of Nutanix’s shift in business model. Foundational relationships with OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) could sour if Nutanix’s move to software takes away business. Worded another way, since Nutanix has stopped selling hardware, those hardware providers that it was using could lose business and thereby start squeezing Nutanix. But Mr. Pandey, Nutanix’s CEO made a comment on this point:All in all, Nutanix’s move to software provides customers with the flexibility to choose OEMs. The best OEMs will win out so they shouldn’t resort to blaming Nutanix for lost business.Nutanix’s cloud operating system is solving the problems of the modern data center and it has the financials to back it up. Overall adaptability, narrowing losses, cash production, and customer fanaticism are all strong signals Nutanix is far from slowing down as an investment. This hyper-converged player is one to watch out for as businesses utilize hybrid data centers.Author’s Note: Just hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button to get these articles before they hit the paywall.

After trading down 7.4% post-earnings, this provides investors a great opportunity to take advantage of an undervalued name, as their transition to a software-only model remains on schedule.Total revenue increased 47% for the year and 49% for Q4, both of which are significant feats for a company that just surpassed $1 billion in TTM revenue. With gross margins approaching 80%, NTNX is poised to re-rate close to pure-play software companies, which typically trade at forward revenue multiples of 7-10x.NTNX data by YChartsAs NTNX phases out their pass-through hardware sales, they will begin to focus solely on their software business, which generates higher margins and has much greater visibility into future revenues. NTNX announced this transition in Q1 and I previously wrote an article going through this transition and how NTNX should now be valued. The recent post-earnings pullback provides a great opportunity for investors to build and increase their holdings in the leading HCI player.During Q4, NTNX grew their software and support billings by 66%, which slightly decelerated from 67% in Q3. Investors should expect slight deceleration from a $1 billion+ revenue company growing billings at this rate. However, the mere 1 percentage point deceleration is an impressive feat in itself.Total software and support revenue increased 49% for the quarter, and 47% for F18. Software revenue reached ~$900 million for F18 and with growth still near 50%, this is one of the fastest software companies out there. Management’s commitment to their software-only approach will cause increased investments in order to grow their market share.Rather than focusing on profitability, management talks about their placement in the Rule of 40, that is revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin. Companies who grow their revenues at this high of a rate will inevitably decelerate their growth rate as they strive to become profitable. The Rule of 40 suggests that as a company matures and begins to focus on profitability, the summation of revenue growth and free cash flow margin above 40 signifies a strong company. NTNX reported a Rule of 40 value of 51 for the year, placing them at the high end of the software company spectrum.Source: Company PresentationGross margins remained very healthy at 78% and I would assume these margins will continue to expand towards 80%, especially as the company generates more software revenue, which has higher margins.As the company sheds their lower margin, slower growth hardware sales, investors should expect higher gross margins. The one caveat with this, which was somewhat seen this past quarter, is that the quicker NTNX gets rid of their hardware sales, their revenue growth will be artificially lower. Since they would no longer record their hardware sales, their top line might take a slight hit to the growth figure. However, this means gross margins would come in higher than expected.Billings are a great proxy for the company’s transition to software revenue. The more software billings the company generates, the more future revenue will come from software sales. The below chart is a great depiction of the company’s transformation over the years and as you can see, F19 shows a very low percentage of billings coming from hardware sales. In essence, by the end of F19, the company will have minimal hardware sales left to get rid of. Because of this transition and management’s strong commitment, I firmly believe NTNX should be valued as a software-only company.Source: Company PresentationNTNX’s customer cohort is also a big driver of their future growth. Traditionally, they have focused on the enterprise-market leaving the middle market companies largely untouched. However, NTNX has placed a lot more emphasis on the middle market and has initiated several internal sales programs to place more emphasis on this large market opportunity.At the end of Q4, NTNX had over 10,600 customers, with 710 of the Global 2,000 customers in their wallet. Growing the middle market cohort will give NTNX a great opportunity to become the mainstream HCI name for companies of all sizes. In addition, NTNX experiences significant revenue growth from existing customers. This is demonstrated by customers who have been with NTNX for more than 18 months on average spend 4.1x their initial purchase.Source: Company PresentationThis is significant in that as NTNX grows their customer base both into enterprises and middle market, over time, these cohorts will provide solid streams of revenue growth. This past quarter, NTNX signed one of their largest deals ever, a $20 million deal, with 40% of the deal’s value being recognized as revenue for the quarter.Management has strongly committed to their transition to software-only revenue and with the impressive combination of top line growth and gross margins, NTNX deserves to be traded as a software-only company with a premium multiple.Software and support revenue was ~$900 million in F18, growing at 47%. This demonstrates one of the fastest revenue growth rates in the market for a company at this scale. For Q1, management expects another strong quarter of revenue growth with total revenue between $295-310 million, which implies software and support revenue growth of 40-45% y/y. In addition, management expects 94-95% of total billings to come from software, a slight increase compared to Q3’s guidance.In order to properly value NTNX, I looked at a variety of fast-growth software companies who trade at premium revenue multiples compared to the greater market. The list of peers include: New Relic (NEWR), ServiceNow (NOW), Proofpoint (PFPT), Red Hat (RHT), Splunk (SPLK), Atlassian (TEAM), and Workday (WDAY). All of the peers are considered leaders in their respective industries, hosting both strong revenue growth rates and consistently high gross margins.NTNX EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsTo be conservative regarding NTNX, I used F18’s software and support revenue of ~$900 million and assumed a rather significant deceleration (given management’s Q1 guidance for 40-45% growth) of 35%. This results in a conservative software revenue of $1.215 billion for F19.With a current market cap of $9.66 billion and net cash of ~$500 million, this gives NTNX an enterprise value of $9.11 billion. Using my conservative $1.215 billion software only revenue in F19, NTNX currently trades at a 7.5x conservative forward revenue multiple. This compares to the peer group average of 11.5x.Assuming NTNX trades at the peer group average multiple of 11.5x, this would imply an enterprise value of ~$14 billion. Backing out net cash of ~$500 million, this would also imply a market cap of ~$13.5 billion. With 171.2 million shares outstanding, this would imply a target price of $79 representing a 40% upside from Friday’s closing price of $56.32.A more bullish case can be demonstrated by assuming NTNX’s software revenues grow by 40%, which would still imply a 7 percentage point deceleration and would be at the low end of management’s guidance for Q1 (which has historically been a seasonally slower quarter). At a 40% software revenue growth, this gives us F19 software revenue of $1.26 billion, representing a 7.2x forward revenue multiple.Assuming this multiple slightly expands to 8.0x over the next 12 months, this would give us a target price of $62, representing a 10% upside from Friday’s closing price of $56.32. Again, these are all very conservative multiples given NTNX’s software transition, high gross margins, large TAM opportunity, and premium valuations given to peers (but not yet received by NTNX).Risks to NTNX include a slower than expected transition to software-only sales, though would have a slight benefit to revenue growth, and would negatively impact gross margins. The emergence of more competitors would also hamper NTNX’s growth."

The company has only been public since 2016, but has formed a strong base formation which it is now breaking higher out of.On its shorter-term charts, its recent consolidation is giving way to buying support. From late 2017, to late last week, the company's share price had held below $38.5. Today's breakout however, was significant, with investors pushing the stock nearly 8% higher on the day. Strong fundamental support is backing the move higher, which gives me confidence in adding a long stock position. I am using a stop-loss point of $37.5 should investor sentiment wane, leading to selling pressure.Source: Trading ViewNTNX is seeing improved investor optimism as it grows at a strong pace, while also investing in innovative new technologies and acquisitions. In the most recent quarter, the company saw strong deal momentum. Specifically, their move towards a software-defined business model has helped them accelerate their large deal flow.The company provides an enterprise cloud operating system in North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. Its cloud operating system converges traditional silos of server, virtualization, storage, and networking into one integrated solution; and unifies private and public cloud into a single software fabric.In the previous quarter, NTNX secured 57 deals worth more than $1 million, up 104% year-over-year, according to management. They also had 19 software and support deals worth more than $1 million. The company now has 57 customers with over $5 million in lifetime bookings, 18 customers with over $10 million in lifetime bookings, and 10 customers with more than $15 million in lifetime bookings, up significantly from the previous quarter, according to management. The growth of new customers and support of previous ones signals NTNX is offering a competitive product, with marketplace demand evident.Additionally, last month, Gartner published its Magic Quadrant for Hyperconverged Infrastructure. NTNX's position in the matrix indicated the analyst's belief in its completeness of vision access and highest on the ability to execute, a testament to the company's product quality, customer service and end-user delight, management stated.Software-defined infrastructure is gaining ground in enterprise, which marks an inflection point for hyperconvergence of disparate data center tiers on a common operating system in the private cloud, according to Gartner.In coming years, NTNX intends to push forward with hyper-converging disparate cloud data centers using a common software platform that they call Enterprise Cloud OS. Enterprises have already started to migrate toward application mobility. This push to hyperconvergence leads NTNX to expand their ecosystem, while also offering more solutions for new and current customers.Moreover, the company recently signed a definitive agreement to acquire a company called Minjar. Minjar is the maker of Botmetric, a service built for the AWS marketplace, providing customers with unified cost control and enhanced operational insights into their workloads running in public clouds.NTNX expects Botmetric will enable its customers to embrace multi-cloud architectures, giving cloud operators the freedom to choose the best environment for their business applications in data. In addition to Botmetric, Minjar also offers SmartAssist Assurance for customers to adopt public cloud services in a hassle-free manner and Minjar managed cloud service, which significantly offloads customers from public cloud management and operational minutia. Minjar offers a lot of potential and as was said earlier, expands NTNX's overall product solutions in an environment of strong demand for its current offerings.Below is a chart of NTNX's revenue and earnings per share metrics. Over the last few years, the company has grown revenue at a rapid pace, while earnings per share is limiting losses. The company remains a speculative venture, but is exploring exciting technologies, leading investors to bid its shares higher.NTNX is trending strongly higher on solid fundamental support. The stock recently broke out to near record levels after months of consolidation. NTNX is showing strong top-line growth, while its also attempts to reverse its earnings per share losses. Additionally, the company continues to invest in acquisitions, and push along its innovative product solutions to drive future growth. I am buying stock in the name with a stop-loss point below previous resistance levels."
4153049,103480,2018-03-04T12:05:46-05:00,"Nutanix reported a blowout Q2, with revenues growing 44% y/y despite the elimination of $14 million (6%) of hardware revenues.The company's shift to becoming a pure software play (and thus a much higher-margin business) is continuing.Gartner released its first-ever Magic Quadrant for Hyperconverged Infrastructure, not only validating Nutanix's space but naming it as the utmost Leader.Billings grew 57% y/y and free cash flow grew >4x despite GAAP losses.","Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX), the world's premier vendor of hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) technology, has always been known for its crazy high growth rates that always defied analyst expectations. The company's Q2 results were no exception, sending shares up 7% and boosting the company from a recovery that had once taken it down all the way to the teens.NTNX data by YChartsIt really wasn't long ago - in fact, less than a year (see chart above) that Nutanix was still in the doldrums. Back then, investors and Wall Street had questioned Nutanix's ability to continue growing, as well as its steep net losses. In addition, Nutanix was seen as more of a commodity hardware play, with much lower gross margins than other companies in its software peer group.Then suddenly, perceptions of Nutanix changed. The company was also more direct in communicating its strategy of pivoting to becoming a purer software play, accelerating gains in the stock (software companies, after all, carry higher margins and thus higher multiples of revenue for their stock). Also a huge plus was the fact that the company started showing, if not GAAP net income, then at least huge growth in cash flows that made investors at least feel secure that Nutanix wasn't burning its cash all the way into bankruptcy anytime soon.As evidenced by the trends seen this quarter and huge tailwinds to Nutanix's business, this is a company to remain long on.One key piece in the bullish story that was discussed on Nutanix's earnings call was the fact that Gartner, the leading IT industry analyst, published its first-ever Magic Quadrant for Hyperconverged Infrastructures in February. For the unfamiliar, I think of the Gartner rankings as somewhat akin to the Grammys of the software industry. Securing a spot in the Leaders quadrant (indicating the highest ""ability to execute"" and the highest ""completeness of vision"", the two axes on the quadrant) is a badge of honor that carries a lot of weight with IT buyers.Nutanix had been a Gartner favorite before, starring in its prior Magic Quadrant for ""Integrated Systems."" But never before had HCI had its own quadrant, signifying its growth and potential as a space. Not only was this a huge validation of Nutanix's industry, but Gartner also crowned Nutanix as the top-ranking player in the space, the leader of all the Leaders in the quadrant (the other Leaders being Dell-EMC, VMware (NASDAQ: VMW), and HP Enterprise (NYSE: HPE). Dell-EMC owns 82% of VMware and the companies have more or less combined their offerings; Michael Dell is currently exploring a combination of the two into an integrated company).Further augmenting the bullish narrative: HCI technology isn't brand new, but it hasn't yet been widely deployed. There are plenty of greenfield opportunities for Nutanix to sell into as it proselytizes its space (which should be much easier with Gartner's distinction). Intuitively, this makes sense. While the proliferation of the public cloud has probably been the defining computing trend of the decade, it's not suitable for every workload - in particular, sensitive workloads with secure information. Companies like Nutanix which offer a cloud-like alternative, but in a local data center (the so-called ""hybrid cloud"") stand to benefit from the cloud's tailwinds as well. In retrospect, it seems silly that investors sold off Nutanix last year on fears that Amazon AWS (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ: MSFT) would drive Nutanix out of business with their popular public cloud offerings. They're wrong: these public cloud offerings cater to an entirely different market with different workloads anyway.Unlike in previous quarters, where Nutanix's stellar growth was helped by its hardware sales - which helped the top line, but weren't proprietary and didn't contribute much to margins - software sales shone in Q2, as the company continues to move away from its hardware business. Nutanix reported blistering 44% y/y revenue growth to $286.7 million, putting the company at a vaunted $1 billion revenue run rate - a scale very few tech startups ever reach.Nutanix's top line also bested analyst estimates of $283.2 million (+42% y/y). Had the company included pass-through hardware revenues in the top line, management noted that revenues would have been $14 million higher - increasing the optical quality of Nutanix's results. See the company's full results below:Figure 1. Nutanix Q2 earningsSource: Nutanix investor relationsThere's also a good reason for distancing Nutanix away from hardware - once Nutanix can tout itself as more of a ""platform"" solution that can be hardware-agnostic (it already is today, for the most part), it can achieve the same kind of ballooning effect that Microsoft had with Windows in the 80s. Nutanix essentially invented the HCI market; like Microsoft, it means to dominate it by farming out its software to OEMs and bringing in every buyer possible without limiting its compatibility to a single server maker. The fact that Nutanix is still managing to beat results and sustain >40% growth while undergoing a revenue-impacting transition is truly impressive.Even better than the revenue achievements: with a huge boost to deferred revenues (representing Nutanix's ""backlog"" of revenues to be recognized in future quarters), Nutanix grew billings by a monstrous 57% y/y, setting the company up for strong revenue performance over the next twelve months. The company also noted it had the highest quarter ever for new customer adds, adding 1,057 customers to a pool of 8,870 total customers.Figure 2. Nutanix Q2 billingsSource: Nutanix investor relationsNote that while Nutanix does have a wide customer pool, it does skew toward large enterprise clients who have multi-million, annual recurring buys (like Toyota (NYSE: TM), a featured client in Nutanix case studies). On a related note, the company also reported 57 deals over $1 million in the quarter.Nutanix also outperformed nicely on the bottom line, driven by efficiencies in R&D and general overhead spending - both of which remained relatively flat y/y despite the growth in revenues. Sales and marketing expenses continued to grow as the company fleshes out its sales force (which, as noted in Q&A on the call, went to a software-only quota basis beginning in February), but still declined by a few percentage points of revenue, contributing to margin improvement. Overall, Nutanix shrunk its GAAP net losses to -$59.9 million in the quarter, a -21% operating margin versus -38% in last year's Q2.Nutanix's pro forma EPS result of -$0.14 also beat analyst expectations of -$0.20, and given a continuation of the growth and margin improvement trends seen this quarter, it's possible to see a breakeven quarter for Nutanix (at least on a pro forma basis) some time in the calendar year.The last major highlight in the quarter was free cash flow, which grew more than 4x to $32.4 million, representing a fairly high 11% FCF margin - at least, high for a company still growing this fast. With a continued transition toward high-margin software sales, Nutanix's FCF should continue to see robust expansion.Figure 3. Nutanix Q2 FCFThe weather forecast for Nutanix looks like clear skies ahead. Nutanix is on top of the world right now, with strong results despite revenue headwind from the hardware transition, and a validation of HCI from Gartner giving it a huge expected sales boost.The company's strong billings in the quarter, exceeding revenue growth by more than 10%, also helps to justify a Q3 guidance forecast ($275-$280 million) that beat Wall Street's estimates by more than $10 million at the midpoint. While the company has seen choppy and volatile trading in the past, the fundamental direction for the company is up - and seeing as the company has only barely returned to the all-time highs it achieved immediately after its 2016 IPO, Nutanix still has a lot of room left to run."
4156302,101421,2018-03-14T12:50:05-04:00,Nutanix has agreed to acquire Netsil for all-stock consideration.Netsil enables enterprises to better visualize and monitor their application performance.NTNX is acquiring Netsil to beef up its multi-cloud monitoring and response capabilities as enterprises developing increasingly complex cloud environments.,"Nutanix (NTNX) has announced an agreement to acquire Netsil for as much as $74 million in stock.Netsil has developed application operations center software that helps IT groups to monitor and visualize their applications for better app management.NTNX is acquiring Netsil as a response to more complex, multi-cloud application environments being developed by enterprises.San Francisco-based Netsil was found in 2016 to improve observability and monitoring capabilities for cloud-based applications in the enterprise.Management is headed by co-founder and CEO Harjot Gill, who was previously a software engineer at Alcatel-Lucent.Below is an overview video of Netsil's system:(Source: Netsil)Netsil's primary offering is its Applications Operations Center [AOC], which enables DevOps teams to obtain better visibility into services and dependencies to isolate problems more quickly.Response times are reduced, resulting in increased application uptime and meeting service level objectives.Netsil's investors funded approximately $5.7 million and included Mayfield Fund, Moment Ventures, Engineering Capital, and others.The Netsil application visibility solution is part of a much larger Application Management Services market.According to a 2017 market research report by Grand View Research, the global application management service market was $53 billion in 2015 and is expected to grow dramatically as enterprises continue their transition to the cloud.The chart below provides some idea of the growth prospects in this space:The main drivers for this expected growth include:Nutanix disclosed the acquisition price and terms in an 8-K but did not disclose a change in financial guidance.Nutanix is paying 'between 85% and 100% of the consideration will be payable in shares of the Company's Class A common stock, depending on the accredited investor status of Netsil's equity holders. As a result, upon consummation of the acquisition, the Company expects to issue at least 1,210,662 and up to approximately 1,424,308 shares of the Company's Class A common stock, subject to certain customary adjustments, in exchange for all of the capital stock, warrants and other vested rights to acquire or receive capital stock of Netsil, including vested stock options of Netsil.'Nutanix is acquiring Netsil to improve its offerings in the multi-cloud monitoring and management segment.As Nutanix said stated in the deal announcement:Nutanix' stock has risen on the announcement as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)The deal was announced on March 12 and the stock has increased approximately 6.7% since the announcement, so investors appear to like the deal.The addition of Netsil to Nutanix' Enterprise Cloud OS will take some time, so investors won't see the results in Nutanix' financials for some time.Nevertheless, the acquisition is part of a broader effort by Nutanix to respond to changing demands by enterprises as the complexity of application monitoring continues to grow."
4190355,104099,2018-07-26T08:02:17-04:00,"The shares of Nutanix Inc. are up massively over the past year. I think investors would be wise to take profits at these levels.I go through my reasoning by looking at the financials and recent insider selling activity.While I don't like the stock at these levels, I don't think the crowd that drove it higher will catch sanity anytime soon.For those people who insist on staying long, calls offer much of the upside at far less risk. I offer my favorite call option.","Over the past twelve months, the shares of Nutanix Inc. (NASDAQ:NTNX) are up about 135%, though as I write this, shares are down ~5% on the day. That is certainly an impressive return over a year, and a strong indication of the volatility in the name. In my view, investors would be wise to take the money and run at this point. The shares may continue to rally from these levels, but with each dollar uptick, the risk also rises. I’ll go through my reasoning by unpacking the financial history here, and by looking at the stock itself.I’ll also review some insider activity that I find somewhat alarming. I’ll conclude with a suggestion for investors who may not want to abandon the name completely. For those people who want to participate in any further crowd driven upside, call options are a reasonable way forward in my view. They offer much of the upside and far less of the downside associated with share ownership at this company’s valuation, so I’ll offer my favorite among these.For those who may not be familiar with it, Nutanix specializes in Hyperconverged infrastructure. The company helps eliminate the silo effects of local data storage, by moving relevant data assets to the cloud, while keeping some data elements local. The Nutanix solution suite enables IT teams to build and operate multi-cloud architectures, ranging from the private to public to private cloud assets, that they control locally.In short, the company allows IT departments to experience the benefits of keeping some data in house while moving other data to the cloud. This flexibility is quite powerful and is why the company has generated massive sales gains over the past five years.The market obviously rewards revenue growth, because Nutanix has delivered that in spades over the past several years. Since 2013, revenue has grown at a CAGR of just over 90% (!). The problem is that as revenue has expanded, so too has the net loss, which is up at a CAGR of about 59%. In fact, when I ran a correlation between revenue and net income over the past 5 ¾ years, I found a very strong (r=-.81) negative correlation between revenue and income. It seems that the more they sell, the wider the loss. This prompts the question, if rising sales won’t generate profits, what exactly will?Loss per share looks better (having ballooned at a CAGR of “only” 21%) for the perverse reason that the massive dilution we’ve seen since 2013 has reduced the rate of EPS loss. The number of shares outstanding has grown at a CAGR of about 32%. In sum, the company has generated revenue, but most of this revenue has been plowed back into sales and marketing (up at a CAGR of 79%), R&D (up at a CAGR of 77%), and G&A (up at a CAGR of about 74%). The result of this is that losses have continued to mount, and a greater percentage of the company’s operations have been funded by dilution. How is any of this good for shareholders?On the bright side, results for the first three quarters of 2018 are much better than the same period in 2017, largely because of the switch to software only. Sales are up by 44%, and the net loss is fully 33% less. Thus, bulls may be forgiven for assuming that the company is on the verge of profitability.Source: Company filingsAs I’ve said repeatedly, and no doubt tiresomely, it’s all well and good to find a great company, but just as important is the valuation. A wonderful business can be a terrible investment if the stock is overpriced. For that reason, I need to spill some virtual ink talking about the stock itself. When I try to determine whether a stock is overpriced, I unpack the market’s current assumptions about a given business. In addition, I look at the price per share relative to the cash flow per share. It’s fair to say that on both metrics, the valuation here is something only a tech investor could love.In order to unpack what the market assumes about the future of the business, I turn to the work produced by Professor Stephen Penman in his excellent book “Accounting for Value.” Penman describes how an investor can use the stock price itself as a variable in a standard finance formula to work out what the market must believe about future growth.At the moment, the market is forecasting a perpetual growth rate of about 13% for this business, which is extraordinarily optimistic in my view. This is especially strange in light of the fact that the analyst community, never a despondent group, continues to forecast losses for this company for the foreseeable future.Switching to a more standard measure of valuation, the price to free cash flow is, to quote a Nutanix investor, “epic.”Source: GurufocusThe shares are currently changing hands around 520 times free cash flow. I’m calling on the entirety of my Irish gift for understatement when I suggest that this valuation is objectively excessive.I don’t begrudge any insider the right to diversify their personal holdings and sell shares in a given company. Selling stock in the company you work for only makes sense in order to minimize the risk in your entire financial life. That said, when I see the excessive insider selling activity at a company like Nutanix, I take note. Over the past five months, the President has unloaded fully 200,000 shares for a little over $10.6 million (thankfully, through the magic of tech company math, he has maintained his share count throughout).In addition, the CFO sold 300,000 shares in June for ~$16.2 million. This sale struck me as interesting because it took his stake from 409,020 shares to 109,020 shares (a 73% reduction). All in, insiders have sold just under 754,000 shares over the past five months.This prompts a question: If the people who know this company best, including the CFO, aren’t comfortable keeping a material amount of their personal capital invested, why should outsiders?A central premise of my investing philosophy is that price and value can become unmoored for extended periods of time. Obviously I think shares of Nutanix are overpriced, but I think investors in that company should consider switching to options for reasons other than the valuation alone. I think the overall market may take all companies lower over the next year, whether they are undervalued or overvalued.It’s also highly probable that the crowd won’t catch mass sanity anytime soon, and so the shares may continue to rally based on narratives about “cloud” and sales growth. In such an environment, it behooves investors, who should always be worried about risk, to consider call options as proxies for their shares. I think this is a viable strategy for people even for companies they happen to like.If I were a speculator in Nutanix, I would sell my shares and buy the January calls with a strike price of $60. At the moment, these are being bid-ask at $4.80 to $5.30. Although this is fairly expensive, the premium representing fully 10% of the total capital for only six months, I think being exposed via calls is superior to being exposed to the shares for a few reasons. First, there is no lost dividend income, so the opportunity cost is zero.Second, an investor can take fully 90% of their capital off the table, making the trade by definition a lower risk strategy. Third, if the shares rally from here, most of the upside will be captured. If the overall market swoons and takes these shares down, far less capital is exposed.I think there are a host of reasons to avoid Nutanix at these levels. In spite of ever-growing revenue, the company seems perpetually light on earnings, which is the basis of all sustainable shareholder returns. In addition, the shares are very expensive relative to the cash flows here, suggesting more downside than upside.Also, the people who know this company best, have been net sellers for the past five months. For these reasons, I would avoid the shares. For those people who insist on staying long, I think a much safer bet would be to switch to calls. Price and value inevitably meet. When price falls to meet value here, owning calls will be the least painful option."

Risk of losing market share, when coupled with highly negative margins, unsustainable cash burn, and a soaring stock price mean Nutanix Inc. (NTNX) is this week's Danger Zone pick.Since fiscal 2015, NTNX's revenue has grown an impressive 78% compounded annually. At the same time, NTNX's after-tax profit (NOPAT) has fallen from -$117 million to -$421 million, per Figure 1. The rapid deterioration in NOPAT comes from negative and declining margins. The company's NOPAT margin fell from -48% in fiscal 2015 to -55% in fiscal 2017. Declining margins and inefficient capital use have dropped NTNX's return on invested capital (ROIC) down from -65% in fiscal 2015 to -135%.Figure 1: NTNX's Revenue & NOPAT Since 2015Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsWe've previously warned of the limited and hidden disclosure red flags in IPOs, particularly with ""emerging growth companies"" such as Nutanix. These limited disclosures extend beyond the IPO date and allow firms to avoid disclosure of key executive compensation information.Rather than provide specific and detailed metrics for performance bonuses and stock awards, NTNX provides a long list of metrics that could be used. Some of the metrics include attainment of research & development milestones, billings, earnings (which can include any calculation of earnings), growth in ""stockholder value"", new product invention, revenue, and individual objectives such as peer reviews. Why not be more transparent?While we cannot determine the exact metrics, we do not see ROIC or economic earnings, and we do see that execs receive bonuses despite destroying shareholder value. In fiscal 2016 and 2017, the three named executives in Nutanix's proxy statement received upwards of $13 million in option and stock awards and $770,000 in bonuses under the executive bonus plan. Over this time, economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, fell from -$184 million to -$458 million.We've demonstrated through numerous case studies that ROIC, not revenue, EBIT, or individual objectives, is the primary driver of shareholder value creation. A recent white paper published by Ernst & Young also validates the importance of ROIC (see here: Getting ROIC Right) and the superiority of our data analytics. Without greater disclosures and changes to this compensation plan (e.g. emphasizing ROIC), investors should expect further value destruction.Nutanix is yet another new technology firm that uses a multitude of non-GAAP metrics, such as non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP free cash flow, and non-GAAP net income to present adjusted metrics that distract from the true economics of the business. Our research digs deeper so our clients see through these misleading financial metrics. Below are some of the items Nutanix removes for its non-GAAP net income:These adjustments have a large impact on the disparity between GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, and economic earnings. In fiscal 2016, NTNX removed $20 million (4% of 2016 revenue) in stock-based compensation expense. In fiscal 2017, the company removed $231 million (30% of revenue) in stock-based compensation expense to calculate non-GAAP net income. Combined with other adjustments, NTNX reported fiscal 2017 non-GAAP net income of -$199 million. Per Figure 2, GAAP net income and economic earnings were -$458 million and declining at a much faster pace than non-GAAP net income.Figure 2: NTNX's Non-GAAP Metrics Minimize Declining Economic EarningsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsNutanix provides enterprise cloud software that combines traditional servers, virtualization, and networking hardware/software into one integrated solution, also known as hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI). This market, along with the larger enterprise software market, is highly competitive. Nutanix's main competitors include VMware (VMW), Cisco (CSCO), Dell/EMC, Red Hat (RHT), NetApp (NTAP), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), as well as public cloud providers Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL).Despite ranking at or near the top in market share (market share is debated based on OEM hardware vs. software), Nutanix's ROIC and NOPAT margin rank well below all competitors.Figure 3: Nutanix's NOPAT Margin Ranks Bottom of CompetitionSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsBeyond profit margins, Nutanix lacks the capital and the operational flexibility of its competition. Per Figure 4, Nutanix ranks near the bottom in regards to free cash flow, and dead last in terms of excess cash. While MSFT and AMZN have negative free cash flow, they also have loads of excess cash to support the business.In a market characterized by rapid innovation and new technology, the ability to invest capital into product development can be the difference between having the best product offering and being left behind. Most alarming, and most detrimental to shareholders, is the fact that Nutanix cannot continue its cash burn much longer. Without the recently announced debt offering, Nutanix's cash on the books would have supported the 2017 cash burn rate for just over six months. If cash burn continues at such a rapid pace, investors shouldn't be surprised to see another debt offering and/or a shareholder dilution to raise additional capital in the next 18 months.Figure 4: Nutanix Lacks Capital Resources to Compete Long-TermSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsNutanix bulls will point to the firm's growing market share and rapid revenue growth as reason to invest in the company. Many will also argue that with just a few cost controls/cuts, Nutanix could be a profitable firm. Each of these viewpoints not only ignores changes in the competitive landscape but also the fact that revenue growth is slowing and projected to slow further, while costs continue to soar.It's important to note that market share can be difficult to track in the HCI market, as software can be installed on another firm's hardware. To shed more light on this important topic, Aaron Rakers, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo, analyzed the IDC data not freely available to the public to provide more accurate market share values. His analysis provided key takeaways that could impact NTNX's future:This detailed market share analysis reveals that, while Nutanix is the market leader, Dell, because of its ownership of VMware, holds the majority of power in the industry.When Dell, EMC, and VMware market shares are combined, and hardware running NTNX software is excluded, they control 49% of the HCI market. More troubling for NTNX bulls, since Dell bought VMware in 2016, VMware's market share has increased at a much faster pace than Nutanix.With a controlling (and financial) interest in VMware, Dell could limit Nutanix's growth potential by promoting its own VMware product in favor of Nutanix's software. Such a decision would instantly impact NTNX's top-line, as Dell accounted for 10% of NTNX billings in fiscal 2016 and 2017. More importantly, Dell could inhibit NTNX's potential market share, which, when excluding Dell hardware, was just 21% in 2017, down from 22% in 2016.Market share risk aside, Nutanix is seeing revenue growth slow despite spending heavily to enhance and promote its products. In fiscal 2017, revenue grew 72% year-over-year (YoY), which is down from 84% YoY in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2018 revenue is expected to grow 45% YoY. Given the strength of its competition and market share threats, Nutanix is not in a position to cut costs and become profitable in the near future.Per Figure 5, Nutanix's research & development, general & administrative, and sales & marketing costs grew 98%, 80%, and 76% compounded annually from fiscal 2015-2017. Cost of revenue grew 80% compounded annually while revenue grew 78% compounded annually over the same time. Worse yet, Nutanix's operating costs make up an increasingly larger percentage of revenue. In fiscal 2017, operating expenses were 113% of revenue, which is up from 107% of revenue in 2015.Figure 5: NTNX's Operating Expenses Growing Faster Than RevenueSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsWhatever you think about market share risk and costs growing faster than revenue, it's hard to stomach Nutanix's valuation. The expectations baked into NTNX's price imply that Nutanix will immediately achieve profitability and increase its market share to nearly 100%. Details below.NTNX shares are up over 110% since their May 2017 lows while the S&P is up 18%. This rapid price appreciation has pushed NTNX to a level where the expectations baked into the stock price are not rooted in reality.To justify its current price of $32/share, NTNX must immediately achieve NOPAT margins of 10% (slightly below the competitors' average, which is boosted by other business lines) and grow revenue by 27% compounded annually for the next 12 years. Keep in mind, NTNX's current NOPAT margin is -55%.In this scenario, Nutanix generates nearly $13 billion in revenue 12 years from now. For reference, Grand View Research, a business intelligence market research provider, projects the entire HCI market will be $14 billion in 2024. So, the current valuation of NTNX implies it will have nearly 100% market share. This scenario also seems unlikely given that analysts estimate NTNX will grow revenue 15% in 2019, well below the 27% compounded annual rate assumed over a dozen years in this scenario.Even if we assume NTNX can achieve a 10% NOPAT margin and grow revenue by 20% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is worth only $15/share today - a 53% downside. This scenario assumes revenue grows at consensus estimates for the next five years and 14% each year thereafter. Each of these scenarios also assumes NTNX is able to grow revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create best-case scenarios that demonstrate how high expectations embedded in the current valuation are. For reference, NTNX's invested capital has grown on average $112 million (15% of 2017 revenue) over the past two years.The largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call ""stupid money risk"", which means an acquirer comes in and pays for NTNX at the current, or higher, share price despite the stock being overvalued. An acquisition could come from a larger tech firm looking to immediately expand its footprint in the HCI market. However, these firms would be better suited to develop their own software and out compete NTNX rather than imprudently allocate capital and destroy substantial shareholder value in an acquisition.We show below how expensive NTNX remains even after assuming an acquirer can achieve significant synergies.To begin, Nutanix has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, NTNX is worth less than its current share price.Figures 6 and 7 shows what we think Cisco should pay for NTNX to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. In December 2017, CSCO ranked third in terms of market share in the HCI market, with NTNX having three times as large a share of the market. Acquiring NTNX would immediately boost CSCO's presence in the HCI market and enable it to grow its software business while diversifying away from its legacy hardware business. However, there are limits on how much CSCO would pay for NTNX to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows (or lack thereof) being acquired.Each implied price is based on a 'goal ROIC' assuming different levels of revenue growth. In both scenarios, the estimated revenue growth rate is 45% in year one and 15% in year two, which is the consensus estimate of NTNX's revenue growth for the next two years. For the subsequent years, we use 15% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of next year's expectations. We use 20% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with CSCO would create additional revenue opportunities through increased exposure to Cisco's enterprise clients.We conservatively assume that CSCO can grow NTNX's revenue and NOPAT without spending anything on working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also assume NTNX immediately achieves a 14% NOPAT margin, which is the average of competitors in Figure 3. For reference, NTNX's TTM NOPAT margin is -55%, so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best-case scenario.Figure 6: Implied Acquisition Prices for CSCO to Achieve 6% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 6 shows the 'goal ROIC' for CSCO as its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or 6%. Even if NTNX can grow revenue by 23% compounded annually with a 14% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is worth less than its current price of $32/share. It's worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 6% ROIC would only be value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal CSCO's WACC.Figure 7: Implied Acquisition Prices for CSCO to Achieve 15% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 7 shows the next 'goal ROIC' of 15%, which is CSCO's current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to CSCO shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most CSCO should pay for NTNX is $10/share (70% downside to current valuation). Even assuming this best-case scenario, CSCO would destroy over $4 billion by purchasing NTNX at its current valuation. Any scenario assuming less than 23% compound annual growth in revenue would result in further capital destruction for CSCO.After IPO in September 2016, NTNX has met or beat top and bottom line expectations for five consecutive quarters. Earnings expectations have fluctuated wildly during this time. Consensus expectations for fiscal 2017 EPS ranged anywhere from -$1.38/share to -$1.49/share throughout calendar 2017. Similarly, expectations for fiscal 2018 have jumped from -$1.35/share to -$0.74/share over the past 12 months.Company guidance has had more of a negative impact on the stock price than earnings beats. Despite beating top and bottom line expectations, NTNX provided below expected outlook in fiscal 2Q17 and the stock fell 26% in one day. In total, NTNX fell 53% in the two months following the earnings release.Given the heightened competition and growing market share of firms like VMware and Dell/EMC, another disappointing guidance or earnings miss could be near. Should such a miss occur, shares could see a fall similar to fiscal 2Q17. While we don't attempt to predict exactly when the market will recognize the disconnect between expectations and reality, the ensuing share collapse could hurt investors' portfolios.Over the past 12 months, 55.5 million insider shares have been purchased and 52.7 million have been sold for a net effect of 2.8 million insider shares purchased. These sales represent 2% of shares outstanding.Short interest is currently 7.9 million shares, which equates to 5% of shares outstanding and 2.8 days to cover. Short interest has grown nearly 48% since February 2017, which would seem to imply we're not the only ones who recognize the issues facing NTNX and its lofty valuation.Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform forensic accounting with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill fiduciary duties. In order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and an accurate shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to Nutanix's 2017 10-K:Income Statement: we made $37 million of adjustments, with a net effect of removing $37 million in non-operating expense (5% of revenue). We made no non-operating income adjustments and $37 million in non-operating expenses. You can see all the adjustments made to NTNX's income statement here.Balance Sheet: we made $130 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $24 million. One of the largest adjustments was $52 million in off balance sheet operating leases. This adjustment represented 15% of reported net assets. You can see all the adjustments made to NTNX's balance sheet here.Valuation: we made $547 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $547 million. There were no adjustments that increased shareholder value. The largest adjustment to shareholder value was $495 million in outstanding employee stock options. This adjustment represents 10% of NTNX's market cap.The following funds receive our Unattractive-or-worse rating and allocate significantly to Nutanix Inc.This article originally published on February 5, 2018.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme.[1] Ernst & Young's recent white paper, ""Getting ROIC Right"", proves the superiority of our research and analytics."
4154165,98236,2018-03-07T12:03:41-05:00,"Nutanix reported the results of its fiscal Q2 late last week.Once again, the results were a blow-out and the company, on a basis adjusted for its software transition, raised guidance yet again.The company did not spend its opex budget-this will almost certainly reverse in the current quarter and going forward.The company's transition to an all-software model is ahead of schedule and appears to be proceeding seamlessly.As strong as reported results were, calculated bookings were stronger still, rising by almost 60% and creating strong operating cash flow during the quarter.","Nutanix (NTNX) reported the results of its second quarter late last week. Surprise! The results were another blowout. I will reprise some of the salient numbers below, but suffice it to say that once again, the company confounded skeptics, of whom there remain many, and continued to outgrow expectations and transform itself into a software-only revenue model without visible problems. Just about all of the metrics that investors study showed a company with accelerating growth that is becoming accepted as a true enterprise supplier by many of its customers. This was a quarter in which the company garnered its first $10 million transaction and closed 3 deals of greater than $5 million. That suggests that its transition to a vendor at an enterprise level, a subject that has been marked by some controversy, is moving along quite successfully. In addition, the company has still retained Dell as a nearly 10% customer. It must be terribly galling to the folks in Round Rock that their customers insist on using Nutanix software. And this was a quarter in which the company expanded its customer base by more than 1000 new name accounts, ending the period with almost 9,000 total customers.Whether or not this company is actually #1 in the HCI space depends on how one parses statistics. And as an investor, I am not sure how much it really matters-if the company continues to grow at rates above 50%, I will leave the debate on bragging rights to others. But it is hard to quarrel with the success the company continues to enjoy in what is the strongest segment of the IT hardware space. (Yes, I know this company is moving to sell only software, but I will retain traditional terminology for the sake of consistency and convenience.)Nutanix shares made a new high the other day, trading at $45. That brought the share price appreciation to about by 20% in the last 3 months, although prior to that the shares had been on a tear and they are up by 87% over the past year. Are they still worth buying? Simple answer-I think so. I don't expect the shares to rise 20% every quarter of course, and I doubt that they will rise another 87% in the coming year, but the company is growing fast enough to provide investors with a decent investment outlook. The HCI wave has years of growth ahead with the latest studies released in late January forecasting a CAGR of 42%. Nutanix is most likely to get more than its share of that growth and its moves to expand its footprint through strategic acquisitions will lead to even faster percentage top line growth.Analysts use many techniques to try to value hyper-growth names like this and most of them are inadequate because they insist on using a model that looks for a rapid reversion to the mean. But a couple of years of 40%+ growth can calm any concerns regarding valuation. (Sorry for the awful pun-CALM is an important Nutanix product.). And the transition to software margins and a concomitant level of valuation suggests that this name has much further to go regardless of analyst consensus price targets. There may be better ways to trade these shares and a better entry point-I will leave the tactics of establishing a position to readers-but in terms of a long-term growth name to own within the IT space, Nutanix continues to be one of my favorites and that is so even at its current share price.The company continues to track ahead of its forecasts when it comes to profitability. And it continues to say that this over-attainment relates to its inability to hire fast enough, with opex spending lagging planned levels. Clearly the company has to create infrastructure to insure its continued leadership in the HCI space and to successfully implement its land/expand strategy. The odds are that the company will grow opex more rapidly than in the recent past, although hiring the appropriate level of talent is likely to prove difficult. Regardless of the specifics, which cannot be readily gauged by outsiders on a quarterly basis, this company has a well-defined path to non-GAAP profitability, and one that should be realized sometime in the fiscal year 2019.Given the company's very strong bookings performance with growth reaching 57% and exceeding reported revenues by 24%, it isn't too surprising that the company generated a significant level of operating and free cashflow. The company was able to sell $575 million zero coupon convertible notes, and with its positive cash flow, it has increased its cash balance to about $920 million. The company announced that it was acquiring a company called Minjar, which has a Botmetric service that can be used to optimize the performance of a multi-cloud environment. At a high level, this is a strategic acquisition that enhances the company's theme of focus on the hybrid cloud. The company had previously bought Calm, now a part of the Nutanix offering, and PernixData. Minjar will be integrated into the Calm technology stack. All of these acquisitions are strategic, are not designed to produce financial accretion. The CEO suggested that there are more in the offing.The company raised guidance noticeably both in terms of revenues and in terms of decreasing the projected net loss. In terms of looking at guidance, it is simplest to look at dollar based gross margin comparisons which even out the effects of eliminating hardware revenue. Last year, the company reported non-GAAP gross margins of $112 million in its fiscal Q3. This year, it is projecting that non-GAAP gross margins will reach $190 million in the current fiscal Q3, based on its now current forecasts for $280 million in reported revenues and a non-GAAP gross margin projection of 68%. That is gross margin growth of 47% and represents a baseline in thinking about this company's expected performance. Given the 57% bookings growth last quarter, and the 104% increase in major deal flow, I would be surprised if the company did not continue to exceed its now current guidance.Using quotes from Shakespeare has become far less popular in this 2nd decade of the 21st century than was the case when I reached maturity. That's too bad, really, as so much of what Shakespeare wrote is timeless. When I consider Nutanix, I am most reminded of the passage that reads ""There is a tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves or lose our venture."" The quote comes from Shakespeare's play, ""Julius Caesar."" No, I don't think making a commitment to these shares is the equivalent of making a play to rule the known world or assassinate its ruler. Nor do I think the CEO of Nutanix, Dheeraj Pandey, has the importance of a Brutus in world history. But still, I do believe that the hyper-converged wave will remain an important investment theme for some years.As this is an article about Nutanix earnings, I will at least reprise the salient headline numbers. Revenues as reported rose by 44% to $287 million. Adjusted for the elimination of $14 million in hardware revenue, the top-line growth was 51%. The company is forecasting that its adjusted revenue growth this current quarter will be close to 70% after adding-back $45 million of revenues that will be eliminated as the company transitions to a software-only model. While that kind of a number may seem difficult to accept, it is likely a function of the strong increase in bookings that will translate into revenues in the current quarter.As mentioned, billings grew faster than revenues and reached $356 million up 57%. Software and support billings, which exclude hardware, actually grew by 60%. The book to revenue ratio was 1.24, noticeably above prior expectations. It is worth mentioning that the major partnerships that Nutanix has with large server providers were all operating at high levels last quarter. As mentioned, Dell was involved in almost 10% of bookings and included 3 large deals. Solutions including Lenovo hardware were up 80% sequentially. IBM (IBM) was involved in its first two deals with Nutanix while the Cisco (CSCO) UCS relationship continues to burgeon, with large deals in the multi-million dollar range closing and total bookings to Nutanix from Cisco rising 40% sequentially. Partnering with all of these vendors as well as others on an agnostic basis remains a very powerful element of this company's distribution strategy.Gross margins dollars grew by 46% on a GAAP basis, with product gross margins rising by 40%, probably the best proxy for the company's current growth rate. GAAP operating expense growth was 20% in the quarter, and neither general and administrative and research and development costs grew at all year over year. Those results were at variance from the company's plan and are not likely to be repeated. Clearly the company needs to create significant infrastructure in order to ensure that it can lead the market and have the resources necessary to support its customers. And, needless to say, Nutanix has to continue to expand its product footprint in order to capture increasing market share. The opportunities in the HCI/Virtualization space are enormous and the winners in the space - and there will be more than one - will be characterized by their introduction of leading edge technology both in HCI and in its ""adjacencies."" While the company has a relatively clear path to profitability as it leverages its growing scale, that doesn't mean it will be able to do so without substantial incremental investments.The company is forecasting that operating expenses will rise from about $199 million reported this past quarter on a non-GAAP basis to around $220 million. I think that kind of progression is reasonable and indeed necessary. Enterprise level large deals do not sell themselves and the company has a very ambitious set of development objectives that were outlined by the CEO during the call. I think it is important to note that the company reduced stock-based comp materially in the quarter, and that stock-based comp is running more than 40% below the levels of the prior year. I think as hiring accelerates, so too will stock-based comp.Not terribly surprisingly, Nutanix was able to generate strong cash generation compared to the prior year last quarter. Overall, CFFO reached $46 million in the quarter, compared to $20 million the prior year. That number was achieved despite the decline in stock-based comp last quarter by $11 million. The improvement in cash flow was influenced substantially by the drop in GAAP losses and by the increase in deferred revenue balances, which more than offset some of the other balance sheet items. Collections, as mentioned on the call, were quite strong and specifically, the company collected $10 million for a deal it will not recognize as revenue until the current quarter. As Nutanix morphs into more of a software vendor and offers different kinds of consumption options, it seems reasonable to project that deferred revenue growth will continue at elevated rates for some time to come. This, coupled with gradual improvements in profitability, will drive higher cash flow going forward.I have written about Nutanix in the recent past-in fact my last article dates to when the shares were downgraded by brokerage JPMorgan Chase. So, I want to avoid reprising that article, to some extent.Last quarter, as mentioned earlier, Nutanix closed its first $10 million software deal with a major beverage producer. This was a new customer making a mega-purchase that included the Acropolis hypervisor. Historically, Nutanix has been a land/expand company and that is still the case. But the company has now developed credibility such that it has been able to sell large software deals to first time users that include its own hypervisor. It represents a bit of an inflection point for this company.I can't stress how important the Nutanix hardware agnosticism is to its success. Customers are free to mix and match servers and often do so as was called out in the latest conference call. Self-evidently, that capability is a major differentiator between Nutanix and its competitors, who are part of hardware companies. Most users will not want to buy hardware upfront, if they can avoid doing so, as prices continue to follow the Moore's Law paradigm. But users can and will make large and long-term commitments to software that is completely portable with regards to different servers. It is the reason why the concern about the software transition, that animated much negative commentary after it was announced, is not just wrong, but completely wrong, and indeed the software only strategy is a profound positive and differentiator for Nutanix.The company is in the early stages of offering a cloud version of its software, that it calls X-I server. The service, launched about 9 months ago, is based on the use of Nutanix Calm and allows users to develop deployments based on networks that include hardware from many of the large server vendors including Dell, IBM, Cisco etc., Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and AWS (AMZN) services and ""natively"" with the Nutanix XI cloud. It is the ultimate in maximizing user choice.This offering is in its early days, so it is hard to evaluate its ultimate success, but it is, again, a major differentiator between Nutanix and its competitors. The combination of XI Server, Minjar and Calm, are all components of the company's strategy to help users implement and optimize hybrid and multi-cloud networks. Just to briefly mention Calm, it is a footprint extension for Nutanix that is designed to launch the company into the world of DevOps. I will leave it to readers to decide if they want to make a deep dive into that potential opportunity, but it is not insubstantial.Most IT vendors offer some kind of system management software. I am not going to try to evaluate whose is better and to some extent, that really depends on a variety of factors, and in particular, depends on the unique requirements of specific users. Nutanix offers something called Prism Pro. Last quarter a couple of Nutanix users bought Prism Pro in deals that were greater than $3 million, one of them as part of a Cisco/UCS deployment.I think that in the coming year, Nutanix will launch an offering to compete with VMW for use cases involving network virtualization. Will it be better than NSX, the VMW offering in the space? Of course I don't know. I assume it will have a variety of features that offer specific user benefits that NSX currently doesn't offer. But the key consideration as an investor, is that it offers more runway and more reason to expect that Nutanix will maintain its hyper growth status on into the future.Finally, I should mention the 2018 Garner Magic Quadrant report on HCI systems. Gartner has rated Nutanix the leader in the space, ahead of Dell, VMW, Hewlett Packard and other noteworthy competitors. I have linked the report here for the convenience of readers. While the ratings of Gartner and other 3rd party market research analysts aren't the end all of making competitive judgements, it certainly is a confirmation point with regards to the rising tide being enjoyed by this company.I am not in a position to offer readers trading advice about these shares. Will it really matter in the long-run, whether or not Garry Cohn remains as the economic advisor to the president? Will Nutanix sell more or less or the same number of hypervisors based on the potential tariff on steel? I simply do not have second sight as to how stocks might trade on a daily or weekly basis. At this point, the shares have risen by almost 19% in a week. There are different opinions as to how to deal with that kind of share price activity, any of which might be appropriate at a given point.What I can say is that there is a clear case to be made for owning these shares in a long-term growth portfolio with the expectation that forecasts for growth and for profitability will increase over time for the reasons I have tried to point out above. And I believe that as the software transition continues for this company, likely valuation metrics will increase.The company is holding an analyst day on March 12th. Some of those kind of events allow investors and observers to get a better perspective on growth opportunities and profit enhancement goals. I can't say that a particular investor day might present a good buying opportunity. It will, most likely, reinforce the case that the company's operational performance has made all by itself for the shares.Currently, Nutanix has a market capitalization of a bit over $7.2 billion based on 167 million shares outstanding. The company's net cash balance is a bit more than $500 million, bringing the enterprise value to $6.7 billion. The company, at this point, only specifically forecasts a single quarter at a time, and during its transition, some of the specific revenue metrics are not really germane to a valuation analysis. I think using the First Call consensus estimates for fiscal 2019 revenues when the transition to a software only model is likely to be mostly completed, provides a better foundation for an EV/S analysis. At the moment, that consensus is for revenues of $1.3 billion and that results in a calculated value of 5.5X on an EV/S basis. Simply put, that is a remarkably modest valuation for a company that is sustaining growth at or above 50% and is likely to maintain that growth rate for at least a couple of years.Nutanix is not going to achieve non-GAAP profitability until sometime in its fiscal 2019 year. Over time, given what I perceive to be the functional advantages of its solutions, it will be able to continue to charge premium prices. And, over time, it will start to do more and larger enterprise deals. At some point, operating margins will reach very profitable levels, substantially greater than 20%, I believe. But that is for the future and earnings do not figure into a valuation analysis at this point.Nutanix has started to generate some CFFO as mentioned earlier, and it likely will continue to do so. As it becomes more of a software company, it is reasonable to expect that it will continue to experience a rapid growth in deferred revenues. And the odds are, that it will see a reversal in its current trend of lower levels of stock-based compensation. But that said, it is not going to achieve a free cash flow yield materially above 2% or 2.2% in the next year or so.Investors buy these shares because of hyper growth expectations and some visible path to profitability and expectations of a highly profitable business model in the future. They do not and will not buy these shares in the short-term because free cash flow yields are compelling.Should readers buy Nutanix shares today? Probably not. Should readers add Nutanix shares to their portfolio as a core long-term holding? I believe so. There are trading techniques to scale into names such as this and shares have pullbacks. I would be waiting for those events to add to or establish a long-term holding in this name. Even from here, I expect the shares to produce positive alpha over the next year."
4129464,98236,2017-12-04T13:15:52-05:00,"Nutanix announced the results of its fiscal Q1 last week.The results were substantially above prior expectations, and further above those expectations considering the elimination of some hardware sales.Nutanix's EPS overattainment was partially driven by the inability of the company to hire to its plan. This might continue for a quarter or two.The company formally announced its pivot to an almost pure software model, with an impact on gross margins.Nutanix's EV/S ratio of less than 5X is far below the valuation of other infrastructure software vendors such as Splunk, which have slower growth.","Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) reported the results of its first fiscal quarter on Thursday evening. It was an exciting way to end November. Nutanix shares, as most readers probably realize, have been on a tear over the past three months, rising by a bit more than 50% prior to the earnings release as many investors have become more familiar with both the Hyper-Converged Infrastructure (HCI) opportunity, as well as the leading position this company enjoys in that space. The company, as had been advertised in advance, announced its intention to eliminate 80% of its pass-through hardware business over the next year so that the vast preponderance of its revenues will come from software and services. The transition started in this quarter as the company eliminated 9% of its pass-through hardware business. In point of fact, as I will discuss later in the article, the beat, large as it was, was actually less than an apples to apples comparison might indicate. In addition, the company, like many other tech vendors these days, did not spend its opex budget due to the timing of new hires. As a result, the earnings beat of $.10/share on a base forecast of $.26 was probably greater than had been anticipated, even in the context of very positive expectations for this company.What should investors do? Sometimes, stocks actually reflect accurately what is going on at a company. In my view, this is one of those times. Growth is accelerating, and so is visibility. While the company isn’t pushing profitability to any great extent, that is understandable given both the magnitude of the opportunity and the land/expand strategy that I discussed in an earlier article. HCI is one of the more seminal trends in the IT space at this time and should continue to be so for some time to come. This is the leading vendor in the space. The pivot to pure software and recurring revenues, while not really changing the value proposition for customers, will provide investors both better forward visibility and higher gross margins, and usually factors in promoting a growing valuation. I continue to hold my position and expect to continue to do so for some time to come. I think the shares, despite their recent journey, are very much worth buying and holding.Changing from an appliance vendor to a software vendor in a single year without missing a beat, and then also changing to a vendor with a SaaS business model, is perhaps the equivalent of leaping a tall building at a single bound. The company said in response to a number of specific questions during the conference call that it had prepared the ground both contractually with its partners as well as with its sales people, and that effective the company’s fiscal Q3, commissions would no longer be paid on zero-margin pass through hardware. In addition, as will be detailed a bit more later in this article, Nutanix is developing cloud offerings of its solutions that will allow it to pivot its revenues to a SaaS basis. Over time, it seems self evident that the company will pivot its business so that most of its revenues will be coming from subscription and other recurring revenues streams and from almost all software and support.Ditching commodity hardware will change the parameters of this company’s financial optics, but it will not change the actual business model or expectations for growth, earnings or cash flow. Over a rather brief time span, it will achieve gross margins that are typical for SaaS software vendors - in the 80%-plus range for software and about 55% for other revenues including services - albeit on somewhat lower revenues. Nutanix is ascribing about 26% of its current revenues to commodity hardware, but that has started to decline. The CFO said that the company will recast its planned business model early next year, but overall gross margins should reach the mid-70% range sometime before the end of calendar 2018. It plans to eliminate at least 80% of its pass-through hardware-related revenues by the end of the current calendar year. High-growth software vendors with a recurring revenue model can achieve extraordinary valuations. It seems likely that over time this will to happen to the company.Nutanix will, perhaps, give up some maintenance revenues on the hardware it is no longer selling, but it was prepared to make that trade in order to focus on sales of its software. It would be hard to imagine an EV/S for this company of less than 6X (current 4.8X), and it is probably more reasonable to believe that the EV/S metric could reach 9X in the wake of successful twin transitions. Achieving that valuation would result in lots of positive alpha. I own the shares in my growth portfolio, and would buy more if they hadn’t become such a large proportion of what is supposed to be a balanced portfolio.As mentioned, Nutanix shares had appreciated by 50% or so in just three months prior to the release of earnings. Even in what has been a frothy market, that is an extraordinary performance. So, the quarter needed to be extraordinary to justify all those new buy recommendations and price target changes. And that is exactly what the company achieved. As reported, revenue growth was 46%. It should be noted that this was a Q1 for this company in the wake of a successful Q4; typically, Q1s show weaker performance as commission accelerators reset.On an apples to apples basis, growth in revenues and bookings as well was greater than reported. The CFO said that Nutanix eliminated more than 9% of the revenues attributable to pass-through hardware. While the dollar amount was not quantified further than that, it would appear that the company eliminated about 3% of the revenue it would otherwise have reported, or about $8 million. Real growth for this company last quarter was apparently over 50%.Margins, or perhaps better put, operating losses were substantially better than planned. Part of that related to the elimination of $8 million of no-margin pass-through revenue. The other part of the margin beat related to operating expense. Basically, operating expenses were about $7 million below the prior estimates - this was a function of the timing of hires. While the company is more than likely to accelerate hiring in the wake of this quarter, its ability to do so is a bit challenging given the current shortage of qualified personnel in its business segment. It is probable, I think, that Nutanix will simply not be able to spend its forecast of $210 million in quarterly opex, and this will set up another noticeable earnings beat in Q3.On the balance sheet, receivables declined in aggregate, and declined even more in the DSO calculation. While it is typical for companies to see a decline in DSO during the first quarter, the fact is that sequential revenues rose by 9%. And more like 12%, considering the revenue elimination. At the least, this suggests that this quarter was far less back-end loaded than a usual Q1. It is also a possibility, that given the very strong revenue performance, the company stopped processing orders at the end of the fiscal period - a not unknown tactic to manage growth.No, this is not Jeopardy or any one of those other TV game shows. But really, the cornerstone of any case for Nutanix shares going forward relates to the space more than any other single element. And with the recent results from both VMware (NYSE:VMW) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), it is clear that there is a rising tide of HCI acceptance that is lifting the results of all of the competitors in the space.The concept of HCI is really only five years old at this point. It is a marketing term, to be sure, but the concept of a software-defined data center is one that has been a goal of computer engineers for some time. There are a plethora of benefits that flow from this architecture, although from the standpoint of investors, all that need be known is that the capabilities are far more efficient than prior paradigms.Hyperconvergence is a technology evolution that does away with discrete, hardware-defined systems that are connected and packaged together. In the HCI paradigm, hardware elements are commercial, off-the-shelf servers, and the convergence of elements is enabled by a hypervisor. HCI includes the ability to plug and play into a datacenter pool of like systems. That has enabled it to be successfully deployed at very large scale.The Nutanix document linked here doesn’t specify a particular percentage but graphically depicts why HCI is considerably more efficient than prior technologies. The plug-and-play features of HCI make it dramatically easier to add capacity to a data center than prior technologies. It usually includes deduplication capabilities that obviate the need to buy external appliances. Most HCI technology has some kind of built-in security feature. Because of the architecture of HCI, datacenter management is far easier and more efficient than traditional data centers, with the potential to substantially reduce human intervention. The fact that HCI systems are built around nodes and clusters means that they can be easily expanded, and these days, HCI can be used as an enterprise solution with very high capacity.Overall, the growth of the market is staggering. According to this Gartner study linked here, by 2019 about 30% of the storage capacity will be deployed on HCI. By 2020, 20% of mission-critical applications will migrate to HCI. This study is a year old, but the new one has not yet appeared. It (the new study) would obviously add SimpliVity to HPE, and it would, perhaps, show that Nutanix has a better ability to execute. I would imagine it would also improve the rating for TDC and drop Dell, as it has now merged with EMC, and elevate NetApp given its recent product introductions. But the point isn’t vendor rankings so much as it is the extremely rapid adoption of this technology. Just to use an analogy, the advent of HCI is probably more disruptive in the server/storage market than electric cars are in the vehicle space. Sometime in the next decade, HCI will be the dominant infrastructure technology being sold. That probably isn’t as sexy as selling electric vehicles, but it might turn out to be significantly more profitable. I have linked here to another study by Wikibon that highlights these trends.There are many factors behind the competitive success that Nutanix is currently enjoying and is likely to enjoy going forward. The company has been willing to spend relatively open-handedly in terms of product development and hiring sales people. Last quarter was a bit anomalous in that regard in that the company was unable to hire development staff at a pace that it had planned. Research & development expense flattened out on a GAAP basis looked at sequentially. It fell quite a bit more in percentage terms on a non-GAAP basis, presumably because with the lack of hiring, the company did not make new grants of stock. But that said, Nutanix spent 23% of its revenues on research & development last quarter, and spend in total dollars is likely to reach $300 million this year. Given that the spend is all on HCI, that is a not insignificant level.I think another factor behind the company’s success is that its software has been ported to work with just about every major hardware vendor. Agnosticism, both with regard to hardware and hypervisors as well, is a significant competitive advantage that almost by definition cannot be matched by competitors. Nutanix basically offers users lots of choices and no lock-ins. If a user wants to convert to a different hypervisor, it is a single click. These are advantages both functionally and in user perception.That said, the company has built its own hypervisor, AHV, and this tool has shown consistent market share gains quarter after quarter. Is AHV better than the VMware Hypervisor? I would not be able to do more than look at commercials on the subject. But for whatever reason, it has been gaining momentum in the market.Nutanix offers what are considered by industry observers as comprehensive management solutions. One basic reason users have for going to HCI is the savings potential in terms of management. The company offers a purpose-built management tool it calls Prism. Last quarter, the company saw a 40% growth in Prism Pro adoption, including 16 relatively significant deals of greater than $100k. It has recently introduced what it calls Calm - not the kind you get from a cocktail, but a solution that offers additional automated management for applications decoupled from infrastructure.Nutanix has perhaps had a reputation of being a relatively high-cost solution compared to some of its smaller competitors. Whether or not that is real or a perception is hard to measure. But the fact is that part of the impact of the company’s withdrawal from the hardware business is likely to mean somewhat less overall price competition. Users will only be paying for Nutanix IP with its set of specific advantages. Again, I'm not too sure how this will play out in the real world, but my guess is that it will remove any sense that the company is offering an expensive solution.The HCI market is going to be huge. It would be unrealistic to suggest that there will be just a single winner. Competition will be substantial, and there will be all kinds of claims, both substantiated and otherwise. The case for Nutanix does not require that the company have some absolute level of HCI market share - indeed, that kind of forecast would be unknowable at this point. The company has made significant appointments in the last quarter, particularly that of a new chief revenue officer to run field sales. Sales execution, as well as specific product features, will be a significant competitive factor in terms of future market share attainment.It would be tedious, I think, to try to evaluate all of the competitive issues in the market. Again, Nutanix has more than enough competitive advantages, both current and coming, to validate its opportunity to sustain 50% growth on into the future.Clearly, Nutanix will have a new business model going forward as it leaves the hardware world to focus on software. The CFO said it is likely that the company will be offering investors a new business model at some point in the new year. The new model is likely to feature significantly higher gross margins that are likely to approach the mid-70% level by the end of this year and perhaps reach 80% or more in fiscal 2019. The CFO, in his prepared remarks, gave a hint of the business model when he talked about a view of the company in the past 12 months absent hardware, which had $800 million of revenue and total gross margins of 80%-plus. Those analysts who suggest that Nutanix shares are fully valued are simply ignoring that kind of model.Nutanix has not made a specific forecast for the full year based on its new business model. It has said that over the course of the year it will eliminate up to two-thirds of its hardware sales, which were 26% of revenue last quarter. Analysts are projecting revenues for the year of $1.14 billion, which is probably a reasonable estimate, but one that is hard to definitively evaluate. On a 12-month forward basis, the sales estimate goes to $1.2 billion - almost all software and services. The company has 161 million fully diluted shares outstanding, which at today’s share prices equates to a market cap of about $5.9 billion. Its net cash position is around $365 million, leaving an enterprise value of $5.5 billion and an EV/S projection of 4.6X.We do not know what the recurring revenue component will be this year or going forward other than that it will be rising and will have some impact on the growth of reported revenues in the next couple of years. During the course of the conference call, the CFO suggested that the transition will be at a deliberate pace - but what that means I do not really know. Users have typically bought infrastructure, and in recent years, have wanted to lease software. How that might play out in terms of software infrastructure is not really clear to me at this point.Will the switch to a more ratable model keep reported revenue growth in the range of 30-35%? I really do not know. I do think, however, that high-growth software companies, as this one is likely to remain, are most often valued at far above 4.6X forward revenues. I could, without much effort, support some kind of comparable analysis that suggests 9X or higher would be a more reasonable expectation for valuation at some point over the coming year.Nutanix does not earn money, and I think it is important to note that the earnings overattainment last quarter was a function of the company not achieving its spend plan as opposed to some new, less-intensive investment program. The company is forecasting next quarter that it will have $285 million of total revenues, with gross margins of 63% yielding $178 million of gross profit dollars. It is forecasting $210 million of non-GAAP opex, up from about $193 million last quarter. I would not be surprised if Nutanix did not spend $210 million this coming quarter, simply because of the difficulty in hiring the kind of talent it needs in a competitive market. But it is not yet feasible to value the company on a P/E basis, and that is likely to be the case for the foreseeable future, especially as more ratable revenues enter the mix.The company generated a bit of operating cash last quarter. Some of that cash generation was the result in the significant decline in DSO, which fell to 57 on what Nutanix calls a straight average. It is significant to note that last quarter, stock-based comp fell by more than 60% year on year. The change in the company’s deferred revenue balance was down as well year on year, but that is primarily a function of the success that it had in its Federal vertical, where sales most frequently do not generate deferred revenues.Nutanix does not forecast cash flow, and if it did, it would almost certainly not be at a level to serve as a valuation support for investors. I expect that in coming quarters, the GAAP net loss will continue to decline. I imagine stock-based comp and the increase in deferred revenues will rise. But the company will likely see a rising level of A/Rs from this point.As mentioned, I own Nutanix shares and have owned them for some little while at this point. I expect to continue to hold them for some time to come. The story, as I see it, is just in its early innings. There are simply just not that many investments which offer an apples to apples growth rate of greater than 50% and gross margins of 80% or more. The category that Nutanix leads is one of the stronger growth stories in IT, and that is not likely to change in the foreseeable future. The company is likely to maintain its leadership role given its visionary CEO and a new chief revenue officer with experience in sales execution. I'm sure there will be speed bumps at some point - all companies have those - but this is one of the more substantive high-growth investments to be seen. I think it will continue to generate positive alpha."
4160379,103480,2018-04-01T16:04:31-04:00,"Nutanix held an upbeat investor day on March 12.The company's CFO focused the discussion around the so-called Rule of 40, in which he believes Nutanix is one of only 21 companies to pass.The framework illustrates how management is thinking about balancing Nutanix's hypergrowth versus future profits.The company is also forecasting billings of $3 billion by FY21, about 3x its current run rate (the company billed $509 million in 1H18).Shares have skyrocketed since Nutanix announced its gradual shift to a software-only model, though after the tech correction in late March, Nutanix is still down 10% from highs.","Nutanix (NTNX), the hyperconverged infrastructure vendor that is a leader in the so-called ""private cloud"" space, has seen tremendous fortune shine on it as of late. Immediately after posting Q2 earnings in early March, Nutanix shares bolted up to $39, and I had believed that to be the beginnings of a long rally. Even as a huge Nutanix bull, however, I underestimated exactly how far Nutanix's rally would go in the coming month. Now hovering near the $50 mark, Nutanix is up 35% in the last month alone - an astounding fact when you consider that most richly-valued technology stocks like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN) got pummeled in the March correction.NTNX data by YChartsNutanix has come a long way since sinking to all-time lows of $15 not long after going public. Investors have seen healthy returns on this stock, especially if they bought at lows when bearish commentary on Nutanix's growing losses and supposedly ""commoditized"" offerings doiminated the day. Now, with Nutanix touting its software story and spinning a future of strong margins and a highly differentiated offering positioned as a VMware killer (VMW), investors are back in love with the name.The main question now is: is there still juice left in the Nutanix rally, or is time to take gains off the table? Goldman Sachs (GS), which once called Nutanix the opportunity of a lifetime, has downgraded Nutanix from Conviction Buy to Buy, citing valuation. Is it time for investors to follow suit?I've decided to hold on to my position. Though the gains from here on out aren't likely to be as massive as in the first quarter of 2018, I still believe Nutanix to have a long runway for future growth. Particularly after Nutanix's investor day on March 12, I extracted a few key nuggets that justify a long-term bullish position.Nutanix currently has a market cap of $8.07 billion. Netting out the company's $349.1 million of balance sheet cash as of its second-quarter earnings release, the company has an enterprise value of $7.72 billion. That's about 6.6x EV/FY18 revenues, against analyst consensus revenues of $1.13 billion (as reported by Yahoo Finance) for FY18, which is already halfway over. That's a fairly rich multiple for a company that hasn't fully transitioned to software-only revenues, but I'm inclined to bite as Nutanix's growth opportunity is so large.One common thread ran through the various product and financial presentations in Nutanix's 2018 analyst day, documented in a huge 219-page investor deck. The unifying theme: Nutanix is just barely scratching the surface of its future market opportunity. These are the exact words that CEO Dheeraj Pandey has been a fan of saying in the past, but the truth within them still holds firm.What this means, essentially, is that Nutanix's current valuation against near-term revenue targets are fairly meaningless. And indeed, with a company that is still in the middle of a business model transition to software-only sales as well as growing at a rapid 44% in its most recent quarter, Nutanix's current valuation multiples must be taken with a grain of salt. It's really the story that matters more.And this story, as refreshed in Nutanix's analyst day, is as robust as ever. The company ran a bottoms-up analysis of its target market within the Global 2000 and non-Global 2000 (smaller clients) customer segments, estimating average win rates and deal sizes for both segments, and came up with a billings target of $3 billion by FY21 (three years from now - Nutanix's fiscal 2021 begins in the summer of 2020 and ends in the summer of 2021). This represents a $1.2 billion billings opportunity within the large G2000 market and a $1.8 billlion opportunity in downmarket clients.But still, against an estimated TAM of $178 billion by FY21, Nutanix would still be just scratching the surface three years from now. Which means it's barely scratching the surface today.Figure 1. Nutanix billings target and FY21 TAMSource: Nutanix investor deck, March 2018Of course, we have to be careful with taking rosy company projections - TAM analyses and long-range targets are designed to be extremely optimistic, and we always have to weigh our own judgments against it.But on the whole, Nutanix's projections aren't too far out of left field. Having billed $509 million in the first half of 2018, Nutanix has already cracked a >$1 billion annual billings run rate. Tripling this within three years isn't too unreasonable for a company that has been growing the top line at ~50% consistently for the past few quarters. And in terms of future TAM, Gartner expects that 2018 itself will see total IT spending of $3.7 trillion. It stands to reason that spending on private cloud infrastructures and datacenter virtualization software would amount to ~$200 billion within three years.Nutanix has evolved far from being considered a startup in IT circles - it's considered ""best-in-breed"" in the hyperconverged infrastructure, private cloud world. As it continues to gain legitimacy and respect from IT buyers, it's well-positioned to capture a multi-billion annual revenue and billings opportunity within the space.The other key takeaway from Nutanix's analyst day is that management isn't ignoring the company's profits. Far from being a ""growth-at-all costs"" company that will trip over itself to hit the $3 billion FY21 billings mark while sacrificing profitability along the way (which is what Salesforce (CRM) sometimes feels like - continually chasing a top-line target while making minimal improvements to operating margins), management has applied a ""Rule of 40"" framework to determining its balance between revenue growth and bottom line expansion.The Rule of 40 is less of a strictly calculated formula than a loosely defined guideline. Nutanix defines it as the sum of its revenue growth % and its FCF margin, one of the most common definitions of balancing revenue and profitability.The company ran this data against all public software companies, excluding those growing less than 20% and those with less than $200 million in revenues, and found that Nutanix is only one of 21 companies with growth plus FCF margin in excess of 40%.With its ~60% trailing revenue growth against a single-digit negative FCF margin, Nutanix's Rule of 40 score lands at 55%. Here's how that stacks up against other software companies in its comparable universe:Figure 2. Nutanix and the Rule of 40Source: Nutanix investor deck, March 2018When Nutanix's stock was tanking, one of the most common criticisms was that the company ran huge losses. Indeed, in the first half of FY18, Nutanix had a GAAP net loss of -$124.1 million - a net margin of -22%. However, that is hugely improved from -56% in 1H17, and Nutanix's free cash flow in FY18 actually tilted marginally positive.The bottom line here: though Nutanix is carrying large GAAP net losses, especially relative to more stablilized peers like Salesforce and VMware, it's making huge strides on the profitability front. And when you consider its massive growth and the sales expenses necessary to achieve that growth, Nutanix's losses are digestible. When you look at Nutanix's losses in the context of its growth, its Rule of 40 score of 55% compared very favorably against peers.Management has committed to maintaining a score in excess of 40% as Nutanix continues to grow. As Nutanix's growth tapers down into the ~40s this year, this also implies that Nutanix's free cash flow margins will continue to tilt toward positive. With a company that's still barely scratching the surface of its market opportunity, investors have to be patient on the bottom-line front as Nutanix makes progress against its long-term operating model. Along with its $3 billion billings target, Nutanix's management has set a long-term, undated gross margin goal of 80% (versus 61% in 1H18) and an FCF margin of 25% (versus 4% in 1H18).Despite the recent run-up in Nutanix's stock and the Goldman downgrade, I still believe Nutanix to have massive opportunity for gains - though unlikely to see the ~2x gains that Nutanix has seen over the past year, it's still a solid long-term bet. Again, with a stock that's growing so quickly and transitioning its business model, its current valuation multiple against near-term revenue targets is less important than the long-term potential and narrative.As expected, the signals coming out of Nutanix's inaugural analyst day were extremely bullish. Key points to note from Nutanix's investor materials were its estimates on long-term TAM and billings potential, as well as insights into how management is using the Rule of 40 as a framework to guide its growth versus profitability decisions. Stay long on this name."
4136738,102762,2018-01-10T15:54:57-05:00,"Nutanix is involved in the fast-growing hyperconverged-infrastructure business. The company will grow along with the data center market.Last earnings revealed the company is on the right track. The margin expanded by 20%, although remained negative.The company's valuation is reasonable in light of the transition toward being a software corporation.","HCI (Hyperconverged infrastructure) player Nutanix (NTNX) went public at the end of September 2016, and since that time the stock has fluctuated significantly, plummeting to about $14 and rising to the current level of $35. However, while the company is still in its early stage and does not make profits, the future of Nutanix looks bright at the moment. Hence, in Q1 FY 2018 the company beat on EPS and earnings, demonstrating positive dynamics in many aspects, which shows the corporation is on right track. As the overall data center industry is expected to grow rapidly, it can be expected Nutanix will grow along with the market. Therefore, NTNX stock has decent upside potential at the moment, despite a sharp increase in price that has already happened over last year, while the downside is limited.The market for the hyperconverged infrastructure is growing at a rapid pace. Hence, the study conducted by IDC reveals that in Q3 2017 worldwide converged systems market revenue increased 10.8% year over year to almost $3 billion, while the hyperconverged system sales grew about 68% year on year to $1bn, ""33.5% of the total converged systems market revenue."" These numbers show the significance of the industry that Nutanix is involved in and explain, at least to some extent, the sharp increase in the company's stock price.The phenomenon seems to be reasonable: the hyperconverged infrastructure sales are boosted by the growth in the data center market, which in turn is driven by increasing popularity of clouds, IoT, and mobile computing. It is expected the industry will continue to grow double-digits in the coming years, reaching the level of $200 billion in 2020.For those who are not familiar with HCI technology, Nutanix website provides a good explanation:I believe HCI will capture a solid share of the total market in the near future, which means revenues for the companies involved in the field are likely to continue growing. It seems clear that the current level of total sales in the segment of $1 billion is very small, compared to the possible data center total market size of $200 billion. Therefore, each additional percentage point of market share will result in a huge increase in sales in the HCI segment. This creates a solid upside while the downside is limited at the moment. Notably, a market research by Hypervisor predicts HCI market will be worth $12.6 billion by 2022.The growth in the HCI segment is likely because HCI provides a number of benefits for the infrastructure users:As a result, HCI is claimed to be a perfect choice for many companies, as this type of infrastructure leads to a reduction in support and maintenance costs.Despite the fact that Dell is considered to dominate the HCI space, Nutanix can be named as an actual leader in the segment, which is supported by The Register's take on this topic.Hence, according to IDC report for Q3 2017, Dell Inc. was ""top canine"" with 30.6% share, while Nutanix was the second with 20.7% share in the segment. However, IDC counts sales of OEMed Nutanix systems by Dell - the XC products - as Dell sales, not Nutanix ones. Therefore, the results are slightly biased in favor of Dell.(Source: The Register)A further insight is provided by Aaron Rakers, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo, who ""crunched the numbers"" and gave a more detailed overview. Thus, when we add $120 million Dell XC sales to Nutanix, it becomes clear the company leads the rating with the total sales of $345 million, which represents a 34% market share.As a result, if the HCI segment continues to increase sharply along with the data center market (which is likely), Nutanix will gain from the trend significantly, due to being the leader in the field. This makes the corporation attractive for long-term investment and ensures a solid upside. Hence, if Nutanix retains at least 30% share by 2020-2022, the company's revenue can grow to $3-4 billion ($12 billion total market sales times 30%). With a price-to-sales ratio of approximately 5, we have a possible valuation of $15-20 billion, compared to current $5.8 billion. This would represent an average annual increase of 21% over the next five years.While the corporation still does not generate profits, the dynamics are rather positive when it comes to financials. At the end of 2017, Nutanix reported its Q1 FY 2018 results beating on EPS and revenue, demonstrating more than 46% increase in sales for the period. The average revenue growth for the last 5 quarters amounted to hefty 68.5%, and the moment will likely continue in the coming years due to the aforementioned reasons.Moreover, Nutanix' net margin improved significantly in the quarter, growing from -40% to -22.3%. This improvement is an important step for a young, fast-growing corporation, and it shows the company is on the right track in terms of the bottom line performance. What is also interesting here is the fact that Nutanix moves toward being more a software company than hardware provider. It is reported the corporation's ""hardware sales - arrays of flash-based storage - will decline from 26% of the company's ""billings"" last quarter to just 9%"" by the end of this fiscal year. In turn, this will influence the corporation's margins positively, and, therefore, the improvement that has been seen so far is likely to continue. Shebly Seyrafi of FBN Securities reports gross profit will reach nearly 80% in fiscal 2019, getting Nutanix closer to other software pure plays.(Source: CapitalCube)The company has also improved its efficiency in terms of managing its working capital. Nutanix' working capital days has decreased from 120 to about 70 days over the last three quarters. This reduces the financing needs and decreases the level of liquidity risk for Nutanix, which is a positive sign for investors.(Source: CapitalCube)VMware (VMW) is another corporation which is involved in the segment of HCI, with about 32% of total sales share. The corporation has shown significant success over last 3-5 years, growing its revenue by 5-20%. As a result, the stock soared about 90% from its low in January 2016 and about 63% in last 3 years.VMW data by YChartsWhile Nutanix and VMWare are not 100% identical corporations, they still are involved in the same industry and offer similar (to some extent) technology. Therefore, the example of VMWare demonstrates that Nutanix, given the corporation manages to become profitable in the coming 1-2 years, has solid potential. This is also reinforced by the fact that Nutanix' position is very strong in the increasing HCI segment. Importantly, VMWare's gross margin has fluctuated near 85% over last years, the level that Nutanix is expected to achieve by 2019 (which was discussed earlier).Overall, Nutanix is a very attractive long-term investment, as the corporation is a leader in the rapidly growing hyperconverged-infrastructure market. Although the company does not generate profits, Nutanix shows positive financial dynamics, as the top- and bottom-line performance has been improving significantly over 5 quarters.NTNX PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsCurrently, Nutanix trades at around 5.3 P/S ratio, which is lower than this of major competitors, such as VMWare. While this does not necessarily show the stock is undervalued, it provides some information on whether the stock has room to grow. Moreover, if the sales continue to grow mid double-digits, the valuation will be even more justified. As the current-quarter sales estimates have increased sharply, it can be expected the stock will continue to grow in the near future.My detailed analyses of VMWare and other tech companies can be found on my profile page.

4128970,51452,2017-12-01T11:59:28-05:00,This article follows our one earlier this week previewing this report and recommending Nutanix shares.Nutanix’s earnings report more than met our positive expectations presented in our preview article early this week.The company continues to experience high and accelerating growth.The company continues to experience high and accelerating growth.The company could even have takeover appeal although there are no indications of it occurring.,"Yesterday afternoon, Nutanix (NTNX) reported October FQ1 results of $276 million and ($0.16), nicely better than expectations for $267 million and ($0.26) that were based on $240-250 million and ($0.37) guidance. These revenues were up 46% YTY and 9% sequentially. Billings increased 32% YTY and 9% sequentially to $315 million.This was just the kind of strong report and outlook we anticipated in our positive preview and purchase recommendation earlier this week.The revenue upside came largely from higher revenues from the U. S. Federal government with its September fiscal year-end falling in Nutanix’s October quarter. Continued strength in the APAC region also contributed to the upside but was partially offset by seasonal weakness in EMEA and the non-Federal North America markets.FQ1 large deal closings were strong with the same 15 $2+ million deals as closed as in the seasonally stronger FQ4.With the beginning of the new fiscal year, Nutanix is no longer including some pass-through (sourced from others) hardware revenues in their reported revenues. This resulted in a 9% reduction to reported revenues in FQ1. Over time, company management expects to eliminate all hardware revenues that represented 26% of billings in FQ1.This reporting change does not mean the company is not continuing to sell NX hardware appliances to customers. But beginning February 1st, salespeople will be compensated only on software bookings. The complete elimination of including hardware revenues in reported results will be spread out over a year or so, and this requires some adjustment when evaluating revenue growth.This reporting change will result in Nutanix becoming more wholly a software company. And a cloud operating systems company that deserves a higher valuation relative to its growth rate.For their January FQ2, Nutanix management forecast $280-285 million and ($0.22)-($0.20), comparing well to prior expectations for $282 million and ($0.25). These revenues would be up 54-56% YTY. They are also net of $12 million or 15% of hardware sales being eliminated. With those hardware sales included, revenues would have been guided to $292-297 million, up 60-63% YTY.As we suggested in our article earlier this week, Nutanix shares could trade up to a $45-57 range within the next 2-3 quarters based on a valuation of 6-7x revenues of $1.2-1.3 billion. And they could continue to as high as $74 by the time the company is being based on FY 2019 revenues that could reach $1.5-1.7+ billion. With the gradual non-booking of hardware revenues these revenues numbers may not be as conservative as we thought before, but we think they are still significantly conservative and the valuations on the higher margin software business could more than fully offset this impact on the reported revenue growth rate that is still high.A new thought that potentially adds to the appeal of owning Nutanix shares:VMware also reported upside results yesterday afternoon and VMware shares are trading up nearly 4% this morning, back towards their high reached earlier this week. VMware is a much larger company with different technologies and products but it also provides valuable software, tools and services to enterprises and governments as they migrate their businesses to the cloud. For customers, this is complicated by the need digitize and now AI machine learning-enable their operations while moving to adopt the optimum combination of public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud and proprietary IT systems and services.Actually, looking at the reports of these two companies the same afternoon, it occurs to us that there may be a fit between them that might cause VMware one day to consider the acquisition of Nutanix. We emphasize that we have heard no suggestions that is the case and are just speculating here.Nutanix is not yet profitable due to heavy investing in building a global sales and support organization but VMware is 8-10 times larger and would likely be able to rapidly increase the sales of Nutanix’s offerings so that the combination could become accretive to VMware earnings within a year or so.Meanwhile, again both companies are doing very well and have highly valuable technologies and services that are needed as the world heads increasingly towards being AI machine learning-enabled and cloud based.We continue our Strong Buy ratings for the shares of both Nutanix and VMware."
4127861,51452,2017-11-27T12:10:04-05:00,Nutanix shares have surged the past two days on two broker coverage initiations with price targets of $40 and $45.The company is experiencing high and accelerating revenue growth with its single OS solution for hybrid cloud enterprise IT environments.We expect this Thursday's October quarter earnings report and outlook to justify further share price appreciation.,"Nutanix (NTNX) is scheduled to report October FQ1 results this Thursday afternoon. Expectations are $267 million and ($0.26) based on $240-250 million and ($0.37) guidance plus indications of an accelerating outlook.Recall, Nutanix provides an Enterprise Cloud platform that brings a wide range of server, virtualization, storage and other services into a single easy-to-manage solution. It goes beyond hyper-converged infrastructure to provide one operating system controllable with single clicks.While many applications can be moved to the public cloud and quickly be useful (hosted on services like Amazon (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud), sometimes that is not the least expensive solution over time. And some critical and proprietary applications need to remain on IT systems controlled directly by enterprises, governments, etc. Hybrid combinations of the two are increasingly the ideal solutions. Nutanix’s software provides the ability to operate public and private clouds from one OS on one platform with just a few “clicks.” Tools and technologies can be deployed from a wide range of companies on a broadening range of hardware platforms including (in addition to Amazon, Google, Microsoft), Cisco (CSCO), IBM (IBM), Lenovo, SAP (SAP), Splunk (SPLK), VMWare (VMW), Citrix (CTXS) and many others. In June, Nutanix announced an expanded hybrid cloud deal with Google.Lenovo bookings increased sharply in FQ3 and were strong in FQ4. IBM represents the first non-x86 processor-based systems. These partners are increasingly bringing large deals to Nutanix and are important in selling the company’s single OS to large customers who might not otherwise be willing to select the company’s offerings for such central and vital functions.Customers include organizations like Airbus, American Red Cross, AT&T, BART, Blue Cross, Deloitte, Hallmark, Honda, Hyundai, Jabil, Nasdaq, New York Life, Restoration Hardware, Panasonic, Societe Generale, Staples, Subaru, Toyota, the U. S. Department of Defense and many others.In January 2017 FQ2, Nutanix saw a slowing of large deal closings, especially in North America. Promoting some top salespeople to management positions and reassigning many territories was blamed. In FQ3 large deal closings in North America rebounded nicely and EMEA and APAC saw continued strong growth. And the number of $1 million-plus lifetime customers increased 31% sequentially from 295 to 341. One customer represented $5 million-plus. In FQ4, large deal closings were stronger yet with $2 million-plus deals increasing from 13 valued at $45 million in FQ3 to 15 valued at $57 million in FQ4. There were three $5 million-plus deals, one valued at $11 million and two at about $7 million.Billings: With the much improved sales execution bringing in these large deals, FQ4 billings were up 25% sequentially and 40% YTY to 289 million. This continued a rebound to $234 million in FQ3 that followed a decline from $240 million in FQ1 to $227 million in FQ2.Large deals are being driven in part by the recent availability of a full stack operating system software. This includes a hypervisor, software defined storage, operations and systems management, automation and security and networking. Large organizations especially prefer the company’s single cloud platform. And the company’s brand is becoming increasingly well known. This has created a virtuous cycle that makes larger deals increasingly achievable, and that appears to have a long way to run.Like in FQ3, better than expected gross margins on the higher revenues resulted in the smaller loss in FQ4. This was despite continued cost pressures from higher DRAM and NAND prices and gross margins were down a slight 10bp sequentially at 58.3%.That brings us to the October FQ1 results this Thursday afternoon. Expectations of $267 million and ($0.26) based on $240-250 million represents growth of 18% sequentially and 68% YTY, comparing well to the 62% YTY growth achieved in FQ3. This is quite an improvement from FQ1 revenue growth expectations of “just” 39% to $231 million before the FQ4 report and FQ1 guidance one quarter ago on August 31. That outlook improvement caused us to raise our rating from Buy to Strong Buy and in these last three months Nutanix shares have gained 49% to close at $34.30 last Friday. Three recent analyst initiations and price targets averaging $41 (two of them just last Wednesday and last Friday with targets of $45 and $40 respectively) have driven Nutanix shares up 13.6% just the last two trading days.At the $23 area where they traded after that FQ4 report on September 1, we noted that the company’s valuation was still less than 3x revenues and suggested that could improve to at least the low end of the 5-10x revenues range often afforded emerging, fast growing companies like Nutanix with new disruptive technologies for large markets. At $34.30, the valuation is $5.5 billion or 4.6x next 12-month revenues which we expect to conservatively be $1.2 billion.Without the impact of those sales execution issues earlier this year, Nutanix shares could already be trading at 6-7x revenues or a range of $45-57 per share within 2-3 quarters based on $1.2-1.3 billion in next 12-month revenues. And with revenue expectations for FY 2019 that begins in just eight months already at 1.44 billion and the potential for that to be raised to $1.5-1.7 billion (up just 25-42%) over those eight months, at a valuation of 6-7x revenues Nutanix shares could reach as high as $74 per share, up 115% from current levels.This optimistic case for the share price appreciation would also be materially aided by the company reducing the size of its reported losses that are already expected to decline from the $0.25 per quarter on average this year to about half that in FY 2019. Approaching this Thursday’s FQ1 earnings report we continue our Strong Buy rating for Nutanix shares."
4103867,22148,2017-09-04T00:33:17-04:00,Nutanix easily beat FQ4 estimates.The lack of leverage in the fast revenue growth rates has rattled investors so far.Hyperconverged infrastructure potential makes the stock worth the risk.A path to profits is needed to reward investors.,"As Nutanix (NTNX) grows into an enterprise cloud leader, the stock actually continues to trade far below its post-IPO highs. The biggest issue with the company in the current market has been the lack of progress towards becoming profitable.The FQ4 results were solid for a big $0.05 EPS beat, but the stock went nowhere. It closed the day at $22. What caught our attention is the company still has massive growth in excess of 30% for the foreseeable future, and the market originally had so much hope for Nutanix, with initial trading above $40.The datacenter enterprise cloud provider generated 62% revenue growth in the last quarter. Billings grew by 40%, but the number that will detract most investors was the substantial $0.33 loss.Once going public, a company needs to get close to being profitable or the investment community will lose interest. One only needs to review the below chart to see how EPS estimates fell all of last fiscal year. Once the calendar flipped to FY18, the numbers started falling again.NTNX EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsThe biggest key to the story is that Nutanix is on a pace to lose close to $1 per share in the next fiscal year or FY19. The market can handle growth investing, but a company needs to be closer to breakeven to get a lot of respect.For an enterprise cloud provider shifting towards software, cash flows are typically a better indication of the investment thesis. What one wants to see is a company generating positive cash flows in order to sustain the growth phase that includes reported losses. The investor data sheet providers the details here.The company is generating positive operating cash flow. One might want to see some larger cash flows, but $14 million for the year is a positive step in comparison to FY16. The free cash flow situation is a concern. Nutanix lost $36 million in FY17 and virtually equal to the $39 million loss from the prior year.Note that the stock now has an EV around $3 billion, with a revenue target of over $1 billion in the current FY. Nutanix guided to FQ1 revenues of $245 million at the mid-point versus analyst estimates down at $231 million, so growing revenues isn't a problem.The disappointing part is that nearly 50% revenue growth for the quarter isn't generating any leverage. Sure, the company continues to beat quarterly estimates, but the guidance of a $0.37 loss is right on par with the loss from last FQ1. Beating by $0.05 and reporting a $0.32 loss just isn't what the investment community wants these days with that type of revenue growth.The key investor takeaway is that Nutanix is a cheap cloud play based on P/S multiples. For the investment to pay off, the company needs to not only beat FQ1 results by the typical $0.05 to show the progress, but guidance this time also has to include a path to reduced losses going forward.Own Nutanix at this price for the promises of enterprise cloud computing. Though, don't overstay your welcome if the company can't figure out how to cut losses while ramping up revenues."
4127801,103480,2017-11-27T09:55:10-05:00,"Nutanix has made a full recovery in recent months, within striking distance of the $37 price at which it closed its first day of trading in its September 2016 IPO.The company has garnered newfound enthusiasm after a string of quarterly beats and analyst upgrades. It gained nearly 30% in October alone, followed by 20% gains in November to date.Nutanix's strong year-end billings in FY17 (ending June) indicate that the company has a strong year ahead, and its guidance outlook (implying a sequential decline) for Q1 looks overly conservative.Nutanix will report earnings in the last week of November, which I believe will drive further upside in the stock.","In recent months, Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX) stock has zoomed back up almost as quickly as it fell. The company, which had its IPO in September 2016, has been public for a little over a year, in which it saw its stock price zigzag from a high of $38 to as low as $15. At its low point, bears had decried the company as a hardware play with little differentiation; now, in its upswing, bulls have acclaimed it as the leader of the so-called ""private cloud"" infrastructure (building cloud-like capabilities in on-premise data centers) and capitalizing on a shift toward software-only sales.As I've written in prior articles, I'm a steadfast long on Nutanix. Since I last wrote on the company at ~$22/share, the shares have jumped 56% and pushed past my prior price target of $33-$36, causing me to recalibrate my analysis and evaluate whether I want to hold the stock past earnings in late November.While I no longer think the stock carries the tremendous upside potential that it did in the $20s, I continue to believe the stock is worth 5x EV/FTM revenues, which, in light of its most recent forecast and estimating a 40% y/y revenue growth rate in FY18, represents a price target of $40. I'm not letting go of my position until the stock crosses that level.Nutanix has had a long history of stock volatility around its earnings releases, so the company's Q1 release on November 30 might provide that window of opportunity to cash in on gains. Let's take a look at recent developments around the stock for clues on what we can expect in Q1 as well as FY18:In recent months, as documented by SA News, Nutanix has received a slew of analyst upgrades and bullish initiations. While I don't believe Wall Street consensus is a perfect rendering of a stock's opportunity (most equity analysts trend heavily toward positive recommendations), it does contribute to a stock's momentum and narrative positioning in the market. With a newly public company like Nutanix, sentiment and hype are often the carrying factors in stock price movements, as compared to a company with decades of quarterly results.RBC upped its price target to $37 (from $34), maintaining its Outperform rating. Needham initiated Nutanix at a price target of $45, with a Buy rating. Raymond James upped its price target to $32 (note this was in early November prior to the stock's spike) and upgraded the rating to Outperform from Market Perform.Also note that Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) has maintained its hyper-bullish stance on the company, calling it a ""once-in-a-decade"" opportunity and placing Nutanix on its conviction list this summer - though we do have to note that as lead underwriter on Nutanix's IPO, we have to take Goldman's enthusiasm with a grain of salt.It's rather difficult to construct a read-through on Nutanix's earnings this quarter, as not many other IT hardware and storage vendors have posted their earnings yet. The ones that have, however, hint at upside for Nutanix.NetApp (NASDAQ: NTAP), the flash storage vendor, received a nice kick in the stock price after a beat-and-raise quarter. The company's forward Q3 guidance of $1.425-$1.575 billion was also meaningfully ahead of consensus expectations for $1.44 billion, indicating good momentum for storage companies this quarter.Among large-cap IT hardware companies, both Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE: HPE) have reported their Q3 earnings. While both companies saw rather poor results overall, HPE did have a surprising bright spot in its storage unit. As shown in the chart below, HPE saw a 5% y/y rise in revenue from storage products, even amidst a decline in its core server products:Figure 1. HPE quarterly resultsSource: HPE earnings releaseLikewise, Cisco saw a decline in its core networking business (akin to HPE's decline in its core server business), but this is largely unrelated to Nutanix's business, and other Cisco units saw some upside. It's worth noting that both Cisco and HP have both previously attempted to acquire Nutanix, and as both companies are seeking for ways to remedy declines in their flagship units, merger talks for Nutanix could rekindle at a much higher price. Both companies, after all, are still cash-rich and have indicated their belief that Nutanix is a premier technology asset.For Q1, Nutanix guided to revenue of $240-$250 million, representing 30% y/y growth at the midpoint of $245 million and a -3% sequential decline.Let's review Nutanix's growth linearity since FY16, noting that the company has recently restated its financials (in FY16 and FY17 only) to comply with new software revenue recognition rules outlined in ASC 606:Figure 2. Nutanix revenue growth linearitySource: Nutanix Q4 earnings presentationNoting that Nutanix achieved 57% y/y growth in 4Q17, it's almost unfathomable to believe that Nutanix's y/y growth rate would decelerate to nearly half in 1Q18 to only 30%. Also note that Nutanix has never seen a quarter of sequential decline in its history, and in fact achieved 17% sequential growth in last year's Q1. The fact that the company is guiding to -3% sequential growth in 1Q18 seems overly conservative.Given the company's consistent trend of beating its forecasts as well as Wall Street consensus (see the earnings history below from Seeking Alpha), I believe Q1 will be another quarter in which Nutanix exceeds even the higher end of its guidance range:Figure 3. Nutanix earnings historyNote also that Nutanix achieved its highest-ever billings of $289 million in 4Q17 (+40% y/y) and total billings of $990 million in FY17 are up 55% y/y. Given that billings add into the company's short-term deferred revenues that will be recognized as revenue in the next twelve months, the fact that Nutanix achieved 55% y/y billings growth in FY17 makes it nearly impossible for Nutanix to hit only 30% y/y growth in FY18. The actual billings results in FY17 just don't align to the company's muted guidance.If we take Nutanix's guidance at face value and assume $245 million in Q1 revenues, and also apply the historical sequential growth linearity through FY18 (with sequential growth of 6%, 3%, and 23% in Q2, Q3, and Q4), we can calculate the following FY18 growth linearity and estimate $1.10 billion in revenues for FY18, implying 30% y/y revenue growth for the full year:Figure 4. Nutanix 30% growth scenarioSource: author-created chart, based on extrapolation of management guidanceFor the reasons outlined in the preceding section, this scenario seems overly conservative. For a company that's achieved 68% y/y revenue growth in FY17 to drop growth to just 30% in FY18 seems absurd.Nutanix achieved 106% y/y billings growth in FY16 and 68% y/y growth in FY17; that is, the company's revenue growth rate was approximately 65% of its billings growth rate. Given that billings is probably the best indicator of forward revenues, I believe it more likely that Nutanix achieves 40% y/y revenue growth in FY18 (73% of its FY17 billings growth).If we apply a 40% y/y growth rate to FY18 evenly across all quarters (noting that the company will see seasonal variations in growth), we can estimate a much more likely revenue curve for Nutanix that still follows the historical sequential growth linearity while hitting $1.18 billion in FY18 revenues:Figure 5. Nutanix 40% growth scenarioGiven that Nutanix is still in hypergrowth mode and adding new customers at a rapid clip, as well as winning huge deals (the company signed 43 deals greater than $1 million in Q4), the 40% growth scenario in which the company shows no sequential declines is the more likely outcome.The implications for valuation: taking Nutanix's current market cap of $5.35 billion and net cash position of $350 million (enterprise value of $5.0 billion), the company currently only trades at 4.2x EV/FTM revenues assuming $1.18 billion in FY18 revenue. Applying a 5x revenue price target implies a price target of $40, or 16% upside from current levels.With Nutanix stock having doubled from its trough, the trade is ripe for profit-taking. The company's upcoming Q1 release, however, provides an upside catalyst for one more pump in the stock price - especially as its Q1 guidance seems muted.While Nutanix is a fantastic long-term trade that capitalizes on its ability to revolutionize the on-premise data center - and its new offerings, Nutanix Calm and Nutanix Xi Cloud Services, allow for greater interoperability with public cloud infrastructures - its valuation is approaching a peak. I'm holding out for one final push past $40, and will then wait for shares to consolidate before re-evaluating a new longer-term position."
4105489,20521,2017-09-08T20:06:47-04:00,"Nutanix's fourth quarter revenues grew 62% over the year to $226 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $218 million.Net loss of $0.33 came in better than the Street's estimated loss of $0.38 per share.Recent quarterly results and strategic moves suggest that the company may be back on track.","Until earlier this year, there was concern if hyperconverged storage provider Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) could manage to sustain its Billion-Dollar Unicorn status. But recent quarterly results and its strategic moves suggest that the company may be back on track.Nutanix's fourth quarter revenues grew 62% over the year to $226 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $218 million. Billings for the quarter increased 40% to $289.2 million and deferred revenue increased 77% to $526.1 million. Net loss of $0.33 came in better than the Street's estimated loss of $0.38 per share.By segment, product revenues grew 57% to $171.7 million and revenues from support and other services increased 78% to $54.4 million.Nutanix ended the year with revenues growing 72% to $766.9 million. GAAP net loss per share of $3.57 was lower than previous year's GAAP net loss per share of $3.83.For the current quarter, Nutanix forecast revenues of $240-$250 million, significantly ahead of the consensus of $232 million. Net loss was estimated at $0.37, in line with market expectations.The quarter's performance and market confidence in Nutanix is buoyed by its recent tie-up with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Earlier this summer, the company entered a strategic alliance with Google Cloud. The tie-up with Google will allow joint customers to deploy and manage both cloud-based and traditional enterprise applications as a unified public cloud service. They will be able to integrate the Nutanix environment with Google Cloud Platform (NYSE:GCP) and the two companies will partner to address the technology opportunities for building and operating hybrid clouds that integrate the benefits of private cloud architectures with scalable public cloud environments.Enterprise customers will have access to a single click hybrid set-up for managing applications between GCP and Nutanix cloud environments. Customers will be able to provision traditional and cloud-native applications into GCP or Nutanix cloud environments with a single click, and even migrate between the two cloud environments seamlessly.As part of the integration, Nutanix also released Nutanix Xi Cloud Services on GCP. The services allow Nutanix customers to natively extend their datacenter environment into GCP and provide an integrated approach to delivering both traditional Mode 1 and modern Mode 2 applications. It simplifies the process of shifting operations between private and public clouds.Finally, keeping in mind the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) industry, the two companies also agreed to collaborate on use-cases. They will integrate real-time edge intelligence with core cloud computing so that customers will be able to train machine learning models and run analytics.Analysts have been very positive with regard to the deal. Post the announcement, Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron reiterated an Outperform rating on Nutanix shares with a price target of $34.00. Baird analyst Jayson Noland also rated the stock as Outperform with a price target of $28.00.It is currently trading at $22.48 with a market capitalization of $3.25 billion. It had fallen to a 52-week low of $14.38 in April this year. It had listed in October last year at $16 and had climbed to its 52-week high of $46.78 shortly thereafter."
4104089,98236,2017-09-05T08:34:13-04:00,"Nutanix reported the results of its fiscal Q4 last Thursday afternoon.The company reported very strong operational performance with beats in terms of revenues, earnings and cash flow from operations.The company significantly raised its guidance for revenue growth in this current quarter.The company had an exceptionally strong bookings quarter, with bookings growing by 24%  sequentially and reaching 1.28X the amount of recorded revenues.The company enjoyed significant success in strategy of penetrating the Fortune 2000 and saw software revenues grow by 96% year on year and 45% sequentially.","Well, yes it was. Nutanix (NTNX) reported the results of its fiscal Q4 on the last day of August. It might possibly have better held the release until April Fool's Day. Just to reprise, the company exceeded almost all operating metrics and raised revenue guidance quite significantly-and even so developed its revenue forecast assuming a government shutdown and less traction from a key partner. Specifically, revenues for the period reached $226 million, with billings of $289 million. The deferred revenue balance has now reached $526 million, up 77% from the year earlier level.Usually, when a business delivers results that are substantially ahead of its own forecast and prior expectations, analysts try to figure out why. Were the results the product of some special circumstances. Are the results repeatable. Is there a new competitor that is a particular threat to the company's longer-term success? In the balance of this article I will take a crack at answering some of those questions. But sadly for current holders, and an opportunity for those considering the name as an investment, the results of the quarter apparently left negative analysts unpersuaded.One analyst, for example wrote that ""the steady expansion of its software merely adds ""credibility to the narrative."" The analyst went on to write that ""the problem is that Nutanix still suffers from a reputation that it is just a provider of collapsed storage and compute…Moreover, the extent to which the company is able to improve on its image and successfully re-platform its entire enterprise stack and become a defacto enterprise OS play is a tall order and still very much an open question."" The analyst said that ""there are long-term concerns surrounding Nutanix's growth and margin sustainability offset the otherwise constructive view that the company presented in its earnings report."" Basically, without much in the way of credible substantiation, this analyst and other nay-sayers seemingly didn't care about results-and continued to rate the shares based on their own predilections. It would seem, at least from the note from which I quoted, that the actual results, at least to these analysts, are seeming less important than actual results and company guidance.An analyst on this site suggests that Nutanix shares are capped in terms of their share price because of the lack of a path to profitability. Actually, as I will be at pains to show below, last quarter did see some positive traction with regards to expense management. The company has been rather specific that as long as it is in hyper-growth mode, it is going to be reinvesting gross margin dollars in favor of leveraging its market share and its growth rather than its profits. There are many other companies in the IT space with similar strategies whose shares sell at far higher multiples of EV/S. There is, no doubt, a balance between growth and profitability-and it is a rare company in tech that can do both. Again, as I will write about below, the company is pivoting to selling larger deals to larger users. That is an expensive undertaking-but one that makes sense given the company's success with ""land and expand"" and with the penetration of large users in the last couple of quarters.Writing this on Labor Day evening, I think it is worth pointing out that today, Sept. 5th, the company plans to hold a conference call to reset its numbers and guidance to provide for the use of the new 606 accounting standard. While, of course, I do not know the precise nature of the results presented this new way and the new guidance, it is almost certain that the new presentation will show Nutanix to be far more profitable than it has previously reported. In turn that will further reduce guidance and provide a justification for some investors to look more seriously at the shares.For some years now, both the business and share price performance of almost all companies selling enterprise hardware has been miserable. The server market has shown steady declines and even the market for integrated systems (usually described as converged)has reached an asymptote according to most market research. The space has been troubled because of the cloud, because of commoditization and frankly because of lack of innovation.Simply put, Nutanix sells something quite different and has done so since it started out 8 years ago. At this point, the level of disruption and innovation that Nutanix has brought to this space is dramatically under-appreciated by many brokerage analysts-and apparently by many investors. And therein lies the opportunity-one of the more significant opportunities in the IT world to come along in quite some while.Many readers of these blogs are simply looking for buy/hold/sell recommendations. But for those who are not, I strongly commend the interview that CEO Dheeraj Pandey gave to a reporter at Barron's. I think it ought to strike most observers that the CEO believes that he is running a software company and that software will continue to be the growth driver in the future. I simply have no objective evidence to dispute his assertion. The Benzinga analyst who I quoted above, simply doesn't seem to accept any of Mr. Pandy's comments about the direction of the IT hardware space or about the path of the product strategy that Nutanix has been following.Over the next few weeks, I imagine that others besides this writer will take a more objective look at the results the company posted this quarter-and last quarter as well-and come up with different conclusions than were reflected by the share price action on Friday. The market has disdained hardware companies and storage companies for some years now-and for the most part the disdain has been merited. That disdain, however, is now at sharp variance with the actual performance of companies on the forefront of technology. At some point, one assumes, facts will trump predilections when it comes to analysis and share valuation.Why were the shares unchanged in Friday's trading? There is a famous song, from a famous show, called the ""King and I"", by Rogers and Hammerstein titled ""It's a Puzzlement."" The song was initially performed by one of the more famous actors of the era, Yul Brenner and has been reprised many, many times. The song best reflects my own reaction to Friday's share price reaction. At the end of the day, the company beat numbers, significantly raised guidance and presented an outlook for accelerated growth that relates to its overall disruptive capabilities and product differentiation. The market seemed to ignore the reality in favor of looking at outdated and incorrect perceptions.Nutanix shares are remarkably cheap, at least for a company growing at 50% and which have been described by Goldman Sachs as a ""one-in-a decade"" opportunity. The quarter reflected some of the reasons for that enthusiasm. Everything indeed came up roses for this company…except the share price. The shares remain far below where they had traded in the wake of the IPO, or even before the company's quarterly miss back in March. They had hardly spiked going into the numbers. It has been several months since the lock-up concluded. Sometimes markets mis-price securities in illogical ways. About the best I can offer to readers is that the lack of a share price response to the numbers of the quarter and to the company's current valuation is not really capable of being logically explained. It provides investors with an unusual opportunity and one that makes sense to take. I had shares going into the earnings report; I have more shares now.I doubt it. Even some analysts who are negative about the shares recognized the results were strong, the guidance was a substantial raise and that the management was presenting a very positive picture. The conference call was certainly spiced with more than a few congratulatory comments, even from one high profile analyst at Morgan, Stanley who does not currently recommend the shares. Price targets from brokerages rose almost universally. And the CEO presented a series of comments that were attempts to dispel some of the myths about HCI (Hyper-Converge Infrastructure) and how the space is developing in favor of the strategies that Nutanix has adopted.The company handily beat prior expectations in almost all categories related to revenue and costs. Revenues of $226 million beat the company's prior forecast by about 4%. The loss of $.33 non-GAAP was $.05 better than had been projected by the First Call consensus. The company's revenue guidance for Q1 of $240-$250 million is, at the mid-point, about 6% above the prior consensus expectation.The company generated $6 million of operating cash flow (CFFO) in the quarter, which was about double the CFFO of the prior year. The GAAP loss margin for the period was 39% compared to 35% in the prior year. Gross margins were about 57% on a GAAP basis compared to 61% the prior year. The gross margin decline year on year, was entirely a function of the increase in DRAM prices which cost the company 600 bps of margin last quarter according to the CFO.There are plenty of other numbers worthy of discussion and I will touch on some of them below-but they were all good. The 24% sequential increase in billings, which were 1.28X the revenues for the period was considerably greater than company targets for that ratio and were a principle factor in the company achieving a modest level of positive CFFO (Billings growth faster than revenue growth drives deferred revenues which drive cash flow.). The company achieved a 45% increase in software revenues sequentially-for the full year software bookings rose by 96%. I think the quarterly acceleration in software bookings was one of the major accomplishments of this past quarter. The company, sells its own hyper-visor, AHV, which provides it with significant differentiation from the other HCI offerings. AHV bookings rose by 214% based on the number of nodes. The company had a net promoter score of 90 last quarter, one of the highest ratings I have seen in terms of IT vendors for that metric. (Net promoter scores relate to user satisfaction-I have linked to an infographic which depicts just how much of an outlier a score of 90 is.)I quoted above from a note that said that there remains skepticism regarding the company's ability to become more and more of a company that is able to provide software to OEM partners. The facts on the ground are what was reported and not some negative hyperbole conjured by a poorly informed analyst. Software as a percentage of total revenues reached 17% on a rolling four quarter average, an increase of 100 bps sequentially but still far below the company's business model aspiration of 33%. It has been the rapid increase in software sales that has allowed this company to weather the gales of the increase in DRAM costs without a dramatic fall-off in gross margins. Going forward, as software sales continue to rise as a proportion of the total, it is reasonable to anticipate, a healthy increase in gross margins.Operating expenses for the quarter were $217 million, on a GAAP basis. That was an increase of 63% year on year but flat sequentially, and noticeably below the company's forecast provided during the Q3 earnings release. Research and development costs, on a GAAP basis, almost doubled in the last quarter year on year. On the other hand, research and development costs actually declined modestly sequentially, perhaps a function of the company's inability to find enough research and development professionals. Sales and marketing costs were up marginally in Q4 on a sequential basis, which given the massive sequential quarter increase in bookings, and the fact that the quarter was a Q4, represent some indication of positive operating leverage. Year on year, sales and marketing costs rose by 49%. General and administrative costs were up 7% sequentially, but were 60%+ greater than a year earlier.Stock based comp expenses fell quite sharply sequentially from $50 million to $37 million. Self-evidently, operating margin performance this past quarter reflected a better quality in terms of reported numbers, and in turn probably related to lower level of hiring compared to prior periods. As the company gains more confidence that the results in Q2 were more of a blip than a trend, hiring is likely to rise and there may be some growth in stock based comp although this wasn't discussed on the call.The company has provided guidance that calls for a 6.4% sequential quarter increase in revenues at the mid-point. While revenue guidance, as mentioned earlier, represented a noticeable increase from prior expectations, it is quite constrained for a couple of specific factors that are certainly not set in stone.That forecast is predicated on a significantly lower than normal contribution from the normal seasonality in sales to the Federal government at the end of its fiscal year. The CFO said that the company had baked into its projections some factor that related to the potential for a government shut-down. In addition, sales to Dell were stronger last quarter than the company had anticipated and actually surpassed 10% of total bookings. For those familiar with this company, sales to Dell have been considered a risk factor for several years-but in actuality, sales with Dell have shown very strong trends.As many observers have pointed out over the past years, Dell-or VMware (VMW) - is and will be this company's most significant competitor for the foreseeable future. So, few observers had thought that Dell would remain a major customer for Nutanix. The fact that it has ought to suggest, at least to some, that this company has a compelling set of solutions that has provided Dell with an opportunity to sell its hardware that would not be available otherwise without partnering with Nutanix.As mentioned, last quarter Dell contributed a bit more than 10% of bookings, a level above its percentage of bookings in the recent past. The company is not counting on that kind of performance in its quarter ending 10/31. Based on the hints provided by the CFO, these two factors represent perhaps 5%-6% of revenues and potentially set the table for another significant upside.This company has several other major OEM clients who certainly might be reasonably expected to take up the slack, although forecasting the precise cadence of OEM orders is not completely feasible. Business with Cisco (CSCO), where Nutanix supplies software for that company's UCS offering doubled last quarter. The company ought to see some initial business from its recently announced OEM transaction with IBM as well as continued growth of its business with HP Enterprise (HPE). And Lenovo, which was a strong contributor to Q3 results, is also likely to show continued growth, albeit on a lumpy basis.The company is forecasting sequentially flat EPS next quarter. It is forecasting that the dollar amount of gross margins will increase by about $10 million related to higher volumes and that it will incur about $10 million of greater opex. That is almost certainly likely to prove to be conservative, although much relates to the software mix. But if software revenues track strongly this quarter because of the numerous OEM deals that are starting to contribute revenue, then it seems likely that gross margins will start to recover because the impact of DRAM price increases is starting to abate. Further, it also seems likely that there will be no government shutdown this quarter-or that is what I have read most recently-post the Harvey catastrophe and the need to fund relief for those victims-and perhaps the victims to come of pending Hurricane Irma. And given the track of GAAP expenses last quarter, which as I have elaborated were essentially flat sequentially, it seems unlikely that non-GAAP opex will rise by $10 million unless stock base comp falls another $10 million sequentially-not terribly likely I imagine.The concept that the company will be able to ramp expenses rapidly to consume any additional gross margin upside is probably not realistic in a given quarter. Overall, I think the set-up in terms of what to expect, is for an earnings beat-and probably a beat on bookings and reported revenues as well.Since the company's miss in the February quarter, this company has provided an unusual amount of detail on its larger wins. It is unlikely to continue to provide all of the metrics it has been reporting the last couple of quarters, and indeed, it is not totally necessary to do so. Last quarter the company closed 15 significant transactions of greater than $2 million. These deals aggregated $57 million of bookings, up by $12 million or by 26% sequentially. Obviously, the company focus on larger transactions with Global 2000 customers in the wake of the Q2 miss has borne some fruit.Nutanix has always offered virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) that accelerates the performance of both Citrix (CTXS) Xen desktop and VMware Horizon View. Nutanix sales of its VDI solutions shrunk to the lowest percentage of total bookings in the history of Nutanix. This is an important milestone-at least is should be-for most observers as typically VDI is sold in smaller deals to smaller users.I have written about this subject in prior articles about this company. Obviously, it remains a controversial topic and negative analysts are seeking to label this company as a hardware vendor and to suggest that the company will not be able to escape the limitations of those kinds of vendors in terms of sustainable growth and valuation. Of course the company sells appliances. That is currently about half of its business according to the study linked here. And it helps users to deploy and support the appliances that they buy. Nutanix calls what they do a hybrid cloud solution. Essentially, the appliances that Nutanix offers bridge the gap between the efficiency and performance of typical public clouds and legacy enterprise data centers. Some people call the solution a ""data-center in a box."" Nutanix, in addition to selling its appliance also has a software fabric that will unify private and public clouds and delivers lots of simplicity in terms of management. Users can deploy the appliance as a turnkey installation or as software on all leading servers. Nutanix can be used with most relevant hardware, it runs on all virtualization (Acropolis-Hypervisor) platforms and it operates with all of the major public clouds. Because of the architecture of HCI, and Nutanix in particular, users are able to buy and use just the amount of capability they need to have and aren't stuck buying unused capability in advance. Users can deploy Nutanix and then run almost all of the popular software applications currently available. For those interested in the details, I have linked here to the company web site. Nutanix has been selling its own hypervisor called Acropolis for two years now and it is starting to become an increasing component of the company's overall offerings. The company has most recently introduced Calm which is a software offering that can help enterprises manage the applications that run on the Nutanix appliances. It is likely to become a nice add-on in terms of its revenue opportunity.A few months ago, the company announced a partnership with Google which will offer a public cloud service called Xi. Xi will be a service in which the same OS will be used on both sides of a hybrid cloud installation. In some ways, this will blur the boundaries of between the public cloud and user controlled hardware. It is hard to know just what the market might be for this new service and how long it will take before it contributes meaningfully to Nutanix revenue.In addition to Xi, the company is working with Google to develop an offering based on the evolving Kubernetes container management system. Nutanix is developing a version of software which will incorporate Kubernetes with its own offering. Kubernetes, and Container technology are often said to be one of the main future directions of computing. For readers wanting a more thorough understanding than I can provide, I have linked to the Kubernetes site which might give a better explanation of how the product functions-certainly better than I might offer.In terms of its business, as I have written above, the company is going up-market as its most important go to market strategy. Last quarter the company sold a large proportion of its bookings to large users. The company has 7000 customers but 400 of them have bought more than $1 million of product lifetime. The company, last quarter sold its largest deal $11 million) to an unidentified customer who provides business, legal and financial services-perhaps Dun and Bradstreet. The customer already was using Nutanix and this deal was a massive extension of its installation. Despite the well-publicized woes of the retail sector, Nutanix has sold significant deals in that vertical and it is one of the leading verticals using Nutanix infrastructure.Despite the focus on Global 2000, the company continued to sell new name accounts. Overall, over the course of the prior fiscal year, the company about doubled its customer count to more than 7000, and it closed more than 800 new accounts just in the last quarter.Valuing the shares of this company involves more than a bit of guess-work and assumption at this point. Whenever something is in the process of significantly disrupting a particular segment of the IT space, it is simply difficult to figure out just how far it will go and how large it will get to be. At the start of the decade, no one thought the public cloud would achieve the disruption it has, or grow into the revenue stream that it has for many different companies. Of course the opposite is also true in that disruptive technology has both winners and losers-at the start of the decade, storage vendors certainly got more respect than they do at this point. And it also true, that not all disruptive technologies take place on schedule. RFID is still having a bumpy road to broad scale adoption.One thing that is worth noting-specifically with regards to valuation. As mentioned, on Tuesday afternoon, the company will be sharing the results of its new reporting methodology. It is early adopting ASC 606 as of the start of the current fiscal year (8/1). I do not know the magnitude of the change that will be seen in the reported numbers but it is likely to be substantial and will bring the company's reported numbers much closer to break-even. In essence, it will be able to report the revenues from multi-year consumption arrangements which had heretofore been recorded as deferred revenue-or in some cases not reported as all. For companies such as this, that are selling multi-year, major implementations to larger users, the impact is going to be not inconsequential. At least from an optical point of view, the company's valuation will come down. Does that mean investors will rethink what they should pay for Nutanix shares in the absence of any other changes? I really do not know although that kind of share price action has been speculated by some analysts.At the moment, using 152 million shares, as currently forecast by the company. Nutanix has a market capitalization of $3.3 billion. Its current cash balance is about $350 million which yields an enterprise value of just below $3 billion. Current estimates for this fiscal year are about $1.1 billion, or 41% growth. What the number will be given the new 606 rules is not knowable-but it will be significantly higher. Given the major gap between reported bookings and reported revenue which will almost certainly narrow. But currently, the EV/S is just 2.7X. How much should it be? How much of the company's revenue stream will come from recurring sources, i.e. software and services? How long will the company continue to see growth above 50%?I do not think anyone can really answer all of those questions at this moment absent second-sight, a commodity in short supply and one that I certainly make no claims to have. I will leave this segment, simply by saying, that software companies with this type of growth outlook, or even with noticeably slower growth outlooks, that are equally without profits, are selling for EV/S ratios of 6X-11X.I have presented some detailed analysis of the quarterly evolution of this company's major expense categories. Obviously a company that has operating expenses of 96% of revenues on a GAAP basis, or even,80.5% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis will not soon reach profitability. Those ratios will change for the better with the adoption of the ASC 606 rule-but by how much, is not quite known at this point. The companies most significant outlier in terms of expenses is sales and marketing which was 53% of revenues on a non-GAAP basis in Q4. Again, the issue with regards to profitability is going to be the future track of software revenues as a percentage of the total and how that will eventually impact gross margins. Spending 53% of revenues on sales and marketing makes total sense given the company's ability to actually land and expand, and given the increased amount of software the company has in its mix.It is expected that the company will be revising its business model goal in conjunction with the release of its 606 presentation. AT this point, valuing the shares of Nutanix on the basis of earnings is quite premature and doesn't present a valid picture of the company's overall evolution.The company has been generating a modest amount of cash flow from operations during the past several quarters, and that was the case in Q4. The positive cash flow generation is a function of stock based comp and the rapid increase in deferred revenue balances which are offsetting the company's GAAP losses. As the result of the company's very rapid growth, some balance sheet items that correlate strongly with revenue were also a major use of funds-in particular accounts receivable. That was offset during this last quarter, for the most part, by accrued compensation expense and other accruals.Cash flow going forward is going to be influenced by changes in the level of reported GAAP loss, offset by stock based comp and the increase in deferred revenues. The new ASC 606 rules will not impact cash flow-although I do expect to see CFFO track higher, over time given the strong trajectory of bookings.At this point, I do not have enough data or company input to readily forecast CFFO going forward. My best guess is that even without material improvement in GAAP operating earnings, both stock based comp and deferred revenue balances will rise by enough to significantly increase CFFO next year-but by how much is really unknowable at this point.The company has a modest level of capex-running at about $50 million/year. I think it is possible that free cash flow might approach $100 million in this current fiscal year.I do not want to minimize the fact that any company in a new space, offering new products and different solutions has some risk. While virtualization is a well-accepted and widespread technology at this point, its use on such a wide scale is perhaps a leap in the dark at some level.And whatever else is the case, Nutanix does make hardware-and in a general sense, hardware in the IT space is simply not a growth area at this point. The fact is that the hardware business is not an area one might pick for sustained high growth. The fact is that there will always be concerns regarding commoditization or gross margins risks in evaluating companies such as this.But overall, the preponderance of the evidence suggests that this company and its management have a significant technology advantage over the other competitors offering some flavor of hyper-converged technology. And based on the empirical evidence, it seems that the company is using its technology to forge partnerships with hardware vendors who will wind up buying the company's hypervisor and other bits and pieces of its software. It is potentially a model that will almost certainly lead to lots of revenue growth for the next several years and is likely to see a fair level of growth both in reported earnings and in cash flow as well. The failure of the shares to react to the company's very strong operational performance has afforded users an excellent opportunity-one that does not come along that often. The percentage upside in these shares is as great as anything in my current coverage universe."
4141049,98236,2018-01-29T17:56:00-05:00,"Nutanix shares have pulled back sharply from a high above $38.The pullback has been based initially on dilution concerns from a convertible debt offering.Subsequently, the shares were downgraded by JPMorgan Chase and fell another 8%-plus.At this point, the shares based on an EV/S comp with other fast growing software vendors are at a considerable discount.The downgrade on which the share pullback has been based in whole or part is not well supported by the available facts and does not represent credible analysis.","I do not find it useful all that often to comment on the work of other analysts and observers. After all markets are made by differences of opinion. Sadly, I get things wrong on more than a few occasions. But I do try to be logical in my presentations and to use the available evidence in drawing inferences and making conclusions. When professional analysts desert that cannon, it becomes worthwhile to comment. And this is really one of those situations.The other day, Mark Murphy, a senior analyst at JPMorgan, downgraded the shares of Nutanix (NTNX) from hold to sell. Those events happen - just about any company whose shares are up by more than 100% in eight months-plus is going to attract a few downgrades. But this downgrade was not based on price, but on concerns regarding the company’s operational performance. Again, having been an analyst myself for many years prior to semi-retirement, I have my own standards as to how the work ought to be done. And this is one way not to do it. If indeed the analyst has some specific knowledge that this quarter is one that's not going well for Nutanix it might be fair for him to share that with his readers. But so far as it goes, there is no such indication and perhaps the opposite is true. I will discuss the company’s recent $500 million private placement of zero coupon convertibles - but suffice to say it seems terribly unlikely that sophisticated institutions would have been willing to loan money to Nutanix on a zero coupon basis with both a 33% conversion premium and a collar if management had not at least intimated in some fashion that the quarter was progressing at or above internal expectations. I can’t imagine an institution who would not get that part of due-diligence right.One thing that observers have to do, is to rank the performance of those making prognostications for a living. And I have always found it becoming for an analyst to comment about his/her record of past insight and what facts have changed. Failure to do either destroys any sense of perspective. The fact is that analyst Murphy initiated his coverage of Nutanix shortly after it went public - JPMorgan not surprisingly was part of the underwriting group. The initiation was a hold and the analyst had maintained that rating for the last 15 months. The question is - has something changed in that time?Quite a bit, at various points in time, but almost certainly for the better. A track record of maintaining a hold rating on shares that opened on a spike, then collapsed, and have now rescinded suggests either disinterest or a lack of understanding of the business on the part of the analyst. Missing all of a move substantially greater than 100% is not a track record that ought to inspire confidence in the opinions of this analyst on this company.I do not profess to know how this quarter will turn out for Nutanix. Certainly, the environment for selling hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) overall has been positive and is likely to remain so. The market space, according to most market researchers, continues to expand at rates near or above 50%/year in almost all studies. Leading companies are likely to be garnering outsize gains - if for no other reason but they are leading companies. If they also are blessed with having superior technology - and I would argue that Nutanix is in that position - they are highly likely to produce results better than their forecast most quarters. The leading competitor of Nutanix is VMWare (NYSE:VMW). These companies may be best said to be mortal rivals in the space, more or less on the same order as the rivalries of professional sports teams. I will address a view of that rivalry somewhat later in this article - at this point it is enough to say that when VMWare last reported its numbers about two months ago, it said that license bookings that include its HCI offering as well as VxRail, its HCI hardware appliance, grew by 150% year on year. Without belaboring the point, or trying to specifically address market share issues here, it seems safe to say that the environment for selling hyper-converged solutions is as robust as it ever has been. I would argue that it is likely that at this point most companies with competitive products in the HCI space are going to be beneficiaries of a strongly rising tide, and that surely includes Nutanix as well.Nutanix has sold software-only solutions for years. And so far as that goes, it principal competitor VMW also has sold software only solutions. From the start of its life as a public company (and really before, I imagine) Nutanix has talked about raising its software percentage, although, to be fair, initially the concept was to do so incrementally. In the interview I had with management a few months ago, the concept of a more complete and comprehensive pivot to a software model was presented. Later, the company’s IR presented a chart deck showing just how much value could be unlocked should Nutanix move to a software-only model. The point of this history is to suggest that Nutanix has been preparing its transition for some time now and there's no evidence that it has experienced difficulties in the transition. And logically, there is no reason why it should.The company for many years now has packaged commodity hardware with what many consider to be its industry leading set of software solutions. Most users really are not particularly interested in buying pass-through hardware from Nutanix. They have many choices in putting together their own HCI or in buying a complete system from one of many vendors who offer Nutanix software. One of the positive elements of the pivot, at least from my perspective and those of other investors, is that it puts the company in the enviable position of having multiple channels that are all trying to sell users on its software. Users can buy Nutanix solutions from Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), from HPE (NYSE:HPE), from IBM (NYSE:IBM), from Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) and even from Dell/EMC. I have linked to a couple of discussions as to just how those partnerships work.Moving to a software-only sales paradigm is basically more of the same and removing an offering of commodity hardware which is a pass-through with no margin for Nutanix from the mix is likely to simply rather than complicate the sales process. It is reasonable to believe that in many bidding situations, Nutanix will be offered by multiple SIs and hardware vendors and will ultimately improve its competitive win rates. It is very difficult for this writer to understand how the software-only model, which is a continuation of past practice, is going to create any near-term business disruption. In fact, I would argue that the opposite is more likely the case as the company will no longer be trying to compete at any level with its own partners.Last November, in discussing the company’s transition, its CEO discussed how the transition would enable “tinkerers” to have friction-free access to Nutanix technology. He also addressed issues of process refinement, sales compensation software downloads, license management and specific new tools for those tinkerers at the top of the sales funnel. It seems more like Nutanix has carefully choreographed this transition and it is likely to go off with fewer than normal disruptions.Like many other software vendors, the company is moving to a subscription model for some of its offering products, although that is probably less feasible for products sold to OEM partners. The company, as the CFO put it on the conference call, will simply step aside in a straightforward fashion from hardware-only invoicing and will enable the company’s legacy appliance manufacturers to begin selling the NX hardware directly to distributors. It is just hard to understand how letting its partners directly invoice customers is going to be disruptive or even noticeable to most customers.Next year, the company will be offering what it calls X-I Cloud Services on a subscription basis. It is going to be far easier to move to a subscription software model absent the hardware baggage that has been part of the company’s offering.As I see it, the company has certainly tried to articulate the cadence of the transition and many of the specifics of how it has intended to proceed in terms of the specifics of an all-software model. The estimates in the consensus would appear to accurately reflect the move from the current hardware/software mix to all software over the next year or 18 months. Interestingly, while the JPMorgan analyst team proclaimed that they feared for potential sales disruptions, those fears did not extend so far as to provide investors with an alternative estimate when it comes to the current quarter or even beyond.A shange in sales leadership - but it happened in NovemberOftentimes, investors are concerned when they see turmoil in a company’s senior ranks - particularly in the ranks of sales management. But the correlation between change and disruption is not all that high. A few months ago, Hortonworks (HDP) announced a change in its sales leadership a few days before the end of the quarter. The shares sold off-and truth to tell - I got shaken out of my commitment. Bad move on my part.The skill set needed to run sales organizations varies substantially with the size of a business and it is not uncommon that a career path which jumps from star sales performer to a sales leader will stall because the individual lacks the skill set needed to run a larger organization. Nutanix has been increasing both its revenues and the size of its sales organization at a dizzying rate. It's a recognition of the inevitable, I believe, more than it is a sign of turmoil that there have been changes in sales leadership. Back in early September 2017, the head of sales for the Americas left the company. Specifically, why that happened is unknown, but the odds are that the individual in question was fired or asked to resign. The results for the fiscal quarter that ended 10/31 didn’t show signs of sales disorganization.On November 2, Nutanix appointed Lou Atlanasio as its chief revenue officer, or VP of sales. He got hired specifically because he has managed global teams that have sold software at scale. Prior to his appointment by Nutanix, Mr. Atlanasio was VP of sales for Informatica, a software company that went private in 2014, with revenues of more than $1 billion at that time. Prior to that, he worked for IBM as a global software sales leader. Later in November, Nutanix hired Sherry Lauterbach as senior vice president of North American Sales. Ms. Lauterbach, as it happens, had been a sales leader at IBM for more than 20 years. It is probably reasonable to imagine that Ms. Lauterbach and Mr. Atlanasio knew each other and had worked on various projects together. Given IBM’s track record and its management culture, it is not terribly surprising to find numbers of disaffected IBM sales leaders ready to find a new home. Missing numbers quarter after quarter and somehow being prevented from remediating the issues is probably a turn-off for many high-energy, high-skilled people. On the other hand, the possibility exists that these hires were themselves part of the problem. But the odds are, that in a lengthy selection process, Nutanix has obtained significant upgrades to its sales leadership team.When I initially did my due diligence on Nutanix - not that long ago as it happens - one comment I heard was that the product was good enough to sell itself. Another comment that I heard was that the company was growing so rapidly that it didn’t have sophisticated sales management systems in place and that it needed more “adult supervision” in the sales process. There are almost surely more senior software sales opportunities than competent sales leaders in the space - it isn’t just Nutanix that has seen its sales and need for sales professionals rise rapidly. Will these specific appointments derail Nutanix's sales execution? I doubt it, given how common this kind of leadership evolution is when looking at rapidly growing companies. What would worry me far more is if the company didn’t make appointments of senior sales leaders from outside its organization and tried to make due with individuals who might be left in place beyond the limits of their competence. Again, I have no particular knowledge of how the Nutanix quarter is closing. Nor, do I suspect, that the team of JPMorgan analysts have any specific knowledge either. But I view the sales appointments as a sign of orderly progression and not as either a symptom of disruption or an indication of sales execution issues ahead.Less than two weeks ago, Nutanix announced that it was making a private placement of $400 million of debentures. Demand proved to be greater than anticipated and the offering was raised to $500 million. Just to recapitulate, these debentures, which are due in 2023, bear no interest and are convertible at around $50/share. Part of the proceeds of the debentures will be used to consummate hedge transactions which essentially would limit dilution and cap the upside of purchasers.The purchasers of these investors are all institutions, of course, and all of them would have done at least some due diligence with regard to Nutanix and its prospects and its current business. The only way investors in the debentures get a yield of any kind is for substantial share price appreciation of Nutanix. At the time the notes were sold, the premium was 33% - it is now about 50%. While Nutanix is obviously constrained from specific disclosures during the offering process, the fact that demand was so strong as to lead to a greater offering size must clearly suggest that buyers of the debentures liked what they heard. Indeed, from the perspective of this writer, they must have liked the presentation quite a bit, given just how the terms work out. No doubt, there are debt investors who will be willing to take on some risk in order to obtain capital appreciation, but these (corporate debt buyers) are typically careful buyers who eschew risk, not like the typical buyer of Nutanix shares. The idea that they can’t figure out risk or that they would be willing to buy securities in the midst of disruptive situations is more than a bit far-fetched.Overall, and looking at a final offering of $575 million of debentures including overallotments, the debentures could be converted into about 11.5 million shares of Nutanix shares. At the end of October 2017, Nutanix had about 157 million shares of stock outstanding. It also had net cash on the balance sheet of $365 million and has been generating a modest amount of cash. So, this offering wasn’t based on any particular need for liquidity but clearly on the desire of management to broaden the company’s offerings.Given the terms, the debentures will dilute current shareholders by a bit less than 7%. Of course, dilution implies significant earnings. The question becomes what might Nutanix do with the net proceeds of the debentures. Nutanix, as part of its strategy, is moving to become a multi-product company. I will not go through any detailed exposition of its product strategy at this point, but it seems reasonable to believe that the company will broaden its product footprint significantly and further develop its competitive moat through strategic acquisitions. I think this management is well qualified to identify high growth opportunities in adjacencies and to effectively integrate additional solutions into its stack. Again, the devil, as the saying goes, will be in the specifics, which of course are not knowable at this point. But rather than the debentures being a dilutive transaction, the odds are, I believe, that the cash infusion from their sale will hasten the company’s path to profitability.Nutanix, even after the last several days of share price pressure, has appreciated substantially from lows set last spring. There are those who have written about the “good news and the software pivot being priced in.” Another way to consider the matter is that Nutanix shares were priced at absurd levels last spring based on mis-placed fears about competition from Dell and concerns about sales execution that have not and are not likely to materialize. I have no intention of reprising the Nutanix “story” at this point-but the company is still the leader or in second place depending on definitions - in one of the faster growing segments of the IT world.There will be issues in optics over the next several quarters. The company will eliminate 26% of its revenue from its P&L. On the other hand, gross margins ought to rise by about one-third over the next 18 months or so. For the moment, I will disregard the convertible issue in the EV/S calculation. I think it is more relevant to look at estimates for fiscal year 2019, when most if not all of the transition to all-software sales will be complete. The company’s 2019 fiscal year ends on 7/31 of that year. The current First Call consensus sales estimate for that period is $1.27 billion, and by that point, presumably more than 95% of revenues of Nutanix will be software and services, with some significant fraction coming from subscriptions. The company currently has a market capitalization of $5.1 billion, and with the cash on the balance sheet as of October, its enterprise is around $4.8 billion. So, its EV/S ratio based on FY ’19 consensus revenue estimates is less than 4X. That's exceptionally modest for a software vendor, with a leadership position in its space that probably will be growing at 35%-plus on an apples to apples basis for several years and with a noticeable improvement in operating margins.Is the software pivot priced in? I hardly think so. Software companies with far slower growth than Nutanix have double or more the EV/S - although to be fair in order to do a straightforward calculation, I have used fiscal 2019 estimates which are basically off by two quarters in terms of comparing EV/S ratios. I think that Nutanix shares, far from being fully valued, remain a very attractive investment. I would recommend that investors stay the course and take advantage of this kerfuffle. The shares are still poised to produce lots of positive alpha over the coming year."

In the aftermath of a strong beat-and-raise quarter that ended a stellar fiscal year for Nutanix, the market shrugged off the stock, keeping it flat at a bargain price of $22.Despite the market's bored reaction to the stock, opinions of it are anything but. Like many of its high-growth, money-losing tech cousins, Nutanix stock has generated plenty of controversy and debate among investors, with some believing it's a penny stock that will cash-burn its way into the grave, and others thinking it's the ""next big thing.""I believe the evidence points to the latter - for a deep dive into Nutanix's business and fundamentals, see my previous article. In this article, we'll dissect Nutanix's Q4 and fiscal year-end results, what they signal in the context of the company's long-term future, and growth opportunities that lie ahead.Nutanix is still trading at a mere ~2.6x FTM revenues (software peers trade between 6x and 7x revenues), a bargain given its technological dominance over hyperconverged infrastructure and the hybrid cloud movement. I reiterate that a more appropriate range for the stock (balancing its software-like growth with its lower hardware margins) lies between 4.5x and 5x, or $33 and $36, implying a 50%+ upside from current levels.Tech stocks with Nutanix's growth potential tend to break out all at once, rewarding investors who stick it out during stagnant phases. Nutanix's stellar Q4, combined with an anemic post-release market reaction, presents an incredible buying opportunity into a company that has quickly become a critical facet of modern IT infrastructure.Nutanix's Q4 and full-year results paint a pretty obvious picture: the company is growing at a rocket-like pace, faster than the majority of other software companies at its scale.Below is a chart showing Nutanix's growth glide path:Figure 1. NTNX quarterly growth metricsAs seen above in red, Nutanix also initiated Q1 guidance of $240-250 million; though given its history of beating the high end of its guidance, it's more than likely the company will exceed $250 million and thus enter the rarified club of $1bn+ run-rate companies.Nutanix also delivered positive OCF this quarter, due to its massively lucrative upfront billings, and despite its large GAAP losses. 2017 OCF of $13.8 million, while still a slim margin of sales, is up nearly four times from the prior year's $3.6 million, showing that Nutanix is committed to delivering operating leverage along with growth.The charts below taken from Nutanix's Q4 earnings supplement present a good visual illustration of the company's ability to slice its losses down year on year:Customer metrics also looked healthy in the quarter. Nutanix added 879 clients (some marquee names: Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA)), bringing its total to over 7,000.Figure 2. NTNX customer countsCustomers continue to skew in favor of large deployments; in Q4, Nutanix landed 43 seven-figure deals (deals with annual billings in excess of $1 million). This figure is up +39% y/y and continues to illustrate the fact that Nutanix isn't going after small fish - it's aiming at the large enterprise market, which has sophisticated technology needs within the hybrid cloud realm. Currently, Nutanix counts 25% of the Global 2000 as its customers. Its relatively low penetration in its self-defined market implies quite a bit more room for growth.Large customers also keep coming back to Nutanix to purchase additional nodes and expand their infrastructure. As seen in the chart below, among other impressive statistics, 70% of Nutanix's business derives from repeat customers.A couple more qualitative points from the quarter illustrate Nutanix's increased penetration into the IT landscape.First, it announced a partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform. While GCP is the smallest of the three public cloud platforms (with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS being first, and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure second), it does indicate the validity of Nutanix's pitch to enterprises: that they need a ""hybrid cloud"" approach, with a portion of their workloads housed in the private cloud and another portion in the so-called private cloud. CNBC also noted how the two infrastructure options are becoming more and more used in tandem, solidifying Nutanix's place as top dog in the private cloud, similar to AWS's position in the public cloud.Second, in Nutanix's core use case of virtualization, the company reported a startling 75% y/y increase in the use of its own hypervisor, the Acropolis Hypervisor (AHV). In its earlier days, Nutanix was primarily being used in conjunction with VMware's (NYSE:VMW) hypervisors, as VMware was then seen as the ubiquitous force in virtualization. Nutanix, embracing the open platform much like Microsoft Windows, allowed integration with VMware products, while quietly selling competing hypervisors of its own (For the non-technical, a hypervisor is the control layer that allows IT administrators to manage virtual machines). Now, Nutanix's native AHV has picked up steam, indicating that along with greenfield growth in replacing legacy servers, the company can also derive growth from stealing virtualization market share from VMware.The market has discounted both the qualitative and quantitative victories announced this quarter. Nutanix shows no signs of slowing down, yet the stock has gone nowhere.NTNX data by YChartsNow, following a tremendous quarter and all signs pointing to continued growth, would be an excellent time to load up on shares, before the rest of the market wakes up and realizes they've left one of software's only value names behind."
4098579,103480,2017-08-14T07:21:44-04:00,"Ever since popping more than 2x in its September 2016 IPO, Nutanix shares have fallen by the wayside, as investors seem to ignore its massive growth and market-leading position.Right now, Nutanix is being comped against commodity storage providers with little IP, bearing a low valuation that doesn't give it credit for its extremely differentiated hyperconverged software.Contrary to popular belief, Nutanix is well-guarded from cannibalization from cloud vendors, as its private cloud approach makes the Nutanix platform marketable to a different set of customers.Nutanix has ample room for long-term growth as a distinguished leader in a greenfield market with few viable alternatives.The stock offers beaten-down value in an otherwise expensive market with crowded tech trades.","Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) is a puzzle for most investors, both from a technical and investment perspective. It's not exactly a low-margin hardware company that manufactures boring chips and peripherals, but neither is it a recurring revenue software company with monthly SaaS billings.Its valuation and trading multiples seem to reflect the prevailing narrative of the day - immediately after its IPO, as investors bid shares up to the mid-$40s, the market saw it as a revolutionary software product with enviable growth. Then, the shares crashed below $20, as investors increasingly began to focus on the commodity hardware component and its position in a decidedly unattractive segment of IT, storage. Indeed the market has not been receptive to storage technology plays, punishing Tintri (TNTR) and having long forgotten about its older cousins Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP).But Nutanix is not just any flash storage vendor like the rest, selling legacy solutions to cram more data into inefficient datacenters. Nutanix was the first company to commercialize the idea of hyperconverged infrastructure (a technique long used internally by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to manage big datasets internally), which applies highly advanced software running on cheap commodity hardware to turn standard datacenters into lean, modern workhorses capable of handling the immense challenges posed by Big Data and the associated spikes in IT workloads. Nutanix's thought leadership in revolutionizing the datacenter - through software, not hardware - has won it the love of customers as well as monstrous revenue growth, up nearly 2x in the last fiscal year. The company is on pace to reach $750mm in revenues this year (it reports Q4/FY17 results on August 30), and is likely on track to reach >$1bn in revenues next year, a staggering scale for a company whose market cap is still a polite $3.3bn.Nutanix is king of the so-called ""private cloud"", addressing a large (~$100bn) market currently littered with ancient legacy technology. With less than 1% of this market's current spend, Nutanix is just getting started. IT leaders are increasingly under pressure to upgrade their systems to whatever is new and exciting, as IT increasingly becomes a C-suite agenda item and a magnet for headlines. Nutanix is the undisputed ""cool kid"" in a stagnant arena of decidedly unsexy names: Dell, HP (NYSE:HPE), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), EMC, VMware (NYSE:VMW), and the like.Nor is Nutanix subject to direct competition from public cloud vendors such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. Public cloud serves a different set of use cases (namely, noncore workloads and adjunct applications involving minimal critical or private data), and large enterprises desiring security and control turn to Nutanix's private cloud solution to re-jigger the bulk of their datacenters. A large part of the valuation error in Nutanix's decline is due to the mistaken belief that Nutanix is a non-cloud (and therefore, non-growth) vendor - a few more quarters of outperformance should show investors that this is not the case.Currently trading at slightly under 3x forward revenues (a stark discount to software peers trading at >6x), Nutanix is properly valued around 4.5-5x ($33-36), the slight discount owing to its lower margins and non-recurring revenue base relative to its more expensive SaaS peers. For patient investors willing to wait for Nutanix's narrative to self-correct into more of a software story, and willing to trust in the technical brilliance of its product, NTNX stock offers a solid long-term bet on an increasingly data-driven world and a long runway for double-digit returns.NTNX data by YChartsWe'll start fleshing out this thesis by taking a high-level conceptual look at Nutanix's product and why it's seeing the massive growth rates we observe in the quarterly results. The numbers, after all, are only as valuable as the underlying drivers.The classic enterprise datacenter, operating on legacy equipment by the likes of Cisco, HP, and VMware, typically contains dedicated server clusters for each of the four core functions: storage, compute, networking, and virtualization. Each function operated in a walled-off ""silo,"" with separate technical teams to handle the different silos, making this architecture expensive and subject to failure, if any of the silos experienced downtime.Nutanix was among the first to popularize hyperconverged infrastructure for the datacenter, in which its proprietary software instructs datacenter servers to combine all four functions, removing the silos and allowing each server to run in a parallel cluster. No specialized equipment is needed - standard x86 servers (commodity hardware, sold cheaply by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)) running on Nutanix software can execute this hyperconverged infrastructure. An outside study by IDC has confirmed that the redefined Nutanix architecture lowers IT's TCO (total cost of ownership) of an enterprise datacenter by a whopping 60%. Versus servers residing in a public cloud format, Nutanix offers cost savings of 30%.Figure 1. Nutanix architecture (left) and common use cases (right)Source: Nutanix websiteHow does hyperconvergence allow datacenters to scale down costs so drastically? Simply put, it allows privately hosted datacenters to achieve cloud's agility for scaling usage up and down. Traditional IT failed in predicting and allocating compute resources, failing frequently during peak usage due to lack of resources and overspending on excess resources when usage was light. Hyperconvergence, due to its ability to have every server (""nodes"") in the system running at full functionality, allows IT administrators to easily ""turn off"" or ""turn on"" nodes as resources are needed.The cloud can do this already, but company executives are loath to put trade secrets and highly private data into public clouds, where the risks of breach are unknown. This is why Nutanix brands itself as a ""private cloud"" - the agility of the cloud offered in the privacy of your own datacenter.Nutanix, therefore, does not compete directly with cloud vendors. It markets itself to workloads that are too sensitive to be placed in the cloud. It will be decades - perhaps even never - before executives are comfortable dumping these workloads into AWS. The world is increasingly espousing this hybrid cloud model (prominent among large companies evangelizing hybrid cloud is JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the first large financial services company to announce moves into the cloud), where a portion of IT is housed in the public cloud and the remaining portion in a ""private cloud"" in company-owned datacenters.In the on-prem/""private cloud"" world, Nutanix's main competitors (VMware, Cisco) are viewed as behind the times, giving NTNX an edge in stealing market share and converting customers from legacy products into its hyperconverged public cloud. According to its S-1, Nutanix operates in several markets that IDC estimates to have combined annual spend over $100bn, of which $50bn comprises of server equipment, $45bn comprises of storage systems, and $5bn in virtualization infrastructure. With its revenues approaching ""only"" $1bn, Nutanix is just getting started and is well poised to continue gaining IT mindshare and a larger slice of the huge server market. It could very well be the Cisco (current market cap: $158bn, though we'll see if that can last) of 2020 - all technology giants began as expert leaders in a growing niche, before coming to dominate entire swaths of the industry. Hyperconvergence is a good place to start.A lot of investor pessimism surrounding Nutanix revolves around its revenue model, which, to be fair, is not the golden recurring revenue-style billings that investors prize. Nutanix generates one-time product revenue from sales of its integrated systems; that is, commodity hardware running Nutanix software.Yes, SaaS recurring revenue streams are extremely valuable - steady, predictable, and profitable. But why do you need a monthly or annual contract when Nutanix's customers, on average, spend 3.6x the initial purchase over their lifetime? And much more for certain large customers - Toyota Motors (NYSE:TM), for example, spent 23.6x its initial purchase since launching with Nutanix in 2013.SaaS companies that are extremely successful typically see expansion rates of 20% or 30%, as customers add on new products during renewals - but this revenue stream comes over time, and investors do not value companies over a 20-year horizon. With a customer like Toyota, Nutanix was able to pack 2,400% expansion into the space of just a few years. Who needs a SaaS contract when customers end up buying more of their own volition?This is why I think of Nutanix's sales strategy as ""deepening"" and ""widening"" its customer base. It ""deepens"" relationships with existing customers and extracts massive amounts of billings from them over time, even if the revenue is not contractually recurring. It also ""widens"" the base by increasing its customer counts by an impressive number each quarter - see chart below:Figure 2. NTNX customer adds by quarterThe bulk of Nutanix's revenue comes from established, sophisticated Fortune 500 companies making educated moves into improving their IT infrastructure. Nutanix does not rely heavily on beefing up revenue via the SMB channel, where IT purchases are highly variable and customers extremely flighty. Nutanix's roster of top-tier logos not only validates the technical value of its solutions but also affirms the strength and non-contractual reliability of its revenue base. See below a customer logo sheet from Nutanix's website:Figure 3. NTNX indicative customer listAs you can see, Nutanix's customer base runs the gamut from Fortune 500 industrials to tech giants and even municipal and federal orgs (fourth logo from top left: the U.S. Army!). The largesse of Nutanix's customer base (over 6,000 names) and the venerable brand names it has collected validate its technical strengths and encourage other IT leaders to pilot deployments of Nutanix, at least in small chunks, in their own data centers. Once deployed, customers typically scale up their Nutanix nodes dramatically and shift an increasing amount of workloads into this cheaper, more efficient datacenter architecture.Now let's dig into the numbers and see where Nutanix lies on the spectrum of balancing growth vs. profitability.First, growth:Figure 4. NTNX revenue/billings growth by quarterNote: Nutanix's fiscal year ends July 31. The last reported quarter, 3Q17, ended on April 30, 2017.Nutanix has achieved outstanding growth rates since it began reporting in 1Q15. On an annualized basis, it has achieved y/y growth in excess of 60% since 2015, a truly remarkable feat for a company on track to post $750mm in revenues for FY17. On a sequential basis, it has routinely achieved high double-digit growth.An apparent slowdown occurs in 3Q17 with sequential growth rates decelerating to 5%, but this isn't too concerning - recall that Nutanix's 3Q covers February through April, a time period where IT buying (especially for large upfront costs like Nutanix) slows down due to the beginning of corporate budget resets. Sequential growth should pick up steam again in 4Q17.On the billings front, billings growth has also tracked nicely ahead of revenue through 1Q17 (recall that billings is effectively a measure of one-year ""backlog"" for a software company), indicating a strong revenue growth pipeline through at least 1Q18. Billings in dollar terms have exceeded revenue in every quarter, signaling that Nutanix's quarterly deal activity is stuffing the backlog channel rather than draining it down.Next, we'll turn to profitability:Figure 5. NTNX operating margins by quarterAs can be seen from this chart, Nutanix's growth comes at high cost. GAAP operating losses have remained stubbornly high, with margins seemingly stuck in the -50% range.This is not necessarily a bad thing, as Nutanix is spending primarily on sales and marketing to push its product into the market. Within enterprise technology, perhaps no investment is as critical to the life or death of a company as the strength of its sales force. Furthermore, Nutanix has sufficient cash to fund several years of burn - as of April 2017, Nutanix had $350 million of cash on the books. The company is also marginally profitable from an operating cash flow standpoint, due to the large upfront nature of its billings; in FY16, it generated $3.6 million in OCF, and in the first nine months of FY17, it generated $7.9 million.Capex investments bring free cash flow (and thus true ""burn"") into the negative ~$30 million range for the first nine months of FY17, but all told, Nutanix's liquidity affords it about a decade's worth of burn at this rate.And note one other highlight on the margin side: G&A spending, generally the most ""wasteful"" and least productive of spend that can be slimmed down by a disciplined management team, has made meaningful strides in slimming down. In 1Q15, G&A consumed 12% of spend; in 3Q17, only 8%. While the absolute numbers may seem insignificant, this represents a 50% improvement in two years, and at a $750 million revenue scale, 4% translates into $30 million - certainly not nothing.Overall, Nutanix is still a company in ""grow and burn"" mode, and investors will have to closely watch how the company's massive spending is translating into top-line growth, particularly on the sales efficiency front. However, its losses don't trigger any immediate red flags - it's nowhere near as alarming as a company like Snap (NYSE:SNAP), where ballooning losses are accompanied by decelerating user and revenue growth.The valuation discussion surrounding Nutanix revolves entirely around whether to view it as a software company or as a storage company. Against a peer set of software companies, Nutanix appears extremely cheap; while against a peer set of storage companies, it seems overvalued.The truth is that Nutanix combines elements of both: it has the high-growth, rapid billings, ""land and expand"" model into enterprise customers, and most importantly technological leadership elements of high-quality software companies. On the other hand, it also behaves like a storage company due to its lower gross margins (owing to being a hardware vendor).Nutanix, however, is evolving into more of a software company. While it originally focused on selling integrated hardware/software solutions in a turnkey Nutanix appliance, it has stated its intention to grow its software-only sales, securing partnerships with OEMs that produce the server hardware loaded with Nutanix software.Let's first examine Nutanix versus other storage peers:Figure 6. NTNX trading comps, storage groupNote on methodology: Forward revenues are based on an extrapolation of management guidance; balance sheet figures are taken from the most recent quarter and market cap is based on close of trading on August 11.Against fellow storage companies, Nutanix shares look expensive. Pure Storage, which is at a similar revenue scale to Nutanix but at a lower growth rate, trades almost a turn lower than Nutanix. NetApp, which is far larger and has actually achieved profitability, is looking even cheaper.Bear in mind, however, that Nutanix's software leadership is unprecedented in this group, and that its technical prowess has awarded it superior growth relative to NetApp, which is struggling with a relatively flat top line.Next let's turn to Nutanix's software comps, comparing it against a peer set of infrastructure software companies (note that infrastructure software tends to trade slightly cheaper than application software) with similar growth and scale profiles:Figure 7. NTNX trading comps, infrastructure software groupRelative to this peer set, Nutanix looks like a downright bargain. It is growing at a much faster clip than any other company in this peer group besides Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), its operating losses are right around the average of the group, and it's not weighed down by debt. Yet it's trading at only about 3x forward revenues while the rest of the group trades at twice that.The market is evidently confused about which group Nutanix should belong to. At the moment, heavy selling is putting Nutanix much closer toward the storage group, but recall that for several months after its IPO, investors were very excited about its software component and awarded Nutanix software-like multiples. Going forward, Nutanix's transition into standalone software sales and OEM partnerships should give it more profitable SaaS-like characteristics.Its true valuation should lie somewhere between the two extremes, a multiple around 4.5-5x (not a stretch, given Nutanix's trading history), implying a price target of $33-36.The datacenter is undergoing a massive, yet quiet revolution unknown to the general masses, as consumer-facing breakthroughs in VR and autonomous driving tend to grab hold of the technology headlines. But make no mistake: the cloud's impact on the enterprise datacenter is just as jarring of a shift in the technology landscape as the sensational gadgets are.Interestingly, the cloud has had a bifurcated impact on IT: while it has caused a migration of certain workloads and data toward the massive public clouds housed by Amazon and Microsoft, it has also caused demand for cloud-like services and capabilities within private datacenters. The proliferation of this demand for agile, yet secure infrastructure capabilities, has turned Nutanix from a startup into the next big thing in IT.Each time the IT landscape undergoes a seminal evolution, it creates a giant in its wake. The commercialization of the mainframe computer in the 1960s gave birth to IBM (NYSE:IBM), and similarly, the rise of virtualization in the early 2000s gave us VMware.IT is at a similar crossroads now, and the winners are still to be determined. Industry analysts, however, have validated the utility of the $100bn market for the private cloud, and no company other than Nutanix is more closely married to that tagline. For investors prepared to withstand temporary pain and valuation confusions, Nutanix can offer a stellar opportunity to invest in ""the next big thing"" before it's too big."
4128890,103480,2017-12-01T01:58:03-05:00,"Nutanix reported a massive beat-and-raise quarter, with revenue growth of 46% y/y eclipsing analyst expectations for 41% growth.EPS and cash flow outperformed as well, with Nutanix's once-huge operating loss margins slimming drastically.The company's transition to becoming a software-centric business - selling its datacenter OS with hardware appliance sales only as an incidental side business - will raise margins and revenue stability.Nutanix's shift toward a larger, predominantly software mix will also tilt its valuation multiple higher toward software-style multiples, whereas it's now trading at a noticeable discount to software peers.","Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX), the leading provider of hyperconverged datacenter infrastructure, has kicked off its fiscal 2018 with a bang. Its Q1 earnings release smashed analyst expectations across all measures: revenue, billings, margins, and cash flow. The company's record-setting $275.6 million in revenue this quarter also puts Nutanix at a $1.1 billion run rate, making it a huge player in the datacenter space relative to a few years back, when the company posted only a couple hundred million in sales.Perhaps most importantly of all, it has cemented its strategy of pivoting to become a software-centric company. Though in its earlier years Nutanix was known primarily as a vendor of integrated hardware-software appliances, with the bulk of revenues deriving from hardware appliance sales (the same is still true today), the company has recently announced its intention to shift toward standalone software sales, with hardware only as an incidental revenue stream.Investor excitement over Nutanix's software shift has driven the stock into a phenomenal recovery in recent months, sending shares up to the mid-$30s from $15, levels not seen until immediately after the IPO in late 2016. For the majority of its life as a public company, Nutanix carried lower multiples of revenue due to its concentration in hardware - but as the company shifts to software-only billings, its gross margins can expand dramatically. Also think of how much more the company can scale as it looks to become the dominant OS for hyperconverged datacenters. Just as Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) Windows gained prominence in the '90s as a standalone OS compatible with multiple hardware form factors, so too can Nutanix achieve its next leg of growth by selling software that's completely decoupled from hardware. Customers can still opt to buy the integrated appliances from Nutanix, but if they have a preferred hardware brand of choice, they can still buy Nutanix software - widely recognized as the ""best-of-breed"" in hyperconverged infrastructures.As I wrote in a prior article, I was hoping for the company's Q1 to boost the stock to $40, a price target that now represents a 4.85x EV/FY18 revenues multiple based on estimated FY18 revenue of $1.2 billion. As Nutanix transitions more toward software sales in FY18, this multiple has plenty of room for expansion, and given that the stock's post-Q1 price reaction didn't show the uplift I was looking for, I'm holding on for additional upside - especially with Nutanix's fundamentals showing so well this quarter.$40 is a minimum for the stock. As analysts digest this quarter's results, Wall Street will be adjusting its price targets much higher.NTNX data by YChartsNutanix posted record-setting revenues of $275.6 million this year, up 46% y/y. This was an $8.7 million beat over analyst consensus of $266.9 million, or +41% y/y. The chart below, taken from its Q1 earnings materials, shows the linearity in Nutanix's growth since 2016. Note that the company had an accounting change to comply with software revenue recognition standards in ASC 606, and all figures are presented post change:Figure 1. Nutanix revenue growth trajectorySource: Nutanix Q1 earnings materialsNutanix's strong revenue growth was also supported by strong billings in the quarter. Total billings were $315 million in the quarter (+32% y/y), driving the company's total deferred revenues to $409 million (+48% y/y). Effectively, the company is building its backlog as fast as (or faster than) it's recognizing revenue, giving it a solid revenue base to draw from in future quarters and providing support to future earnings.Other business metrics reported in the quarter trended strongly as well. Here are a couple of the highlights:For a company like Nutanix, the hard part is becoming ""mainstream."" Especially in the datacenter infrastructure space, where IT buyers are extremely inert and apt to keep buying from the vendors they already know, it's a hard market to be a startup. With Nutanix's run rate reaching well over $1 billion, however, the company is now hardly a startup - it has truly become as mainstream in backend infrastructure as VMware (NYSE: VMW) and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO). Hyperconverged infrastructures (NYSE:HCI) are now top of mind for enterprise CIOs, boasting reductions in total cost of ownership (as HCI requires less specialized human IT administration) as well as strong performance - and within HCI, the undisputed leader is Nutanix. VMware and HPE SimpliVity (NYSE: HPE) have competing offerings, but they are still a few years behind Nutanix's traction in the market. And once Nutanix's level of brand recognition and market acceptance has been achieved, its path to growth is more of an eventuality, a downhill ride.As the company continues to scale, it's also making vast improvements in the cost structure and slimming its losses. Nutanix once concerned Wall Street for its high (even for a Silicon Valley startup) net losses; now, the company's loss margins have slimmed, and it's even posting positive operating cash flow. The company posted an operating loss of $59.2 million in Q1 (representing a -21% operating margin), a huge improvement over a loss of $114.5 million in the prior-year quarter (a -61% margin).The company's pro forma EPS of -$0.16 is 10c above analyst consensus of -$0.26, as margins came in better than expected. Increased sales leverage, in particular, contributed a lot toward Nutanix's slimmer losses - it increased sales spending only 13% y/y and achieved 46% y/y revenue growth in return, indicating the trend previously mentioned. As Nutanix becomes mainstream, more business will come knocking at its door without the company having to exert itself too much in field sales.It also generated $10.2 million of operating cash flow in the quarter (a 4% margin), a 2.5x increase over just $4.2 million in 1Q17. Given the rapid advances in margins, coupled with strong top line growth, Nutanix is just on the cusp of expanding its cash flow, and in the longer run can probably achieve cash flow margins in the double digits. See the company's cash flow margin trends in the chart below:Figure 2. Nutanix cash flow marginsEver since it went public (in September 2016, at $16/share), Nutanix has been received with a bit of confusion by investors: is it a hardware company or a software company? It sells datacenter appliances, after all, built on commoditized Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) x86 servers, a cheap staple and modern workhorse for enterprise DCs. But the appliances are powered by Nutanix software - the ""secret sauce"" that controls the servers and binds together compute, storage, and networking resources into a single, cluster-computing unit - hence the term ""hyperconverged."" So which is it - software or hardware?The market treats it as both. Its revenue multiple - at times trading in the low 3s, now in the low 4s - is both higher than that of a typical hardware company but lower than a typical software company, where a 46% grower like Nutanix might traditionally be awarded with a 7x revenue multiple. In recent months, however, Nutanix has announced its intention of pivoting more toward software, jumpstarting the recovery in shares, as software businesses find more favor with investors and carry much higher multiples.And it has much higher margins as well - so it's no wonder that investors value software revenue streams much more than hardware. Nutanix estimates that its software and support revenues will carry 80%-plus gross margins (representing nearly pure profit for each incremental sale), versus hardware appliances which are basically sold at cost.Going forward, as Nutanix includes its base OS as part of its software sales, the company expects hardware sales to be less than ~10% of total billings. As shown in the chart below, taken from Nutanix's Q1 earnings deck, its hardware mix was 26% this quarter, eventually dropping down to 9% by year end and 5% the year after that.With software eventually moving to become the dominant part of the company's revenue base, it's almost guaranteed that Wall Street and large institutional investors will shift their view on Nutanix and consider it more of a software play, attaching higher multiples to its revenue streams.Investors are finally paying attention to the fact that the winds are blowing in the right direction for Nutanix - across the board. Recall that even though the stock has rallied this year, it has still yet to recover past the $37 high mark it saw immediately post IPO. With enthusiasm rekindling on the back of massive growth and a fresh software narrative, Nutanix is well-positioned to outperform in 2018.I'm still waiting on a price target of $40 (4.85x EV/FTM revenues) to consider letting go of a portion of my holdings. With the software story becoming more prevalent, however, there's a good chance of the company entering into a sustained phase of multiple expansion as it eases into a more software-normal revenue multiple of ~6x. Either way, with a strong Q1 under its belt and with Wall Street's newfound confidence in the company, it seems the only way for Nutanix is up."
4102706,55342,2017-08-29T13:53:29-04:00,"Hyper-converged infrastructure provider Nutanix is expected to report its Q4 earnings on August 31, after the market close.NTNX stock is up more than 27% since its Q3 earnings.Is the stock setting up for another post earnings rally?","Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) is set to report its Q4 earnings after the market close on August 31. Nutanix shares have made a tremendous recovery following its Q3 earnings in the last week of May. The stock had previously fallen below its IPO price of $16. However, the stock has gained more than 27% following its Q3 earnings announcement, handily outperforming the broader markets, which were almost flat in the same time frame. The big question going into the earnings announcement is: Will the upcoming earnings announcement help NTNX stock maintain its upward trajectory? Is Nutanix stock setting up for another post earnings rally?Wall Street expects Nutanix to report a non-GAAP loss per share of 38 cents on revenue of $217.85 million in Q4. The estimates compare against a loss per share of 39 cents on a top line of $139.8 million in the year ago quarter, implying 2.5% earnings growth and a top line growth of 55.82%, on a year-over-year basis. On the Q3 earnings call, management issued revenue guidance of $215 million to $220 million. The Street's estimates for revenue are just above the midpoint of the management guidance for Q4. On the bottom line front, Nutanix management has guided for Q4 loss per share to come in around $0.38, same as the analyst estimates. The company expects its gross margins to be approximately 58% for the fiscal fourth quarter.Nutanix has a short history of trumping Wall Street estimates as well as its own guidance. According to the estimize database, the company has beaten the top end of the management's EPS guidance in all the quarters since the company went public.Source: EstimizeOn the revenue front, the company has a strong track record. In comparison to Wall Street estimates, it beat Wall Street's revenue consensus in all of the earnings releases after its IPO. Management had issued a revenue guidance for the last two-quarters only, and the company trumped the high end of the revenue guidance numbers in both quarters. Source: EstimizeThe other name of Nutanix stock is volatility. NTNX stock is known for wild swings and is remembered for making big movements either way following earnings announcements.So, will Nutanix beat Street estimates once again? Based on a strong earnings history and the fact that Nutanix has consistently delivered an earnings beat in all of its earning releases in its short history, a beat looks like a likely outcome. The case for an earnings beat is also strengthened by the earnings whisper of 34 cents per share, which implies a decent beat. However, only an earnings beat would not be enough for a post earnings uptick. The company's fiscal 2018 and 2018-Q1 guidance are also very crucial as we had witnessed a massive sell off after the 2017-Q2 earnings on account of below par guidance for 2017-Q3. The company needs to maintain its strong top line growth and project narrowing losses in order to convince investors.The latest short interest numbers were out last week. Short interest in Nutanix stock has spiked by 3.5% during the latest reporting period. In this reporting period (ending August 15), the number of shorted shares rose to 14.05 million. As of the end of July, short interest was at 13.5 million shares. The short interest, as a percentage of float, came in at a massive 22.5%. The days to cover was really high at 6 days. Shares of the HCI provider have seen a significant increase in short interest since the third quarter financial results were announced. If the stock registers another post earning pop, we could see the stock benefit from a massive short squeeze.ConclusionGiven the strong guidance, the expectation is for Nutanix to beat by a nice margin. If NTNX misses, it would be a severe disappointment. The company had also warned about increasing DRAM costs affecting its margins when it stated that its expected DRAM costs might have increased by nearly 100% in Q4. Wider than expected losses could be a big blow to the stock.Investors looking to go long on Nutanix ahead of earnings should closely monitor the charts. Nutanix has a major resistance level at its 200-day SMA which it has failed to break above till now. If NTNX stock manages to break above the major resistance with strong volumes, the stock could be in for a major uptick. The average price target for the HCI provider's shares is $27.20, which still implies a significant upside from here, but a lot will depend on the company's FY 2018 outlook. However, given the high volatility and its post earnings behaviour, Nutanix stock is a high risk/high reward bet going into earnings."
4090525,103291,2017-07-26T03:23:11-04:00,"Nutanix is doing things the right way and is a leader in its space.Burn through cash to create a superior product, not to set the financials ablaze.Day-to-day movements in the stock price will almost surely frustrate you.","Things look good for Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX). Whether it is in the short term, the medium term, or the long term, I can't tell. But what I do know is that the company is doing something right. Revenue has been growing quickly, partnerships with well-respected companies continue to flow in, and the company has been consistently recognized as a leader in the HCI space.Recently, the company announced that it would be teaming up with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) in the tech giant's effort to combat cloud growth in others such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). This is good for a few reasons - Nutanix's revenue will see a sharp rise in time, and its products will see more exposure in a market that is still under-recognized. But more than anything, this partnership confirms something that we all already knew - Nutanix is doing something right.At the time of this writing, NTNX is trading at $23.80. Down from a 52-week high of $46.78, many investors are scratching their heads as to why this stock is trading at its current levels. But when we really look into the company, we find that its valuation is very tricky. Founded in 2009, with an IPO less than a year ago, Nutanix is a relatively new company. Combine that with the fact that it's a technology company, and there you have it - a hyper-growth, cash burning machine.As investors know all too well, these types of companies are nothing new. We're seeing it with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), we're seeing it with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and we've seen it with others through time. These darlings of technology burn though mountains of cash trying to accomplish a variety of tasks, from battery production and efficiency to the expansion of a content library. And while these companies have very different value propositions, one consistency is that a high level of self-investment has propelled them to create a product that consumers and investors alike believe in. Say what you want about these companies' financials (trust me, I have), but the presence that they have been able to create and maintain in their respective markets has reflected very generously upon the stock prices. It has caused the market to be seemingly less concerned with the content in the financials and more concerned with what could be in the future.To me, this is similar to what is happening with Nutanix. Since its IPO last September, the company has been burning cash and operating at a loss. As is typical with companies of this nature, an accurate valuation is more dependent on a determination of future profitability. This determination requires a rather subjective look at the company's products and direction. As far as the product goes, Nutanix is doing very well for itself. It has created a way to combine entire data centers into one small box. It has revolutionized the way that companies across the world utilize the cloud. The company has created a product that customers purchase and realize that their new, simplistic, efficient IT operations couldn't exist without Nutanix. Tech giants see this and want a piece of it for themselves. In the short time since Nutanix became public, it has partnered with IBM, Dell (DVMT), and Google, to name just a few.In my DCF evaluation, I see the company maintaining healthy double-digit growth, while improving margins consistently over the next 5-10 years. As the marketplace becomes more and more aware of this technology and the company's partners contribute more and more to sales, Nutanix will see a steady rise in growth. As operations become more efficient, SG&A will see a steady decline without a negative impact on revenue growth. After all calculations, I arrive at an intrinsic value of $34.55. This price results in a 48% upside from the latest closing price.While a 48% increase in the price of any stock sounds fantastic, it is not the type of thing that can happen overnight. In fact, this particular stock trades unlike anything I have seen. It will jump on good news and have a wide pullback that results in a negative week - just look what happened the week the partnership with Google was announced. Regardless, Nutanix is young and in a hyper-growth phase. It is a leader in its sector, and the sky is the limit when discussing potential growth. With that, my recommendation is to buy this stock and forget you did. If you follow it too closely, the volatility will drive you crazy. Conversely, forgetting that you ever bought this stock will likely result in a pleasant surprise when you finally remember the choice you made."
4087828,21815,2017-07-14T15:19:38-04:00,"Nutanix is the pioneer and leader of the hyper-converged infrastructure which enables companies to manage their on-premise and cloud applications on a single plane.We are especially encouraged by the strong sales to existing customers.The company still has some room to recover from the Q2 disappointment after a much better Q3.However, there are also a couple of problematic aspects, in our view.","Nutanix (NTNX) is the pioneer and market leader in so-called hyper-converged appliances (or hyper-converged infrastructure, HCI), combining storage, virtualization, and servers. This is a pretty big deal because in principle, it offers a large reduction in the total cost of ownership. From MarketRealist:Here is SA contributor Bert Hochfeld:The company tries to become the sort of operating system of the hybrid cloud and virtualization world, from Forbes:Whether the company succeeds remains very much to be seen though, but it is off to a promising start, having accumulated a great many large customers and agreements with public cloud providers like Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT), AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).CompetitionIts biggest competitor is Dell, as SA contributor Sniper Fund pointed out, it is the leader in servers, storage (via its acquisition of EMC) and virtualization (via its acquisition of VMWare). However, Nutanix also has an OEM agreement with Dell, at least till 2021.Hewlett Packard (HPE) acquired the number two HCI player SimpliVity in 2016. Here is a list and short description of the competition. And, there is Cisco (CSCO) which has its own HyperFlex products.We think the story can be brought down to a couple of things:GrowthThe market is fairly new but will display significant growth, from Channele2e:Or, from MarketRealist:The company itself quoted a Gartner study during the Q3CC arguing the hyper-converged market will grow to roughly $8.5B in 2020.The company itself has been growing fast, but it is still raking in substantial losses. Sales went from $445M in 2016 to an estimated $759M this year to $1.05B next year (average estimate of analysts). Analysts don't see losses decline all that much, from $1.41 per share this year to $1.28 per share in 2017.The latter estimate has come down quite a bit, which is one reason the shares haven't performed all that well since IPO:What we particularly like about Nutanix is that it enters deals, especially one with large customers, and they then manage to expand these deals once they get familiar with the workings and economics of what Nutanix has to offer. From the company's NEXT conference (from Benzinga)Or in the words of management, this is the 'land and expand' strategy, from the Q3CC:One big benefit that Nutanix has to offer is scalability, so this doesn't only work for the client, it works for Nutanix as well, with so many customers scaling up after an initial order. One can see this in the bottom half of the figure below:And in this figure:And, this can be followed by additional services like security.And, the company has also multiple OEM partnerships, many of which are just starting up. There is not just Dell, but also HP, Cisco, Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGF), and IBM.And, something management said during the Q3CC also caught our attention:ScaleScale is where most the profitability (eventually) should come from, that is, top-line growth exceeding the growth in S&M, R&D, and G&A (overhead).Gross margin is under pressure of late due to the memory price increases and increase in backlog.One other way to get scale advantages is to increase the proportion of software (which earns higher margins) as part of total sales, and it is doing just that:Disappointing Q2 better Q3In Q2, it had some issues with its sales force in the US which is why the results were disappointing. Some feared these were permanent, or hiding problems, but the third quarter put most of these fears to sleep.Q3 was a good quarter. Revenues grew 67% y/y and billings 47%. The latter would have been higher, but there was also an increase in backlogs. The same can be said for the book-to-bill ratio (coming in at 1.22) and gross margins (58.4%).Margins are actually a bit lower than a year ago (62.5%) and even Q2 (59.8%). The increasing backlog (deferred revenue) is one factor:Another reason is the increase in memory prices (both DRAM as well as Flash), causing an 8% rise in product cost during the quarter.To give you an idea, DRAM doubled in price in the year to August, causing a 6% drop in margins for the company, although it did counter some of that through a modest price hike.The company will keep ramping OPEX by $10 a quarter, and turning back to a previous discussion about scale, this could be a point of some concern.What happened this quarter is that all categories of expenses grew faster than revenues (+67%):From the 10-Q (p32):Apart from the issue with memory prices and backlog, we are still obviously in the land grab phase, and that land grab seems to go pretty well, but still. Sequential growth is a little less steep for some of these cost categories though, as you can see in the table below (from Tmxmoney):And, while the company isn't bleeding cash too heavily (and the tendency is clearly declining, see the operational leverage graph above), there is other stuff that one has to consider:That is $50M of stock-based compensation in a quarter on $192M of revenue; that is, stock-based compensation is 26% of revenue. Apart from that, it grew tenfold in a year. A little steep, in our view.Q4 GuidanceRevenue to be between $215M and $220M, gross margins of approximately 58%, and an EPS loss of around $0.38 (with weighted average shares outstanding of approximately $152M).Valuation and conclusionThe main valuation metrics P/S (4.7) and EV/S (3.75) don't seem terribly excessive, but this really all depends on what your expectations are for the growth and operational leverage.We do think the fast growth is likely to continue for quite a while and the company will achieve considerable operational leverage (especially if memory prices start behaving and the new accounting rule, ASC 606 is operational by August next year).However, we have two problems, the lack of significant recurring revenues and the high level of stock-based compensation.We do think the company has a bright future ahead, and in the present investing climate, the shares will likely trend upwards. After all, the shares have noted as much as 50% higher only recently, before the disappointing Q2 cut them in half.However, the high share based compensation and lack of recurring revenues temper our enthusiasm quite a bit."

4078766,98236,2017-06-05T12:14:08-04:00,"Nutanix reported the results of its fiscal Q3 about a week ago.The results should be seen as a significant snap-back from the disappointment of the prior quarter.The company also raised guidance for the current quarter substantially while suggesting that it will continue to increase opex by a minimum of $10 million/quarter for several quarters.The company maintains its competitive position in the hyperconverged spaces, one of the more disruptive elements in IT hardware in the last decade or more.The company has achieved an enviable position with large users and its solution has been able to become a standard for a significant cohort of Global 2000 enterprises.","Nutanix: The best way to confound skeptics is to produce impressive resultsNutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) reported the results of its latest fiscal quarter last week. The results substantially bested expectations for most revenue related metrics. While billings were essentially in-line that had more to do with mix than it had to do with actual demand. For some reason, the results seemed to be a surprise - it still seems an article of dispute that Nutanix is the leader in a hot space. The competitive landscape in the market for hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) is crowded, confused and in a constant state of flux. But Nutanix continues to lead the field. The company's senior management has both characteristics of prudent experience and audacity.I think that Nutanix is a badly understood company that is considered to be an IT hardware vendor with prospects limited by the growth of the cloud and by excessive competition in its space. Certainly, the move of workloads to the cloud has diminished the number of workloads that can and will run on-prem. But that trend can be exaggerated and has been since the cloud emerged as one of the seminal events in the IT space. Over time, hyperconverged is likely to be the primary form of computing for on-prem workloads given its advantages in cost, efficiency, security and form factor. Forecasts continue to change and forecasts for the size of the hyperconverged converged market opportunity continue to ramp. There is plenty of room for this company to continue its hyper-growth path for a number of years.The company has probably outspent its competitors in terms of research into hyperconverged technology for some period now. Some of its vision relating to the ability to move data from applications in the cloud to applications running on prem is very much a work in progress. It continues to add functionality in terms of micro-segmentation, security and management to its current offering and is seen in most studies as the leader in its space. I do not expect that it is going to be displaced from its leadership role any time soon.And despite the current gross margin pressures and the ramp of opex, the company has a very clear path to profitability. Even with the opex spending ramp, revenues are rising significantly faster in percentage terms than operating expenses, a trend that will lead to strong levels of profitability.Just how fast is the HCI market growing? One thing to note is that it is still nascent - just a few years in terms of gestation. For another thing, definitions are quite fluid. Converged doesn't mean hyper converged and converged is falling while hyper-converged is rising. Here is a link to the most recent market research study on market size which talks about the market reaching $13 billion by 2022 with a CAGR of 48% through the period. At the end of the day, that is why people invest in Nutanix and undergirds any investment case. Hyper-converged means hyper growth. Nutanix remains one of the leaders in the space along with Dell which is both a competitor and a partner.At the moment, the company's path to profitability is being obscured by the massive increase in DRAM prices which were said to reduce gross margins by as much as 600 basis points in the just reported quarter - and yet the company still beat its earnings target for the period. The company also has forecast a stepped-up investment in major opex categories. That is not the most popular strategy to embrace these days and will, no doubt, sideline some investors and encourage short sellers. But again, unless readers believe that the management of this business are either knaves or have tin ears, ramping op-ex because the opportunity in front of the company continues to expand is prudent and not shareholder unfriendly. Needless to say, the company's elongated gestation cycle will be the subject of some investor pushback and has certainly engendered a significant short story regarding the company. But I think it is fair to say that this just reported quarter suggested that the company has a potentially lucrative business model as it continues to scale up.Nutanix is not without its detractors. The latest statistics show that 21% of the float has been shorted and the short interest rose a little month on month. The negative thesis relates to items including valuation, competition, pricing/margins and the inability of management to prevent the expiration of the employee lock-up. It is also a hardware company in the storage space and that automatically makes it a target for disapprobation. Perhaps, in the end, short sellers will complain that management has failed to prevent global warming. Sitting here in a still chilly metro New York, that is a much more significant knock on their capabilities. Perhaps on the next conference call, someone will ask why hyper-converged infrastructure can't extend summer in the north east by at least two months.I think the operational performance of this company coupled with a host of supporting commentary from management and sub-headline news and metrics suggest that the company continues to operate at a high level. Much of the balance of this article will be taken up with an analysis of some of the negative expectations that have weighed on share price performance over the past several months and which continue to be part of the investment discussion on this name. There are, no doubt, risks in investing in the shares of this company. It is relatively small, it still makes losses and it is on the cusp of cash flow generation. It has many competitors and more will appear. It is considered a hardware company, although the nature of hyper convergence is such that much of the value add provided by this company is related to its software.The anatomy of a beatJust how many times have investors seen a company produce results significantly above projections but then give what is considered to be disappointing guidance? Not that I have any particular informational advantage, but even if I did, I would never have the ability to know what guidance might be for a particular company. I think that equal to confounding some skeptics about the quarterly performance that was reported was the rather substantial increase in top line growth that the company is now forecasting. I will take a look at some of the specifics that were reported and look at the management guide as well.Nutanix sales for the quarter ended 4/30 reached $192 million. That is up 67% year on year. The company had forecast that its revenues for the period would be between $180-$190 million. The company had forecast a non-GAAP loss for the period of between $.45-$.48. The actual non-GAAP loss was $.42. The company had forecast non-GAAP gross margins of between 57%-58%. Gross margins turned out to be 58.4%.Within revenues, the company reported that services and software revenues almost doubled while product revenues rose 62%. One of the largest discrete opportunities this company has in terms of its outlook is to dramatically improve its gross margins based both on a greater software mix and on higher product margins as the cost pressures from elevated component prices begin to subside.The company reported $234 million in billings. It had forecast that billings would be about $234 million - I've used the mid-point of the ranges that the company actually does forecast. I am not too sure how significant billings performance is in evaluating the company's sales performance. The billings metric is significantly influenced by the change in the deferred revenue balance. That in turn relates both to the length of contract terms and to the percentage of business done with OEMs. Obviously, business done through the OEM channel will not include deferred revenues.Many companies no longer report or try to forecast billings because it is more or less impossible to forecast the deferred revenue metric with any degree of accuracy. In reality, Nutanix doesn't forecast bookings explicitly either. It simply forecasts revenues and then forecasts that based on historical patterns bookings should be 1.25-1.3X revenues and from that analysts derive a bookings forecast. The distinction between ought to be considered a specific forecast and what is provided by Nutanix seems to have eluded some commentators. I think it would be a mistake to pay much attention to the billings metrics of NTNX either way.This was not a quarter in which the company showed much in the way of expense discipline. Overall, operating expenses rose by 96.6% year on year. Sales and marketing expense was most controlled rising by 68%. Research and development more than doubled and general and administrative expense rose by 78%.I think it is actually more relevant to look at expense trends on a sequential quarter basis. In this last quarter, general and administrative costs declined marginally. Research and development expense growth throttled back substantially to less than 5% sequentially and sales and marketing expense growth was still showing almost 15% sequential growth.Nutanix management is not managing the company these days based on constricting growth in either sales and marketing or in research and development. The management sees enormous growth in its space and also see loads of competitors. Their approach is rational although it will not please all investors. The hyper-converged category is one of the more disruptive developments in the past couple of decades - not as seminal as the cloud to be sure but certainly of huge significance. While there are plenty of competitors that have entered the space, there are fewer in this area than there are in other IT categories.Before I look at guidance and the future for this company, I think it is important to at least take a pass at the company's competitive moat. This is really not a hardware company and it makes limited sense to value it as though it were. There will be no doubt readers who have a deeper technical understanding of this space than do I. And I'm sure some of those readers may not share my views of Nutanix and its capabilities. There isn't some single source of truth regarding competition in the space. I have no real way of saying that SimpliVity, a competitor of Nutanix, has ""better"" or"" worse"" solutions. That said, one of the links I presented earlier suggests that SimpliVity went to HPE out of desperation and not strength.There are lots of tangled wires in this space. VMWare/Dell (NYSE:VMW) is perhaps the most important competitor to consider at this time. And yet Dell remains a major Nutanix partner with significant wins announced by Nutanix in partnership with Dell this past quarter during the course of the conference call.The competitive scene in the hyper-converged spaceCommenting on competition in the hyperconverged space is a bit like commenting on traffic conditions on a busy, large city freeway. The cars are whizzing along but traffic seems to be entering from both the right and the left. The traffic goes from light to heavy to stopped in a few hundred meters. And there are accidents almost all of the time because of the speed at which the cars travel.For those readers unfamiliar with the term, hyper-convergence is a type of infrastructure system with a software-centric architecture (basically a software defined data center) that tightly integrates compute, storage networking and virtualization resources and other technologies from scratch in a commodity hardware box. The solution can be sold by a single vendor, it can be sold by OEMs who buy software and furnish their own hardware or it can be sold by system integrators that will buy software and package it with commodity hardware and perhaps add some specific features they offer.While surveying the competition is somewhat elementary fashion, it is probably fair to point out that the real competition for Nutanix is the public cloud. The issue for anyone in the IT hardware business has been the conception that all workloads are migrating to the public cloud and nothing will be left for providers of on-premise infrastructure. It is just an example of over-hype. Whether or not there ever comes a time when the cloud is everything, that time is in the unforeseeable future. For now, the hybrid cloud is probably the preponderance of user demand. Some workloads will be cloud, many others, perhaps more, will be on-prem with some movement back and forth for ad-hoc workloads. One reason why Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) wound up partnering with VMW was to have an offering that was optimized for those users who do not want and are not preparing to move every workload to the cloud. That is the market in which Nutanix operates and will continue to be so. Part of the short thesis regarding Nutanix is centered on this fear which is exaggerated and simply wrong-headed. Hardware shares remain valued as though their business outlook is dim, regardless of either their guidance or results. I think that will change at some point and I think Nutanix probably offers the single greatest potential appreciation when investors start making more informed decisions.Nutanix is clearly a market leader, probably still the absolute market leader, closely challenged by VMWare's software only VxRail. VMW has seen that component of its business enjoy very rapid growth and I think it will continue to do so into the foreseeable future. Without reviewing VMW's results just published, part of their upside has to do with their ability to enjoy the rising tide of the hyper-converged market.VMW announced a deal with Amazon late last year that some feel will be a ""game changer."" I'm not inclined to use that kind of hyperbole but it is a significant milestone in this business. I'm not sure I can readily handicap the competition between VMW and Nutanix. The VM technology has been around for quite a bit longer than that offered by Nutanix and Nutanix probably offers features and function that are not currently available on VMRail.Nutanix is unique in the space in being able to offer a complete stack that includes their own hypervisor, AHV, commodity hardware and all of the other functionality people expect to find in a data center.As mentioned earlier, another major competitor, at least notionally, is SimpliVity which recently was sold. SimpliVity was a much smaller vendor than Nutanix and it did not have its own hypervisor. The valuation that SimpliVity fetched when compared to Nutanix was far less and is perhaps a factor in the recent share price performance of the later regardless of the glaring differences between the two. Nutanix offers its software running on HPE ProLiant servers. That seems likely to be a more popular choice than an all HPE configuration.Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) offers a hyperconverged solution called Hyperflex. It appears to be only marginally competitive at this point and has clearly lagged the original goals to which the company aspired. In the long run, solutions based on Cisco UCS which use Nutanix software are likely to prove a more popular solution than the all-Cisco hyperconverged solutionWhile Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) offers a hypervisor, Nutanix can and is used to provide to provide a hyperconverged architecture that runs many Microsoft applications. It is said that users can build an Azure-consistent hybrid cloud in hours with the factory-installed Cloud Platform System Standard on the Nutanix solution.IBM has recently become a Nutanix partner. In that case, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Nutanix will package an integrated offering which combines the Nutanix Enterprise Cloud with IBM Power Systems. The partnership is targeted at enterprise users (Global 2000) looking to run what are described as mission critical cognitive workloads.NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), as mentioned in an article I did in conjunction with that company's most recent earnings release, is preparing to launch a hyperconverged product that is said to be extremely scalable. And to be optimized for workloads…well similar to the workloads that are targeted by the new IBM/Nutanix solutions.There has been some perception in the market that Nutanix solutions are not for mission critical applications. That appears to be a substantial misconception simply based on the kinds of deals that the company has been reporting both this past quarter and past year. Overall, it appears that Nutanix products are running many so-called Tier 1 mission critical applications.Guidance: Confounding Naysayer'sNutanix provided a more upbeat assessment of current business in their earnings release than many had thought likely. The upcoming quarter is a fiscal Q4 for the company and thus its guidance is only for a single quarter. Revenues are expected to reach $215-$220 million which would be growth of 56% at the mid-point. That forecast compared to the prior consensus revenue expectations of expectation of $204 million.The company actually lowered its loss estimate marginally from a prior consensus expectation of $-.39 to a current expectation of $-.38. But as has been pointed out by others, that kind of a forecast implies significant growth in opex. Overall, the new forecast calls for a sequential revenue growth of $26 million or 13.5%. The EPS forecast implies that opex growth will be about $15 million or 6.6%. Management has suggested that it will continue to ramp opex by a minimum of $10 million over the next few quarters.Management has suggested that it will hold 58% gross margins by adjusting its software/hardware mix with its partners. In other words, if the quarter progresses, and the 58% gross margin target is seen to be at risk, the company will work with partners and system integrators to sell less hardware and to increase the proportion of high margin software revenues. It is interesting to me that the company believes that it has such a strong pipeline that it can sacrifice revenues in order to maintain margins. It suggests that the current revenue estimate is lower than what the company sees from its internal forecasts.Management suggested to me in an interview that there has been and would continue to be a straightforward correlation between top-line growth and increases in opex. So, I think the takeaway from the increase in opex is simply that the company believes that growth is likely to continue at a greater rate for an extended time period than is implicit in most models.At the moment, First Call consensus expectations for fiscal year 2018 call for top-line growth of 38% which is a significant increase from prior expectations. That said, however, the non-GAAP projected loss is $1.26.The company is likely to start to see some relief from gross margin pressures next year as the increase in NAND and DRAM prices start to abate. So, at a minimum, and based on the consensus revenue growth forecast, gross margins should increase by almost $150 million in fiscal 2018. If non-GAAP earnings only were to rise to forecasted levels, that would mean that opex would have to increase by around $120 million which is self-evidently far above the cadence of $10 million/quarter that the CFO suggested was a minimum expectation. So, at least to me, the implicit opex forecast in the consensus seems more than a bit extreme. I think that the current estimates and management's forecast present an excellent set-up as they seem almost designed to be bested and by a significant margin at that.ValuationAs mentioned, Nutanix shares are more than a bit controversial. While the shares have more buy ratings than holds, it is not a strong plurality. And despite the results of the past quarter, there were no upgrades, just higher price targets and higher estimates.At the moment, with a forecast average share count of 152 million, Nutanix has a market cap of just $2.8 billion. It has a current cash balance of $350 million leaving an enterprise value of less than $2.5 billion. With revenues forecast to be at around $970 million over the next 12 months, that is an EV/S of 2.55X.Is that a remarkable value? I suppose the answer comes down to two factors. The first issue is the longevity of the company's hyper-growth phase. Certainly, an EV/S of 2.55X is not representative of valuations accorded other companies in the IT space that are growing at 60% top-line, or for that matter at 30% top-line. There are those who think that the company's hyper growth phase will end with a bang as Dell-EMC ceases to partner with this company, even on a tactical basis. There is no evidence that the relationship will end that way, and the data released about the trajectory of the relationship on the conference call suggests that Dell continues to partner with Nutanix in order to support its own sales targets and the partnership continues to drive around 10% of current sales.As mentioned earlier, there is and likely will continue to be issues about how the advent and hyper-growth of the cloud will ultimately impact the TAM for hyperconverged infrastructure. I think the arguments that all IT hardware companies are completely doomed is fraught, to say the least, and most likely more than a bit of hyperbole. But such arguments are and probably will continue to constrain valuation until the company starts to achieve significant levels of profitability.Another issue of note is that this company, whether or not it is really a software vendor, is clearly a company that does not and is not likely to build a recurring revenue base. The sale of infrastructure is not perceived by users as something they might choose to rent. And without a recurring revenue stream, valuations for Nutanix are likely to be lower for this company than other high-growth IT peers.But the second major issue of importance, even more than the issue of recurring revenue, the value of which can be overdone (SaaS companies still contrive to miss and to miss revenue targets as well as earnings targets and bookings get calculated whether or not vendors do the calculations), is the issue of profitability. Obviously, this company doesn't have any although it has been close to positive cash flow generation the last several quarters.This company, at the moment, has a stated margin gross margin goal of 60%. It seems likely that over time it will significantly exceed that objective. Currently, software, as the company reports it, is 16% of revenues. (These are pure software sales in which the company sells no hardware. It dramatically under-represents the value add of software as the company really isn't going to be paid substantial margins to package commodity hardware components.). These sales have margins typical of normal software margins above 90% according to company management. The company expects that in its current incarnation software revenues are going to double as a proportion of total revenues. As that happens, total company gross margins ought to increase from current levels by 1000 basis points or more.The current pricing of DRAMs and NAND has let to constrained gross margins. These prices have increased by more than 100% for Nutanix over the past year and have shaved 600 basis points from operating margins. That will reverse in time and it seems reasonable to believe will support product gross margins of well in excess of 60%.But of course, the major issue for this company is going to be control of operating expense. And in turn the biggest factor in that control is how fast it chooses to grow its sales capacity. Part of that is going to come down to the ability the company has to recruit more OEMs such as IBM and Lenovo. And an equal component is going to come from the productivity of the company's sales teams. It takes nine months for a sales team to become productive. Until that time, they add to cost without revenue. Depending on the trajectory of sales hiring, the company is simply going have what appears to be an elevated spend for sales and marketing costs.That just hasn't happened yet and probably is not going to happen in the next several quarters. The company was willing to raise sales and marketing spend by 15% sequentially last quarter, even in the wake of disappointing execution in the prior quarter, while its revenues last quarter were up 5.5%. That relationship is likely to reverse this quarter, but the path to profitability is going to take the direction of holding the growth in sales and marketing spend to negligible levels while seeing revenues increase at 20%-30% for a couple of years.The other components of operating expense already are showing signs of stability with general and administrative expense flat sequentially and with research and development expense essentially flat over the past three quarters.There is nothing unique or unprofitable about the Nutanix business model. It can easily evolve at scale and it is reasonable to believe that sales and marketing expense can be well controlled. But that is simply not going to happen in the short term during which the company is seeing more opportunities than it can deal with absent substantial hires in the sales and marketing category.The company reported cash flow from operations (CFFO) last quarter at a negative $16 million. That compares with several prior quarter that were around the breakeven to slightly positive range. Stock based comp is a significant factor in cash flow. Last quarter it declined a bit sequentially mainly because of the performance of Nutanix shares. Stock based was 26% of revenue last quarter and diminished the net loss by 45%. Much of the stock based comp expense is concentrated in research and development. To the extent that headcount increases in research and development are constrained, it will have an outsize impact on any future growth in stock based comp.In addition to stock based comp, cash flow is materially influenced by deferred revenue increases. And in turn, those are significantly negatively correlated with the OEM percentage of revenue metric which has risen lately. The balance of the company's cash burn is related to balance sheet items. The company's cash collection cycle tends to be short, but rapid growth will still increase receivable balances.Excluding balance sheet items, CFFO for this company will average $100 million or more per quarter greater than GAAP profit/loss. While it is hard to forecast the company's increases in deferred revenues and more difficult still to forecast that balance on a quarterly basis, it seems likely that the growth in deferred revenues will continue to add more than $40 million a quarter to CFFO for the foreseeable future.It would, I think, be naive to pretend that there was some cut and dried valuation formula for a hyper growth company that is unprofitable and likely to remain so for a year or more and which will not generate any substantial CFFO. I have tried to build the case that the company will continue to grow because of the rapid adoption of HCI as a standard in the IT hardware space. This is one of the more disruptive technologies seen in this space in some while and its advantages are such that it continues to expand its TAM on a rapid basis. All of the current signs suggest that Nutanix will maintain its leadership position in the space although the battle with VMW for the No. 1 spot may persist for several years. And all signs suggest that the path to profitability will go through reducing the sales and marketing expense ratio and that in turn is likely a function of available growth rather than some unique difficulty in achieving product sales.After last quarter's stumble, this quarter's snap back has yet to be appropriately valued. I think current prices represent an excellent entry point and will produce significant positive alpha in the quarters ahead."

4051814,93566,2017-03-03T08:27:11-05:00,"Nutanix reports disappointing results and guidance.Management blamed sales force distractions in North America, but declined to take concrete action.Company expects pressures on gross margins from higher commodity prices going forward.With analysts expected to remain largely supportive for now, this is the chance to get short the stock.Expect the shares to remain under selling pressure and move to new all-time lows over time.","Hyperconverged cloud platform provider Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) just reported its Q2/FY2017 results. The company has been one of the hottest tech IPOs in 2016, with the shares pricing at $16 back at the end of September, substantially above the initial range of $11-13. The stock soared straight out of the gate and ultimately peaked at a whopping $46.78 during the first week of trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange, but was basically cut in half over the next few weeks until touching a 52-week low of $23.11 in early November. From that, the shares managed to stage a solid recovery back into the mid-$30s area.As frequently the case with new IPOs, Nutanix reported blowout Q1/FY2017 top-line results and guided revenues materially above expectations for Q2. Nevertheless, the stock traded down substantially over the following sessions but again managed to recover mostly thanks to overall market strength. So far in 2017, the stock's volatility has settled to its lowest levels since the company went public with Nutanix's shares mostly trading in the low $30s.Unfortunately, investors have to prepare for volatility to increase significantly going forward and the shares to crater to new all-time lows rather sooner than later as Q2 results and forward guidance were largely disappointing, particularly with regard to the company's all-important billings performance which surprisingly decreased sequentially.Management blamed disruptions in sales force's productivity after having recently promoted some of its best performing sales representatives to leadership positions, which led to a lower number of large deal closures during the quarter relative to expectations.Nutanix's management obviously had listened closely to security platform solutions provider Palo Alto Networks' (NYSE:PANW) recent conference call as its statements largely mirrored the explanations given by Palo Alto Networks' management for its weak sales execution, despite both companies doing business in very different market segments.But, in stark contrast to Palo Alto Networks' management, Nutanix's executives seemed largely unconcerned about the poor performance and equally weak outlook, and even declined to take specific countermeasures on the call. Instead, management stated its expectations for the sales force issues to abate over time as new sales representatives grow into their respective roles and incrementally increase productivity.Frankly speaking, I consider this a highly nonprofessional and almost irresponsible approach as I firmly expect these issues to only get more tenuous going forward when not being addressed adequately or even not at all like in case of Nutanix.That said, the company had more bad news to offer as ongoing DRAM and NAND supply constraints will take their toll on gross margins over the next quarter and most likely even beyond.On the conference call, analysts were rather generous with the company and largely abstained from asking tough questions. Instead, some analysts with recent bullish coverage initiations were almost desperately looking for positives to avoid downgrading the stock for now.Indeed, management had to offer some bright spots as strong execution in EMEA and APAC yielded record billings results, with international bookings growing to 48% from 34% in the previous quarter. Unfortunately, a good chunk of the increase in the percentage metric is caused by the underperformance in North America.Things became almost surreal on the call when management hinted to a potential early adoption of a new revenue recognition policy, as the company's evaluation of an accounting change required by the FASB had obviously resulted in a favorable impact to important reported metrics like, for example, gross margin.So, Nutanix is obviously contemplating to pull forward the adoption of the new accounting standard by one year to effectively mask some of the business' recent and expected future underperformance and bring some crucial metrics back up. Several analysts applauded the move almost enthusiastically most likely mainly because of being relieved from backpedaling on their overly optimistic long-term models after just two quarters.Given the progression of the conference call, I have no illusions about analysts' course of action tomorrow as I firmly expect most of them to reiterate their respective ratings on the company's stock, while tweaking estimates just slightly with the biggest bulls even advising to take advantage of the price decline and add to positions.With only two quarters reported by Nutanix as a public company, analysts will mostly tend to give the company the benefit of the doubt for now, particularly in light of the fact that a slew of downgrades would most likely result in an avalanche of class action lawsuits that could very well extend to the underwriters of the recent IPO.Given the expected defenses by analysts, expect Nutanix's stock to open with rather moderate losses relative to the punishment of Palo Alto Networks' shares on Tuesday.Personally, I am planning to take a short position in the stock preferably just slightly below the $30 mark rather early in the session, on my expectations for some of the company's larger institutional investors reassessing their investment thesis in light of the increased risk for further underperformance relative to expectations.As a day trader, I will most likely close the position at session-end, at the latest point, almost regardless of the outcome as margin requirements for short positions tend to cause substantial opportunity cost over time. But given the fact that the company's execution issues will most likely not go away anytime soon, I firmly expect the shares to crater to new all-time lows over the next few weeks as many investors won't feel comfortable with the stock's heightened risk profile anymore.Bottom line:Nutanix's growth engine is already sputtering after just two quarters reported as a public company. Management blamed sales force disruptions for substantial billings underperformance and moreover guided for a decrease in gross margins due to severe commodity pricing pressures going forward.While analysts will largely tend to give Nutanix the benefit of the doubt in the early innings of being a public company, Mr. Market often has very different views on companies that start to underperform expectations already shortly after going public.Accordingly, expect several of the company's institutional holders to reassess their investment thesis over the next few days and weeks, and shares to remain under selling pressure for the time being.Given the issues discussed above, I advise investors to enter a short position in the shares and wait for the scenario outlined by me to play out. If things are developing according to plan, the stock should see new all-time lows going into the company's Q3/FY2017 earnings release in early June.Investors might also find some additional, useful information in my article on somewhat related company Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) that has been published just 24 hours ago."
4057176,23005,2017-03-22T15:46:43-04:00,Nutanix grows sharply with sales of its HCI appliance.Rapid market growth has drawn major new competitors including VMware and allies.A market that changes as fast as it grows to present up- and down-side to stock.,"Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) is both a pioneer and a leader in the market for Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) solutions. The company offers an enterprise cloud platform that converges and integrates virtualized servers and storage to reduce both the footprint and cost of enterprise infrastructure. The company was founded in 2009, launched the 1.0 version of its offering in early 2012, and its own virtual machine monitor (also called a hypervisor) in late 2013. To maintain a competitive lead, the company invests heavily in its platform and technology. It released the 5.0 version of its software last year as it prepared for its initial public offering, which occurred on September 30, 2016, at $16 per share.Since having gone public, Nutanix's shares have been volatile, initially trading up to $47 per share and since round-tripping the band between the low 30s and the low 20s, especially around earnings. The company is growing very fast and dominates a rapidly growing market it defined with its offering. Both the product and the market are complex, however. Hence, there is much to learn if one is to get comfortable enough with the company to purchase its shares. Accordingly, we offer the following analysis in two stages. First, we will take a close look at the company and its products, and review the recent earnings report. Then, we will give an overview of both the technology of HCI and the market that is growing so rapidly around it.A Look at NutanixIn its most recent fiscal year (ended July 31st), Nutanix generated revenue of $444.9 million, posting an increase of 84.3% over the prior year. Of this amount, nearly 80% derived from the sale of products and the remainder from support and services. Both businesses have a cost of revenue of just under 40%, yielding a gross margin for the year of 61.6%. We note, though, that it has since trended down a bit in the first and second quarters due to increases in DRAM and Flash memory pricing. The company is investing heavily in its businesses, and operating expense readily exceeds gross profit. Yet, management must invest ahead of revenue, given such strong growth. Based on consensus estimates, it is clear analysts expect this growth to continue, albeit at a declining rate; the consensus revenue estimates for fiscal 2017 and 2018 are $741 million and $1.04 billion, representing respective growth rates of 66.6% and 39.8%.The company's products comprise Hyperconverged Infrastructure solutions, both as Nutanix-branded systems and through OEM relationships with Dell and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY). In its 10-K, Nutanix lists Partners A through F that assist it in serving end customers. The company uses the distributors Carahsoft Technology and Promark Technology to ship its products to end customers and, in fiscal 2016, the two accounted for 15% and 20% of revenues, respectively. Three other partners (Partners C, E and F) accounted for 14%, 11% and 15%, respectively, of revenues in the year. The concentration is considerable, indeed, as these five partners contribute 75% of revenue. The company also sells software-only solutions for installation on third-party hardware, most notably on the Dell XE series and Lenovo Converged HX series, as well as on the Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) UCS rack-mountable server series. By way of reference, software accounts for 15% of bookings and ultimately revenue as well. Two thirds of this amount is generated from software license sales, the remainder from support and services.The company's core technologies reside in its software, which is designed to run on industry standard servers. It outsources the assembly and test of its own products to Super Micro (NASDAQ:SMCI) and Avnet (NASDAQ:AVT), which procure the required components, assemble the systems, and install and test the software. Its third-party logistics firms handle shipment while holding no inventory. Product revenues are recognized on shipment and support and other services revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the contract.Recent EarningsNutanix recently reported its fiscal second-quarter results, its second release since going public (See Table 1 above). It again surpassed expectations. Revenues for the quarter were $182.2 million, up 77% over the prior year level. Billings of $227 million were up 59% year to year and deferred revenue of $420.6 million was up 128% on the same basis. The billings to revenue ratio remains healthy 1.25x, down 23 basis point from the fourth-quarter peak of 1.48x. The company continues to add customers at a rapid clip, with an additional 900 bringing the total to 5,384. This represented year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter increases of 104% and 20.3%, respectively. Indeed, the company could rightfully claim in its recent earnings conference call that ""we're extremely proud of our rapidly growing customer roster,"" which features prominent companies large and small. Cash generation improved as well, as the company generated positive operating cash flow for the fifth quarter in a row. And, for the first time, free cash flow was positive as well. A singular blemish was a slight decrease in profitability (noted above), as the non-GAAP gross margin inched down to 59.8%, due to increases in DRAM and NAND pricing. Still, on balance, the metrics were strong.The company's performance in the quarter was impressive on qualitative factors as well. Nutanix continues to see strong adoption of its built-in Hypervisor (AHV, described below). On a rolling four-quarter basis, usage in the quarter rose to 21% from 17% in the prior quarter. This product was also certified for use on SAP's (NYSE:SAP) Business Suite, which is integrated within its Netweaver Platform. It can now be integrated with Nutanix's Enterprise Cloud Platform deployments with this widely used software environment. The platform this quarter was also selected by Computer Reseller News as product of the year in the Hyperconverged Infrastructure category, taking first place in both the Product and Customer Demand sub-categories. The award was made in conjunction with its use on Cisco's UCS (Unified Computing Systems) offering (also commonly used and discussed below).The company's call soured a bit, however, when management gave guidance. For the third quarter, revenues are now expected to be between $180 and $190 million, yielding a midpoint somewhat below the consensus of $188 million. And, with additional memory pricing pressure, the gross margin is to be between 57% and 58%. Accounting for the weaker-than-expected revenue guidance is a transition that is underway in its North American sales force. The company is moving some of its most productive people into sales management roles. As a result, the company booked fewer large deals and came into the third quarter with somewhat less momentum. Still, the miss is a slight one and a reflection of the difficulty of managing such strong revenue growth. But however transient, it produced a 26% drop in the share price, as such events do with rapid growers. The consensus estimates have held steady, however, with revenues for fiscal 2017 and 2018 (as we noted above) growing, 66.6% to $741 million and 39.8% to $1.04 billion, respectively.Nutanix Product SolutionNutanix Enterprise Cloud Platform, as stated in the Offering Memorandum, ""converges server, storage and virtualization resources into one integrated solution delivered on commodity x86 servers."" The company's two products are Prism and Acropolis and can be best understood in the following schema, which we have adapted from the company's graphic.Acropolis offers the meat of the solution and runs virtually above the hardware layer and its OS. It includes the Distributed Storage Fabric, which provides ""high performance storage services for all applications,"" and the App Mobility Fabric, which allows for ""intelligent application placement and migration."" Multiple hypervisors are supported, including VMware's (NYSE:VMW) bare-metal ESXi, Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Hyper-V and, more recently, its own Acropolis Hypervisor (AHV). Based on the KVM native to Linux, AHV obviates the need and cost of third-party hypervisors. As we will see below, individual hypervisors support so-called containers, comprising an operating system with its required application and workload. Based on research confirmed by IDC, Acropolis allows for a 60% reduction in cost relative to traditional infrastructure and an 80% reduction in virtualization costs. Given the rate of growth displayed by both the market and Nutanix, customers are finding these benefits compelling.Prism runs above Acropolis as an interface that allows administrators to manage virtualization and infrastructure. It offers administrators ""robust operational analytics,"" as well as search and self-service capabilities. Capacity planning, application provisioning, upgrades and troubleshooting can be managed and even automated through its GUI, often with one click.HCI: A Look At The TechnologyData center technologies have undergone rapid transformation over the past decade, with the emergence of Big Data and a fundamental shift in focus from Enterprise Computing to the requirements of social media infrastructure and Cloud Computing. Standards and technologies have proliferated with the emergence of both open and proprietary web-scale computing infrastructures (i.e., of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Azure, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, etc.) and widely embraced open-source computing technologies (Linux, Hadoop, the Open Compute Project, Openstack, etc.). And in utilizing their own on-premise infrastructure and that of cloud service providers, enterprises have significantly increased the complexity and the heterogeneity of their computing environments. This rich situation merits special treatment elsewhere. But it is the launching point for any discussion of Converged and Hyperconverged Infrastructure.With Converged Infrastructure, vendors have converged formerly discrete compute, storage and even network hardware to ease the implementation of new deployments. And to maximize utilization of this converged hardware, companies have adopted virtualization as a software management layer over the ""bare metal"" hardware and, most often, its operating system. Hypervisors, or virtual machine monitors, reside above the operating system of the so-called host machine to run multiple virtual machines (also called guest machines), each with its own operating system. Multiple applications can thus be run simultaneously, each within its own so-called container supported by an individual hypervisor and virtualized OS.Hyperconverged Infrastructure is a natural progression from virtualization intended to further increase computing capacity, manageability and utilization within these complex computing structures. Above the converged hardware, data management and processing occur in virtualized software-defined servers and storage, hence the notion of hyperconvergence. As they arise, workloads can by dynamically provisioned by system administrators across hypervisors and virtual machines from a management console. Processes can be automated as well. Hyperconverged infrastructure allows enterprise systems administrators to optimally leverage the abundant, differentiated and heterogeneous computing resources available to them. And they now can do so within individual Hyperconverged systems and the Private and Public Clouds with which they are networked. Some term this Superconvergence as it involves software-defined networking. A key point to recall is that HCI is a hyper-converged computing system with software-defined servers and storage, integrated into what are termed ""nodes."" The market appears segmented as, depending on the vendor, these systems can scale to 24, 100 and close to 1,000 nodes. Moreover, the market continues to grow and evolve very rapidly.HCI: A Look At The MarketAs much trade press coverage as there is for the Hyperconverged Infrastructure market, there is not as much analysis of the market as you would think. This is because the market is only now gaining scale and size of note. Moreover, many participants are either captive business units of larger companies or private. IDC includes Hyperconverged Systems within its Converged Systems quarterly tracker, and we have some idea of its size from the most recent published data. Mousing over the graph, we have extrapolated that the trailing 12-month revenues for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $1,774.7 million. We believe this amount to be understated by IDC's rigorous methodology, but it is just as likely that the very rapid growth of the market, and the precise timing of the observations we have considered, are issues as well.We have other insights to offer. Last May, Gartner forecast that the market for HCI would grow 79% in 2016 to almost $2 billion. And it stated the market could grow to $5 billion in 2019 to encompass 24% of the market. Last August, this researcher posited that 30% of x86 workloads will be in HCI environments in 2019, up from the then present 5% level. And 20% of mission-critical applications will transition to HCI systems by 2020, in its view. So the market will continue to display strong growth. Only Nutanix is public and it is said by Gartner to have 50% share of the market. SimpliVity is positioned second with an additional 20% of the market. The remainder of the market is fragmented. In any event, the market opportunity is considerable. Nutanix's Targeted Available Market (TAM), as it is identified in the offering memorandum, totals $125.6 billion for 2016. Were 20% transition to HCI, the opportunity would amount to $25.1 billion. This surely has the interest of major vendors, as we shall see.A Forrester Wave report on all 12 participants in the HCI market was published last summer, though it is only available through purchase or intermediaries. It is well summarized in Network World by Brandon Butler. Nutanix, which named the market with its first product release in 2011, is (as is often said) the mind and market share leader. With annualized revenue and deployments at that time, respectively, of $460 million and 3,100, it is the clear market leader. It is also said to have the most robustly featured offering as well. Forrester cited SimpliVity as runner-up, praising its platform while noting it scales only to clusters of 48 nodes (versus the 100 node clusters of Nutanix). The third company in Forrester's leaders category is Pivot3, which introduced its first HCI offering in 2007. It has focused more on data rich surveillance applications than the enterprise, and to that degree is seen as an outlier.Beyond these three leading participants, there are a handful of small non-public vendors, as well as the major hardware vendors you would expect. And this is notable as it is clear the latter are increasing their focus on the market significantly. HPE (NYSE:HPE) has recently completed the acquisition of SympliVity and plans an integrated offering within 60 days. Combining HPE's ""best-in-class infrastructure, automation and cloud management software with SimpliVity's industry-leading software-defined data management platform,"" the company will offer what it terms the industry's only ""built-for-enterprise hyperconverged offering."" Cisco has also stepped up with its HyperFlex Systems portfolio, which it has shipped to 1,100 customers in the three quarters since its introduction. It has just released a series of new features for the system, which it sells with its widely used Cisco UCS platform. And it deems its offering to be ""purpose-built"" with ""ground-up innovation for Hyperconverged Infrastructure."" Clearly, it is a formidable competitor.Last but not least, there is the obvious pairing of EMC and VMware, which Forrester treated separately in last year's analysis (See Figure 2 above). Of course, the latter is a subsidiary of the former, albeit one that is publicly-traded. EMC and VMware, together with Cisco's and EMC's pivotal, have offered converged, and more recently hyperconverged, systems through their VCE alliance, which they formed in 2009. (The acronym VCE resolves to Virtualized Computing Environment, though it could as easily stand for VMware, Cisco, and EMC). And with Dell's inclusion of EMC and its Converged Systems business (VCE and by extension VMware), the company's HCI offering operates in manifold ways. Together, this aggregation of Tech leaders has significantly and broadly increased its focus on hyperconverged infrastructure over the past 18 months.VMware is a software company and deploys its product offering on a range of vendor hardware. Its chief hyperconverged offering is its vSAN. In August 2016, VMware re-architected its software offering, introducing the Cross-Cloud Architecture, which is targeted squarely at what it terms SSDC Clouds (i.e., Software-Defined Data Center Clouds). As such, the release significantly increased its focus on hyper-converged solutions. As stated, the VMware Cloud Foundation ""delivers the next-generation hyper-converged infrastructure for building Private Clouds. ""EMC and VMware together offer two Hyperconverged Infrastructure products: the VxRail appliance family, introduced in February 2016, and the VxRack SDDC family, introduced in May 2015 (See Figure 2 above). Both are intended for use in VMware environments, which account for much of the market. While the former is a true appliance comparable to Nutanix, the latter is a more robust hyperconverged rackscale system. So named, it relies on the Intel Rack Scale architecture in which storage is decentralized and distributed across server racks, typically within large system cabinets. With virtualization, the entire system can power computing, and in this sense, it is ripe for hyperconvergence and software-defined computing. The VxRack is a true enterprise product that can scale to far larger clusters of nodes (to nearly 1,000).With EMC's acquisition by Dell, VCE also offers the Dell EMC CX as a third hyperconverged solution, along with its VxRack and VxRail systems. The Dell product is indeed powered by Nutanix software and its optimized to support heterogeneous environments requiring multiple hypervisors. The VxRail is likewise an appliance suited to the large part of the market using VMware's vSphere and ESXi. That is, the Dell EMC CX can support multiple hypervisors, including Nutanix AVM, VMware's ESXi, and Microsoft's Hyper-V. This clearly differentiates the platform and its Nutanix software from the VxRail and VxRack, which are optimized for VMware-based deployments. Some question the willingness of Dell EMC and VMware to support all three platforms, though the company has stated its commitment to each of them. In a letter from November 2016, VCE President Chad Zakac and Nutanix CEO Dheeraj Pandey strenuously reaffirmed their commitment to the platform and its many joint customers, noting that it had sold 10,000 nodes to 1,000 customers in the preceding 19 months. Clearly, there is strong demand for the product.Two Key Individual Views of HCIMuch additional insight into Hyperconverged Infrastructure can be gained from two very long and expansive interviews of VCE's Zacak and Nutanix's Pandey in IDG's Network World by its chief of content, John Gallant. The earlier of the two, from last August, was with Zacak, just six months after the February launch of the VCE VxRail appliance. Indeed, the titles of each of the interviews are telling. The former of Zacak reads: ""VCE Chief Boasts of Hyperconvergence Superpower."" He clearly expects VxRail to become the number one hyperconverged appliance. He also suggests that HCI is only now growing out of its early phase, where it has been served by the dominant incumbents, Nutanix and SimpliVity. He sees these current leaders as wedded to their singular platforms, whereas he believes the market is segmented and requires a range of converged and hyperconverged solutions. This is because, in using software-defined servers and storage, hyperconverged infrastructure is unable to support services required in certain mission critical tasks. He thus sees healthy demand for both VCE's converged offerings (Vblock and VxBlock) and its hyperconverged offerings (VxRack and VxRail), as well. He also notes the very large majority of the market standardized on VMware's vSphere virtualization platform and states the VCE converged and hyperconverged solutions are purpose-built to integrate seamlessly with it.Indeed, HCI grew initially at the edge of the Enterprise, supporting Virtualized Desktops Infrastructure and VDI still accounts for about 30% of the market served by Nutanix and Simplivity. Mr. Zacak believes these first generation appliances, so well suited to ROBO (Remote Office/Branch Office) applications, will have trouble attaining the scale and reach required to serve what will truly be an Enterprise market. For example, Simplivity installations can scale only to 48 nodes, and Nutanix to 100 nodes. VxRack, in contrast, can scale from four to close to 1,000 nodes. He notes that the market grew from a $1 billion market last year to a $2 billion market this year. As it grows to $10s of billions in ""the next few years,"" participants will need scale to stay in the game, in his view. Either way, VCE is having great success. With just four months at the time from its launch (including what is typically a three-month adoption and deployment period), VxRail had gained 360 customers in 60 countries, selling over 2,000 nodes over an entrenched market leader. As with Cisco's HyperFlex, the market seems very receptive to VxRail and what Zacak calls ""its big brother"" VxRack. In fact, in VMware's fourth-quarter earnings conference call, the company stated the vSAN and VxRail license bookings were up 150% year to year and that the business is now at a $300 million run rate with more than 7,000 customers across all segments. And the company repeated claims to be the leader in HCI. Including the revenue it generates from the Nutanix-based Dell EMC CX, this may well someday be the case.The second Network World interview, from late September, was with Nutanix CEO Dheeraj Pandey. Its title, ""Nutanix CEO Skewers Box-based Hyperconvergence Rivals,"" is illuminating as well. The interviewer notes the complexity of the HCI market, ranging from stand-alone providers like Nutanix and SimpliVity to a ""semi-bewildering array"" of partnerships between these stand-alones and their OEM partners. Asked how this might shake out, Pandey states there are only two operating system players, VMware and Nutanix. SimpliVity, Cisco and HPE all rely on VMware. And Dell relies on Nutanix. And only Nutanix started with an ""empty canvas,"" much like VMware started with vSAN 12 to 15 years ago.While Pandey has ""a lot of respect"" for VMware, he seems too dismissive of SimpliVity when he describes it to be ""a smoke and mirrors company"" set ""to crater under their own weight around the false promises"" they made. CEOs should never discuss competitors in such a way, even those under duress. Moreover, it is not clear SimpliVity was under duress; its venture investors, in selling out to HPE, alluded to its strong growth and third-party observers have praised its offering. Another unsatisfying feature in his characterization of the market is that he fails to note the dominance of VMware and its virtualization in the marketplace and the fact that it has driven most participants to standardize on it as the operating system because of its ubiquity. Still, he notes the utility of Prism as a management interface and its appeal to administrators of virtualized desktop infrastructure. Finally, he notes the enormity of capital and operational expenditures spent on the hardware, software, and virtualization of infrastructure and believes it will support a multiplicity of players. Indeed, Nutanix retains its market leadership.In sum, the market for Hyperconverged Infrastructure products is growing and evolving rapidly. Created with the release of Nutanix's first product five years ago, it has been populated up to now by a handful of upstarts and major players with products that could be adapted, to some degree, to the specific needs of the market. The technologies now, however, are highly developed and highly in demand. Major vendors anticipate rapid adoption in the Enterprise and are now aligned to satisfy the resulting demand. VCE and HPE, as well as Cisco, see the great opportunity the market presents and have developed, or are developing, the products it now requires. And they are now generating significant traction in the marketplace. This is what VMware terms next-generation hyperconvergence. We believe competitive pressure in the market is set to increase in very significant ways.And Regarding Nutanix the Stock?Nutanix remains the mind and market share leader for Hyperconverged Infrastructure Solutions, as it confronts a rapidly changing market. In a brief 18 months or so, it is doubling from a half-billion-dollar company to a billion-dollar company in a market that, in many ways, it created, gaining a share of roughly 50%. Though profitability is likely still over the horizon, cash flow metrics have turned positive and the company is clearly gaining scale. Moreover, it seems to have the strong support of its customers and its partners, even those with which it competes. This speaks to the compelling nature of its products.This being readily acknowledged the fact remains the market for HCI solutions is changing as fast as it is growing. It has been a market in which Nutanix and Simplivity could lead with shares of 70% and 20%, respectively. Yet, major vendors with newly charged offerings have come crashing in with momentum of their own. HPE has acquired SimpliVity and hopes to boost the combined market position with its broad customer base and strong balance sheet. Cisco recently cited as a possible third OEM partner for Nutanix, has recharged its HyperFlex offering and, with its popular UCS server platform, has added 1,100 customers in a few quarters. And VCE and VMware, having really just entered the market, have gained considerable traction with their manifold offering, which includes not only VMware, nSAN, VxRack and VxRail, but also the paring of the Dell EMC CX appliance and Nutanix software. Clearly, the rapidly growing market for Hyperconverged Infrastructure is well served with abundant alternatives.As we noted above, Nutanix's shares rocketed from $16 per share to $47 per share out of its IPO last fall, subsiding as such recently issued stocks do. It now trades at the low end of the $20 per share to $30 per share range and thus would seem to have upside, especially once the lock-up from the IPO expires at the end of March. Nutanix is the leader of very hot market, but one that is now hotly contested. Large, well capitalized Tech leaders are now positioned to compete more forcefully. Yet, the market and technologies are very complex and the use-cases for customers both complex and differentiated. This is clear in the HCI offerings of Dell EMC, which range from VMware's vSAN, through VCE's VxRack and VxRail, and the Dell EMC CX running Nutanix software. Surely the high growth of the market will blunt some volatility for Nutanix shares. That said, we expect some volatility in the stock price as market share shifts become clear with earnings. For investors, we recommend nimble trading as opportunities arise on the up- or down-side in share price movement. And if indeed one captures gains, we will have to advise hyper-vigilance. This is one stock to watch closely as trading opportunities are sure to arise and offer rewards."
4056106,21136,2017-03-17T10:53:49-04:00,"The lock-up expiration for Nutanix is set for March 29, 2017.After the lock-up period expires, Nutanix is expected to offer more shares in a secondary offering, which could amplify price pressure with an oversupply.We predict pre-IPO insiders will be eager sell shares once restrictions are lifted.Our firm has found price declines in the days (-11, +9) surrounding a few select lock-up expiration events (day 0).","Event SummaryThe lock-up period is a restriction that prevents major pre-IPO shareholders, such as venture capitalists, employees, managers, owners, and company founders from selling immediately after the IPO.The restriction usually lasts 180 days after the company goes public. The 180-day lock-up period for Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) is scheduled to expire on March 29, 2017. Currently 122.4M shares are restricted from trading. This represents 89.7% of the total shares outstanding.(S-1/A)Although Nutanix was arguably one of the hottest IPOs of 2016 and performed strongly in its market debut, the stock recently took a tumble. The stock reached a high of $46.78, and is now trading for less than half of that. The strong early performance and possible fear that a recent downward trend could continue could push pre-IPO shareholders to sell shares once restrictions are lifted. We therefore recommend investors sell of short shares before pre-IPO shareholders have the opportunity to on March 29, 2017.Our firm has found that movement around lock-up period expirations is strongest when a large percentage of total shares outstanding are restricted, when the company has performed well its IPO , and when outside investors hold a significant portion of the restricted shares. Nutanix fits all three criteria. The stock is up significantly since its IPO and its pre-IPO shareholders include six PE/VC investors (see below), who hold an aggregate of 52.9% of total shares outstanding. We predict these outside investors will be eager to cash in on gains, as well as free up capital for other investments.(S-1/A)Company BackgroundSan Jose, California-based Nutanix offers cloud-based, enterprise-level services that integrate the traditional IT components of visualization, storage and server into a single product.

He currently serves on the board of directors of Applied Micro Circuits Corporation, a fabless semiconductor company. Mr. Williams holds a B.S. in Accounting from Bentley College and an M.B.A. from the University of Southern California.Recent IPO Performance and Financial HighlightsNutanix went public on Sept. 29, 2016, after much hype and excitement from investors. Due to strong demand, the company priced a larger share offering above an already upwardly revised range. Shares priced at $16, then increased over 131% on the first day, to finish the day at $37 per share. Despite this strong start, shares have been drifting downward and took a sharp drop in March after providing weak Q3 guidance. Shares fell 27% on the earnings report and are currently trading around $21.00.The company reported earnings on March 2nd, and the stock price fell immediately on disappointing guidance for the following quarter. For Q32017, Nutanix gave revenue projections of $180M - $190M, (versus analysts' consensus of 188.45M) and provided EPS guidance of a net loss of -$0.45 - -$0.48, (versus analysts' consensus of -$0.35).Conclusion: Sell, or Short Opportunity For Experienced InvestorsNutanix is still up 25% from its IPO price, even after dropping significantly post its earnings report.We predict pre-IPO investors will be eager to cash in on gains once restrictions are lifted, particularly given the negative guidance Nutanix gave for future earnings and fear of future share price dip.As noted previously, pre-IPO shareholders hold 89.7% of total shares outstanding. If these shareholders sell even of a portion of their shares after March 29 it could have a significant impact on share price.We therefore recommend investors sell of short prior of March 29.Don Dion's IPO Insights provides up-to-date information and analysis on the major IPOs each week, along with additional opportunities to invest and short these stocks at their quiet period and lockup period expirations, respectively.

The results surpassed market expectations, but did little to improve the stock's performance.Nutanix's FinancialsNutanix's first quarter revenues grew 90% to $166.8 million driven by a 87% increase in billings to $239.8 million. Loss for the quarter came in at $47.8 million or $0.37 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $152 million and a loss of $0.44 per share.By segment, product revenues grew 84% over the year to $129.66 million and support and other services revenues grew 114% to $37.15 million. During the quarter, Nutanix added more than 700 customers to end with nearly 4,500 customers.Nutanix expects revenues of $175-$180 million for the current quarter with a loss of $0.35-$0.36 per share. The Street had forecast revenues of $168 million and a loss of $0.37 per share.Nutanix's AcquisitionsDuring the quarter, Nutanix completed two acquisitions. It had announced the acquisition of storage acceleration and analytics specialist PernixData in August this year. PernixData specializes in scale-out data acceleration and analytics and is known for its software that helps customers virtualize applications without compromising on performance and visibility.Earlier last quarter, Nutanix also acquired DevOps automation services provider Calm.io. Nutanix plans to leverage the Calm.io acquisition to build an application first approach toward managing IT by adding cloud automation and more management tools. The acquisition will help Nutanix move closer to being able to deliver application and service orchestration, runtime lifecycle management and policy-based governance across all application environments. Terms of the acquisitions are not known.According to IDC, the hyperconverged infrastructure market is estimated to grow from $981.91 million market in 2015 to more than $4.7 billion by 2019. But despite impressive market growth rate projections and an upbeat performance, investors aren't too optimistic about Nutanix as bigger players like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) are entering the hyper-converged cloud infrastructure market. Earlier this year, both these players had launched their versions of the hyperconverged offerings, which analysts believe will help commoditize the space.Nutanix isn't very worried. According to Nutanix, Cisco's hyper-converged solution essentially competes with VMware's (NYSE:VMW) products and is dependent on VMware to function properly. Cisco does not necessarily offer its own virtualization experience. To provide a superior service, Nutanix is working more closely with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and is designing the operating system to span from an enterprise's facilities to public cloud installations running on AWS.In August this year, Cisco also announced plans that ousted Nutanix from its solutions partner program. Analysts believe that Cisco's move was fueled by its failed attempts to acquire Nutanix earlier last year.The stock had listed in October this year at $16 and had soon soared to a high of $46.78. It is currently trading at $25.28 with a market capitalization of $3.6 billion. It had fallen to a low of $23.11 in November."

NTNX price action has been very volatile since it started trading. NTNX is an early leader in the fast-growing Hyper Converged Infrastructure (HCI) market. Gartner is bullish on this space and mentioned in the 2016 Magic Quadrant for Integrated Systems, ""Twenty percent of mission-critical applications currently deployed on three-tier IT infrastructure will transition to HCISs by 2020.""Today we will focus on the HCI market where Nutanix competes and not the Converged Infrastructure market.If we break down the three tiers in detail, these are Servers, Storage and Virtualization. NTNX's S1, page 5 mentioned the following statistics on the three-tier infrastructure:Based on the Gartner 20% prediction, it's fair to say $16 billion of spend will likely be disrupted and at risk. This doesn't mean the HCI market will be worth $16 billion as customers would require a lower cost of ownership to transition to the new technology.Companies at risk - ServerThe server market is dominated by HP, Dell and IBM (NYSE:IBM), which own over 50% of the market. A weak server market is nothing new for these players as they all face fierce competition from the original design manufacturer (ODM) targeting hyper scale customers directly. Expect these players to closely monitor the HCI market and introduce their own solutions over time. In the case of Dell, they have an OEM relationship with NTNX.Companies at risk - StorageEMC, which recently merged with Dell to create Dell Technologies is the worldwide leader. HP, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and IBM also feature in the top 5. Clearly, DELL, HP and IBM will see a threat from the HCI market on both their Server and Storage businesses. EMC and NTAP will be looking very carefully at the HCI market. EMC has already hedged its bets with the introduction of VxRail in Feb 2016, a direct competitor to Nutanix.Companies at risk - VirtualizationVMware (NYSE:VMW) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are the largest players in this space. The common thread amongst Server, Storage and Virtualization is Dell Technologies and it's worth understanding where Dell fits in.Dell - Key Risk 1)Firstly, Dell Technologies is a leader in the Server Market, and leads in the storage market through newly acquired EMC and finally is the leader in the Virtualization market through its ownership of VMware. The newly refreshed VxRail is now based on Dell Servers and is a direct competitor to NTNX. For companies already using Vsphere and EMC storage, the VxRail could do well in competitive back-offs.Dell - Key Risk 2)Dell is an OEM partner of NTNX and has extended their partnership to 2021. Ultimately, however, if EMC and Dell decide to sell their own solutions over NTNX then this may harm their business. The S1 indicates Partner B is 20% of revenue, however the name of the partner is not disclosed and it's unclear how much concentration is tied up to Dell.Positives so farClearly, NTNX has a lot of things going for it including the following;What to Look for to gain conviction in NTNXWhy not dive in and buy the stock? For the moment, it is prudent to sit on the sidelines until we have more clarity on the following;If NTNX can navigate the key challenges ahead then shareholders will likely be rewarded and NTNX will be a free cash flow multibillion-dollar business. For now, it is best to be a fence sitter as the next few quarters will be high risk due to higher levels of uncertainty around the competitive environment."

But uncertain market conditions made it delay its listing.It listed on the Nasdaq at $16 a share at a valuation of $2.18 billion.The valuation wasn't much higher than what Nutanix had been valued at two years ago at its last funding round. But the market appears to have received the stock well so far.","After a rather slow IPO schedule for the technology sector during the year, things appear to be looking up. Last week, hyperconverged storage provider Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), finally went public. It had filed to go public in December last year, but the market conditions led to a delayed listing. It has only been a week since it listed, but the Billion-Dollar Unicorn club member appears to be doing well so far.Nutanix's FinancialsFounded in 2009 by tech experts Dheeraj Pandey, Ajeet Singh and Mohit Aron, San Jose-based Nutanix was set up to deliver invisible infrastructure for enterprise computing. It developed storage capabilities to simplify datacenter infrastructure by integrating server and storage resources into a turnkey appliance that can be deployed in as less as 30 minutes and can run any application at any scale. Nutanix's impressive ""Legos"" like platform has helped it deliver strong growth since being founded.According to recent financials, Nutanix's revenues grew 84% for the year ended July 2016 to $445 million. The continued investments in product development and marketing capabilities continue to hurt the margins. Nutanix ended the year with losses growing 34% over the year to $169 million.By segment, product revenues grew 74% to $350.8 million and support and services revenues grew 131% to $94.1 million.Nutanix's Road to the IPOIn December 2015, Nutanix had filed to go public. But uncertain market conditions made it delay its listing. Prior to listing, Nutanix had raised $312.2 million from investors including Anshu Sharma, Battery Ventures, Blumberg Capital, Bob Pasker, EquityZen, Greenspring Associates, InstantScale Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Morgan Stanley, Riverwood Capital and Sapphire Ventures. In August 2014 it had raised $140 million at a valuation of over $2 billion. The delayed IPO coupled with continued losses made it raise another $75 million in loans from Goldman Sachs this year. And then, finally, last week, the company took the plunge.It listed on the Nasdaq under the ticker NTNX at $16 a share at a valuation of $2.18 billion. The valuation wasn't much higher than what Nutanix had been valued at two years ago at its last funding round. But the market appears to have received the stock well so far. The stock rose to $46.78 after listing, taking its market capitalization to over $5 billion. It has fallen since and is trading at $36.10 - still a significant uptick from its list price.Nutanix's successful listing is a good omen for the tech industry. The data storage industry hasn't had a very strong IPO track record of late. Other vendors like Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) and Nimble Storage (NYSE:NMBL) have seen their valuations fall by more than 40% since they listed. Nutanix's IPO is likely to steer other tech companies into listing.Nutanix's CompetitionBut Nutanix's path ahead is not all that rosy. The industry is seeing strong competition from bigger vendors. Dell's acquisition of EMC earlier this year has brought Dell's might into the industry as well. Besides being a competitor now, Dell has also been an OEM partner and a big customer for Nutanix. Dell accounted for a meaningful portion of Nutanix's billings over the past few quarters and there is obvious concern that Dell may want to switch over to its own EMC-VMWare offering instead.Then there are other legacy players like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and HP Enterprises (NYSE:HPE) which are also very bullish on the sector. Earlier this year, both Cisco and HPE launched their hyperconverged offerings. Cisco's HyperFlex was released in March and post the release, Nutanix was no longer part of the Cisco partner program. In fact, even though Nutanix announced that its software could run on Cisco's UCS C-Series server/storage systems, Cisco said that it does not support the solution."
4010460,98236,2016-10-05T21:13:25-04:00,"Nutanix's shares went pubic last week and have been hyper-volatile since that point.The company's valuation is going to be judged by many as hyper-extended, but looking carefully suggests that it is by no means as elevated as perceived by the naked eye.The company has pioneered and is the market leader in a category called hyper-converged infrastructure.Hyper-converged infrastructure is likely to see the fastest growth rate in the enterprise hardware space, at least through 2020 in percentage terms.The company has shown some margin leverage at scale, although it is still loss making and will almost surely remain so through its next fiscal year.","Nutanix - Disruptive technology for sure; positively disruptive investment maybe!Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), a leader in the hyper-converged infrastructure space, launched its IPO at the end of last month after a lengthy saga in which suspense built to a climax. The title of this article comes from the musical Guys and Dolls, written by Frank Loesser in 1950 and perhaps most famously performed by Frank Sinatra in the film version of Guys and Dolls. It has nothing to do with the business of Nutanix and has to do with the efforts by a character called Nicely-Nicely Johnson (really, that is the man's name in the show) to get a bunch of serial gamblers to a prayer meeting. Guys and Dolls gets revived from time to time and it is often reprised in high school drama clubsNutanix has been a significant player in disrupting the enterprise infrastructure business for the past several years, really tearing at old customer relationships with its technology. It is not a storage company, although it does sell storage and its secret sauce is that it really does sell hardware that incorporates the various required functions required in IT and does so for less and for a dramatic reduction in the total cost of ownership. I think there is little doubt that it is destined to be a big deal - one of those hyped spaces that deserves the hype.Nutanix's shares have been rocking more than a few portfolios as well. The shares went public for $16.50, which seemed a somewhat normal valuation, or at least one that could be defended by underwriters. At that price, the company was valued at $2.3 billion and that is somewhat consistent with valuations at the time Nutanix did its last round of venture financing in 2014.All things considered, the IPO valuation was a bargain as had been forecast by some of the writers on this site since Nutanix has grown exponentially since 2014. I am not totally sure why the underwriters erred to such a degree on the side of cautious conservatism. Perhaps the underwriters were concerned that the company is in the storage business - which it is, sort of, and storage companies are not commanding the strongest valuations these days. The underwriters might also have been concerned that the hyper-convergence is a hyper-competitive space into which hardware vendors are piling. Everyone is looking to say they have a hyper-converged solution even if their definition produces far less benefit than one can get using the Nutanix platform. And then there is the inconvenient fact that this company has yet to earn money and is unlikely to do so in the near future although there are some pale green shoots toward a better profit trend.On the other hand, the company has nearly trebled its size in two years and it grew by 84% last year. The TAM for the company's product is probably more than $100 billion, and the acceptance of this technology by major users is one of the strongest seen by many observers in recent years. Revenues as reported reached $445 million in the fiscal year that ended 7/31.Perhaps a better metric to consider is billings which are more than doubling every year and which reached $206 million last quarter. While one can't eat a billing, it is the most objective measure of the company's growth and scale, and it significantly changes the valuation parameters for this company. The growth of billings is to an extent reflected in the growth of deferred revenues which has grown from $36 million to $296 million over the past two years. I do expect that the derived bookings metric will most likely become key to valuations for investors over time. In looking at the share price action in the first few days of trading, I think it is important to note that annualizing the latest billings numbers and using them as a proxy for revenues produces a valuation of something like 7X and not the 11X EV/S derived from annualizing the latest reported quarterly revenues.The shares jumped by no less than 178% above the IPO price before pulling back yesterday and today. That might seem a bit odd to some, but then there are Acacia (NASDAQ:ACIA) and Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) whose share price performance makes this journey seem like a sedate buggy ride at the worst.There have been some articles on SA regarding the prospects for the IPO and price targets. By this time, the shares are in a different valuation universe and no longer fit the parameters of value investors, although companies that are growing north of 80% are rarely likely to do so. The purpose of this article is to both take at least a cursory look at the hyper-converged space and its implications in the hardware space - the operative word being cursory -and to see if the valuation accorded to Nutanix can be justified.As readers are aware, at this point, there have no reports or estimates made on NTNX, and some might suggest I would be better served in deferring commentary until it had at least reported once and publishing analysts took the company guidance and incorporated it in their own estimates. On the other hand, the volatility of the shares and the interest that many seem to have in the name led me to write something based on industry sources and the prospectus.Should investors enter the name at this point, I think the positives outweigh the negatives although the short-term volatility is likely to be significant. The last few weeks have suggested that there is a bit of pent-up demand for the shares of tech unicorns, and if that is the case, I can think of far worst places in which to invest. The company management is seasoned, its products are said to be leading in a space that is the fastest-growing component of the enterprise hardware space. The shares aren't cheap compared to lots else out there, but I would be quite surprised if a company with a 90% growth rate would ever be cheap. Maybe scale into a position. But long-term investors in the tech space are probably going to get to this name eventually.Just what is hyper-converged and why should investors care?Sometimes names say it all. I apologize in advance for any errors due to over-simplification. And to be sure, I am certain that I will omit some pertinent details in the interests of brevity. Some readers have requested shorter articles; others want to see longer ones. This is a compromise. And I am not trying to evaluate products particularly - just trying to recommend stocks. For users who have different experiences using the Nutanix appliance or using other hyper-converged fabrics and have different opinions, realize that I can only use anecdotes I have and data I get from third-party research. I do not manage a data center which some will say is all too evident.Like most companies of this kind, the prospectus has a number of colorful and informative charts for readers looking for a deeper dive into the technology than I will try to provide in this article. This is a technology company which has pioneered a category. One ought to anticipate that it has market-leading technology that has been the major factor in disrupting what had been a very stable and boring market in many ways.But hyper-converged appliances mean just that. The designs for hyper-converged appliances incorporate the functionality of storage, virtualization and compute into a single package. With hyper-converged platforms, users do not buy storage as a standalone product any more. Many people consider hyper-converged solutions to be a kind of storage, and this company first came to my attention when it knocked off NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) in a few deals in the public sector vertical five years ago. But the product and the software that it sells are obviously more than just storage, although the appliance includes storage modules. In fact, these days, Nutanix sells a hyper-converged platform with all-flash arrays, although that product is just barely two months old at this writing.Nutanix has put together an appliance whose hardware is built on commodity servers and flash arrays - although up to this point most of the company's installed product does include legacy storage technology. At one time, it was called a data center in a box as it includes besides storage, compute and virtualization, deduplication, security of a kind and tiering. The benefits to users of this kind of architecture are significant which is why the growth trajectory has been stratospheric and the technology is being adopted in many mainstream shops to replace traditional data center hardware.I sometimes see articles on this site and elsewhere describing things as having limitless demand. I basically cringe before those kinds of assertions, but considering the functionality of hyper-converged appliances, I might come close to suggesting that the TAM will turn out be large and that first-mover advantages so significant that a company like this does have a reasonable chance of justifying its valuation.Hyper-converged platforms seem destined according to many industry commentators to change the enterprise IT hardware landscape beyond recognition because they have so many advantages when compared to everything that has come before. The odds are that they will change the nature of on-premise data centers to an extent almost hard to imagine at this point. Data centers operate without many people because they are automated. Data centers have far fewer contention points between various functional groups since scalability ceases to be a major issue. Fewer issues involving routine errors in managing a data center because most of the most prosaic tasks have been automated. Hyper-converged replacements have very high and easily quantifiable ROIs and are rapidly spreading from smaller enterprises into the whole population of large data centers.The cost of ownership benefits are really substantial and quantifiable. According to an IDC study cited by the company's prospectus, typical TCO reductions are 60% compared to traditional infrastructure and the TCO of the appliance can even be 30% below that of current public cloud offerings. Because of the hyper-converged architecture, this appliance automates many of the administrative tasks that have plagued data center operations for many years.The technology is exceptionally simple to deploy when compared to traditional infrastructure. Many of the tasks that have been considered normal for decades can be done away with by this technology.The appliance has immense scalability based on its clustering architecture. Obviously, nothing is ever going to be as easy for users as adding capacity in their public clouds, but this architecture comes close. Heretofore, adding clusters has had performance impacts; the company says its clusters and software can scale to thousands of nodes without performance degradation.The appliance uses the latest technologies available to ensure security which include two-factor authentication and encryption which can be configured by the system administrations.To a greater or lesser extent, using hyper-converged appliances is competitive with using a public cloud. Indeed, Nutanix describes its platform as an enterprise cloud.On the other hand, it really isn't an either/or proposition. Nutanix and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have a joint offering that uses the Nutanix appliance with Azure. There are going to be multiple ways to reach a new world of computing and cloud and hyper-convergence need not be mutually exclusive. Most users are going to have hybrid infrastructure for many years to come and hyper-convergence is a way of enjoying many of the benefits of the cloud in terms of price/performance. Over time, it is reasonable to assume that some of the limitations of the public cloud will be overcome. On the other hand, hyper-converged technology is likely to continue to improve as well. I do not think that at this stage of the evolution, the growth rate of Nutanix will be impeded by public cloud offerings.At the moment, adding together the various solution sets that NTNX replaces yields a TAM of about $125 billion. Obviously, the costs of hyper-converged products are significantly less than the aggregate of the solutions they are designed to replace. Still, the TAM relative to the size of this company suggests that there will be years of growth runway, regardless of the growth of the public cloud.Some thoughts on growth prospectsI will take a look at the financials best as I am able below, which is essentially an analysis of the prospectus, but this company is going to be valued on bookings growth for at least the next couple of years and perhaps longer than that. The real question for investors is how much growth in revenues/bookings is going to be enough.I recently wrote an article regarding the two publicly-traded vendors of flash storage which might, at some level, be thought of as a competitive technology. One of the two, Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) grew no less than 93% year on year last quarter on a reported revenue basis which is actually a bit faster than the growth of Nutanix in its latest reported period. The sequential growth for the quarter for PSTG was 16% and that was a beat of 5% compared to guidance. The forecast for sequential growth this quarter is 17%. Those are not insignificant growth rates, but at least initially, investors seemed ambivalent regarding the earnings presentation although the shares have now increased by about 13% since the earnings release while IGV is up just a bit more than 1% over the same period.On the other hand, Pure's shares are selling at a bit more than 2X revenues. What does that mean for the future valuation for Nutanix? Different readers and observers will come to different conclusions. Prescience is an attribute gifted to few, and I can't claim any special helping of it, much though it might be desired.In making comparisons, it is fair to note that storage by itself is not as attractive a business, certainly not these days, when compared to the market for hyper-converged hardware/software. And there is a significantly higher software content in what Nutanix sells vs. what is sold with flash storage, although the competitors in the storage space are doing their utmost to change that.Overall, the hyper-converged market has been forecast to grow at more than 43%/year and to reach $12.6 billion by 2022. The market for storage in its own category is not growing at all and might even be shrinking.There are many vendors who sell hyper-converged systems. Not surprisingly the joint venture VCE between Dell/EMC is a major competitor. So are Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) Exa line of appliances. The Gartner Magic Quadrant analysis, which is about a year old, says that Nutanix is the leader in the space and identifies a raft of smaller vendors, many of which are bound for consolidation as competitors of some kind or the other. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), Teradata (NYSE:TDC) and NetApp are also called out but as visionaries and not leaders.I don't think that any but the boldest and more foolhardy analysts want to call winners and losers in such a nascent market at this point. Nutanix in its prospectus lists its competitive strengths as having purpose built enterprise cloud platform, having a commitment and passion for elegant design, and having a breadth of engineering expertise. How any one might even offer a guess as to the quantification of those attributes is far beyond my ken. But I don't think it is particularly risky to opine that all thing considered, it is likely that Nutanix will remain amongst the market leaders for the foreseeable future unless it gets consolidated, and hence its growth rate is likely to equal or exceed the 43% estimated CAGR of the market as a whole over the next several years.Obviously, at some point, the billings that the company is enjoying will turn into revenues and the disparity will narrow. Recall that at the moment, bookings growth is running at an annualized rate of greater than 100% and has done so for the past eight quarters. So, using a 50% growth rate off of an $800 million billings run rate yields a revenue estimate of $2.7 billion by the end of fiscal 2020 for Nutanix. The math suggests it is likely to be greater than that. Depending on profit trends, $2.7 billion or greater in revenues is quite enough to support the current market value of this company with a reasonable IRR over the period.This is a company that does not have enough history to determine seasonal patterns. That being said, its July quarter, the end of its fiscal year, saw the fastest growth in terms of revenues and of bookings and in the growth in deferred revenues of any quarter in the past seven on a percentage basis as well as in absolute dollars.Profitability and valuationNeedless to say, Nutanix is not profitable at this point. All of the figures to be cited are GAAP. The company's non-GAAP presentation will also be discussed. In any event, the company had a GAAP gross margin in its latest fiscal year of 61.5%. That compares to 58% gross margin in the prior year. I think that there are significant scale economies available in a business such as this and that in a more or less reasonable pricing environment, gross margins are likely to expand consistently for several years.Sales and marketing costs are huge. Last year, sales and marketing spend was 65% of total revenues compared to 67% the prior year. Research and development costs were 26% of revenues compared to 30.5% the prior year. General and administrative costs were 7.6% of revenues compared to 10% the prior year. Overall, the operating loss as a percentage of revenues dropped from 49% to 37%. That is decent improvement but almost certainly not fast enough for many observers. I think that the guidance the company is likely to provide in the wake of its first quarterly conference call is likely to describe some inflection points where the spend on both sales and marketing and research and development show far more rapid improvements in their ratios than was the case in the recently ended fiscal year.The company continued to see sequential improvement in cost ratios through the end of its fiscal year. Overall, operating losses in Q4 were 35% of revenue compared to 37% for the year as a whole. That is a pretty decent result for a Q4 for a company which must have been paying significant commission accelerators as the growth in sales and particularly bookings accelerated. On a sequential quarter basis, the operating loss dropped by 500 bps.The company at this point is in a land grab mode and using land and expand sales tactics to the largest possible extent. Eventually those tactics become self-limiting almost by definition. Given the amount of software versus hardware in the company's ""value mix,"" I expect that product gross margins in particular can significantly exceed 62% achieved last year by a fairly wide margin.So far stock-based comp has been relatively modest. It was 4.5% of revenues last year and that compares to 7% of revenues in the prior year.At this point, cash flow from operations is close to a break-even, mainly as a function of the huge growth in deferred revenues. The growth in deferred revenues almost trebled last year, significantly greater than the growth in either reported revenues or in bookings. The growth in deferred revenues was 43% of the reported revenues and represented 30% of proxy bookings. Those are very high numbers and for many investors would be a significant component of the valuation analysis. At this point, I do not know if the company will make bookings and deferred revenue growth a focus of its earnings presentation and forecast. I will simply comment that valuations are far less elevated than might seem to be the case because of that particular metric.Free cash flow is a small use of cash. In the wake of the sale of 14 million shares, the company raised approximately $230 million and paid off $73 million of senior notes. That has left it with $283 million in cash - perhaps less of a balance than might seem reasonable to some observers for a company growing so fast.It is the growth in deferred revenues and bookings that makes the comparison between this company and PSTG far more difficult than it might seem on the surface. It is the growth in deferred revenues that suggests to me that the company's valuation, while not at bargain levels, is perhaps just reasonable enough for those investors who can stand the risk. Hyper-converged is one of those next big things. This company is certainly the most direct way to play the trend and should become a significant business in the foreseeable future."
4009443,25120,2016-09-30T13:01:27-04:00,"Nutanix made a splashing debut as investors are attracted to the disruptor which is actually accelerating sales growth.While sales growth is impressive, Nutanix is posting increasing losses as well.As investors become very upbeat on the growth prospects, I seen no appeal at $30 per share even as I liked the relative sales multiples at the offering price.","Nutanix (NTNX) made a splashing debut as investors are clearly attracted to the rapid growth being reported by the provider of enterprise cloud platform software solutions. While I can surely appreciate the growth and relative modest sales multiples at the $16 offering price, the great opening day returns make it an easy stock to avoid for me.While relative sales multiples can be defended, certainly given the growth reported, Nutanix is losing a lot of money. For me, the risk-reward is simply not appealing at roughly $30 per share.Next Generation Cloud PlatformNutanix provides an enterprise cloud platform which converges silos of servers and storage into an integrated solutions, as these solutions are able to connect to public cloud services.This solution offers both agility as well as meets all criteria with regards to mobility and security, among others. In essence companies get the best of both worlds. They never buy too much or too little capacity, which causes cost inefficiencies. Customers furthermore always have access to their data which is accessible from all devices.The software which Nutanix has developed includes two products, Acropolis and Prism. These products have resonated extremely well with customers. After being founded as recent as 2009, Nutanix has grown to a 3,700 customer base as of July.Nutanix points toward the fact that the transition is just starting across the industry. The market for traditional x86 servers and storage totals roughly $100 billion according to researchers IDC and Gartner. Cloud management and virtualization solutions represent just a $10 billion opportunity. Given the secular shifts, these markets are expected to grow rapidly and replace a lot of the traditional solutions.Priced For GrowthGiven the fact that Nutanix is young and small and the opportunities are large, it is of course priced as a true growth stock. The company sold 14 million shares for $16 apiece, raising $224 million in gross proceeds. The company will have 136 million shares outstanding following the offering, valuing the company at $2.2 billion. After shares have nearly doubled toward $30 per share, the market valuation actually surpasses $4 billion.The company will operate with a net cash position of some $300 million following the offering proceeds as all existing debt and preferred stock will be exchanged following the offering, valuing operating assets at close to $3.8 billion. Interesting enough, the company actually raised money in August 2014 at a $2 billion valuation as plans for an IPO toward the end of 2015 failed.The good news is that Nutanix has grown at a rapid rate and actually posts sizable revenues. Sales hit $444.9 million in fiscal year 2016, up 84.3% on an annual basis. While gross margins are decent in the low sixties, losses are large. Operating losses rose to $165 million in 2016, for margins of negative 37.1%. While actual losses increased in dollar terms, negative relative losses did come down from the -49.2% reported in 2015.Momentum in terms of growth is rock solid. Fourth quarter revenue growth actually accelerated towards 88.7%, with revenues increasing to $139.8 million. That comes in at $560 million on an annualized basis, for a 6.8 times sales multiples at $30 per share. Actual operating losses for the quarter expanded to $47.9 million, equivalent to 34.3% of sales.Final Thoughts, Growth And Big LossesThe market for enterprise infrastructure is moving fast and Nutanix appears to be well positioned. That said in fast changing markets it is hard to judge the competitive power of a company, although the sizable revenue base and spectacular growth numbers reveal that Nutanix has a very competitive position. That said, the company loses a lot of money, reporting losses at a rate of $200 million a year now. Fortunately, it holds a net cash position of $300 million following the offering.The company itself thinks that it competes with the likes of VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), among others. Traditional players might have an interest in the business as well as they struggle in this market and need to reinvent themselves in order to remain relevant in the future.Risks obviously include the losses, competition (including that of much larger business), and reliance on key staff, among others. The big positive in my eyes is the rapid growth as revenue growth is actually accelerating. While I surely liked the relative appealing sales multiple of 3 times as which shares were offered at $16 per share, the appeal is now gone. Operating assets are valued at close to 7 times annualized revenues at $30 per share, as shares nearly doubled on their opening day.At these levels, sales multiple are similar to that of Red Hat. While growth of Red Hat is much more modest, with sales growing by 20% per annum, it is actually profitable and posts GAAP operating margins of around 15% of sales. Given the rapid growth in terms of sales, it illustrates the potential for the company, yet margins have to improve as the market will demand profitability in the coming years.If the company can sustain current growth for a couple of quarters to come, revenues might come in at a run rate of a billion. If we can attach a 5 times sales multiple to such a revenue base, given that margins are still negative and are likely to remain so for some time, we could see a $5 billion valuation. That suggests fair valuation levels around $35 per share. Given that shares essentially doubled on their opening day to levels in the low thirties, the risk-reward is simply not appealing for me at these levels."

He joined the company in 2013. His previous experience comes from senior positions at IBM-XIV, DDN, ONStar, and Zambeel.CFO Duston Williams has served in his position since June 2014. His previous experience comes from senior financial positions at Gigamon Systems, SandForce, Infinera, Maxtor Corp., Aruba Networks, and Rhapsody Networks. Mr. Williams holds a B.S. in Accounting from Bentley College and an MBA from the University of Southern California.Financial Overview & Use of ProceedsNutanix provided the following figures from its financial documents for the year ended July 31:As of July 31, 2016:Total revenue in 2016 represents an 84% year-over-year increase and a 62% increase in gross margin percentage over the same time period. While still negative, total free cash flow has decreased from ($49,002,000) in FY2015 to ($38,658,000) in FY2016.Nutanix intends to use the net proceeds of this IPO for capital expenditures, general corporate purposes, working capital, research and development, and sales and marketing activities as noted above, and administrative matters. None are specified. The company also notes it may also use some of the proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary technologies, products, solutions or businesses.Potential Competition: VMware (NYSE:VMW), Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and OthersNutanix faces competition from a variety of companies that offer virtualization, infrastructure and management products including HPE (NYSE:HPE), Cisco Systems, Lenovo Group (OTCPK:LNVGY), Dell Technologies (DVMT), Hitachi Data Systems, IBM (NYSE:IBM), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP).As noted, NTNX is priced competitively.Conclusion: BuyNTNX has shown remarkable revenue growth, and high gross margins; at its current valuation, we recommend investing.Technology IPOs have done particularly well in 2016, and NTNX is likely to continue the trend.Noted risks do include lack of profitability, a quickly evolving market for cloud software, and dual class structure, which will give 98.9% of voting power to directors, executives, and pre-offering investors, after the IPO."
4007207,101421,2016-09-20T01:31:58-04:00,"Virtualization software company Nutanix wants to raise $174 million in its IPO.The company is valuing itself at $1.67 billion, a discount to its previous $2 billion private valuation.NTNX is an extremely high growth company, with high and growing gross margins too.Revenues grew at 84% YoY, to reach $445 million in FYE 2016.The $1.67B valuation is reasonable, and I reiterate my BUY recommendation for this technology high-flyer.","Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) is a datacenter virtualization software technology company ""unicorn"" that has set the expected range and valuation for its anticipated IPO.The company is offering a total of 14 million shares to the public and 2.1 million shares to underwriters at a midpoint price of $12 per share.Net proceeds to the company are expected to be $174 million assuming 16.1 million shares are sold, and the company market cap upon IPO would be $1.67 billion.No shareholders are selling shares in the proposed offering, so all the net proceeds will go to the company, which it says will be used for the standard boilerplate reasons of general corporate purposes, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions.Company RecapIn my original analysis of the company and its IPO prospects, Nutanix Is A Unicorn Getting Ready To Fly Its IPO, I was enthusiastic about Nutanix' future prospects.The company simplifies datacenter cloud operations for Global 2000 companies by integrating server and storage resources inside the datacenter via its virtualization products.This helps enterprises streamline their IT infrastructure operations, thereby reducing costs and increasing operational flexibility.Nutanix is growing topline revenues at a torrid pace, with some cooling in FYE 2016:FYE 2016: $445 million, 84% growth over priorFYE 2015: $241 million, 90% growth over priorFYE 2014: $127 millionGross margin is high and increasing, with FYE 2016 showing 62% vs. FYE 2015 58%.The company is spending heavily on Sales & Marketing and R&D, resulting in an FYE 2016 net loss of $169 million.NTNX had $99 million in cash as of July 31, 2016 (Unaudited).IPO ValuationIn my original analysis, I indicated that the company's most recent private market valuation was publicly reported as $2 billion, as of August 2014.I also stated that due to the company's rapid growth, high gross margin and high customer upsell rate of 80%, the IPO was worth considering, assuming valuation was ""within range of its most recent $2 billion valuation.""Below are two valuation calculations to test that assertion:Price/Sales Valuation MethodNutanix wants to effectively value itself at 3.7x trailing 12-month sales. By comparison, direct competitor VMware's (NYSE:VMW) Price/Sales multiple is 4.52.Considering VMW's revenue growth of 6% vs. Nutanix' 84%, this would imply that Nutanix is cheaply valued at its proposed IPO valuation.EV/Sales Valuation MethodVMware currently has an EV/Sales value of 3.51x.Nutanix' EV/Sales calculation results in a value of 3.7x, so essentially similar to that of VMware.Based on the two valuation approaches, the NTNX IPO valuation of $1.67 billion is reasonable, and I reiterate my buy recommendation for this ultra high-growth technology company IPO stock.Even though the IPO is at a ""down round valuation"" of $1.67 billion when compared to its most recent private financing valuation of $2 billion, and most likely contains extra shares for investors at the $2 billion valuation in the event of a lower IPO valuation, the post-IPO valuation is still compelling for new investors.Existing shareholders, some of whom acquired shares at the $2 billion valuation mark in August 2014, are holding on to their shares on the expectation that its public market valuation will increase significantly.That is my expectation as well. I'm bullish on the IPO for NTNX."
4007874,101924,2016-09-22T11:55:49-04:00,"Nutanix, a software “unicorn” which uses hyper-converged technology, is moving towards an IPO after delaying for about nine months.The company boasts strong revenue and customer growth and has made acquisitions to boost its technological prowess.Nutanix has never been profitable, does not anticipate being profitable soon, and is in a market which sees heavy competition from rivals from such as Hewlett-Packard.In a market which is starved for tech IPOs, Nutanix’s strong growth makes it a prime target which any investor should get as soon as possible.","This year has been dismal for technology IPOs, but a healthy stock market has meant that investors are waiting to see those IPOs return. And after nine months of waiting, Silicon Valley startup Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) announced new share prices for its upcoming IPO.Nutanix filed an amendment to its SEC filing which will see its shares priced from $11 to $13. While this is a price drop compared to earlier expectations, the company could still raise up to $209.3 million with a midrange price of $168 million. Nutanix had first filed for an IPO back in December 2015, but has put it on hold as it waited for better market conditions.It appears those market conditions have arrived, and there is a lot to like about Nutanix. Just like Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), the one tech IPO earlier this year which has been a major success, Nutanix is a company which has seen high growth both in revenue and total customers.It has developed valuable partnerships with other tech companies around the world. This includes BEArena in Australia, whose managing director, Darren Ashley, believes Nutanix offers a platform for development for the future, much like Apple did with the iPhone.While Nutanix's lack of profitability and its decision to drop the share price may scare some cautious investors away, investors should instead view it as an opportunity to get a great company for a lower price.A burgeoning, competitive marketNutanix states in its IPO that ""we provide a leading next-generation enterprise cloud platform that converges traditional silos of server, virtualization and storage into one integrated solution and can also connect to public cloud services.""To translate that, Nutanix uses storage technology, often called hyperconverged systems, which lets major companies run servers more easily and cheaper, eliminating waste. It does use a revolutionary approach of combining storage and computer servers and boasts clients such as Best Buy, Toyota, and the Department of Defense.Since being founded in 2009, Nutanix has seen massive revenue growth thanks to a successful marketing approach. Nutanix's Fiscal Year Ended July 31 revenue ballooned from $6.6 million in 2012 to over $440 million in 2016. Even that 2016 figure represents a massive boost compared to a 2015 revenue of $241 million.But while Nutanix can see huge improvement with its own technology, it is also making further moves to expand its technological horizons. In August, Nutanix acquired both PernixData and software company Calm.io.Lack of profitability an issue?Nutanix has seen rising revenue and is working in a market for which there is high demand. But rising revenue has not translated to profits, and Nutanix's losses are mounting.The company may have earned over $350 million last year, but it had a net loss of $168.5 million in 2016 compared to losing $126 million in 2015. Nutanix has never been profitable in its history, and the company admits in its SEC filing that ""we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.""But such losses are hardly unusual for tech IPOs, and the way Nutanix is losing money is enlightening. Nutanix's expenses come from sales and marketing, which saw the company spend $288.5 million in 2016.Nutanix could pull back on its marketing expenses if it was absolutely determined to make a profit, but there is no reason to do so given how successful the company has been in expanding its user base. And while the company has been losing money, it has little debt thanks to rounds of private funding. Nutanix is best served by aggressively pursuing more customers.Another major challenge which this company does face is that the field of hyperconvergence systems is highly competitive. Hewlett-Packard has released their own systems which purport to be cheaper and more efficient than anything Nutanix can do, and there are further competitors like Dell and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Nutanix is still a startup competing with those larger firms, though its resilience in keeping customers and revenue high indicates that it will be able to hold firm.Buy as soon as you canThe market has been starved from a good tech IPO for some time, and so some investors might be wondering if Nutanix seeks to take advantage of this by filing and watching hungry investors jump on despite its lack of profitability.But Nutanix is a solid investment. It has continued to grow even in the face of stiff competition and represents a field of technology which has attracted the interest of major corporations across the globe. And its lower share price only means that those who jump on first will be able to get the stock for a lower price when it rises.Nutanix is absolutely a buy, especially at this reasonable price share and valuation."
4056551,98236,2017-03-20T12:47:34-04:00,"Earlier this month, Nutanix reported the results of its fiscal Q2.The results were somewhat in line although bookings were soft. The guidance did the shares in and led to a 32% decline in share price valuation.The company has forecast a noticeable decline in sales force productivity in North America due to internal issues.Some observers think the issue isn't execution but competition.In addition, the company is facing short-term margin pressure from component price spikes of NAND and DRAM.","Nutanix - How long is the road to profitability?Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) has been one of the worst performing names so far in 2017, and as I write this, it is down almost 23% year to date. It is less than six months since the company went public and appreciated 130% on its first day of trading at the end of September 2016. Shortly thereafter, it made a high at $44/share, and for the most part, it has been tracking lower since that time. The company reported earnings at the start of this month, and the shares have fallen to the current trading range losing about one-third of their value in that time and more than 50% of their value since the high that was made back on October 3rd. The concern was guidance, which showed rapidly slowing sequential growth and a deterioration in margins. It is the second time that the shares have reacted negatively to an earnings release since the company had its public debut.Should investors look at this as an entry point, or a name from which to stay far away? I think the valuation has reached a level that presents a reasonable entry point into the name and I think that competitive concerns, while hardly inconsequential, are more than discounted at current share price levels.Nutanix, for those unfamiliar with the company, is a leader in what is called the hyper-converged space. Hyper-converged is a technology that has been developed over a bit more than the past decade that uses software to integrate compute, storage, networking and virtualization resources in a single box built around commodity hardware. That is, no doubt, a gross oversimplification for some. But the fact that multiple functions have been seamlessly integrated in a single box using commodity hardware is seen by some as revolutionary. It has dramatic impacts on the total cost of a data center and turning some of the economics of IT hardware on its head.Currently, many observers and competitors of Nutanix suggest that hyper-converged infrastructure has been optimized for small data centers such as those run in the branches of large enterprises. While that may sound like a quibble, it isn't really. Nutanix is close to a $1 billion annual run rate in terms of revenues today. It is not likely to achieve continued hyper-growth status if it is unable to sell its solutions to large businesses for mission critical applications.NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), in its most recent call, talked about building enterprise class hyper-converged products as though that was a virgin market. It is not an easy argument to decide, but it appears that Nutanix, even in a difficult quarter, has been able to penetrate a fair number of new Global 2000 nameplates and to do so by providing infrastructure with which to run mission-critical workloads.For the most part, users buy hyper-converged infrastructure because of its advantages in terms of cost, reliability and the automation of a data center. It is also considered to be very ""agile"" in that it is designed to share resources so it can provide extra compute capacity to an organization both inexpensively and quickly. Most hyper-compute solutions have built-in security features, and the solutions are quite scalable with additions to capacity based on adding building blocks so that users buy what they need and do not need to buy capacity ahead.Is Nutanix relevant?There are two observations to make. Nutanix was, has been and remains a pioneer in the space, and any space that offers users so many advantages is likely to become very crowded very rapidly. The market for hyper-converged infrastructure is said to have a CAGR of 44% by one market research firm with revenues expected to balloon to $12.6 billion. Given that the overall markets for both servers and storage are growing minimally at best (at least in dollar terms), it not surprising to see every storage vendor and hardware vendor that is still above ground ""converging"" on this market.The other thing to note is that what are called hyper-converged integrated systems are becoming mainstream and this will have the propensity to increase growth rates beyond what have been forecast. The Gartner note linked in the text talks about the evolution of use cases which have been quite specialized up till now but should become far more pervasive in the future.For Nutanix, the major competitive struggles at this point appear to be with VMware (NYSE:VMW). Needless to say, conference calls are probably not the best cases to get objective judgments about the state of competition between the two vendors. For those who want a more in-depth analysis than I can provide, I recommend the following article linked above. It is fair to say, I think, that from the standpoint of technology, it would appear that Nutanix has the better part of the argument. But this is information technology and in that regard, it is not all that different from selling things like high-fashion sneakers - perception and style often count for more than technology. It is why it is rational for investors to be at least as concerned about sales execution as they are with whose solution can offer users the most effective solutions. I will simply say that by all appearances, the Nutanix Acropolis Hypervisor (AHV) despite its rather awkward name, appears to offer users more of what they want in a datacenter solution.It is probably reasonable to expect that the Dell/Nutanix partnership will deteriorate over time. It is hard to be allied and partner with the parent of your greatest competitor indefinitely. But that has happened yet and it doesn't appear to be the reason behind the current sales setback.And one can certainly wonder about just how far the partnership that Nutanix has with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) can really evolve. There are going to be forks in the road at some point. But saying that does not imply that the forks to be seen are necessarily negative for Nutanix shareholders. It is at least as conceivable that Cisco, or another larger hardware vendor, winds up buying Nutanix as it is for Cisco to decide to compete all out in trying to displace Nutanix. The link above suggests that Cisco has tried to buy Nutanix twice; perhaps the third time will be the charm. I think it is hard to say, in the wake of Cisco purchase of AppDynamics, that almost any kind of acquisition is off-limits and this kind of transaction would surely make better strategic and financial sense than the transaction with AppDynamics has made.Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has approached the hyper-converged market with its Exa line of appliances that are optimized for various workloads. For Oracle, the strategy has not been successful, and it has been a perpetual share donor to Nutanix and to other hyper-converged vendors, in general.So, Nutanix is having to compete for market share against organizations such as NetApp, Dell, HPE (NYSE:HPE) and Cisco that are multiples larger and have much to lose. The competition is likely to be messy and cut-throat. Further, as discussed below, some of the competitors, most noticeably Dell, are Nutanix customers.In the last few months, there have been many announcements of products and consolidation in the space. Most notably, HPE has purchased SimpliVity, NetApp has promised an enterprise class system using the technology it acquired when it bought SolidFire, and AWS and VMware have announced a joint solution that may appeal to some users. At this point, Cisco is said to be unhappy with the performance of its HyperFlex product in the marketplace, which is often a precursor to some kind of strategic action. IBM (NYSE:IBM) is not involved in the space at this time. A take on the market and competition is linked to here from an industry trade publication, called The Register. As can be seen, it appears that Nutanix remains very relevant in this hyper-growth market despite all of the announcements.At the end of the day, I would rather let management speak for itself in terms of how it looks at the market and let the reader decide whether or not the exposition rings true. Here are excerpts from the CEO answering the specific question on which hangs the question of Nutanix's future as a company and an investment:If the CEO has made a persuasive argument on that issue, then the time to buy the shares depends on valuation and expectations. And for those who are unpersuaded, there is no reason to consider any other strategy but when to short them, they are still overvalued.Unreasonable expectations of unreasonable performanceNutanix was one of the pioneers in the hyper-converged space and started to be a factor in the marketplace at the start of this decade. Revenues have gone from zero to a current run rate of $700 million in less than five years. Profits…well, that is another story explored later in this article. The story across all typical sales metrics was fantastic…until last quarter. The company went public in late September and was one of the hottest IPOs of last year. The IPO was priced at $16 and before too long, the shares reached almost $47 intraday. At that price, the company had an enterprise value of more than $6.3 billion, which was more than 8.5X revenues. Obviously, investors had forgotten that Nutanix is a storage vendor and most storage vendors have EV/S of 2X or less.The company is a very long way from profitability. Last quarter, despite the issues the company had with bookings and revenues, was the first to show a modicum of expense discipline, at least on a non-GAAP sequential basis, which is about the only way these companies can be analyzed.The company's first public quarter which was announced the end of November of 2016 essentially achieved the results that had been expected and exceeded the levels that had been publicly forecast. Revenues increased 90%, 19% sequentially. Billings grew 87% and deferred revenues grew 160% year on year. The company generated a little bit of operating cash and had a slightly negative free cash flow. That said, the shares, after appreciating before the numbers were released, declined substantially because anticipation was greater than realization. But overall, the quarter didn't result in any dramatic negative share price reaction other than seeing a modest trend toward less outrageous valuation metrics.The company forecast that revenues would grow 5% sequentially in Q2, which was considered a sandbag at the time. On the other hand, the forecast was an increase over the prior First Call consensus. Part of the reason for the modest forecast was the strength the company had seen in sales to the federal government. Federal business had dramatically seasonally based expansion during the closing of the government's fiscal year and it was expected to decline meaningfully sequentially. That did indeed happen, and just that way. The company enjoyed a strong quarter in its sales to Dell despite the EMC merger, an area of concern to most observers given that one of the key strategies of VMware. Now majority-owned by Dell, VMW is offering its own suite of virtualized hyper-converged solutions.The company has also been developing an OEM relationship with Dell rival Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), but that is far smaller in terms of revenue contribution at this point. The company didn't explicitly forecast bookings for the subsequent quarter but suggested that the relationship between bookings and revenues would gradually drift down to about 1.25X from 1.4X.For the most part, in terms of operational performance, Q2 lived up to management's forecasts or was perhaps a bit better. Non-GAAP earnings were over the consensus and revenue beat modestly. GAAP gross margins rose a bit above the company's target range and reached 63%. That is a little bit surprising as many other vendors who use the NAND and DRAM had visible margin contraction during the quarter.But GAAP operating expenses almost doubled year on year. That said, however, GAAP operating expenses did decline 16% sequentially, most of that being in the general and administrative category, which fell to a very reasonable 8.5% of revenues.Billings came in at 125% of reported revenues, which is consistent with the kind of ratio trend forecast by the company. Billings fell by 5% sequentially, mainly reflecting a lower contribution from the company's Federal operations. It was this fall in sequential billings that was one of the precipitating factors in the share price debacle. Management ascribes the billings shortfall to a sales execution issue in North America. Clearly, there are alternative explanations that have more serious long-term implications.The company sold 900 new name accounts, up from 700 in Q1. That is a good leading indicator of future business because of the company's land/expand model. Very few users jump into a hyper-converged architecture without some period of experimentation and operational proof of concept. Once they do, they can buy lots of hardware.During the course of the call, the company talked about its efforts to develop solutions that would allow it to fully participate in industry trends toward public cloud usage. Nutanix isn't there yet and some observers have opined that it will never be there and that its future growth will be cut off by the cloud. It is an issue to be watched no doubt, and as mentioned above, the alliance of VMW and AWS is something that concerns this management but it hasn't yet started to change the competitive playing field.Besides the bookings shortfall, described above, the real issue that drove the shares was guidance, which, for a company such as this, was quite unexpected and created serious problems for shareholders.Overall, the company is now forecasting total revenues of $180-190 million in revenues. At the mid-point, that would represent sequential growth of less than 2%, although revenues would still be up by 60% year on year. There is a bit of negative seasonality in Q3 - it was visible a year ago, and two years ago, but the forecast is clearly below previously expected revenues levels.As mentioned above, the company, like all other vendors who sell storage, is having to deal with higher DRAM prices which have spiked sharply in the last several months. While the company raised product list prices in an attempt to offset some of the increase in component costs, it has lowered its gross margin forecast by several hundred basis points.And, as the result of lower revenue expectations, coupled with continued growth in operating expenses, operating cost ratios are going to noticeably increase compared to levels previously expected.High stock price, missed bookings, a cloudy outlook for current quarter financial performance, the result was the 32% share price pullback seen in a couple of days in early March.Some questions, some projections and some expectationsWhen a company like this misses and guides down and the share price implodes, many times, the knee-jerk reaction is to abandon the shares. I can't say I have never done that myself in my career as an analyst or as an investor. Even if one thinks the case hasn't changed, it is easier, often, to ""go with the flow"" and throw in the towel. Should that be the way to approach this name? I really do not think that to be the case.One of the covering analysts, who had rated the shares as a hold when they were above $40, doesn't like them now that they are $20. There is more than a bit of chutzpah in that, given that her firm was one of the underwriters of the IPO, although this particular analyst has been ladling out that kind of fare for many years now. The other 17 analysts who report their ratings to First Call left their recommendations alone, and overall the line-up is evenly divided between buy and hold, but with an average price target 50% greater than current quotations.The company suggested that much of its sales problem was self-inflicted. Again, pretty typically, it has promoted many of its top performing individual contributors to sales managers and has created multiple new territories. It is the standard playbook for companies like this. Sometimes, however, taking a great individual performer and moving him/her from the field to a management position has the impact of creating a hold in sales coverage. Whether that sorts itself out in six months as the company forecasts, or it takes longer as other observers feel is the case, is not something that can be proven at this point. On its side of the argument, management pointed to the company's strong performance in both EMEA and in APJ where it had not pulled individual contributors into sales management roles.As mentioned earlier, the company, like all of its peers in the storage world, is being temporarily pressured by a component cost squeeze. I think that an investment decision beyond that of how to trade this name based on the cost of DRAMs is foolish. This company, as mentioned earlier, has raised list prices. Whether or not that will actually work is difficult to say. But, in a quarter or two, the DRAM/NAND shortage will reverse. It would be less than optimal to try to trade the shares of this company, or any other company such as NetApp or HPE, based on short-term cycles in component costs.Finally, the company is likely to announce the early adoption of the new FASB 606 rule on revenue recognition earlier than planned. I do not think this is a good place for a lengthy and specific discussion of how 606 is going to impact this company. But the net is, according to the CFO, that gross margins will be several hundred basis points higher in the wake of the immediate adoption of the new rule. Looking out 6-12 months, it is quite conceivable that gross margins will increase by about 500-600 bps from the levels forecast next quarter and that operating expenses, particularly those in sales and marketing, could also show a noticeable improvement even larger than that of gross margins.At this point, the current estimates for the quarter that ends 4/30 reflect management guidance both with respect to revenues and earnings and both of those estimates have been developed using the most conservative assumptions. Beyond the current quarter, estimates were noticeably reduced for the following quarter and indeed for the following year. It is those reductions that potentially set the stage for a succession of significant beat and raise quarters. I do not think that potential is valued in the shares at the current time.ValuationValuing disruptive companies that have stumbled is never going to be an exact science. I have tried to lay out the case that what we are seeing here is a stumble and not a seminal detour - but there will be plenty of readers who think I have happy ears or that the impact of so many competitors is simply a risk they do not wish to deal with. Understood.I have written on this company a few months ago, and at that time tried to provide some market potentials. This company talks about a potential $100 billion TAM in a few years. Most market research analysts, at least in their published reports, are a bit more conservative, but as hyper-converged becomes mainstream, the ultimate market size can be enormous.I will just stick with a few traditional valuation metrics at this point. Over the next year, the company is forecast to reach revenues of $900 million. That seems quite low given the current quarterly progression but it makes sense to use the consensus I think. The company, at the current time, has 142 million shares outstanding, and Friday's closing price was $20.40 the market capitalization of around $2.8 billion. The company currently has a cash balance of a bit greater than $350 million, which puts the enterprise value at $2.45 billion. That yields an EV/S of 2.7X, no longer an outlier for a very fast growing company in its space. As many readers are aware, Nimble Storage (NYSE:NMBL) has recently announced an agreement to be acquired by HPE for $1.2 billion, which was a valuation of 2.5X enterprise value. Nimble had a growth rate of about half that of Nutanix and perhaps a far more difficult market space in which to compete.As mentioned, Nutanix has no earnings and none are likely for the next couple of years. It is modestly cash flow positive, but no one is or should be buying the shares for cash flow generation. Substantially, more than all of its CFFO is coming from stock-based comp and that is not likely to change in the near future. The company is building deferred revenues because of its software sales, although that has been offset to a degree by the amortization of deferred commissions. Last quarter, the company had a significant benefit from the change in the fair value of its convertible preferred stock warrant liability and while that may continue this quarter, it is not a perpetual source of funds.Despite the improvement in some of the expense ratios last quarter, management has forecast that there will be some noticeable backsliding in the sales and marketing expense ratio in the current quarter and probably beyond. The valuation for this company is a function of revenue growth and the revenue growth is a function of the company's competitive positioning in a hot space.I certainly can't prove my expectations with regard to growth and the company's guidance is such that it has given itself a quarter or two in which to recover its ability to achieve sales execution. There are some who suggest that it is prudent to avoid the name until there is a palpable sign that it has overcome competitive headwinds. Other writers on this site have urged avoidance of the shares because of the lock-up expiration.For my part, I think the possible acquisition of this company at a substantial premium simply can't be ignored and is likely to put a floor under the shares. Cisco needs what it has and probably realizes it. IBM ought to want what it has. And frankly, Oracle ought to abandon what seems a quixotic quest with regards to its Exa line of appliances in favor of trying to acquire this business. Of course, I haven't any idea that anything will happen in that regard for Nutanix - but it certainly seems to suggest that it is not unreasonable to enter the name at this point with the current valuation expecting to see positive alpha going forward."
4008796,66213,2016-09-27T16:41:08-04:00,"Nutanix has filed for an IPO to raise up to $209 million.The much anticipated offering could take place within the next few days.Although the company has posted strong growth, the IPO may reduce Nutanix's valuation from its last round of funding.","Nutanix (Pending:NTNX), the cloud-based storage technology software unicorn, has been awaiting an IPO which may only be a few trading days away. Seeking to raise up to $209 million in proceeds, this young company is offering growth investors a big risk/big reward opportunity. Some highlights pertaining to this investment:It Can Be Awhile Before We See ProfitabilityWhile huge losses may scare off many risk-averse investors, it is not necessarily as bad as it seems. For fiscal year 2016, Nutanix took a net loss of $168 million on total revenue of $445 million. Obviously, that is not a welcoming loss. However the net loss margin has declined over the years. Looking at its income statement, you will see that it actually has a fairly strong gross margin of 62% for 2016. However, the operating loss comes in from the sales and marketing expenses, which are more than $288 million. That accounts for more than its entire gross profit. Research and development also came in over $116 million, but still doesn't touch the sales costs. I would expect this trend to continue for a while as Nutanix hasn't made any real push to reduce its sales and R&D costs as a percentage of revenue.Source: Nutanix's S-1The Balance Sheet Is Upside DownThis is a big reason why risk-averse investors won't be looking at this IPO. With $399 million in total assets and $455 million in total liabilities, there is a stockholders' deficit of $56 million. As it stands, it has over $99 million in cash, which represents a fairly solid cash ratio of almost 0.5. However, at the pace it burns through cash, that won't last it very long. Fortunately, the IPO proceeds should help provide some strong liquidity for the company when it burns through its current cash. Nevertheless, the company mentions nothing about using the IPO proceeds to pay off any debt or strengthen its book value, so I would expect a weak balance sheet until it starts turning positive cash flow.Source: Nutanix's S-1It's A Pure Growth PlayJust like many software unicorns before it, Nutanix is purely a growth play. While that means huge volatility, negative margins and an upside balance sheet, at least it has posted incredible growth numbers. Revenue has increased from $6.6 million in 2012 to $445 million in 2016. Its three-year CAGR is almost 52%. Unlike some other young companies that hit the market and promise future growth, at least Nutanix has the history to back its up.The Valuation Is What You Make Of ItAt $13 per share, Nutanix would be valued at $1.8 billion. To a growth investor in the software space that is only 4 times sales - which is a pretty good number given its current growth rate. But a value investor would see this as a game of roulette. It's an industry with heavy hitters, the company holds a negative book value, and future cash flow isn't all that clear yet. So there are a few different ways to look at this valuation depending on what you are looking at.ConclusionThe Nutanix IPO will be an interesting one. To me, it still seems a bit odd that this company is going public right now. It just feels too early. And considering the company fetched a valuation of more than $2 billion two years ago in Series E funding, it could be a red flag to some investors. There are two very different ways of looking at this IPO and coming to a definitive investment conclusion won't be easy for anyone."
3964565,61281,2016-04-11T22:23:12-04:00,"Converged data center solutions vendor Nutanix prepares to go public soon.As the computing needs increase and are expected to continue rising, cost-saving data center solutions attract a lot of attention.The company offers a unique converged solution that allows its clients to save up to 30.6% of their IT expenses.With a 91% YoY revenue growth, 60% gross margin, narrowing losses, and no debt, Nutanix is an attractive investment.","Four months after it initially filed for IPO, the data center infrastructure vendor Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) updated its S-1 with the SEC and re-ignited its IPO plans. Like many other startups considering an IPO, Nutanix decided to halt its IPO plans amidst the increased stock market volatility and wait for a better timing that would allow it to maximize returns and offer an optimized exit opportunity for shareholders. This strategy drove the IPO market in Q1 2016 to its lowest level since 2009 with only 8 IPOs when none of them were a technology company. For growth startups that raised money in high valuations under the assumption that investors could materialize their investments later, the quiet IPO market increased investors' illiquidity risk (the risk to hold illiquid stocks of a private company that could not be sold) and pressure companies to come up with alternatives. Furthermore, startups need to raise increasing amounts of money to finance their activity, and startups that maxed out any private market alternative will face a real operating problem.Some companies like Spotify (MUSIC) can raise debt with a clear path to IPO to satisfy both the operational needs and the investors' needs. Other companies like Nutanix prefer to go public and take the risk that the timing might be difficult but probably better than the alternatives. Nutanix raised so far more than $300M in five funding rounds since April 2011 and reached an incredible valuation of $2B in its latest series E as shown in the chart below.Nutanix raised funds from an extensive list of leading VCs like Riverwood, Sapphire, Khosla, and more that identified the growth opportunity in this small data center vendor. With the incredible rise in mobile devices and the need for cloud computing, data center infrastructure has become a very important component of the emerging industries like data analytics, APM, IoT, cyber security, and much more. The exponential growth opportunity attracts many investors to this niche of technology, and when a small San Jose-based startup is competing fearlessly and successfully with giants like EMC (EMC), Dell, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), VMWare (NYSE:VMW), and others, it catches the eye of institutional investors.Nutanix provides a converged data center solution that includes computing, storage, and virtualization that allows enterprises to save on data center machines, reduce their IT spending, and save space and power. Nutanix operates in a highly competitive market where customers look for a mix of price, cost-saving potential, and performance, and when IDC reports that customers can deploy Nutanix technology in up to 85% less time than traditional infrastructure and that it can reduce the time required for infrastructure management by up to 71%, it is an attractive alternative to the data center giants. According to IDC, using a Nutanix solution can bring a 30.6% cost saving in IT infrastructure spending as shown in the chart below.Nutanix translates its converged computing solution into sales and generates an increasing amount of revenue each quarter at an amazing pace of 21% quarter over quarter and 91% year over year as shown in the chart below.Nutanix increases its revenue at an impressive pace that we often see from multi-billion dollars' worth of tech unicorns; however, unlike many unicorns, the company continuously improves its margins while narrowing its GAAP net and operating profit as shown in the chart below.Comparing Nutanix to its peers, it has slightly higher multiples that might be above the market average; however, they are extremely below the common multiples we often see in unicorns or other growth tech companies. Nutanix' higher multiples reflect the fact that it is the smallest and youngest company of the pack, and it incorporates the largest growth potential of its peers along with larger risk accompanied with investing in Nutanix (under a $2B valuation) versus investing in EMC or NetApp.I believe that Nutanix IPO offers an attractive entry point into a rapidly growing industry and a piece of a company that presents attractive multiples, narrowing losses, growing gross margin, and impressive top-line revenue growth. Looking for the long haul, Nutanix offers an optimized solution that fits its customers' requirements and translates into sales. With a 91% YoY top-line revenue growth, 60% gross margin, and a 6.5 P/S ratio, Nutanix stands out from most unicorns and represent an attractive investment opportunity. Once the company prices the IPO, I will revisit my thesis."

Pandey was previously from Aster Data and before that Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), where he managed development of the storage engine for the Oracle Database and Exadata products.(Source: Nutanix YouTube)Nutanix' business model assumption is that data centers of the future will run on commoditized x86 blades and that the differentiating factors in capabilities will be in the virtualized software-defined platforms that will span public, private and hybrid cloud environments. This ""software-defined, commodity hardware"" approach was popularized by cloud behemoth Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL).TechnologyNutanix has two primary product families: Prism and Acropolis.The company's solutions can be delivered either as software only or as an on-premise appliance that is configured to the customer's specifications.Nutanix stated in its recent S-1/A filing that it had 3,100 ""end-customers as of April 30, 2016, including approximately 285 Global 2000 enterprises.""CompetitionNutanix operates in what Gartner calls the ""integrated systems"" segment of the IT infrastructure market.

This slowing growth rate is not uncommon for enterprise software companies such as Nutanix, but is nevertheless something to watch.Gross margin was 62% in the most recent nine-month period vs. 58% during the same period in 2015, representing a meaningful improvement.Nutanix had $192 million in cash on hand as of April 30, 2016.The company's most recent private market valuation was reported as $2 billion, as of its most recent funding round of $140 million in August, 2014.(Source: WSJ Online)IPO OpinionAssuming moderate market volatility, Nutanix will likely IPO soon and perform well. Reports are that the buy side of the market is hungry for new issues, especially after the recent market doldrums of the Brexit event and the approaching end of summer.Although the IPO market has been largely devoid of non-life science offerings, recent IPOs of software companies such as Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and Line (Pending:LN) have performed well, whether accompanied by an opening day rise by Twilio, or an initial drop and subsequent rise in Line's case.Both of those IPOs were for companies with large revenue run rates and very strong revenue growth comparables, both important features that Nutanix shares.The company also cites an 80% upsell rate for its customers of 18 months or more, which indicates tremendous customer satisfaction and loyalty.I'm quite bullish on Nutanix as an IPO candidate, since it has a strong financial position, excellent growth and loyalty rates and improving gross margins even as it continues to invest in its sales and marketing efforts for further market share growth.From here, Nutanix is a sales and marketing play in the medium term, offering its integrated cloud management solutions for the middle market enterprise, a market with strong future growth rates."

The company was expecting to go public earlier this year. But given the weak market conditions, it has still not listed. Many in the technology sector are waiting for it to go public to determine what the IPO markets really look like.Nutanix's FinancialsIn an updated S1 filing, Nutanix saw revenues grow 82% over the year to $305.1 million for the nine-month period ended April 2016. For the same period, net losses increased from $88.9 million to $118.6 million. For reference, Nutanix had earlier reported fiscal 2015 revenues at $241.4 million with a net loss of $126.1 million.

Earlier this week, it announced the acquisition of San Jose-based PernixData for an undisclosed sum. PernixData makes software that aggregates all the flash-based storage that comes with servers into one sharable pool, thus offering organizations the ability to free up speedy storage for use by any server on the network. The acquisition will help Nutanix offer improved performance by leveraging PernixData's flash caching and optimization technologies. The merged entity will be able to focus on reducing the inertia of application data that inhibits workload mobility across virtual and cloud environments and deliver the flexibility to run any application in any environment, without business-critical data being held hostage to a legacy infrastructure.It also announced the acquisition of India-based Calm.io, a development and automation startup. Calm.io offers software that automates software deployment for software that can be run both on company-owned infrastructure or on outside public cloud infrastructure. The terms of the deal were not disclosed. The acquisition will help Nutanix address the demand for hybrid cloud systems where organizations are looking to run sensitive applications within their firewalls and others on public cloud services. Together, the two companies will bring an application-first approach to choosing, managing and consuming IT infrastructure so that customers will be able to pick the right cloud for each application. Nutanix also plans to add cloud automation and management capabilities to its existing software stack to deliver application and service orchestration, runtime lifecycle management, policy-based governance, comprehensive reporting and auditing services to support all application environments, including virtual machines, containers and microservices.The data storage industry hasn't seen a very strong IPO performance in the past year. Other similar players like Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG), which went public in October last year, saw its shares peak within a few weeks of listing before trailing to nearly 40% of its value currently. Similarly Nimble Storage (NYSE:NMBL) has seen its value fall by 55% since its April 2014 high. Nutanix appears to be waiting for better market conditions before listing."

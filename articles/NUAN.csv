4361131,105783,2020-07-27T16:34:49-04:00,"NUAN's migration to a SaaS business model will cause short-term disruptions but long-term growth.The roll-out of Wi-Fi 6 and investment into healthcare act as strong long-term tailwinds to Nuance Communications.An opportunity to buy at a discount may occur within two years when growth estimates disappoint.Three DCF models are conducted to produce a range of outlooks for the share price of the company (bear case: 48% downside, base case: 2% downside, and bull case: 45% upside).","I am currently neutral on Nuance Communications (NUAN) as they migrate to a cloud-based SaaS (Software as a Service) business model. The market is assuming a flawless transition which is unlikely, however, future opportunities may occur if the stock price falters.Nuance Communications design conversational artificial intelligence applications to increase productivity for their customers. Conversational AI uses speech to interact with a device, the most common examples being Alexa and Siri. They produce conversational AI services for companies in healthcare, financial services, telecommunications, government and retail.In 2019 their Automotive business, which designs on-board virtual assistants, was hived off. Nuance also sold their Imaging (approx. $400m) and Mobile Operator Services Divisions. Companies like Amazon, Google, Tesla and Microsoft were aggressive competition in these sectors. It made sense for Nuance Communications to focus on its wide-moat core businesses, Enterprise and Healthcare.The Enterprise division provides Interactive Voice Response systems and Virtual Assistants. They have a diverse customer base including Coca-Cola, IBM, and a lot of major banks. Going forward I expect the Enterprise division to make up a third of total revenues (2019 revenue = $510.8 million).The Healthcare division has been a ""cash cow"" for many years (2019 revenue = $950.6 million). Before streamlining the company, it consistently made up 50%+ of revenues. Going forward it will generate about two-thirds of total revenues. Customers include ""Cleveland Clinic, Johns Hopkins, Partners Healthcare, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (""VUMC""), and National Health Services (""NHS"")."" (2019 Annual Report) The largest subsection is Clinical Documentation (>50%). Its products are the Dragon Medical Cloud, the Dragon Medical License and Transcription Services. Transcription services are a labour intensive, low margin business and therefore replacing the tasks with AI solutions is desirable. The Dragon Medical Cloud evolved from the Dragon Medical License business and is Nuance Communications flagship SaaS product.The new (2018) CEO Mark Benjamin orchestrated the division spin-off and sales, however, he was appointed for his SaaS business experience. His previous position was as COO and President at NCR services. NCR's business model includes a large subscription-based cloud services segment. He was previously with ADP; they supplied data analytics within the cloud for HR departments on a subscription basis.Software as a Service model has become increasingly popular. Google (GOOG), Adobe (ADBE), Slack (WORK), Shopify (SHOP), Microsoft (MSFT) and MathWorks have all successfully implemented this model. Essentially the application is hosted within the cloud and is paid for via repeated subscription. It offers many advantages over the OPS (On-Premises Software) model. I have divided these into ""Financial"" and ""Quality of Service(QoS)"" advantages.""Financial"" improvements are in the gross margin and the increased free cash flow. The gross margin of the transcription service is in the mid-30% range. If this is replaced by the SaaS model, then the gross margin could reach as high as 80%. Assuming that service/customer churn is low (high retention), then free cash flows should improve as the reliability of income increases using this model. Upselling and maintaining the service for current customers is as important as finding new customers, as this generates long term reliable and predictable revenue.The key ""QoS"" improvements are the increased level of customization, the lower barrier to entry, the product lifetime and the overall scalability. Clients may customize the service to suit their changing needs, an example could be increasing the language sets available. The barrier to entry is lower as fixed costs are lower therefore, smaller orders are more viable. SaaS model customers are regularly updated to the latest software release, this increases the lifetime of the service for the customer (instead of a license becoming obsolete and having to buy another). Built-in, and simple, scalability is a major selling factor as it allows for increased subscriber revenues.Many international organizations have access to Microsoft Azure data centers, therefore may access Nuance's cloud-based offerings. This increases the addressable market as international companies can easily access Nuance's product. Nuance Communications has a high level of penetration into the US market. The European and Asian markets are still largely untapped. The cloud gives great access to these markets.Healthcare services require a high level of service reliability. For example, Adobe may have a short period of downtime for the software that graphic designers use, such downtime is unacceptable in a healthcare setting. This limiting factor has prevented further penetration into the market. The roll-out of Wi-Fi 6 technology will likely change this dynamic and will offer a strong tailwind to the SaaS model.GAAP rules can make the transfer between the two systems difficult. GAAP has general rules for SaaS whereas OPS is industry-specific. This may lead to a myriad of unforeseen changes from contract revisions to issues with deferred revenue. Primarily because revenue is often delayed until the go-live date. This means that ""cash accepted"" cannot be logged as revenue leading to accountancy challenges.The advent of Wi-Fi-6 is advantageous to the SaaS model because healthcare environments are frequently saturated by electronic interference - caused by a proliferation of Wi-Fi enabled devices. Electronic interference diminishes the reliability, the data transfer speeds and the number of devices that can be supported. A solution is to increase access points, yet all this does is further increase the level of electronic interference. Wi-Fi 6 is perfectly suited to implementing a reliable, high-data cloud service into a noisy, device dense environment. I believe as the capabilities of Wi-Fi 6 become apparent, cloud-based services will be the largest beneficiaries.There are many long-term healthcare sector growth drivers. Such as aging populations, more people with long-term conditions and the introduction of more technology that enhances care. Recently, COVID-19 has highlighted how unprepared we are for pandemics and a medical crisis. Nuance Communications is focused on an industry which some claim will grow at a CAGR of 44.9%.In many developed countries, there is a lack of trained medical professionals due to workforce retirement, burnout, increased demand and lack of new trainees. To help compensate for this, physicians time must be optimized. By minimizing the time physicians spend completing paperwork, the number of patients treated and the treatment they receive is improved. Nuance Communications offers a service that requires a low initial investment, instant implementation and a significant productivity boost.Many developing countries also lack trained professionals and so Nuance Communications may find a market there, too.This valuation section contains a Bear Case, Bull Case and a Base Case DCF. The free cash flows are calculated using the Yahoo analyst revenue numbers.Figure 1 - Bear Case DCFThe Bear Case DCF assumes that the company struggles to migrate to a SaaS model. It sees only 5% growth in revenues, healthcare facilities do not attempt to modernize and find Nuance's cloud offerings unattractive. The transcription and low margin sections of the company are not phased out as there is not enough demand for Dragon Medical Cloud. Therefore, the profit margin remains at 10%.The fair value calculated is $13.94 which is a downside of 48% ($26.44). The probability of this case is low because SaaS migrations have been completed by many companies, the CEO has SaaS experience and there will likely be significant investment in the healthcare sector post-COVID-19, which will benefit Nuance.Figure 2 - Bull Case DCFThe Bull Case DCF assumes a steady migration to the SaaS model, phasing out the low margin parts of the business and transferring them to the Dragon Medical Cloud platform. Business ramps up as healthcare institutions adopt more technology to improve care. The profit margins and the revenue growth increase steadily.The fair value calculated is $38.49 which is an upside of 45%($26.44). I believe that this is hopeful at best. Nearly all previous SaaS migrations have suffered setbacks. When Adobe (ADBE) made the transition, many of their customers dissented strongly. Over 30,000 people signed a petition to try and make them revert to their old model. The healthcare sector will have a lot of inertia to overcome before it takes the step forward that is required. Also, shutting down its low margin divisions will be tough. As services are phased out employees will seek alternative employment, which will leave holes in the business and likely cause the margins to fall further. Therefore, this idyllic migration is unlikely both in revenue growth and in margin growth.I see the base case being somewhere in between. Any values that I use for free cash flows will be completely speculative. However, I will create a Base Case DCF to roughly describe how I believe the next few years will play out.Figure 3 - Base Case DCFThe Base Case DCF shows stagnation in free cash flows occurring from 2020 through until 2022. There will be great upheaval in the business model during this time. However, management will be able to maintain profit margins and revenues. In 2023 I expect to see the company rapidly expanding its margins and the bureaucratic healthcare sector to finally begin heavy investment in modernization.The fair value calculated is $25.88 which is a downside of about 2%($26.44). I find this disappointing as this is a company where there is great potential. Perhaps this evaluation uses too many negative assumptions? However, healthcare modernization can be a bureaucratic nightmare. As I have previously stated this model is a simple illustration of how Nuance may be affected and not my definition of fair value. I will likely ""hold"" until better buying opportunities arise.The largest risk to Nuance Communications is the loss of key personnel and technological expertise. There are contractual obligations (non-competes) and incentives for some of the key staff members however, these are rare. This expertise is vital to the company's moat as large AI companies expand into the market. If a ""brain drain"" occurs then Nuance will be unable to compete. I don't believe there are enough mitigating factors in place to combat this issue which worries me.Nuance has $2.1B in goodwill as they were acquisitive before 2018. The last recorded acquisition was in May 2018. I believe that any obvious cause for goodwill impairment would have been recognized by now. Compared to the size of Nuance the latest acquisitions have been quite small (Voicebox for $82M). The size of the goodwill looms over the company however I see the probability of it being significantly diminished as low.Nuance Communications have high levels of debt. The 2019 annual report had total debt at $2,137m and $1,142m of that was current debt. The current debt of $1,142m was refinanced leaving $230m in current debt. With $521.28m in cash and cash equivalents, this current debt is well covered. Nuance Communications' Q2 report said:The company is aggressively tackling the debt, which is a very positive sign as this debt load can stifle growth. Risks such as competition, SaaS migration and geographical focus have all been mentioned through the article.The migration to a SaaS model will position Nuance Communications to benefit from the imminent roll-out of Wi-Fi 6 technology and the forecast increased investment in the healthcare sector following the COVID-19 pandemic. Wi-Fi 6 will need a strong history of performance before it is implemented in a healthcare setting. The bureaucracy of the healthcare sector will delay any large investment by at least two years. The market is pre-empting the convergence of these factors and which will cause the share price to drop when on a series of below expected earning reports.As stated in my Base Case DCF, I see this migration to SaaS as a long-term positive move by the company. However, the transfer between the two systems will be very turbulent and the stock price will likely weaken on a poor earnings report. I see this as an opportunity to buy the shares if technical expertise is retained and the debt burden has been reduced."

The firm caught my attention back when it supplied voice recognition to Apple (AAPL). Unbeknownst to investors at the time, Nuance would not make much profit from the deal. Plus, management was slow in pivoting the business to health care, to the cloud, and subscription offerings. All of that changed in the last few quarters.Nuance stock is now pivoted towards sustainable growth. Even after the big run-up that sent the stock up 18% in the last month alone, the stock could trade at $30 shortly. But DIY subscribers who read my coverage on Nuance stock in May 2018 are up 81% compared to the S&P 500's (SPY) 24.66% return. And in that time, Nuance generated strong cash flow and bought back shares. In the last quarter, it had $510 million in cash and bought back $92 million. Looking ahead, there are three reasons that Nuance will continue moving higher from here.Demand for Dragon Medical Cloud improved in the last quarter year-over-year. In Q1/2020, revenue grew 51% Y/Y. Investors should expect continued strength after the company reported strong bookings in the third and fourth quarters last year. Expansion of the product through its launch in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands will support the pace of growth. Healthcare drove Nuance's annual recurring revenue in Dragon Medical Cloud.A record introduction of new products also lifted quarterly performance. Its latest revision of PowerScribe One platform on its AI marketplace is an example of products that customers want. And the 500 demonstrations in the period will only lead to the strong performance ahead.Nuance raised its earnings per share forecast by $0.02 to $0.82-0.90. For the second quarter, it expects non-GAAP revenue in the range of $353 million to $367 million. Non-GAAP EPS will be in the range of $0.15 to $0.19. At a recent share price of $23.55, the stock trades at 26 times forward earnings. Plus, compared to the industry, Nuance stock has favorable valuation metrics. Its Price/Free Cash Flow, Price/Book, and EV/EBITDA are all lower than that of the industry:Source: Stock RoverStill, the discount is warranted because sales growth will lag the industry:Source: Stock RoverInvestors have alternatives to holding Nuance. Check Point (CHKP), for example, has a quality score of 94 compared to 77 with Nuance:Impatient investors may want to hold other software stocks that are poised to grow faster. Alternatively, waiting for the stock to pull back after the strong run-up will prevent overpaying.Nuance said that customer excitement within healthcare complements the increased product initiatives and launches in its enterprise business. Specifically, Ambient clinical intelligence (ACI) development and its strategic partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) may only raise awareness for Nuance's brand. This is still early, so investors will not see the rewards from the two firms right away. Nuance said:The transformation in Nuance continues to progress at a decent pace. Investors may assign a discount rate of 10.5% and a terminal EBITDA multiple of ~24 times. In the 5-year discounted cash flow EBITDA exit model, the stock is worth ~$24."
4351147,104952,2020-05-31T17:02:03-04:00,"Nuance is an enterprise conversational AI company that consistently generates +$250 million of FCF and ~$1.8 billion of revenue every year.While revenue has been flat for years, growth has reaccelerated to ~10% in recent times after the Cerence spin-off.The continuing success of the turnaround will hinge upon the growth in recurring revenue, driven by the adoption of Dragon Medical, its cloud-based healthcare offering.So far, Dragon Medical's traction has been strong. ARR grew by 70% in 2018 and 38% in 2019.The company also has an attractive $500 million share repurchase program, 86% of which remains unexercised.","Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) is a cash-flow compounder with strong fundamentals and moat in the healthcare and enterprise segments. At present, Nuance is a ~$2 billion-a-year business with a consistent double-digit FCF (free cash flow) margin. While growth has slowed down to a single digit in recent years, the turnaround that involved a spin-off of its automotive business Cerence (NASDAQ:CRNC) has been successful. In recent times, growth has reaccelerated to a double-digit zone. Moreover, the company also has a $500 million share repurchase program with ~86% of it yet to be exercised.When we covered the stock last year, Nuance just recently completed the Cerence spin-off. At the time, we believed that the spin-off would allow Nuance to be laser-focused in growing its conversational AI business in the healthcare and enterprise segments. Since then, our thesis has seemed to be valid, as the solid 30%-40% ARR growth in the cloud healthcare business has remained consistent. Since last October, when we first covered the stock, the shares price has been up by over 45%. At ~$22 today, the price has almost retraced to its YTD-high of ~$23 in February 2020.(Source: Company's 2019 investor day slides)Going forward, we expect the company to continue relying on its healthcare solutions, such as AI-based solutions in ACI (Ambient Clinical Intelligence), CAPD (Computer-Assisted Physician Documentation), and the rest, to sustain its ~10% growth. On the other hand, the steady IVR, CDI, and HIM businesses will continue to drive profitability. As of Q2, these businesses have been solid as demand for the solutions increased amid the COVID-19 situation. While smaller hospital clients were impacted a lot more due to the reduced demand for elective procedures, large hospital systems make up ~97% of Nuance's healthcare revenue. The healthcare segment's profit also expanded by 15%, as its cloud-based solution, Dragon Medical, gained strong adoptions.(Source: Stockrow)Due to the outperformance of its cloud-based Dragon Medical One offering, we see upside opportunities in the healthcare segment. Meanwhile, the enterprise business has also been growing decently. In Q2 alone, the strong 19% growth in the enterprise segment drove the 10% overall growth despite the COVID-19 situation.(Source: Company's 10-K)At a $298 million of ARR at the end of 2019, the company would still also expect a 13-21% growth after adjusting for the near-term COVID-10 slowdown. With that in mind, the company can also potentially exercise more share repurchases in the future once the share price drops to an attractive level as the adjustment gets priced in further. As of Q2, 86% of its $500 million budget for the share repurchase program remained unexercised.Following the promising turnaround last year, Nuance will expect near-term slowdown and uncertainties in 2020. Having reached ~$298 million of ARR at the end of 2019, the company will lower the expected ARR by approximately $38 million, which is quite a significant figure. This means reducing the expectation of midpoint growth from ~30% to 17%, which is ~1,300 bps.Upon the spin off and a successful shift to cloud-based solutions, there has been quite a significant premium embedded into Nuance's P/S. Its P/S has recently soared from ~2.5x to the ~3.5x level to reflect the reaccelerated growth.(Source: Stockrow)In Q2 alone, the company had a strong quarter despite the COVID-19 outbreak.(Source: 2019 Q4 earnings call slide)Considering the catalysts, there is a potential for the stock to trade higher than 4x P/S once it continues to surprise and outperform this year. In particular, this will potentially involve Nuance increasing the share of the recurring portion of its revenue to keep the turnaround and growth stories consistent. As it stands, the building-up of Nuance's premium and reacceleration of growth to ~10% recently have been in line with the Dragon Medical's ARR growth. As of Q2, only over 80% of the overall revenue was recurring-based. Consequently, at ~3.4x P/S today, we think Nuance is an interesting GARP play and a good buy."
4185649,22148,2018-07-05T20:26:40-04:00,Nuance recently shook up the C-suite and the BOD after years of lackluster results.The company has promising technology for connected cars and the conversational AI future.The stock typically bottoms out right below $14 at a forward P/S multiple of 2x.,"From a technology side, Nuance Communications (NUAN) has a lot to like. From an execution and leadership side, the conversational AI company lacks a lot. The stock trading at $14 provides a traditional entry point to play a potential breakthrough in technology.Due to lagging results at a time that speech recognition and conversational AI devices are taking off, Nuance is shaking up the executive team including the BOD. After the recent CEO hire, the key to success will be the quality of the new additions.Last week, the company announced that three board members would retire on June 30. Robert Frankenberg, Katharine Martin, and Philip Quigley were long-term board members when the stock struggled. The move follows a nice addition of Sanjay Vaswani to the board. He is a managing partner of the Center for Corporate Innovation and had previously worked at Intel (INTC).While this board addition was solid, a lot of questions come with the recent CEO hiring. CEO Mark Benjamin joined the company on April 23 after having spent about 18 months as the President and COO of NCR Corporation (NCR) per LinkedIn.NCR is a sleepy technology company primarily involved in the declining ATM market. The stock results over the last couple of years were less than impressive. The initial rally after his hire was followed by a rough period over the last year.Ironically, Automatic Data Processing (ADP) has a far better performance since Mr. Benjamin moved to NCR in October 2016. ADP traded in the $80s and is now a $134 stock.Clearly, these time periods are far too short to make a complete judgment on his talents. The issue though is that his main experience comes from a sleepy tech company and Nuance wants to escape the same fate.The company has promising technology including the Dragon Drive solution for the connected car. The issue is turning this technology position into a growth company.Image Source: Nuance websiteThe best depiction of the lack of progress made by the previous CEO is the chart on revenue growth. When the scale used for quarterly revenue growth is only 4%, one can see that Nuance hasn't had a very robust 5-year period.NUAN Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsThe best part of the story is that Nuance is solidly profitable and generates decent free cash flow. Cash flow from operations was as high as $566 million in FY16.The company though has a very convoluted business structure without driving any sector into a massive growth machine. The healthcare sector always has promises for clinical documentation and image diagnostics, but the sector never generates any meaningful growth.Enterprise deals with AT&T (NYSE:T), Accenture (NYSE:ACN), and Barclays Bank (NYSE:BCS) never seem to boost numbers and mobile shifted from promises in wireless to now automotive. The company does a lot to drive successes for other firms in speech recognition and conversational AI, but the deals never boost the prominence of Nuance or the quarterly results.The company forecasts net new bookings growth of 5% to 7% this fiscal year. The new CEO is looking for ways to accelerate the business:The interpretation here is that a reorganization could take place that impacts the near-term outlook but eventually accelerates growth in the future. The stock is cheap when the forward P/S ratio dips to 2x sales estimates, but the stock could be in for a bumpy ride.NUAN PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that Nuance needs a reset. The stock typically reaches a bottom around $14 at 2x sales estimates. The new CEO could provide a catalyst for the stock but his past work experience doesn't support any meaningful move.Nuance remains an interesting way to play the typical $14 to $20 ramp with potential upside. If the new CEO and revamped BOD figures out a way to accelerate growth in the booming conversational AI sector, the stock could see far larger gains."
4300639,104952,2019-10-30T19:54:37-04:00,"Nuance's spin-off of its Automotive unit, Cerence, has seen mixed reactions. Nuance was down ~15% on the day of the spin-off completion.The Cerence spinoff will create greater shareholder value. Cerence's vision to enter autonomous driving and smart cities will be executed by a strong leadership team.Microsoft has recently partnered with Nuance, which shows the tech giant's deep commitment to the healthcare sector.We believe that the Cerence spinoff and Microsoft partnership will serve as the catalysts for the stock going forward.","October 2019 has been a busy month for Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: NUAN). At the beginning of the month, the company announced the spin-off completion of its Cerence (NASDAQ:CRNC) business unit. As a result, the companies have now become two independent publicly-traded companies, wherein for eight shares of Nuance, shareholders now also have one share of Cerence. Later on in the second week of the month, Nuance and Microsoft (MSFT) announced that they would join forces in speeding up the provision of clinical information technology ((ACI)) to aid the production of clinical information.In Q3, Nuance reported a Non-GAAP EPS of $0.31, which beats the estimate by $0.03. Its GAAP EPS of $0.04 also beats the estimate by $0.02. Having posted an overall revenue of $460.2 million means the company increased its top-line growth by 1.9% YoY to beat the guidance by $4.75 million.Based on the ASC 605 reporting standard, we saw that Hosting and professional services segment increased by 6% to $260.9 million, driven by an overall increase across Healthcare, Enterprise, and Automotive segments. Product and licensing was down 4% to $121.8 million, primarily due to a decrease in Enterprise and Automotive, which was offset a little bit by an increase in Healthcare. The Enterprise segment of Product and licensing experienced the largest decrease, which was due to the lower revenue from the contact center clients. Maintenance and Support was also down by 1.6% to $66.5 million, driven by the customers’ shift from licenses to cloud-based solution in the Healthcare segment.(source: Nuance 10-Q)With the spin-off of Cerence, Nuance will no longer recognize the revenue from its Automotive segment. As of June 30, 2019, Automotive revenue segment contributes ~16% of the total segment revenue based on the new ASC 606 reporting standard. Overall, the company’s strong expense management was the Q3 highlight. Operating income almost tripled to $38.5 million while net income was up to $88.9 million from $64 million in FY 2018.The Microsoft partnership would allow Nuance to combine its healthcare-optimized speech recognition products like Dragon Medical with any related Microsoft services across cloud computing, AI platform, and also its medical-specific AI technology. In that sense, These services would include Azure and its AI platform and Project EmpowerMD Intelligent Scribe Service. The Nuance partnership would be the first among the two key partnerships Microsoft has done in recent times. Soon after in October 21st, Microsoft also announced a seven-year partnership with Humana to build predictive and personalized health care solutions tailored for Humana members. The partnership also allows Humana to use Microsoft’s Azure cloud, Azure artificial intelligence and voice technologies.(source: Cerence S-1)On the other hand, we think that the Cerence spin off makes a lot of sense from various perspectives. In particular, we feel that Cerence’s vision to optimise its offerings and R&D activities towards AR (Augmented Reality) and smart cities is something that would benefit highly from a separate leadership team with a specific industry expertise:Autonomous driving is also an area that a lot of firms such as Uber (UBER), Alphabet (GOOGL), Lyft (LYFT), or Tesla (TSLA) have been pouring their resources into. Operating independently, Cerence will have a very clear direction as to how it will engage with any of these firms going forward, with the least minimal risk of conflict of interest with Nuance, if any.(source: seeking alpha)Overall, the market has viewed Nuance’s Q3 earnings positively, while the overall reaction on the spin-off was a bit mixed. The stock fell 15% after the completion of the spin-off on October 2nd. A few days after its announcement of Microsoft partnership, however, the stock has traded upwards again to approximately ~$15.93 per share as of the last week of October. The 2.6% lower price per share compared to its pre-Q3 earnings report. With an EPS estimate of 1.13 at the end of September 2020, the company trades at a roughly forward P/E ratio of 14.10. This forward P/E is also lower than the sector median of 23.23. On the other hand, Nuance’s ~11.62% YoY growth also means that the company would grow faster compared to its peers.We are optimistic about Nuance’s prospects going forward. On the spin-off, we believe that investors are getting lower risk exposure to its Automotive segment while receiving interesting upsides from the growth opportunities in autonomous driving and smart cities. The Cerence’s leadership team who execute the vision is also very solid and experienced. On the recent business activities, we are also confident that the Nuance and Microsoft partnership would be the catalyst for the potential outperformance. Looking at how Microsoft has also recently entered a partnership with Humana (NYSE:HUM), we realize how the partnership has become a key growth initiative for Microsoft in the healthcare sector. As a result, Microsoft would be fully invested in the process. Ultimately, Nuance represents an interesting long opportunity for investors seeking any AI opportunities."
4326680,104012,2020-02-24T14:33:26-05:00,"Nuance Communications Inc. is a Massachusetts-based software company whose business is primarily in artificial intelligence and speech recognition.
        The new strategic approach is showing signs of bearing fruit with the company bouncing back to profitability and seeing a sizeable market appreciation.
        Continued pursuit of a lean organization in a highly competitive market promises to further enhance profitability.","Nuance Communications Inc. (NUAN) is a Massachusetts-based software company whose business is primarily in artificial intelligence and speech recognition. It was formed after the merger between ScanSoft, which had roots in Xerox, and Nuance Communications in 2005. Owing to competitive pressure, NUAN has had to sell its imaging and automotive divisions in 2019. The company now focuses on providing healthcare and enterprise solutions. The new strategic approach is showing signs of bearing fruit with the company bouncing back to profitability and seeing a sizeable market appreciation. Therefore, an evaluation of key metrics inform a buy suggestion.Figure 1 shows NUAN’s net profit margins over the last three years ending 2019. It is notable that this ratio has improved significantly since 2018 when it was a loss of 8.68% to 2019’s 11.73%. The inference is that NUAN’s management has made considerable enhancements in controlling costs. This deduction is particularly important given that NUAN’s revenues declined marginally between 2018 and 2019 as shown in Table 1. However, the company turned around its net income from a loss of $159.93 million in 2018 to a profit of $213.81 million in 2019. The primary contributor to this development is the management’s decision to simplify operations by focusing on its Healthcare and Enterprise segments. This necessitated the sale of those operations that had ceased contributing to profitability. The positive impact of the new strategy is evident in NUAN’s first quarter results ending December 2019. These are shown in Table 2 where the company’s net income increased significantly to $48 million compared to $19 million in 2018. Other outcome of NUAN’s renewed strategy are discussed in subsequent sections.As shown in Figure 1, NUAN’s asset turnover increased significantly in 2019 (33.98%) compared to 2017 (29.13%) despite a brief dip in 2018. The company’s improved performance implies that it is deriving more revenues from its assets, which is a major indicator of efficiency. Asset turnover also increased significantly in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to the previous year as shown in Table 2. These outcomes denote that NUAN’s new strategic approach is paying off by ridding off the company’s unprofitable assets.Figure 1: Performance driversThis is further evidenced by the substantial growth in return on assets seen in the latest quarter and over the last three years ending 2019. Furthermore, Table 2 shows that the firm has substantially enhanced its efficiency in generating profits from existing assets. This is directly related to NUAN’s decision to dispose of unprofitable assets in 2018 moving forward.Table 1: Annual fundamental analysisTable 2: Quarterly fundamental analysisNUAN is a highly leveraged company with its equity multiplier averaging 288.29% over the three years ending 2019. While the disposal of some of its segments has contributed to a reduction of this ratio to the current 248.99%, this indicator still has a negative connotation on the company. Firstly, NUAN operates in the highly unpredictable technology sector that is susceptible to rapid changes that could erode its cash flows. This factor is emphasized in Table 1 and 2 where the company’s operating cash flow, used in paying interest and the source of subsequent financing activities, declined sharply in 2019 compared to 2018. This was despite a significant increase from 2017 to 2018. While 2019’s decline is partly attributable to the sale of NUAN’s segments, it is also notable that the company lost about $19 million in sales in this period. These developments underscore the fact that excessive debt bears significant risk for the company should it fail to raise sufficient cash flows to pay of its liabilities.Return on equity is driven by the net profit margin, asset turnover, and equity multiplier. Tables 1 and 2 show that NUAN’s ROE increased significantly over the last three years and in the latest quarter. This is due to there being a concerted effort by the company’s managers to increase profitability and asset efficiency by selling loss-making segments. However, it is also apparent that NUAN has relied on debt financing to attain these goals despite a decline in this item. Specifically, NUAN’s debt levels reduced from $4 billion in 2017 to $3.2 billion in 2019. Yet, the company’s equity multiplier remains high at 2019’s level of 249%. This makes the company vulnerable to price attacks by rivals as high leverage makes it necessary to retain high prices. A competitor who offers a cheaper identical service as NUAN will have dealt the company a significant blow to its cash flows and it may resort to a further sale of assets.Figure 2: ROA and ROE trendsFigure 3 shows a considerable improvement in NUAN’s stock price between 2017 and 2019. Indeed, it is notable that the company’s market value has appreciated by 56% since December 2018, which is around the time NUAN announced its restructuring plan. Subsequent appreciation has also been driven by this plan bearing the intended results. Besides, NUAN has seen its price/earnings ratio increase from a loss position in 2017 and 2018 to 2019’s 45.72 and the current 43.66. Though, there has been a reduction in this indicator in the most recent quarter, the substantial improvement compared to previous years implies growing market confidence in NUAN’s stock. Specifically, the most recent P/E ratio infers that investors are willing to pay at least $43.66 for a $1 of NUAN’s earnings. Since a company’s share price has been defined as the summation of its future cash flows, an increase in the P/E ratio then signifies growth in investor confidence that it will generate adequate cash flows in the long-run.Figure 3: NUAN stock price trendsOwing to the sale of some of its businesses, NUAN’s enterprise value to EBITDA declined significantly from 42.20 in 2018 to 20.52 in 2019. However, this has since improved to 26.70 in the most recent quarter. This further highlights the market’s confidence in NUAN’s renewed strategic approach that is already showing signs of leading to positive results as discussed previously.NUAN has sought to repurpose its business since making consecutive annual losses in 2017 and 2018. In the new model, the company is leaner and more efficient as it focuses on its healthcare and enterprise divisions. This approach has had positive results with profitability and asset efficiency improving considerably since 2018, both annually and quarterly. However, NUAN remains a highly indebted company, which exposes it to competitive attacks from larger rivals. Despite this drawback, the market has reacted positively to the recent changes at the company as indicated by the P/E and enterprise to EBITDA ratios. It is based on these factors that investment in NUAN is recommended. Specifically, the continued pursuit of a lean organization in a highly competitive market promises to further enhance profitability. More importantly, the restructured organization can be expected to attract substantial stock price increases in the medium to long-term."

Voicebox owns a patent on Conversational Voice Technology and was recognized as one of the World’s Most Impactful Technologies in the IEEE’s recent list of technology awards.Management is headed by Co-Founder and CEO Mike Kennewick, who helped build the frim from the ground-up and was previously a CEO at Webforia.Below is an overview video of Voicebox’s location intelligence feature:(Source: Voicebox)Voicebox’s primary offerings include:The firm counts as development partners a number of automotive and technology companies:Investors have invested $25.3 million in the company through five funding rounds, and include Morningside Ventures, AutoNavi, Inventec and MiTAC. (Sources: Crunchbase andCBInsights)Market & CompetitionAccording to a market research report by Markets & Markets, the Natural Language Processing [NLP] market will grow from $7.63 billion in 2016 to $16.07 billion by 2021.This represents a CAGR of 16.1% between 2016 and 2021.The main drivers for this expected growth are an  increase in usage of smart devices, increase in demand for enhanced customer experience, a number of emerging options in application areas, increased deployment of web & cloud-based business applications, increased investment in the healthcare industry, and growth in machine-to-machine technology.Major competitive vendors that provide high-end NLP software include:Nuance has yet to confirm the reported transaction, nor has it quietly filed an 8-K or mention the deal in its recent earnings announcement.However, a visit to the Voicebox website refers the visitor to Nuance’s automotive AI solutions website.Nuance appears to have acquired Voicebox to integrate its natural language processing technologies into its growing automotive platform.The addition of Voicebox promises to enhance its offering to automotive OEMs wishing to incorporate greater voice-based capabilities in their cars as automobiles transition towards increasing compute-driven intelligence and interaction with occupants.In the past twelve months, NUAN’s stock price has fallen approximately 26.7%, as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)Over the past year, NUAN’s stock has dramatically underperformed the benchmark S&P 500 Index which has returned approximately 13% during the same period.In its most recent earnings release, Nuance management said it has ‘made progress in key vertical industries and growth businesses.’However, the financial results show worsening results, with a GAAP net loss of $(164.1) million, or $(0.56) per share, compared to a loss of $(33.8) million, or $(0.12) per share, in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017.’Perhaps this is the darkest point before the dawn, as Nuance management has touted a number of ‘design wins for Nuance’s AI and virtual assistant offerings with key customers, including AT&T, BMW, Cisco, Ford, Geely and Wells Fargo.’With such a wide array of customers, however, Nuance runs the risk of spreading itself too thinly instead of focusing on the most profitable and highest priority industries.In its current earnings release, management also announced a goodwill impairment of $137.9 million related to two businesses. That’s a pretty significant haircut - one can only hope that management is ‘clearing the decks’ for better comps in the coming fiscal year.We don’t know what NUAN paid for the Voicebox acquisition, so we can’t tell the effects on its balance sheet from the deal.Nuance management will need to perform much better in the following quarters to keep investors interested in its prospects amid strong market demand for AI and virtual assistants for which its technology portfolio provides solutions.Count me in the ‘show me’ group as we await further earnings and operational announcements in the coming quarters.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4174039,22786,2018-05-15T04:52:09-04:00,Confidence in Nuance fell after the company reported sluggish results and lowered its outlook.Subscription revenue stalled unexpected.Fair value model suggests 10 percent more downside.,"When technology stocks fall, that is the time DIYers (do-it-yourself) seeking value stocks should get interested. That was the case for Synaptics (SYNA), whose earnings failed to impress and Symantec (SYMC), whose management said it was looking into its accounting practices. Then there is Nuance Communications (NUAN). For a while, it looked as if Nuance turned the corner and would return to growth at a reasonable price. That changed in short time when the company reported second-quarter results that shook investor confidence. Revenue growth lagged in the single digits while the company slipped to a GAAP loss. A jump in cash flow from operations was the only bright spot.The company touted its progress in user-experience offerings in automotive, with Daimler and Toyota. The cloud platform continued growing through Dragon Medical cloud. Nuance introduced AI in its core engine capabilities, offering voice recognition and text-to-speech features for the enterprise. Two other buzzwords it used include voice biometrics and virtual assistant design wins. Even though Nuance secured business from Cisco Systems (CSCO), Ford Motor (F), Geely, and Wells Fargo (WFC) for the virtual assistant, competitors are already ahead. Alphabet (GOOG) is dominating the consumer space with Google Home Assistant and Smart Speaker. Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Alexa is selling in record numbers, with tens of millions in sales during the last holiday season.NUAN data by YChartsOn its conference call, management made no mention of the virtual assistant. Nuance could only mention growth in the high single to low double-digits in healthcare and automotive:Source: SA TranscriptMore troubling was the company’s underperformance in the enterprise space, due to lower services and licensing deals getting pushed out into the next (third) quarter. Bookings also fell a significant 8 percent.Nuance forecast organic revenue will grow by just 2 percent to 4 percent. Bookings will grow 5 percent to 7 percent for the fiscal year, helped by Dragon Medical, Automotive, and Enterprise. The company is seeing significant changes in its SRS business, or Subscriber Revenue Services business. Value investors may point to the successful shift of software sales to a subscription model with Adobe Systems (ADBE) and its Creative Suite. Microsoft (MSFT) is another example of a company that successfully moved its Office users to Office 365 on the cloud, cross-selling Azure cloud computing platform and services to small businesses and enterprises.NUAN stock offers no upside in subscription revenue:NUAN data by YChartsWhile Microsoft may earn a valuation of 24 times forward P/E and Adobe gets 32.6 times forward P/E, Nuance’s 11 times forward is not likely to expand any time soon. This implies the share price will not rise. The company still has a debt to maintain, with its long-term debt/equity at 1.14 times. Year-over-year, long-term debt increased from $2.24 billion to $2.3 billion.In the fiscal second quarter, cash flow worsened due to an impairment of goodwill charge of $137.9 million and higher capital expenditures of $12.78 million, up from $7.39 million. Nuance forecast cash flow from operations in the range of $410 million to $430 million. It previously guided $430 million to $450 million.Investors did not expect weakness in SRS. Margin guidance continues to fall every quarter (for three quarters in a row). Previously, Nuance faced weakness in professional services but this time, SRS became a headwind. Investments in conversational AI and security initiatives cut into profitability. The company has some hope for growth in Healthcare. EHR optimization and implementation have nice traction. Large implementations could once again offset the impact from Nuance’s weaker segments.Wall Street’s average price targets, based on only five analysts, is $21.60, which is nearly double the $12.95 closing price. If investors assume Nuance will generate a predictable level of future cash flow, a 10-year DCF EBITDA Exit model suggests that NUAN stock still has slightly more downside.

4151123,21820,2018-02-27T12:15:01-05:00,"Nuance Communications reported a stellar first quarter, which saw a return to growth.Shares are trading flat since earnings, despite a large increase last month on preliminary results.Bookings are strong in several areas and should power large back half of year.Rumored sale of automotive division could be a major catalyst at a rumored $1.5 billion price tag.","Nuance Communications (NUAN) reported first quarter earnings earlier this month. After a minor 3% rise, shares have traded relatively flat. Back in December, I highlighted why this small cap company was in a good position to take advantage of the growing artificial intelligence market. That bullish case was strengthened by the first quarter earnings and some exciting catalysts for the company.My bullish case for NUAN shares centered on:The first quarter earnings showed the continued strength of the healthcare, enterprise, and automotive sector. The company also raised guidance, strengthening my argument that the original estimates given were conservative. Shares continue to trade near 52-week lows, giving investors an opportunity to invest in a powerhouse AI company.(Photo Credit) Nuance reported first quarter revenue of $508.8 million, an increase of 2.6%. More importantly, organic revenue grew 1% in the quarter.For the first quarter, revenue broke down as:For fiscal year 2017, revenue broke down as (in $ millions):Just looking at these two charts, we can see many positive things from the first quarter. The biggest thing that jumps out is the healthcare segment. After a disappointing fourth quarter, the company has not only rebounded, but posted a higher quarter than each of the quarters in the last fiscal year. The enterprise segment also continues to be a positive segment for the company, with continued revenue increases. The numbers will look slightly different in the future, when automotive is broken out from mobile into a separate segment. The remaining mobile will be combined with enterprise.Digging deeper into the numbers, the financial health is improving for Nuance’s largest segment. After the disappointing fourth quarter, Nuance has seen margins recover for the healthcare segment. Take a look at the following margins for the segment:The healthcare segment was led by the continued growth in Dragon Medical. This portion of the healthcare segment is now the largest line of business in the division. The company’s legacy business in healthcare continued to decline, but is more than being offset by the company’s new artificial intelligence offerings helping the medical fields.The other big growing segment is enterprise, which saw organic revenue increase 4%. The company saw net new bookings for this segment grow 21%, suggesting a huge demand for its products. This could see this segment post nice increases in revenue in the back half of the year. Keep in mind that this 4% increase came on a comparable quarter that saw revenue grow 15% in the prior year. The second quarter comparable number is again high, so we might not see as a big of a jump. I would guess that the third and fourth quarters could see revenue increase double digits for the enterprise segments.I highlighted the growth of Nuance as a player in the artificial intelligence in automotive in the last article. Thanks to the growth of autonomous and connected cars, Nuance is seeing strong growth for its services.The automotive segment could be a short- or long-term catalyst depending on what the company does with it. The plans to break this segment out into its own sector should show the strong growth of the company’s automotive products. A rumored sale of this unit could be much easier to accomplish with it shining as its own sector for all to see.Bloomberg reported options for a sale back in January. The company is said to be working with Evercore on the review process for selling the automotive business. Rumors say the segment could reach as much as $1.5 billion in a sale.Without a sale, the strength of this unit will continue, but could see its biggest growth two or three years from now. The company highlighted several design wins that were part of first quarter bookings. These are for 2020 and 2021 car models. Nuance collects revenue when the cars are shipped, putting some of this new revenue years away.On the conference call, Nuance highlighted several auto wins:It’s also worth pointing out that Dragon Drive is behind the auto assistant in a new concept car from Toyota. The Toyota concept-I is one of the most talked about cars and has been shown off at two Consumer Electronic Shows. The car is being designed as “less of a machine, more of a pal.” The car design comes from the inside out, making it one of the most connected cars currently being developed. Nuance is clearly a top company being used by automotive companies to create new connected cars for the future. This is a huge growth segment for Nuance now and for well into the future.(Photo Credit: Wired)The first quarter was the seventh straight quarter of revenue growth for the company’s automotive sub-segment. Revenue was up 4% to $61.5 million in the first quarter. The company also said it received strong bookings for its auto products.One of the great things about the first quarter was the increase in net new bookings. In the first quarter, net new bookings increased 10% to $418.4 million. This is a key figure used to see how future revenue will look. Last year, the first quarter had the lowest net new bookings figure, suggesting there could be extreme upside here if the other three quarters see similar increases. Take a look at last year’s net new bookings by quarter:As I predicted in my last piece, the guidance given by Nuance Communications was conservative. Thanks to the strength in the first quarter and strong bookings, the company has raised several financial estimates for the full year. Nuance is guiding for full-year revenue of $2.055 to $2.095 billion. Prior guidance was $2.03 to $2.08 billion. Earnings per share are expected to come in a range of $1.14 to $1.20, an increase from the prior range of $1.06 to $1.15. The company also raised organic revenue growth to a range of 3 to 5% (from a prior 2% to 4%).This was an amazing quarter from Nuance Communications. The thing that really confuses me here is that Nuance released preliminary earnings back in late January. On the strength of that, investors sent shares up to a high of $18.74. Shares have fallen since then and when official results came in, the stock couldn’t crack the $18 level again. Shares were up 22.5% at that January peak from the time of my last article. I think shares there were still undervalued.Nuance Communications continues to be a great way to play the shift to artificial intelligence in several industries. I would recommend investors take a look at this small cap name before the next earnings report. The sale of the automotive unit could come as a major catalyst if a deal is reached and could be the move that the stock needs to get back to the $20 level."
4129549,21820,2017-12-04T15:03:45-05:00,Nuance Communications unveils two new AI products for growing healthcare market.AI healthcare market expected to grow around 50% annually.Nuance has strong position in artificial intelligence for other areas like enterprise and automotive.Early guidance for 2018 and 2019 is strong but also seems conservative given segment trends.Shares trade near 52 week lows and are ready to break out.,"Artificial intelligence continues to be one of the biggest future growth sectors for investors to get in front of. Many sectors are going to see a big benefit from artificial intelligence growth. Thanks to recent developments, one of the stocks that could be a big winner in the artificial intelligence boom has resurfaced on my radar and is now my favorite investment for this coming shift to AI. Nuance Communications (NUAN) will benefit from its position in artificial intelligence solutions for healthcare, automotive, and enterprise solutions. With that said, the stock is a strong buy here on recent weakness and trading near 52-week lows.Nuance Communications is a name that immediately pops up as familiar to most investors. Many investors and people know the company’s technology as it has powered their car’s entertainment systems, listened to them place orders for Domino’s Pizza (NYSE:DPZ), and even once powered Apple’s (OTC:APPL) popular Siri service. Today, we look at why Nuance Communications has a bright future as a leader in virtual assistants in healthcare, enterprise, and automotive. The company has already worked with large companies and continues to be one of the most sought after for the artificial intelligence segment. I continue to be surprised to not see Nuance Communications listed in all of the artificial intelligence stocks to buy lists.Nuance shares got a slight lift this past week after the company unveiled its new AI Marketplace for Diagnostic Imaging. Nuance shared details in a press release and also unveiled the technology at the Radiological Society of North America Conference, currently taking place in Chicago.(Photo Source)Nuance will combine its PowerScribe radiology reporting and PowerShare image exchange with Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) deep learning platform to create the first marketplace for diagnostic imaging. PowerShare and PowerScribe are already used by 70% of all radiologists in the United States. There are many huge benefits in creating this marketplace, as ultimately it will lead to better production by radiologists and by prioritizing patients through algorithms can save lives. This new platform streamlines the use of AI for detection, diagnosis and treatment of disease. Nuance is truly revolutionizing the medical imaging business with artificial intelligence.How revolutionary is this news piece form Nuance? Consider this from the company’s blog: “integration of machine learning technology in radiology is a disruption that could be as profound as the advent of digital imaging”.Nuance’s new service is similar to the concept of app stores. Radiologists and AI developers can build, test, and share algorithms with each other. As an example, an algorithm can identify a pulmonary embolism on a CT angiogram and prioritize this study on the radiologist’s worklist. The platform can be used to define and build, publish and share, and access, subscribe, and use. This use of the algorithms can save vital diagnostic minutes.(Photo Source)Along with the new platform service from Nuance, the company also has highlighted a recently developed virtual assistant for the healthcare segment that could be a big growth factor going forward. Nuance introduced an AI powered virtual assistant and prototype smart speaker that are specifically designed for the healthcare clients it already serves. According to Nuance, 63% of healthcare executives are investing in artificial intelligence. The same study says 74% of the executives plan on investing in AI in the future.This new virtual assistant and speaker can help doctors edit health records, review patient charts, fill prescriptions with their voice, serve up patient summaries, schedule appointments, dive into lab test results, review pre-existing conditions and prescriptions, and more. Clinicians currently spend 43% of their day at their computer and Nuance hopes to make this figure much smaller and increase productivity for the healthcare industry and save companies money as well. This isn’t a first for Nuance here as it has worked with other large companies to create virtual assistants. Examples include Ford, General Motors, FedEx, and American Airlines. Final pricing has not been announced for the virtual assistant or speaker yet. Nuance plans on selling directly to health care providers through its traditional enterprise channels.(Photo Source)Nuance Healthcare is incredibly large in terms of revenue and the reach it has in hospitals. Nuance deploys solutions to 86% of United States hospitals. The company’s products are used by more than 500,000 clinicians and 10,000 facilities worldwide. Nuance saves healthcare clients over $1 billion in reimbursements annually.These two new additions by Nuance continue the push into artificial intelligence in the medical field. This is a huge growing market and worth billions of dollars to Nuance and competitors. Take a look at these estimates by leading researchers for the AI healthcare market:This is huge growth as AI health care is currently worth less than $1 billion as a whole. The annual growth is around 50% depending on which of these figures is the most realistic. Nuance is well-positioned to take a big chunk of this.The healthcare segment saw its best quarter ever for net new bookings in the fourth quarter (ending September). The Dragon Medical segment saw 19% full year growth thanks to the continued strength of cloud-based offerings. The fourth quarter saw continued increased demand for PowerShare and PowerScribe. I would expect all of these trends to continue and first quarter net new bookings should come in strong again thanks to the new launches. The virtual assistant and new AI radiology platform were both launched towards the end of or after the fourth quarter.While the healthcare business segment is the biggest for Nuance and perhaps where the most growth is, the enterprise segment is a big winner for Nuance. In fact, the segment posted its seventh consecutive quarter of year over year organic growth in the fourth quarter. The segment was also the biggest revenue gainer for the company in percentage for the fourth quarter and the full year.(Photo Source)Nuance continues to beat out the competition in rankings, which should mean it can keep up its high recurring revenue amounts and also land some new deals. The company secured the top vendor position from two leading research groups (Forrester, Opus Research), beating competitors like IBM Watson.Opus Research gave Nuance the highest combined score amongst all intelligent assistant and bot vendors. Nuance received a gold rating in six of the seven categories. The results were presented showing 28 companies in the field, including IBM Watson, which is becoming an increasingly big part of IBM’s growth.One of the biggest trends for companies is increasing their social media presence and maintaining customer relations by always being available. Nuance has a big presence in this field and AI is bigger than some would think here. Nuance uses the example of people direct messaging a company on Twitter. Nuance’s AI can filter through the messages and respond appropriately or alert a live agent when a follow-up response is needed. More than 6500 enterprises are using Nuance’s self-service technologies.In 2016, the intelligent assistant market was worth $1 billion. By 2021, that figure is expected to rise to $4.5 billion. Again, Nuance is well positioned in a growing market and a leader that has shown itself against competition and secured contracts with some of the most well respected companies in the world.Along with being the rumored voice of Siri, it is Nuance’s inclusion in automobiles that put Nuance on my radar. Back in 2013, I discussed how Nuance had a strong position in the connected car growth segment and argued a recent acquisition would act as a catalyst to continue the growth. The auto segment is growing and becoming so big that Nuance plans on braking it out as a separate category from the current Mobile segment.Nuance is investing further into the connected car market by opening a DRIVE Lab (design, research, innovation, and in-vehicle experience lab) in the Detroit areas to study innovation in the automotive segment. This lab in Detroit will act as a global hub for Nuance. Additional labs are planned for Europe and Asia. Nuance is betting big since studies show that 90% of top automakers believe AI is very important to them. The company is positioning itself well here with its existing Dragon Drive automotive assistant and should be able to continue its nice win streak of working with all of the top automotive brands. Nuance works with Audi, BMW, Daimler, Fiat, Ford, GM, Hyundai, SAIC, Toyota, and Volkswagen. There are more than 180 million cars on the road that have Dragon Drive technology inside.(Photo Source)Keep an eye on Nuance in January, as the company will be honored and on full display at the Consumers Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Thanks to its work with Dragon Drive, Nuance is being honored as a CES 2018 Innovation Award honoree. The company will show off its connected car platform at the event that runs January 9 through 12 in Las Vegas.In the fourth quarter, Nuance reported strategic wins and launches that included: Toyota, Volkswagen, Audi, Harman, and Garmin. The company’s Dragon Drive continues to pick up big wins and be a big part of the connected car going forward. When Nuance announced its guidance for fiscal 2018 (more on this below), it highlighted an expectation of double digit growth in automotive as one of the strengths.Nuance recently reported its fourth quarter and full year financials. The fourth quarter was heavily impacted by a malware attack the company suffered that forced a period of shutdown and loss of revenue. Despite the impact, the financial results came in strong and highlighted the growth the company has coming in the future.“Absent the incident we completed an excellent year operationally, strategically, and financially,” the company said on the earnings call.“Our fiscal year ’17 performance provides further evidence that our strategic focus on evolving our business to conversational AI and predictive analytics-based solutions is generating demand in our key vertical markets,” Nuance said.Nuance saw net new bookings hit the high end of guidance. In the healthcare segment, net new bookings had the best quarter ever in the fourth quarter. The enterprise segment saw record net new bookings for the full fiscal year. Nuance saw net new bookings of $424.4 million in the fourth quarter and $1.65 billion for the full fiscal year across all business segments.Here is a look at the revenue figures by segment for Nuance:As you can see the fourth quarter was significantly impacted by the malware incident. The healthcare segment, which is the biggest business segment, saw big losses in the quarter and for the whole year. The imaging segment continues to drag down results as well. The enterprise and mobile (which includes auto) segments both performed well and as listed above have a bright future. Now if you look at the big picture and expect the mobile and enterprise segments to grow and believe in the bullish case I laid out for the healthcare segment above, you can see how the future is exciting for Nuance Communications. To make things even better, the company’s guidance suggests the imaging business might actually improve thanks to new product launches in fiscal 2018.Nuance released guidance for fiscal 2018 and early guidance for fiscal 2019. A goal of organic revenue growth of 2 to 4% for fiscal 2018 is set. The company sees bookings growth and recurring revenue growth to continue its momentum, along with the recovery of margins from the malware incident. The company expects earnings per share to come in a range of $1.06 to $1.15. Revenue is expected to hit a range of $2.03 to $2.08 billion for Nuance in fiscal 2018. The company’s early guidance for fiscal 2019 is organic revenue growth of 3 to 5%, driven by growth in Enterprise, Dragon Medical, and automotive. With the excitement in many of the company’s categories and product launches, I have to say I think the early guidance for 2018 seems conservative. Given the early guidance call for 3 to 5% growth in fiscal 2019 I think could be a better projection. I think Nuance is perhaps setting the bar low here and should have no problem beating expectations.I highlighted the three business segments that have led me to believe Nuance Communications is a great investment going forward with its dominant position and vast knowledge of the artificial intelligence sector. I left out the imaging business segment, which actually has some upside in fiscal 2018. This segment will have its most robust set of new product offerings in the division’s history and recently signed some nice partnerships with Lexmark, Canon, and Epson.Nuance has a nice roadmap ahead in areas that have huge growth and billions of dollars in potential deals. The company has shown through awards that it has the knowledge to help customers use artificial intelligence and virtual assistants to help them save money and improve customer relationships. One of the things that is so attractive about IBM right now is how it is utilizing Watson to grow in new markets and fields and using AI to help companies and grow its revenue. Think of Nuance as a mini-Watson here and you can see how its $4.5 billion market capitalization could be a steal for an investor or an acquirer.Nuance may trade sideways until some feedback is given on how well the new radiology platform is going or in February when first quarter earnings are released. Keep in mind that Nuance has said it will be transitioning the automotive business into a separate business segment. The growth of this unit could get some additional details and make the company more attractive going forward. I think you have a little bit of time to get into Nuance here and believe it could be a strong performer in 2018 and wouldn’t be surprised to see shares trade back in the $20 to $25 range they saw several years ago."
4098875,98236,2017-08-14T21:50:12-04:00,"Nuance announced the results of its 3rd fiscal quarter last week.Much of the announcement was a reprise and an elaboration regarding the malware attack that significantly affected operations.Looking beyond the malware attack and its impact, the company reported a quarter that featured strong progress on the top line with bookings growth far above expectations.Despite the malware attack, Nuance actually raised its bookings forecast for the year and reached some favorable qualitative milestones regarding the drivers of future bookings growth.Shares declined about 14% in the wake of the malware attack and are at levels that are unusually attractive.","Let’s cut to the chase. Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN), when all the one-time issues are removed, is achieving accelerating growth and is continuing to improve operating margins. As a result of a significant and rather successful hack called NotPetya, the company has forecast a modest decline in earnings over the next 2-3 quarters. The shares have responded to that decline and ignored the growth acceleration. What it means to investors is that there is now an opportunity to acquire shares in Nuance at exceptionally attractive valuation metrics. No one can know how long the window will last - and given the history of this company, one needs to be cautious about looking at positive developments. Yes, in many ways this has been a star-crossed company for investors. But I have to write about logic and not my own frustrations in trying to analyze these shares.Logically, investors should be buying-buying now and averaging over the next few months until Nuance next reports its results. The bad stuff is out there and baked into the shares. The very positive operational developments have simply been ignored and are quite compelling. Simply put, the guide-down Nuance provided to its forecast in its latest quarterly earnings release, and the concomitant share price reaction, present an opportunity that should be taken by investors, albeit on a prudent basis. The growth, as I will explore in the balance of this article, is the real thing. The hack, while an issue, is neither intractable nor a longer-term problem.Nuance announced the results of its June ending quarter on August 8, 2017. The results themselves were probably better than might have been anticipated in the wake of the global malware incident that had led to a disruption of the company’s worldwide operation, primarily in its healthcare transcription and imaging businesses. I have linked here to commentary from an industry publication regarding the virulence of the NotPetya, its possible impact on Nuance, and interestingly, some potential longer-term benefits for the company.Specifically, the company reported results that showed a small increase in revenue compared to the results of the prior year. Of equal significance, it reported another quarter of very strong net new bookings growth, this time 24% year on year, net of the impact of the malware account which interdicted about $10 million of bookings in the company’s imaging sector at the end of the quarter. Net new bookings for the quarter as actually signed reached $439 million. Nuance has seen substantial net new bookings growth since Q4 of fiscal 2016, and it is reasonable to surmise that bookings are a reasonable proxy for the course of future revenue performance.Nuance’s Enterprise Group, which was not impacted by the malware attack, saw the highest level of bookings since the company started to report bookings. The enterprise business saw substantial strength in sales of biometric solutions (those where voice is used as a security agent), including a record contract signed with a large global financial installation. Speaking personally, I can hardly wait for my own very backward global financial institution Citibank to adopt voice biometrics and spare me from excessive keystrokes and frequent frustration.Nuance continues to enjoy expanded penetration in terms of what it calls omni-channel cloud offerings that involve automated customer engagement processes. Essentially, these kinds of solutions use some level of AI to automate the call center and avoid some of the tedious menus one is forced to navigate when trying to use prior-generation customer service operations. I have been surprised that it has taken as long as it has for these solutions to be adopted, as they are potentially such a powerful competitive tool for companies that pioneer deployment - but perhaps the issue of customization has been a greater barrier than I might have expected.The other high-growth business segment for this company last quarter was Mobile, which continued to see both reported revenue growth and bookings growth. Within Mobile, Nuance continues to see both expanding customer acquisition and deepening engagement in its automotive solutions. As with almost every other software business, AI, in this case as part of the company’s Dragon Drive, HMI (human/machine interface) set of customized offerings, has proven to be to have a significant positive impact on demand, as it offers vehicle producers ways of differentiating their offerings to improve the experience of drivers.The company is still in the process of reaching a meaningful level of revenues from its IoT/Smart Home products. Yes, the era of talking to appliances has dawned, for better or for worse, and many TV vendors have already integrated voice capabilities in their higher-end offerings. I have, personally, yet to talk to my TV - but then again, I suppose I might be considered anti-social. Over time, it is reasonable to project that the use of voice technology as part of smart homes will ultimately have a noticeable impact on the revenue growth rate of Nuance.The malware incident was estimated to have cost the company about $15 million, or 3% of non-GAAP revenues in the just-reported quarter. EPS was estimated to have been impacted by $.03/share, or about 10% of the reported earnings number, because of the malware attack. The malware incident was specifically reflected in the 3-year total of on-demand contracts, which fell from the record level achieved last quarter. Overall, the attack on Nuance’s HIM transcription network has probably speeded up the continuing migration to the company’s Dragon Medical cloud solutions.There has been much written about the Malware incident, both in terms of the technical process of the attack as well as its impact on Nuance. I certainly do not purport to have the knowledge as to whether the company should have been better fortified to deal with the attack or have had better strategies to restore service to its users in the wake of the attack. That is not really a useful discussion for current and prospective stockholders. At this point, the hack of the customer order entry process in Nuance’s Imaging business has been mitigated. At this point, most, but not perhaps all, of the company’s transcription network has been restored to the level of functionality that existed before the attack.The costs of the attack are going to be seen in Nuance’s Q4 operational performance. The company will lose about $75 million of revenue in Q4 because of the loss of transcription volume and the grant of credits to current customers. That represents more than 15% of total revenues that had been expected in the company's medical business and probably represents almost 30% of the revenues it had expected from medical transcription services.Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be impacted by about $.12 in the 4th quarter, which is something on the range of 35% of the EPS that might otherwise have been anticipated. These losses will be reflected in cash flow from operations (CFFO) and will fall in the 4th quarter. Not only have revenues been impacted, but inevitably some collections have been delayed and are not likely to be entirely mitigated during the current fiscal year.Some losses from the breach are expected to impact the results of the following fiscal year, although self-evidently, they will make comparisons easier in the last two quarters of the year. The company is now projecting that the losses in transcription revenues for the upcoming fiscal year will be about 3.5% of total anticipated revenues. The impact on year-to-year comparisons overall using that projection will be about 1% - positive! The overall revenue loss, as projected, is expected to impact operating profits by $25 million, and that would have a net after-tax EPS impact of $.05-.06 at the current non-GAAP tax rate and using the company’s current estimated diluted share count of 296 million.I think at this point it might be useful to consider just what investors might actually expect in terms of operational performance both this current quarter and through 2018. Needless to say, and as highlighted by the linked article, inevitably Nuance will lose some market share in transcription to competitors, and it will accelerate the decline in medical transcription revenues through conversion to Dragon Medical. I think it is likely, in a situation in which visibility is foggy at best, that the company will have erred on the side of conservatism in setting investor expectations. As I tried to illustrate above, Nuance is actually forecasting a reduction in its organic growth projection net of the attack, and yet it was quite evident, simply from having listened to the conference call, not the impression the company is trying to provide.At the end of the day, and despite the overall impact of the malware impact, the company actually raised its bookings growth target for the full year, primarily because of overperformance during the first 3 quarters of the year. Comparisons in Q4 for bookings were always going to be tough because of the 45% bookings growth seen in that quarter in the year-earlier period. Nuance typically does see some super-sized transactions in every quarter, and that was certainly the case in Q3. I think on evaluating the state of the pipeline, and based on strong sales momentum in many areas of Nuance’s business, it seems likely that the company will see some, although very modest, growth in Q4 bookings, which will push full-year growth to about 10%.I think I ought to start by saying that the absence of Carl Icahn as a shareholder and his board presence is something to be considered in evaluating the overall outlook. Icahn is who he is, and he clearly was a factor in constraining opex growth for this company and keeping it focused more on margin improvement than on growth optimization. While that doesn’t mean that the opex spigots have been turned back on to any substantial degree, this company is a bit more likely now to increase its opex expenditures than might have been the case a year ago. Contrariwise, I imagine Nuance will probably show a bit faster top line growth than it has projected.I would, at this point, normally review some of the operating expense metrics in some detail. That probably does not make sense in the wake of the hack, which will lead to some material increases in expense ratios over the next two-three quarters. Even with the impact of the hack, Nuance was able to sustain gross margins levels on a GAAP basis in the just reported quarter. The company reported a modestly higher level of GAAP losses primarily because of amortization, restructuring and acquisition-related costs which are not included in non-GAAP EPS calculations.Again, for the just-reported quarter, GAAP opex ratios were slightly lower than in the year-earlier period. The company’s operating cash flow improved marginally in Q3 compared to the year-earlier period, primarily because of better collections and other balance sheet items.Nuance, as part of its review of the impact of the NotPetya hack, provided a perspective on top line and earnings expectations for fiscal 2018 that I have detailed earlier in this article. Those projections are now embedded in the consensus. I think the estimates are likely to be noticeably lower than probably makes sense.As mentioned earlier in this article, the company is suggesting that the impact of the breach will diminish next year, from about $90 million in revenue loss for this fiscal year to about $70 million. So, that is basically a 1% revenue tailwind which was simply not considered in the guidance provided for revenue growth in fiscal 2018. And one might question just how realistic the $70 million estimate might be for lost revenues. If one tries to disaggregate the sums, the conclusion is that management thinks it will lose a significant proportion of its medical transcription business more or less permanently.Management was not really questioned about the basis for its projections on the call, and I certainly have no way of knowing if its projections regarding permanent market share loss are realistic. By all accounts, the hack was one of those unforeseen events that was more on the lines of an act of nature than something that could reasonably have been anticipated and planned for. It would appear that the company restored service rapidly, issued substantial credits to users (part of the $70 million revenue loss projected for fiscal 2018), and offered users a highly reduced cost option to migrate to cloud-based Dragon Medical - the latter being the company’s longer-term strategy in any event. Nuance had said that prior to the malware attack, Dragon Medical cloud growth would have exceeded the decline in medical transcription. It has also said that its revenue loss estimate for the next fiscal year does not include any accelerated revenue growth from medical cloud bookings.The company also suggested that next year’s loss of revenue would take down operating margins by 100 basis points, and that is the expectation that is in the consensus estimates published on Firstcall. While I have no specific knowledge to dispute the company’s estimates, it is just as well to remember that Nuance had restored 90% of the annualized volume of lines transcribed by the end of last month. Most of the other services were actually restored earlier in July. According to the company, in a press release issued independently of the earnings call, no Nuance customer data has been altered, lost or removed by the malware. The company said that the ""Use of Nuance’s Dragon Medical One product has increased among clients seeking an alternative for physicians to capture patient documentation. The PowerScribe and Dragon Medical One solutions were not impacted by the June 27 incident and have remained available to our customers.""Healthcare has been the largest business at Nuance for some years. But transcription revenues have been falling for some time now. The company does not detail the breakout between transcription and cloud in medical, but given that the total run rate for medical revenues is around $900 million, it seems as though the company is estimating an impact of well more than 10% on its transcription business. That seems to be a very aggressive estimate of the longer-term impact on its malware business.Investors/analysts have never quite received some formula for translating bookings growth into revenue growth. As best as can be determined, about 30% of bookings turn into revenues in the first 12 months, another 30% turn into revenues in the 2nd year, with 90% of bookings recorded as revenue by the end of 5 years. So far this year, booking growth has been at quite elevated levels and has exceeded management expectations. That really was true in this past quarter as well, with bookings growth rising by more than 20% year on year. The company is forecasting that bookings growth will be nominal in the current quarter, because last year included some very large deals that drove bookings growth up 45% year over year.One of the things that have happened this year, not just for this company but for almost all enterprise software vendors, is that users have been willing to invest in larger projects than has been the case for several years now. Nuance has the kinds of solutions that lend themselves to super-size transactions. The large biometric deal with a financial institution is typical of some of the projects for which Nuance competes. It would be hardly be surprising to find that the company wound up closing some extra-large transactions in fiscal Q4, and those transactions are not part of the current bookings forecast.Last year, in the wake of the huge Q4 bookings attainment, bookings grew 4%. This year they are expected to grow 10%, and they will presumably grow by some noticeable level in fiscal 2018, although the company hasn’t yet forecast that specific number. So, I am inclined to believe that with the current level of bookings growth forecast, coupled with the conservative composition of the forecast, the company should be able to achieve greater than a 2-4% increase in revenues next year, and that in turn should lead to operating margins exceeding those the company used in its presentation this quarter.When I consider the various puts and takes of the both the malware incident and the basic demand drivers for this business, I am inclined to believe that the current set-up presents investors with an environment in which it is more likely than not that Nuance will be in a position to beat expectations and raise its forecast over the coming quarters, and because of the malware impact, the base of expectations is quite low.How much are Nuance shares worth? Many retail investors have little confidence in the management of this business and particularly in the company’s CEO, Paul Ricci. Mr. Ricci has received generous, not to say obscene, compensation for his services, and investors have not achieved positive returns. There is a fundamental unfairness in that, and one that is really not easy to accept.By all accounts, Nuance had been on the receiving end of offers from a variety of enterprise IT vendors over the years. But it seems likely that there was no reasonable interest from potential acquirers during the period (4/13-5/17) in which Icahn was invested in this company.And the company hasn’t really been able to monetize much of its technology in a time frame that has produced decent headline results. At some point, investors want to see headline revenue and earnings growth, and while there are many green shoots in that regard, the buds certainly haven’t flowered. To say that Nuance as an investment has been star-crossed would be an understatement - and being star-crossed weighs on valuation.With those kinds of headwinds, it might be expected that valuation for Nuance is likely be to reflect some level of negative emotion. In other words, it will take more growth and more earnings to move these shares than would otherwise be the case.And that leads to a discussion of just how fast this company really might be growing. I have tried to do the best I could to remove what at the end of the day is a one-time event in making an assessment regarding its current and projected operational performance.As is the case for many older software vendors, Nuance has a business segment in decline - medical transcription - and most of the rest of the business has recently experienced double-digit growth. As mentioned earlier, I have commented on Nuance several times in the past - not perhaps the most edifying experience in the world. Over that period of time, the problem has been that the fall in the company’s boat declining segments has outdueled the growth businesses in a quantitative sense. According to management on the last call, that had been set to change this past quarter. Whether that is true or not specifically, it does seem likely now that the true growth rate of Nuance is going to be emerging in the coming months.An interesting omission in the conference call last quarter was commentary about declines in its handset business. Nuance’s mobile business expanded at rates a bit greater than had been previously projected, and the company continued to enjoy success with service providers as well as with the automotive suppliers whose revenue is included in this segment.Nuance has had a smaller boat anchor in its imaging division, and that division suffered noticeably from the malware attack. But management has said that the pipeline is growing in that business, and that it should be stable in fiscal 2018. Imaging is its smallest business and really has very tenuous connections with the rest of the company’s offerings. It does not seem to this writer to be an optimal strategic allocation of capital. Regardless, it seems likely that the boat anchor effect of this division will not be noticeable going forward.Where all that leaves me is to expect that this company can, and is likely to, achieve high-single digit growth spearheaded by enterprise, automotive, IoT offerings and Dragon Medical in the cloud. That is probably a level of growth that is greater than reflected by the current share valuation.Currently, based on the data in the last earnings release, Nuance has 288 million outstanding shares. Overall, outstanding shares have increased modestly. The company is forecasting a 2.3% increase in outstanding shares going forward, and I will use that forecast in developing valuation metrics. It has a current market cap of just less than $4.8 billion. The company has net debt of $1.7 billion. Its enterprise value is $6.5 billion. The consensus revenue estimates for the next twelve months are about $2 billion. So, the EV/S is a bit over 3.2X. That multiple is reasonable if the company can’t grow more than 2-4% and is quite a bargain if it can attain high-single digit growth.Non-GAAP consensus earnings estimates for the next 12 months, based on the projections portrayed by the Firstcall consensus, and which include some level of cost for the hack, are about $1.15 per share. This number includes the impact of losses from the hack, and is therefore less than a reasonably anticipated level of earnings subsequent to the impact of the hack and its remediation. Besides the hack, there are many adjustments in the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP which I will not discuss at this point, but currently, net of taxes, stock-based comp represents about 25% of reported non-GAAP EPS.I would be surprised if Nuance didn’t over-attain its EPS projection in a noticeable fashion. But in any event, it has a P/E on the consensus earnings projection of less than 14X. That is probably less than a typical number, even for IT vendors expecting modest growth, and reflects investor disenchantment with the many stumbles of this company.The company’s cash flow was and will be impacted by the malware attack. Overall, the difference between non-GAAP EPS and CFFO is going to be the change in deferred revenues as well as any other changes in the balance sheet. The deferred revenue balance has been showing consistent year-on-year growth and is now up almost 10% year to date. That is part of the difference between reported revenue growth and bookings growth. I think a projection for CFFO in the range of $400 million for the next 12 months is a reasonable expectation. At that level, and with capex running at about a $60 million annual rate, the company would have free cash flow of $340 million. It would produce a free cash flow yield of greater than 5%, and adjusted for the impact of the malware attack, the free cash flow yield would be greater than 6%. That, again, is about consistent with numbers that could be expected for the modest growth the company has forecast and is quite a bargain if the company can reach high-single digit growth with continued modest margin expansion.Nuance shares have pulled back by about 14% since the malware attack was first announced. If it proves to be a one-time event, as I believe, the pullback has provided investors with an excellent entry point. But in addition to the pullback since the announcement of the hack attack, the company announced a very strong quarter in terms of its ongoing operations and essentially raised guidance when looked at on a holistic basis. Owning NUAN shares has not been a pleasant experience for most investors, including this writer, and I do not currently have a position in the name. But I think the balance of risk and reward is strongly weighted in favor of investors at this point."
4047937,102470,2017-02-21T14:17:34-05:00,Nuance has been a disappointment in recent years.Transition to a recurring revenue based model appears to be paying off.Earnings are forecast to rise going forward; CEO to retire in 2018.,"IntroductionNuance Communications (NASDAQ: NUAN) has been a disappointment for shareholders in recent years.Despite enjoying a dominant position in the fast-growing niche field of voice recognition systems, management have been unable to unlock shareholder value, with Nuance's share price falling from over $30 three years ago to under $16 today.Nuance has been transitioning to a recurring revenue based business model over the last few years, and while earnings have suffered in the process, it appears that the transition may finally be starting to pay off.In this article I present a concise investment analysis of the company, and look at whether blue skies are finally on the horizon for the voice recognition specialist.Company Description$4.6bn market cap Nuance Communications is a leading provider of voice and language solutions for businesses and consumers around the world.The company's products include speech recognition systems, embedded systems used in applications such as automobiles and consumer electronics, and dictation systems.Nuance sells directly and through distributors and serves clients in a range of industries, including healthcare, financial services and telecommunications. Approximately 70% of the company's sales are generated in the US, with notable clients including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Ford (NYSE:F), Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS). Nearly two-thirds of Fortune 100 companies use Nuance products and more than 10,000 hospitals in the US use Nuance healthcare solutions. The company has regional offices in 35 countries and approximately 14,000 employees.In 2011, Nuance reorganized its segment configuration into four key groups: healthcare, mobile, enterprise and imaging. Healthcare is the largest segment, generating 50% of sales, while the mobile segment is responsible for approximately 20% of sales.Nuance has a history of making acquisitions, and while this has boosted revenue in recent years, the benefits have not always flowed through to the bottom line.Financial & RatiosThe table above shows that while revenue has grown from $1318.7m in FY2011 to $1979.6m in FY2016, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.5%, earnings growth has not been as impressive.Indeed, after generating diluted earnings per share (EPS) (Non GAAP) of $1.73 in FY2012, earnings fell heavily in FY2013 and FY2014, and were negative between FY2013 and FY2015 on a GAAP basis.Analysts covering Nuance currently forecast Non GAAP earnings of $1.59 and $1.68 for FY2017 and FY2018 respectively, meaning that the company trades on a forward looking price to earnings (P/E) ratio of just 9.97, falling to 9.43 for FY2018.It's worth noting that net debt has crept up in recent years, as a result of both acquisitions and stock buybacks and consequently the company's net debt/equity ratio has increased from 15.3% in FY2011 to 94.5% in FY2016.Fourth quarter earnings / 2016 results announced on 17 November 2016 showed signs of improvement, with the company reporting record net new bookings of $516.9m, up an impressive 45%, revenue of $512.4m, and non GAAP diluted EPS of 41 cents per share for the quarter.For the full year, revenue came in at $1979.6m, including recurring revenue of 70%, an increase of 400 basis points on the year before, and diluted EPS were $1.52.The company also generated record cash from operations of $565.8m for FY2016, up 16% on the previous year.In GAAP terms, fourth quarter and full year earnings were 6 cents -4 cents respectively.CFO Dan Tempesta was upbeat about the results, stating:""We remain focused on our cost discipline and transitioning the business towards recurring revenue models, while strengthening our competitive position in important markets through our investments in innovation and additional offerings. We believe last year's groundwork positions us well for organic growth in fiscal 2017 and beyond.""The market responded positively to the results, with the stock jumping as high as 12% on the day.Bull CaseAfter years of shareholder disappointment could Nuance Communications finally be turning things around?Fourth quarter results certainly showed glimpses of a turnaround, with the 45% increase in net new bookings standing out as a key highlight. Recurring revenue of 70% was another highlight, and this should ensure that revenues have an element of consistency going forward. Other positives include the considerable cash flow the company is generating and management's upbeat tone in regard to the future.Of Nuance's four segments, the area that looks to have the most compelling growth prospects is the mobile segment. This segment provides a broad portfolio of specialized virtual assistants and connected services built on voice recognition, text-to-speech, natural language understanding and text input technologies, and a vast range of applications could benefit from Nuance's technology.Customers are looking for a convenient, connected and more human experience from their phones, tablets, computers, automobiles, TVs and wearables, and as a result, demand for Nuance's technology should be strong in coming years.Another plus is the fact that CEO Paul Ricci is set to retire during the fiscal 2018 year. To say that Ricci has not impressed as CEO is an understatement - he's managed the distinction of landing on Fox Business' "" Worst CEOs"" list multiple times. Ricci has been vastly overpaid, given the misery that long term shareholders have endured, and I have no doubt that most investors will be pleased to see him go.Sell side analyst sentiment towards Nuance is largely positive at present, with broker Raymond James placing a ' strong buy' and price target of $24 on the stock, and analysts at Craig-Hallum Capital Group and Barclays having price targets of $23 and $19 respectively.On a P/E ratio of under 10, Nuance does not look expensive.Bear CaseThere are several risk factors that investors should be mindful of.While fourth quarter earnings showed signs of progress, we need to see more evidence that earnings are on an upward trajectory. Debt levels are also a factor to keep in mind. Nuance's net debt to equity ratio now stands at 94.5% after rising considerably on the back of acquisitions and stock buybacks, and this should be monitored going forward.ChartThe five-year chart is not impressive, with the share price falling from over $30 in February 2012, to just over $13 in November 2016.However the stock spiked higher after the fourth quarter results, and has risen above the 50-day exponential moving average (EMA), suggesting that this could be the beginning of an upwards trend for Nuance. If the 50-day EMA can cross the 200-day EMA that would be a positive signal.Conclusion"
4026624,22786,2016-11-28T10:16:01-05:00,Nuance Communications reported strong quarter results with record bookings.Sales to medical community jumped on strong Dragon cloud sales.Company well-positioned to raise gross margins and grow profits next year.,"Every week, I look at a handful of cheap stocks and do the research to decide if they are value stocks or value traps. As the company that became best known for powering Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri voice recognition technology, Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) looked like a value trap. The stock bottomed at $13.44 in early November but surged after reporting quarterly results. Record new bookings, a management change, and disciplined cost controls suggest Nuance will hold its gains. Although I would caution investors from chasing the stock today, those seeking value should take a closer look again at this company.There are four reasons Nuance is no longer a value trap.Before starting, readers should know what a value trap is. Per Investopedia, ""a value trap is a stock that appears to be cheap because the stock has been trading at low multiples of earnings, cash flow or book value for an extended time period. Stock traps attract investors who are looking for a bargain because these stocks are inexpensive."" Nuance trades at a forward P/E of 10 times and has a P/FCF that is also under 10 times (orange line):NUAN data by YCharts1/ New CEOThe Board of Directors extended Nuance's current CEO's tenure through March 2018, but after that, he will retire. The leadership change accelerates CEO Paul Ricci's business transformation plans. The company already invested in sales, services, and made moves to strengthen operating along vertical markets. The record net new bookings in the fourth quarter is a testament to those investments paying off. Net bookings grew 45 percent year-over-year. Nuance generated revenue of $512.4 million.2/ Revenue Acceleration in health care and automotiveNuance's competitive position improved after the company won and secured new businesses across all segments. Health care, a unit that lagged for several quarters, benefited with the highest net new bookings. The company won customers through its release of Dragon Medical Advisor, an AI Assistant for doctors.Dragon Medical's success mirrors that of Adobe moving its Creative Suite to the cloud. With Dragon Medical cloud, Nuance benefited from a sharp increase in customer bookings. Bundling the solution further drove revenue bookings in the quarter.Nuance won BMW's business for its Dragon TV product. Together with Dragon Medical, voice biometrics, and unified print and scan, Nuance forecasts organic growth of around 1 percent for this fiscal year. Health care and Enterprise will drive the net new bookings and place the company for higher growth next fiscal year.Investors should take note that the growth forecast is for the full year, not for the next few quarters. The fourth quarter benefited from seasonal strength. Nuance may beats earnings expectations next quarter if customers finalize orders earlier than Nuance expects. Nuance cautioned analysts to look at bookings from a fiscal year timeframe instead of quarterly.3/ Moat in speech recognitionGoogle's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) move to open up its API will not harm Nuance's moat in its speech recognition technology. Just like Rackspace's specializing in cloud computing but unharmed by Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Nuance specializes in selling to global brands, health care, and large corporations. These customers are not adopting Google's free API for its business needs.4/ Growth drivers accelerating in 2017Building from a strong fiscal fourth quarter, Nuance is positioned to benefit from an increase in demand for computing power in automobiles. It may lever the customer service solutions, such as automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and natural language understanding to power to the car market.TakeawayNuance's fourth quarter demonstrated its R&D investments are paying off. Losses shrank considerably to $12.5 million (""GAAP"") in the last quarter, compared to a loss of $115 million in the year-ago period. Operating margin more than doubled to 7.1 percent. Cost controls, lower sales and marketing costs, and a drop in R&D spend contributed to the better results. With customer sales picking up, Nuance's stock represents value for investors looking to buy a company that is growing again.If you liked this article, please [+]Follow me for continued coverage on companies with a busted business model and are about to turn around.

4045393,98236,2017-02-13T12:44:24-05:00,"Nuance reported the results of its fiscal Q1 late last week.The headline numbers were basically in line, bookings numbers were a strong beat and management chose to give voice to optimism that it could beat formal guidance.The company saw very strong bookings performance in the key healthcare vertical with triple-digit bookings growth for its flagship product.The company continues to land key customers in another important segment, automotive.The company had a very strong quarter, more or less across the board in its enterprise segment that saw strong bookings and a 27% increase in revenues.","Nuance finally shows more than a couple of green shootsNuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) is a story of a turnaround that has been never-ending and which has more ups and downs than the weather around here. If you live on the east coast, you get accustomed to false springs. On Wednesday, it reached 62F here, and a particular kind of bush whose name I do not know came into bloom with little yellow blossoms. Ah, but the climate here is as tricky as the stock market, and just a few hours later a blizzard raged and yet the next day it was back to 50F and sunshine. That is a good metaphor for the story of Nuance - except that it appears that the clouds are finally rolling back and a few green shoots have taken hold. Two quarters in a row of strong bookings and guidance that suggest that a warming trend has started. A beat on revenue. There is still plenty to accomplish, but this seems to be a start.In terms of headline numbers, the company reported a small revenue beat which represented modest year-on-year growth. EPS at $.35 was in line, but many of the analysts that cover the name responded to stronger guidance by raising their own estimates. The big news, and the most important sign of business health, was that the company reported the second strong bookings quarter in a row. Bookings were particularly strong in the company's healthcare and mobile verticals. Bookings were up 23% compared to the prior period in fiscal 2016 after a quarter in which bookings were at all-time record levels. It's the 2-quarter performance as much as anything else that gives me some encouragement.In addition to the strength in bookings, recurring revenues have now reached 73% of the total, up 600 bps compared to the prior-year period. Basically, the increase in recurring revenues has now become large enough to offset the decline in perpetual revenues which have declined to 16% of the total from 24% a year earlier and to much higher percentages over the past several years. Although the company's headline revenue metrics showed no growth year on year, the fact that it was able to transition to a more ratable model and still keep reported revenues at levels consistent with year-earlier performance suggests significant improvements in the company's business.As part of the overall strength in bookings, the company's 3-year value of on-demand contracts reached $2.5 billion. That increase of 11% is in contrast to many years, including the prior fiscal year, in which that metric was unchanged or declined.Although the results for the period were stronger than planned, the company still reported declines in EPS and in cash flow from operations (CFFO) compared to the results in the prior year. The decline in gross margins relates to the continued transition to recurring revenue streams, including hosting which have lower gross profits than perpetual license in their initial quarter. But a novelty for me, in the years of suffering I have had in covering the company, is that management is forecasting that its planned cost abatement strategy will be strong enough during the balance of the year such that full-year margins will reach the levels of fiscal 2016,Margins also were impacted by interest costs, although the impact was not huge. The company sold $300 million last June to finance the share repurchases from Icahn. Outstanding shares are down to 289 million which compares to 308 million shares outstanding a year ago. In all, interest costs increased by $8 million, impacting the P&L by about 6%-7% after taxes and offsetting the 6% decline in outstanding shares.Management, in its prepared call remarks, said that ""we are executing on a number of additional margin improvement initiatives that will manifest in our financials in 2H '17 and FY '18."" Yes, that represents a substantial change from the Nuance of yore which would miss, and then offer little in the way of explanation regarding how the miss would be made up.The company is forecasting EPS of $.36-$.40 for the current quarter which brackets the current consensus expectation of EPS of $.38. Management is also forecasting that full-year EPS will be between $1.53 and $1.63, which also exactly brackets the prior analyst consensus.The company's revenue forecasts for both Q2 and for the full year are also consistent with prior analyst expectations. While this forecast is not exuberant by any means (3% revenue growth is anything but exuberant), at least it is growth. Bookings growth of 2%-6% for the year is also modest, particularly since it includes the 23% growth for the past quarter. That said, however, the comparison with bookings in Q4 2016 when the metric grew by 45% to a record level, are a high bar for the company. During the course of the conference call, management suggested that another quarter of decent business results, an outcome that it said is a potential, would lead to a formal positive revaluation of guidance metrics.Is there anyone out there who cares?Nuance shares have been little better than dead money the past year or so and these days they come with lots of skepticism regarding future growth and overall operating performance, a sentiment that is shared by this author.Because of the skepticism, the shares have been unable to react substantially to good news and are sensitive to disappointments. The shares appreciated about 5% in the wake of the quarterly earnings release despite the upside to bookings and management's positive commentary about the business outlook. Most analysts simply find anything too positive that the company CEO, Paul Ricci, might say to have credibility issues. There are more than a few commentators, including this author, who simply find that Mr. Ricci has not given good value for money.Overall, the shares are down 5% from a year earlier levels, although up 36% over the past two years, while the IGV is up by 42% in the last 12 months and up 27% over two years. Nuance shares are not anthropomorphic creatures. If the company delivers on its operational goals, the shares will go up - they have and will do so again. The problem has been the 4 years of operational stagnation, at least on the headline level.There are some favorable metrics to consider at this point in evaluating the company's chances for achieving positive alpha. One is valuation which is plumbing some significant depths at this point. I will come back to that subject in more detail a bit later on. Partly as a result of the valuation, the short interest is low. That can, of course, cut two ways, but many investors are reluctant to enter controversial names with a substantial short interest, believing that hedge funds, in particular, which bet against a company do so with an informational edge.Analyst opinion is somewhat split on the name with 3 holds, 3 buys and 3 strong buys and a price target of about $21. There is plenty of room for both favorable coverage from new analysts (only 9 analysts report their estimates and opinions to First Call at this point) and higher ratings on the part of existing coverage. Over the past year, it has sustained a substantial amount of selling by former lead shareholder Carl Icahn. In all, Mr. Icahn sold more than 30 million shares, or more than half of his total position, last year at prices around $20. It isn't totally surprising, as was pointed out at the time by SA contributor Mark Chapman, to have seen Nuance shares under pressure even though the company essentially bought most of Icahn's shares.At current prices, the shares clearly are going to screen well for potential P/E buyers. Whether there will be some rumors with regards to a consolidation, or whether a P/E firm might want to take on a complicated company as this one is, is hard to evaluate.Sometimes investors are willing to give companies the benefit of the doubt or to overlook disappointing business metrics. I am not inclined to believe that has been or will be the case for Nuance. The shares will not be ignored particularly, but investors and analysts will value the name based exclusively on signs of improving year-on-year business performance. The company is going to need to beat estimates/guidance if it is to produce positive alpha in the balance of the year.Beating estimates - not something this company has been able to do consistentlyNuance is a very complicated company to look at because it has so many moving parts, and the trends in one of those parts are not necessarily related to trends in other business segments. That may be surprising to some readers, and Nuance is a company based on speech, at least at some level, but the functionality of one business segment is not really related to the functionality of other segments. Put that together with a steady, but unevenly sequenced transition to hosted and other ratable revenue sources, and it becomes close to impossible to see consistent trends on a quarterly basis.Overall, it can be difficult to form a judgment as to how well the company is going to do in a quarter - indeed, bookings results appear to be more basically random, albeit around a trend line quarter to quarter. As mentioned earlier in the article, bookings in the last two quarters have been strong and have driven the 3-year contract value in backlog to record levels. That means it is unlikely that the company will miss headline numbers even if conditions in its markets deteriorate the next couple of quarters.Management doesn't try to forecast quarterly bookings, clearly a prudent practice. But I am not too sure that the shares will show a significant response to the company simply making its forecast bookings target growth for the balance of the fiscal year. Investors at this point want to see some substantive growth beyond flat reported revenues and earnings comparisons for the balance of the year. Q1 bookings growth was 23% and the company is forecasting that full-year bookings growth will be just 2%-6%. Part of that forecast is due to the outsize results of Q4 2016 during which bookings grew by 45% to an all-time record level. But part of the forecast also suggests that neither Q2 or Q3 are going to see any significant bookings growth either.Management chose to say that while it was not prepared to change its formal forecast, it could see opportunities for an upside and would change its forecast in the wake of another strong bookings quarter. There are several opportunities that appear to have reasonable potential upsides beyond the current forecast cadence.Most important to me, and perhaps most likely is the healthcare business segment. Nuance, despite its many different major business lines, continues to generate almost 50% of its revenues from its healthcare related solutions. Were one to try to encapsulate the reasons for the disappointing business metrics for this company over the past few years, one would not have to look further than healthcare as a principle villain. The company actually has a reasonable strategy to develop healthcare revenues, I think, but that strategy has been masked from view by the continued and steep erosion of the company's medical transcription business. The decline has gone on longer and has certainly been steeper than anything I anticipated.If an investor wanted to focus on one telling commentary this quarter in the prepared call remarks that may have marked a milestone, it was that management is now forecasting that the healthcare sector will grow in fiscal year 2018 as the growth in Dragon Medical surpasses the decline in the transcription business. And the qualitative comments of CEO Ricci suggested that the change to growth could come in the current fiscal year.The consensus forecast for Nuance's revenue growth in fiscal 2018 (starts 11/1/17) is 3%, unchanged from the forecast for revenue growth in the current year. The flip from 4% revenue decline currently forecast by management in the current fiscal year to growth in fiscal 2018 will add at least 300 bps to growth, and quite possibly more than that, and that, if it occurs, would significantly change how this company is perceived, I believe.Last quarter, Dragon Medical, historically a desktop application that facilitates voice to text automated medical transcriptions, grew by 126% year on year. At this point, the majority of Dragon's units are shipped on a subscription basis, reversing historical trends, which is one reason why the reported revenues in medical are falling despite the oversize increase in Dragon units that were booked last quarter.There is minimal competition in the market for Dragon, and the barriers to entry, given the specialized vocabularies that are necessary for most use cases, are very high. The rapid growth in Dragon Medical suggests that a tipping point has been reached and that most physicians and healthcare professionals have decided that the economics of the solution are compelling vs. outsourced transcription procedures. Of course, that is an issue for Nuance in that it is one of the main providers of those outsourced transcription services.What is happening, in essence, is that Nuance is losing its customers in transcription services while selling more Dragon Medical. In the long run, it is a good trade as Dragon Medical has a market share of close to 100% in its space, while Nuance has a far lower market share in transcription services. But the average cost of those transcription services is several times the cost of Dragon Medical, and more than that if Dragon Medical revenues are recognized ratably. But at 126% growth in unit shipments, it is obvious that Nuance is reaching a tipping point in which Dragon Medical's growth outweighs the declines in medical transcription revenues.In addition to Dragon Medical, the company is focused on selling its integrated offerings that include both Dragon medical and clinical information solutions. What Nuance calls Clintegrity is one of those solution sets that has been around for a while but just now seems to be taking off. Its potential broad scale acceptance beyond present forecasts is a potential positive that is probably not embedded in the company's forecast. The Nuance suite of healthcare solutions has a very high ROI that is easy to document. It should have grown faster, sooner and honestly this current management team could have done a better job in managing a transition from transcription solution revenues to software given that market trends have been visible for years now. But if there is a single potential area in which the company can show upside breakout results, it would most likely be healthcare and that is one reason why some of the metrics in Q1 were far more exciting than the overall headline numbers.There are several other potential break-out areas for this company that are worth mentioning. Mobile technologies represent 18% of revenue. The Mobile business segment houses two very different business elements. One of these is automotive which has been a growth driver for some time and which has been and remains a significant component of the growth in bookings. Last quarter, the company won deals at Panasonic, Toyota, Peugeot and Harman, all for different forms of entertainment applications within the car. The potential impacts that Nuance may garner as autonomous vehicles edge closer to introduction have yet to be seen. Right now, vehicle manufacturers and their OEMs are most concerned about providing voice activated entertainment experiences for passengers as a competitive differentiator and Nuance has a high market share of that business.The problem for Nuance in Mobile is that a significant amount of its revenues comes from selling basic voice technology to the makers of devices/handsets. The number of devices that incorporate Nuance technology is not growing. The prices are declining. The results… well, that is why segment revenue declined 5%.Over time, the growth in recurring revenues from automotive is highly likely to grow faster than the decline in device revenue. The company has some hope that device revenue might stabilize as the year progresses. It has already taken longer for that to happen than I might have anticipated. The connected car is a reality and Nuance is benefiting materially from its position in that area. But it is all ratable revenue that increases in dollars more slowly so far, than device revenue has declined.The business that continues to surprise to the upside has been enterprise. Enterprise grew by 27% in revenue last quarter and was 100%+ the reason that Nuance enjoyed a revenue beat. There are many reasons for growth in enterprise, some quite mundane, others more leading edge. My two favorites - as a consumer as much as anything else - are voice biometrics and what Nuance calls customer engagement.If you have ever called your bank or your wireless provider, or your credit card company and gotten involved in a dialog with a customer service representative, you have been inevitably asked inane questions about where you grew up, your favorite food or where you went to high school. And woe to you if the answer is even slightly different than registered. It is more or less like playing Jeopardy except the only prize you win is you have the dubious privilege of continuing to try to resolve problems with a befuddled CSR.I have failed the test - recently in fact - but soon the test will be ending at Sprint (NYSE:S), my mobile service provider which is scheduled to install voice biometric recognition to replace the questions. Other major wins last quarter for biometric technology included Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and Medicare/Medicaid. I think it is fair to say that over time, the penetration of voice biometric technology for authentication purposes will reach 100%. Customers like it better (not a very high bar) and it is obviously far less expensive to use than to have an agent ask questions.At this point, the company is just starting to see interest in what it describes as advanced customer engagement that combines virtual assists, artificial intelligence and analytics. In plain English, that means solutions that significantly add to the intelligence in a call center (not a very high bar as most of us know from frustrating personal experience).This technology pioneered at Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with Siri was more of a development project than anything else from the point of view of Nuance. A few years later, Nuance introduced its Nina, its customizable virtual agent, and with that technology now coupled with AI and analytics, the number of potential applications has expanded exponentially. The deals that include several components of Nuance technology have the potential to be enormous and transformative for users in terms of how they are able to manage customer experiences. That means the sales cycles will almost certainly be lengthy.Initially, many sales cycles will start as next generation call centers, but the opportunity is far greater than that. In fact, management talked about the recrudescence in demand for call centers as a factor in last quarter's performance in enterprise. The opportunity Nuance has in this segment is perhaps as large as any other opportunity in the company in terms of its potential to contribute to revenue growth.The nice thing about the enterprise sector is that there is not a boat anchor inhibiting reported growth. Next generation call centers have replaced initial call center technology and are still showing accelerating growth and whatever happens with Omni-channel and eventually with advanced customer engagement transactions will add to growth. So, Enterprise is already growing rapidly and could be a source for breakthrough growth going forward.Nuance did not forecast specific growth percentages for Enterprise, perhaps because the strong results of the past quarter were a surprise to management and may not be repeated in the next couple of quarters. The Enterprise segment has seen 7 consecutive quarters of sequential growth at various percentages. I suspect that the transition to voice biometrics will proceed very rapidly because of its relevance to the customer experience as a competitive differentiator.The fact is that there are several roads to glory for Nuance as my southern relations might say. Nuance's management provided a forecast that has been adopted as the consensus by analysts. It has also suggested that it has the opportunity to over-attain that forecast, but few observers are going to expose themselves to slings and arrows by suggesting that such a result is likely. The odds are, however, that something will go right for the company and it will wind up over-attaining its forecast for bookings and perhaps over-attaining revenue and earnings expectations as well.Over time, Nuance ought to evolve into a solid double-digit growth business. None of that, however, suggests that fiscal Q2 is going to be anything other than what the company said it might be. Investors who buy the shares at this point should be doing so because they believe that there is a high probability for Nuance to attain the formal guidance the balance of the year and a reasonable probability that the company will over-attain its current bookings targets and perhaps will then beat current consensus forecasts for both revenues and EPS. I do believe that the company has embarked on a course that should lead to consistent double-digit top line growth some time in the fiscal 2018 year coupled with higher margins. That package is, I think, worth more than what investors are paying for Nuance shares at the moment and reflects impatience with turnaround and some basic lack of trust of any positive management forecasts.ValuationNUAN shares have a relatively compressed valuation given comparable valuations in the enterprise IT space and there has been good reason for that. The shares are selling within a few percent of the price they were a decade ago and they reached an all-time high in the wake of the introduction of Siri with the launch of the first Apple iPhone.The issue has been that Nuance has not seen any significant growth in 4 years despite some of the success it has enjoyed in some new product areas. In fact, EPS is precisely unchanged over the period and the 7% growth in revenues has pretty much been completely inorganic. That is the kind of track record that can lead to investor disenchantment and low valuations.At the end of the last quarter, Nuance reported that outstanding shares were 294 million. The share price is now $16.70 which yields a market capitalization of $4.9 billion. The company has a net debt position of $1.8 billion. That leads to an enterprise value of $6.7 billion and to an EV/S of 3.25X. The company is projecting non-GAAP EPS of around $1.60 which would result in a P/E of 10.5X. The company is forecasting that CFFO will be 110% of reported non-GAAP net income. That yields CFFO of $510 million, and with capex forecast to be between $60-$70 million, that yields an estimate for free cash flow of $445 million at the mid-point. Overall, that produces a free cash flow yield of 6.6%. It seems most likely that the company will use free cash flow to pay down debt and it seems unlikely that it will buy back additional shares in the short termOverall, these are quite compressed valuation metrics and certainly have strong upside potential if the company can finally start to achieve some of the potentials it should have from its solution portfolio.Nuance shares have been a disappointment for many years now and last year was no exception. But the last two quarters have seen some significant breaks in the overcast of despond that has settled over this company. I think the opportunity this company has to achieve consistent double-digit growth is now within sight of realization. And margins are far more of a concern for Nuance than in the past. I think positive alpha is a strong probability over the coming year."
4076910,98236,2017-05-26T14:53:00-04:00,"Nuance reported the results of fiscal Q2 earlier this month.The results were a noticeable beat and the company returned to positive organic growth.Bookings growth at 31% was far above expectations and led to a substantial increase in full year bookings targets.While the company did raise guidance for earnings and revenues, that increase was overshadowed by a new non-GAAP tax renewal.The company's CEO has painted a far more encouraging picture with regards to the company's transition than his heretofore comments on that subject.","Nuance - A successful quarter and one that is unambiguous in its outlineA couple of weeks ago, Nuance (OTC:NAUN) Nuance reported the results of its fiscal Q2. It sometimes takes me a bit longer to get around to writing an article on particular companies during earnings season and this was one of those times. Nuance has been a company in transition for many years now and during that time it has shed many investors who simply were unable to deal with the multi-year path this company has been on to consistent growth and a return to historic operating margins. In fact, more than a few investors have thought there was no such path and there were times when I felt the same way. I have published articles on the name on this site and they have proven, for the most part to be premature. But finally, the company was able to put together a quarter in which most of its initiatives showed progress and in which its boat anchors seemingly lessened their drag. The shares responded modestly to the announcement and rose about 8% the day after the earnings release. By now, however, the shares have retraced half of the move. And they haven't really done much over the past year, rising by 13%, far less than the progress of the IGV which is up by 30% over the same span.The title of this article is an old English/Irish proverb that migrated to the US and to the slave community as it expressed their hope for a brighter future when compared to their dismal status. It was a popular saying in both the Irish and black communities a century and more ago. In part, I have used it to reflect the long road with its multiple turnings that this company has followed for the past five years during which its shares have contracted. Can this company finally create positive alpha for investors? I have certainly had my share of false starts in evaluating this name as the link might suggest. But the numbers are starting to add up and after the long bull run tech names have enjoyed, I think it is more likely to find positive alpha in what appears to be a junk heap rather than looking to companies at the top of the mountain for further differentiated appreciation. Or at the least, perhaps it makes sense to love one of those unloved names that can be used to provide a bit of leaven in a portfolio.Looking at the quarter Nuance reportedThings at Nuance are rarely what they seem. Perhaps that is just the nature of a transition that has been going on five years. Even this quarter, which showed visible operational progress. The reported results have to be caveated with regards to the company's published tax rate. Some headlines have proclaimed the company missed expectations. It did not and adjusted operating income soared by 40% year over year, a cadence far greater than anticipated by almost anyone. (I removed restructuring and acquisition related costs from both years to arrive at an apples to apples comparison of operations.)Reported revenues increased by 4% year on year and by 1% on a non-GAAP, organic basis. I think one of the more important statements the company made as part of its earnings release is ""the headwinds from our handset business and the transition from Dragon Medical perpetual to cloud are now largely behind us."" Those headwinds have prevented the company from reporting growth for years which is why the stock has been unable to appreciate. The company's revenues are just 5% higher than they were five years ago and all of that increase and more has been inorganic. And for much of that time, the culprits have been declines in Dragon Medical and declines in the company's handset businesses. If that headwind is over, then the calculus around the valuation of the shares will change substantially and the company ought to be able to achieve consistent revenue growth.As part of the detail the company reports, it included the annual line run rate for transcription. This use to be the company's cash cow and prior to 2012 increased regularly and provided a firm footing for reported numbers. It appears in the most recent report that the decline on a sequential basis has come to an end, one of the more positive developments of note this past quarter.The company's other boat anchor, mobile, also showed quite encouraging trends this past quarter. Revenues jumped 8% sequentially and were 8% above year-earlier levels. Mobile has been plagued by falling revenues in the handset business where price competition coupled with flattish shipment trends have hobbled the business and outweighed the impact of high growth solutions such as automotive. The company had decent wins with large telecom providers. The company also is seeing continued strong traction in selling its solutions to manufacturers of smart TVs and other appliances and it is putting together IoT offerings that are likely to provide sustained growth in the next few years.The company has been enjoying a long run of success in terms of what it calls Dragon Drive which is the platform it sells to auto makers that use it to provide value added services to drivers. This quarter the company reported wins at Audi, BMW, Fujitsu-Ten, Melco and Geely. (Geely makes cars in China, Melco makes automotive parts and Fujitsu-10 provides OEM navigation system under the Eclipse brand name.)The enterprise business showed favorable trends that are comparable to those seen over the past year and grew 14% organically. Nina is a core technology for Nuance in enterprise and is showing accelerating growth. Nina is a well-received technology and has enabled the company to offer users a transition to a far more enabled automated call center. I wish the company would hurry up and close additional customers and spare me and likely many readers from the abysmal experience that remains common when using call centers.The company publishes a backlog metric, and that too has been stagnant for several years. It started to show positive trends in the middle of the prior fiscal year and it is now at $2.57 billion, up 19% year over year. Presumably, with backlogs showing that kind of an increase, the growth that should be expected in hosting and subscription revenues should start to show comparable percentage rates of growth. Some of that is starting to happen with hosting revenue reaching 40% of the revenues for the entire company and up by almost 10% year-on-year while recurring product revenues (subscriptions) jumped by 17% over the same period.Gross margins were essentially flat year on year mainly driven by lower reported gross margins on ratable revenues which perversely are negatively correlated with the rate of growth of bookings from that revenue source. GAAP operating expenses declined by 2% year-on-year. There remains a significant amount of margin runway for this company. It has shown a fair level of expense discipline and I imagine that will persist. The current mantra is that the company will continue to prune, but will take the savings it generates and reinvest those into higher growth areas of the business. If Nuance can achieve sustainable revenue growth which seems to be more likely now than in the past, it should be able to substantially improve operating margins which are hundreds of basis points below levels that the companies regularly attained.One of the more important metrics that is tracked by most analysts is bookings and they were up by 31% year-on-year. The cadence of bookings is usually lumpy, but bookings trends have started to show consistent quarterly improvement. Bookings for the past three quarters have shown substantial increases that will ultimately impact revenue growth.Overall, recurring revenues have grown to 75% of the total. While achieving an internal goal to ramp recurring revenue will produce more stable results going forward, it does not mean that the company will not have variable quarters - just that the variability is less than has been the case.GuidanceNuance as a company is known for teasing investors with reporting a quarter of decent operating performance and then forecasting guidance that is less than stellar. I would say that has happened more times than I have had hot dinners but the fact is I have had more than a few hot dinners in my life. I will let it go that this is one of those rare times when the company increased its forecast for key financial metrics. Body language is important in assessing guidance - at least it is for me. Paul Ricci, the CEO, is not normally the most emollient or ebullient of CEOs. This was a rare call in which his enthusiasm regarding the outlook shone through his monotone intonations. I have been listening to Mr. Ricci for more years than I might have chosen - this was his most enthusiastic outing and that goes back to the days when the company was growing more rapidly.Most important, at least to me, was the increase in bookings growth targets which now are 8% at the mid-point for the full year compared to an earlier estimate of 4%. The company marginally increased the mid-point of prior guidance for revenue and for EPS.As mentioned earlier, the company is adopting a new way of reporting its non-GAAP taxes. For many years, the company has used its NOLs as an offset against reporting any substantial level of US tax liabilities. Its non-GAAP tax provisions have been at the cash tax rate it pays which is around 5%-6%. It will now use a 31% statutory rate in terms of reporting non-GAAP taxes because of its interpretation of an SEC regulation on the subject. Most other companies have not chosen that interpretation but starting next quarte Nuance will only report headline results using a 31% tax accrual. That is going to reduce reported non-GAAP earnings significantly - from a prior expectation of about $1.59 to a current expectation of $1.16. The company will report cash taxes on a supplemental basis and some analysts are likely to continue to look at the company's P/E on the basis of earnings calculated using a cash tax rate in order to make for a more relevant comparison. The company has over $600 million of NOLs. That is a real asset and I expect that it will be valued in accordance with its actual worth by some investors some of the time.The new non-GAAP tax rate does not change the cash taxes that Nuance will pay and doesn't change the company's cash flow expectations. In terms of percentages, the CFFO estimate rises from 110% of reported non-GAAP results to 150% of the new reported non-GAAP results. In both cases, the CFFO expectation is the same at about $515 million and free cash flow is forecast to be $460 million for this current fiscal year.I think one of the more salient items to look at in guidance is what appears to be a substantial acceleration in automotive bookings which have reached a level in which additional head count is now required to implement the backlog. Since the company's episode with Mr. Icahn's ownership, management has been very careful with investing in headcount. If it is adding headcount, I think it is reasonable to imagine that the company's automotive business and in particular the influence of the connected car initiatives has driven and will continue to drive a prolonged period of double-digit growth.Nuance is not a direct participant in the autonomous car free-for-all. That said, the use of its voice technology is likely to grow rapidly when autonomous cars move from the test track to streets and highways.In addition, the company has made significant progress in delivering on the promise of its intelligent Omni-channel solutions with regard to its enterprise offerings. Without going through a detailed product analysis, this area of the company's business remains under appreciated. Nuance actually has a solution, or a set of solutions, that when demo'd show substantial improvements in the technology of call centers. Just to quote Ricci on the subject, ""Customers are going through a transformation of their customer service operations to fully embrace this Omni-channel vision. So, I think the opportunity in the market remains large, and our position is distinct. So, I think it is a sustainable opportunity for us."" By Ricci's standards, that kind of statement is positively giddy with optimism.Finally, there is the long-languishing medical operation, really the single most important factor in evaluating the company's finances and constituting 45% of operating income and 47% of revenue. The same trends in terms of the deployment of AI and analytics that are driving growth in the company's other segments are driving a positive forecast here as well. Ricci talked about a return to organic growth in terms of reported revenues in healthcare in FY '18. So far this year, healthcare has declined about 6% organically. Turning that around will add something on the order of 700-900 basis points to growth in fiscal 2018.While management has not yet forecast it, I think that the company has a reasonable opportunity to achieve high single-digit top line growth in fiscal year 2018, That kind of growth would compare to the current First Call consensus expectation for revenue growth of less than 4%. Again, to quote from the CEO's answer to a question, ""I apologize, I do now that we're doing quite well in cultivating new customers in that (healthcare) business. And I think that's part of what's contributing to the quality of the pipeline we have in healthcare, which although I had not commented on specifically is really extraordinary pipeline for us right now."" Now if one heard something like that from Mark Benioff (CEO of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)) one would simply say it is Mark being Mark and let it go. I'm not sure I have ever heard Mr. Ricci describe pipeline for anything related to this company as extraordinary.The current earnings expectation for this company for the current based on the new tax rate accrual is EPS of $1.18 and the consensus for forecast for fiscal 2018 is only EPS of $1.24. Given the description of the robust pipeline, and the forecast of organic growth in healthcare and continued acceleration of growth in the other important business segments, I think a reasonable expectation for earnings would be $1.30 or a bit higher, and that would most likely create CFFO of about $560 and free cash flow of $510 million.Why is the inflection happening now?In a nutshell, I am inclined to credit the inflection in terms of the company's operational performance to the coming of age of artificial intelligence as a widely-adopted technology. This company was actually a pioneer in AI and developed much of the technology that still animates Siri. It bought much of IBM's (NYSE:IBM) pioneering work in this business area almost a decade ago. Sometimes results can move slowly in terms of technology and I would say this is one of those times. It has taken a very long time for this company to go from producing the technology it bought from IBM to then introducing the technology that underlies Siri, to introducing Nina and Dragon Medical a few years later. It is just now attaining material traction from its capabilities in terms of being able to offer natural language solutions across its product lines which are starting to show visible results in terms of top-line growth.Should the company have developed these kinds of solutions more rapidly? I do not have that kind of hindsight. Is Paul Ricci to blame for not insuring that the technologies that were acquired were commercialized more rapidly? Perhaps, although I do not like to second guess managers without more knowledge of the facts than it is possible to have both from outside the organization and in arrears.There is a relatively well known passage in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar that has been quoted many times and on many occasions that seems appropriate here: ""There is a tide on the affairs of men, which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune. Omitted, all the voyages of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries. On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current when it serves or lose our venture. "" It is so to speak, the time for Nuance to put it all together and regardless of opinions about the current CEO, which I perhaps share in whole or in part, the environment has finally become amenable to what Nuance has to sell.To a greater or lesser extent, this is a company that has been waiting for the world to catch up to what it has on offer. I readily concede that the transition was more than a bit unpleasant, or bound in shallows and miseries as Shakespeare put it.But after many years, this company finally has a set of available solutions that are significantly differentiated from competitors and appeal to current trends in terms of IT demand.ValuationOnce upon a time, Nuance was considered to be a growth story that had a sexy new technology and its shares achieved high valuations. Those days are long over, although the question as to their return is alive, I believe. But for the moment, I simply look at the company as a value name starting to show relatively decent results.The company is projecting that it will have a diluted share count of 296 million this year. The share price as of this writing is $18.80. That yields a market cap of $5.56 billion. Net debt at the end of the reported quarter was about $1.75 billion. That brings the company's enterprise value to $7.3 billion. With sales now projected at $2.05 billion, that yields an EV/S metric of 3.5X. Not perhaps in deep value territory but pretty reasonable if growth reaches and sustains in the high single digits as I now believe to be likely.As mentioned earlier, in the article, Nuance has adopted a new and unusually conservative methodology for reporting non-GAAP EPS. Based on my model for fiscal 2018 which starts on October 1, the P/E as reported and screened will be about 14X. But using an earnings estimate that is congruent with almost all other software comps, the P/E is approximately 10.7X. Nuance is only followed by seven analysts these days - following the name has proven just to painful for many brokerages. So, I'm not too sure how they will treat the reporting anomaly. The NOL of $620 million is really something of significant worth and if this business were to be acquired it would surely be part of how the company would be valued. I would be inclined to say that while the P/E isn't amongst the lowest out there, it is certainly at an attractive level if my assumptions for growth are accurate.Stock based comp is at moderate levels and is no longer rising. Last quarter stock based comp was 8% of revenues in total and about 5% of reported revenues after adjusting for the tax impact of SBC. In all, stock based comp represented about 30% of reported non-GAAP EPS.The company generates a lot of cash and the relationship will change significantly in the wake of the new income tax reporting methodology. Stock based comp represents about 32% of current cash flow. Depreciation represents 46%.The contribution of deferred revenues to cash flow is seasonably variable. It was negligible last quarter although at very high levels the prior quarter. Given the level of bookings that the company is forecasting, it is reasonable to expect that deferred revenue will show significant percentage growth, although I haven't the tools with which to try to forecast specifically.I have used the company's cash flow forecast as the basis for my expectation as explained earlier. With an enterprise value of $7.3 billion and free cash flow expected to be a bit greater than $500 million, this would produce a free cash flow yield of just shy of 7%. Not the highest such metric, but one that compares favorably to the free cash flow yield of other, so-called older software vendors.With the impending retirement of the CEO and the recent sale of the last of the Icahn holdings, it is probably germane to speculate about potential consolidation. At this point, the company has more ""relative technology"" through the melding of voice, AI and analytics then has been the case for some time. Because of the technology, it would make a very attractive strategic acquisition for a wide variety of names. The NOLs are something that lowers the potential price for acquirers by around 5%-6%. It is an attractive asset and in this environment, suggesting that a bid for the company is possible is hardly a stretch.As mentioned, the shares, while certainly up, have hardly appreciated beyond reasonable levels. Its year to date appreciation of 27% is actually lower than the appreciation of the IGV which has been 29% appreciation YTD. I think the current set-up ought to allow the shares to start generating positive alpha over the current months."
3977386,53622,2016-05-24T11:36:37-04:00,Nuance has sold-off over the past couple of months.Is Carl Icahn playing a major role in the sell-off?My take on the company and trading strategy is discussed.,"Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) is an interesting stock to own and trade. I laid out my rationale as to why I was long the stock in a series of articles back in December. Up until the middle of March, I was happy with progress the company was making, despite fluctuations in the share price. But when the company announced a deal to boot Icahn and his two seats from the Board, red flags were raised and I sold off a majority of my position in Nuance.Fellow Seeking Alpha contributor Bert Hochfeld has provided great coverage on Nuance's earnings releases (including the latest one located here), which I highly recommend for anyone interested in this name. Having said that, Mr. Hochfeld reported no position in Nuance, which essentially means that he is providing sell-side coverage.I cover Nuance from a perspective as an investor/trader, which means that factors such as sentiment, market direction, opportunity cost, and trading patterns can matter more than the underlying fundamentals. And when looking at Nuance's current situation from the buy-side, however, there's not much to like right now.After selling approximately 26.3 million shares as part of the agreed buyback ($500 million at $19 per share) with Nuance, Carl Icahn (NASDAQ:IEP) immediately turned around and unloaded another 4.4 million shares before the end of Q1. This reduced his stake to under the 10% threshold where all transactions must be reported.Additionally, because that sale occurred right before the end of Q1, it afforded Icahn a whole quarter to unload the rest of his stake without having to show up in a 13F filing. Based on the stock chart since Icahn's last reported transaction, I'm willing to bet that Icahn has unloaded a significant portion of his remaining stake in Nuance.Source: YahooBased on the 3 month average daily trading volume of 3 million shares reported by Yahoo Finance, I doubt that Icahn has been able to unload all 30 million remaining shares yet. My guess, however, is that Icahn wouldn't have given up the board seats and immediately sold to get under the 10% threshold without a plan to dispose of the whole position. Therefore, absent material news to really entice new investors, I suspect that the stock will continue to drift lower through the rest of the quarter as the market has to absorb Icahn's selling.This is especially so given the financial situation Nuance has put itself in. Before using its entire cash hoard to perform the buyback with Icahn, investors at least knew that Nuance would be opportunistic with its open market buyback program to put a floor on the stock price. Assuming the company will be able to hold its 1H FY 2016 FCF generation steady at about $270 million, it will take one full year just to replenish its cash balance and pay down the newly formed credit facility. This means that investors should not look for any type of return of capital in the near future.Looking longer term, the situation does not look much better either. The company has $1.05 Billion senior notes coming due August 2020. With one year of its FCF already needed to replenish its cash hoard, the company will have 3 years to generate the cash necessary to repay those. Even without much growth over that time frame, the annualized FCF rate of ~$600 million appears sufficient.But that also means that investors will now be looking at 4 straight years without any type of capital being allocated for shareholders. And with another $1.05 Billion of convertible debt coming due over the next decade, I don't know if it's a safe assumption that the company will be able to simply roll-over its debt on attractive terms.All of this means that it is imperative that Nuance is effectively managing its capital over the next few years. CEO Ricci noted on the last conference call that the cost savings initiative is mostly complete now, which coupled with the likelihood of an increased tax rate going forward and very modest revenue growth in FY 2017, I doubt FCF will continue to grow at the pace seen in recent quarters; especially when considering that operating cash flow was 139% of non-GAAP EPS last quarter.At the current share price around $16.30 as I write this, the stock trades at annualized EV/EBITDA of 12.5. This doesn't exactly make the shares extremely cheap or expensive, so most of the issues I've discussed are likely priced into the stock accordingly.But considering the ongoing headwinds in the medical segment due to transcription volume erosion and the weakness in handset revenues within the mobile segment, top-line growth will likely remain relatively stagnant for the next year or two.Source: Q2 2016 Prepared RemarksSource: Q2 2016 Prepared RemarksGiven the weakness in these two key markets for Nuance, it is actually impressive that the company has been able to hold revenue steady and expand operating margins. Additionally, I like the fact that Nuance appears largely immune to deterioration in the overall economy, but that doesn't mean the stock's valuation won't compress in a market sell-off.Taking everything together, I plan to hold off on re-purchasing my original stake in Nuance until there is clarity on when Icahn is done selling (which likely won't be until the Q2 13F is filed in August), overall fundamentals improve, or the company is able to proactively take more action on the liabilities side of its balance sheet. I am also watching for signs that Nuance's products start gaining traction within the IoT space, as this could be a significant catalyst to drive new growth not currently anticipated by the Street."
4000419,98236,2016-08-18T00:16:15-04:00,"Nuance reported another quarter that was consistent with its past earnings announcements - it continued to underwhelm.The company did beat EPS, but revenues missed by about 1%, and bookings were hard to figure out.The company's guidance was not all that optimistic either.Its transition is seeming to drag on interminably, with healthcare seeing the worst of the impacts of the switch to ratable revenues.There were a few green shoots to be seen, and even the Nuance forecast, when carefully parsed, provides modest hope for some shorter-term positive trends in specific metrics.","Just Around the CornerOne of the more famous songs of the early 1930s, for those of you unfamiliar with the pop music of the era. As it happens, the lyrics seem to fit the current state of Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) shares almost to a tee. The lyrics talk about letting a smile be your umbrella, and offer the suggestion of then president Herbert Hoover that ""now's the time to buy."" While the president would never have qualified as a Seeking Alpha contributor with that particular forecast, he actually did know how to organize businesses in areas from China and Africa to South America. And his taste in shirts would perhaps have gratified one of the more interesting contributors to the site. And regardless of his stock forecast, Mr. Hoover was a shrewd and successful businessman who had come from flat nothing to amass the current equivalent of about $200 million before he retired from the private sector at the outbreak of World War I.The song starts, ""And just around the corner, there is a rainbow in the sky."" It could really be a theme song for all of the contributors who want to explain to readers how they need to think about a bum recommendation. And you can tell by the refrain that it was an era before we Americans worried much about weight (well, sadly more than a few of our forebears were worried about weight, but in the sense that they weren't getting enough to eat) or cholesterol - the refrain of the song is, ""let's have another cup o' coffee and let's have another piece of pie."" By the way, for you sticklers, that is the real name of the song, i.e., ""Let have another cup o"" coffee,"" although I grew up thinking it was called ""Just around the corner."" The song, and the show of which it was the hit, tell with almost searing clarity how New Yorkers tried to cope with the ravages of Depression. Yes, it was satire - the SNL of its day, I suppose.What does all of that have to do with an evaluation of Nuance in the light of the quarter it reported back on August 8th. Well, for one thing, it spares me the necessity of writing about a less-than-pleasant subject for a few moments, Sadly, that rainbow in the sky is still just around the corner for Nuance, and Herbert Hoover has given up making Buy recommendations for more than the last 50 years.Nuance most reminds me of that proverbial child who is said ""not to live up to his potential."" The company has, and has had, plenty of technology - more, perhaps, than is broadly recognized. The people who sell the product, for the most part, are fair representatives of the evolutionary process with but one head and two eyes apiece. While the company faces plenty of competitors, it more often than not had the right mix of prices, products, references and the like to win major deals. The CEO, while irascible to be sure, and not perhaps the most investor-friendly or even people-friendly executive of whom I know, is smart, tough and knowledgeable about the business. So, what has been the trouble with Nuance? Simply put, the company has not been performing to its potential, and still is not. At some point, if the company performs, so will the shares. As to when is that likely to happen, my guess is certainly sooner than that rainbow of the early 1930s, and indeed, I would make the case that the patience of investors will be rewarded - but it is a hard case that is often frustrating to make.Just for the recordNuance reported its results about a week ago. Headline numbers included revenue of $485 million (non-GAAP), a miss of 1%, and EPS of $.38 (non-GAAP), a beat of $.01. Compared to many other companies, its earnings improvement was weighted to GAAP earnings. GAAP operating margins rose 300 bps despite flat revenue, one of the better measures there can be of real expense discipline. Are these results consistent with what might reasonably be anticipated for a company in transition? Yes and no - one of those great answers that needs further explication. Product and licensing revenue declined, and services and hosting revenues increased. It was just about a wash, overall. At this point, 71% of revenues come from recurring sources, up from 68% in the prior year. Without being too waspish, at this rate, the transition still has another 3-4 years to run before the decline in product revenues ceases to be quantitatively significant. Stakeholders are understandably no longer totally quiescent about the speed of the transition.The company's bookings came in at $363 million for the quarter, which was a decline from $484 million of bookings in the prior year. The year-prior period included some extraordinary bookings in the automotive sector that were said to be in the range of $100 million or more - the question of how much more is not really known, so it was difficult to tell if bookings this past quarter were up or down, excluding the extraordinary booking in automotive. The company said bookings were strong in Medical, the largest revenue stream for this company, and for Imaging.Overall, the best metric was the decent increase in deferred revenues which grew by 13% to $729 million. That being said, the inability of the company to grow bookings, even adjusted for the absence of the large automotive deals from the prior year, is disappointing. Net new bookings have been stuck in a consistent range for several quarters, adjusted for seasonality, and this quarter was no exception to those results, although bookings did increase 16% sequentially. Will bookings break out of their rut in Q4? I will examine that question later in this article, but I think that is the most likely result, although one not forecast by management in its earnings presentation.Another metric of significance, the 3-year value of all on-demand contracts, also has been flat for quarters now. At some point, the company ought to be in a position to change the contour of that metric to reflect growth in the on-demand sector. Part of the issue here is probably the fact that Nuance is going through an evolution in its mobile device business. The company sells solutions to carriers that are embedded in cell phones. The pricing has been abysmal and the number of phones being shipped has declined, so Nuance has seen contracting revenues and also seen the value of its future contracts with carriers decline in this segment.The other major issue preventing better headline results was in healthcare, the company's single-largest revenue contributor. Healthcare represents 50% of revenues, and those revenues fell 6% year on year. Until healthcare starts to grow - and it hasn't grown in 8 long quarters - top line performance for Nuance is going to remain pressured.Perhaps not apparent to some investors and commentators is that the company has long been a leader in medical transcription services. The transcription business is, to one degree or the other, currently the Achilles' heel of the Nuance model, and I have heretofore not paid the attention I might have done to the rate of its decline. At this point, lines being transcribed have fallen by almost 9% year on year, and it is doubtful that the performance of that metric is going to improve, although percentage decreases are likely to vary around a declining trend. Most of the loss in revenue from that source is being made up by transcription users migrating their requirements for transcription to Dragon Medical and its wide range of siblings. Management says growth in Dragon Medical will overtake the declines in transcription in 2017. As the saying goes, for those readers who are shareholders, ""fondly do we hope; fervently do we pray."" I can say without any equivocation that President Lincoln was not thinking about Nuance or Dragon Medical when he spoke to the crowds on that blustery inauguration day in March 1865.Often, in this place, I might choose to go through a competitive review of the numerous products and solutions against which this company struggles. The word struggle is probably overdone, and it would be tedious and too costly in terms of space to try to recapitulate all of the different market shares that Nuance has in all of its many spaces. There are reasons for Nuance's less-than-stellar performance in the recent past; this writer does not believe competition from different peers has been a factor in the company's lack of growth.The business segment that Nuance calls ""Mobile"" was solid during the quarter, with the exception of the aforementioned issue with regard to declining revenues from the simpler solutions that are embedded in mobile devices. Overall, mobile is a bit less than 20% of revenues, and the company saw total revenues decline because of the run-off of services contracts as users switched to a completely subscription-based business model.Mobile is one of the divisions with the high visibility technologies that have the potential to remake the company as a growth business. Most particularly, Nuance is deeply involved with automotive infotainment systems in vehicles, it has deals with appliance makers regarding smart TVs and to work inside of a wide variety of Internet of Things devices. At some point, the revenue potential of all of these initiatives needs to become visible from a revenue standpoint - but that has yet to really happen in a meaningful fashion.Although growth for Mobile went in the wrong direction, the company had a strong margin performance which increased by 700 bps, reflecting spending discipline and a more profitable mix of sales that improved gross margins.Nuance's Enterprise business has just overtaken Mobile in terms of revenue. While everyone, myself included, wants to write about a transition, Enterprise still has large revenues coming from the sale of on-premise IVR systems. Believe it or not, the new systems are said to be an advance over the old, with a far higher order of intelligence. Did you know that? Next time you yell at an IVR coming to you through the phone, remember, the poor software really has a larger brain case and wants to help you. I confess that knowing a bit about how the solution functions has not kept me from screaming loudly at the phone when the IVR has too little ""I"" and too much ""VR."" On the other hand, voice biometrics is a solution that is friendly for users and is starting to drive significant revenues for Nuance. While the empyrean of AI for Customer Service is not yet at hand, it is apparently getting closer. I wonder if I shall actually live to see its implementation across a broad spectrum of businesses.Imaging is one of those businesses that seemingly came to Nuance in a 3-way trade in exchange for a player to be named later. Its connection with the rest of the company in terms of technology is negligible. Without wasting space on reviewing the operation, segment profit declined and revenues were flat last quarter.The company's cash flow performed consistently with its operating performance Overall operating cash flow increased by 5% this past quarter year on year, and it was 117% of non-GAAP income compared to 119%. Most of the cash flow that is being generated is going to be used to fund the massive share purchase the company made from Carl Icahn in March. Overall, that transaction cost $500 million, of which $300 million was borrowed, so for the next couple of quarters, the company is replacing some of the cash it spent. Outstanding shares have now dropped to 279 million from the year-earlier level of 313 million. If it can ever start to produce consistent revenue growth, the rewards to current shareholders are going to be outsized.When might there be some rewards?The first thing that has to happen is to see Nuance achieve a reasonable level of operating performance. I will say it right now - I had thought that day would have been here by now. I suppose I could give the excuse that I am in good company. The average price target for these shares on the part of the 9 analysts publishing that metric on 1st call is $22. But company or not, these shares have languished since I wrote my initial report on Nuance for Seeking Alpha at the end of last year. The inflection point I thought was discernible then is still ""just around the corner."" By that I mean the company needs to show consistent bookings growth of 10% or more, consistent reported revenues gains in the same range and consistent growth in the 3-year contract value of subscription arrangements. Until that might happen, these shares aren't going to produce solid positive alpha over a sustainable time period regardless of lowly valued they might be.I do not think any, or all, of those goals are unreasonable or unrealistic targets, and for Nuance to work as an investment, investors are going to have to see some progress on all of those fronts, coupled with continued improvements in operating margins. And most of the growth investors are looking for is going to have to be organic. The company has less than $600 million of cash and equivalents and outstanding debt of $2.44 billion. That is a highly leveraged financial position for a software vendor - I am not sure I remember any vendor so highly leveraged. It is going take a couple of years, at present rates, for Nuance to be able to generate enough cash flow to restore a more normal financial balance and restore some of its financial flexibility.And buying companies for stock at these valuations is a very tendentious kind of transaction that needs far more justification than can usually be mustered. Nuance recently bought a company called TouchCommerce for a total consideration of $215 million. The headline justifications are all good, in my opinion. The problem is paying for the company. Nuance closed the acquisition of TouchCommerce in a transaction that cost at least $110 million in cash, and probably more, depending on the election of Nuance to pay an additional $85 million in cash or in stock. TouchCommerce is large enough in revenues that it is going to add 100 bps to organic growth numbers as reported in FY '17.Prudently, Nuance has chosen to include mega transactions from its bookings forecast in Q4. ""A number of the booking transactions in the pipeline are large, in the range of $10 million to $50 million, and thus typically involve protracted negotiations."" And so they do. And that has left the company with a forecast for no material bookings growth in Q4. Basically, the transactions will happen when they happen, and when they do, they are going to produce a significant upside to anticipated results.Bookings are not revenues, and revenues should be easier to forecast these days for Nuance because so much of its revenues are ratable in nature. Overall, the revenue and EPS estimates based on the consensus of 9 analysts reporting to Firstcall is little changed since the release of quarterly results.Nuance shares dropped by more than 10% on the day after the recent earnings release, based on investor disappointment with the lack of visible growth. They have actually continued to decline after a minor dead cat bounce, and have made a new low for the year.An interesting question for both this writer and for readers/potential investors is the likely share price reaction in the event that Nuance manages to record upsides in both bookings - quite likely, I think, given the forecast includes none of the substantial deals that are in the pipeline and in earnings, and reasonably likely given the company's long-term earnings track record. At this point, valuation has become so compressed that it seems likely that moderate upsides are likely to produce disproportionate share price gains.The first question on this quarter's conference call came from an analyst who asked when the company would start to deliver organic growth after promising that such an outcome would be underway by this point. Sometimes I think it would be helpful to have litigators on quarterly conference calls. The answer to the question about organic growth was, ""We have seen an acceleration toward cloud and term based arrangements. And while enhancing opportunity for growth as we look into the second half of 2017, it has reduced growth in the second half of 2016."" Really!In a different forum, the next question would be, ""OK, if the trend toward ratable bookings is accelerating, where is the quantitative evidence of that in last quarter's numbers, and why shouldn't bookings grow even without growth in reported revenues?"" Needless to say, those kinds of questions are not seen in modern conference calls, which are rarely anything but forums for companies to attempt to express a certain spin on the news. This company actually lays out its bookings history in a nice chart that is easy to understand. Investors, as well as this writer, are impatient with the absence of bookings growth going back a considerable number of quarters.Just to make the point: bookings grew less than 2% in Q1 of this year, about 1% in Q2, and their growth for the just-reported quarter can't be readily calculated because of the whale booking that was seen in the year-earlier period. Now, bookings themselves can be a slippery number, having to do with term lengths and other factors, but the estimated 3-year value of on-demand contracts has shrunk by 3% since the end of calendar 2014.So I find forecasting fiscal 2017 results to be a fraught exercise - either with or without company guidance - and I am not too sure whether it is better to have the benefit of that insight or wing it on a hope and a prayer.My intuition, and that is all it can be, suggests that Q4 will see a few large bookings that are closed. For the many years I have known of this company, it has typically had some very large deals in its mix, and I think what it sells is amenable to large deals to a very great extent. It is Q4, and somehow large deals have a way of closing in Q4 - it is the commission accelerators - and IT spending has seemingly shown a better tone overall, according to industry publications such as Gartner and IDC. While management has not done the best of jobs in guessing bookings - I refuse to call what they do forecasting - I imagine they have purged their forecast of all large opportunities at the executive level, both because timing is really impossible to guess, being in the hands of the customer and not the vendor, and also for the motivation of being able to show a visible upside from a depressed set of expectations.I imagine bookings will actually show moderate growth throughout the course of the next fiscal year. I say that not because I see that proverbial rainbow just around the corner, but because the company has more successful products in decent market spaces than has been evinced by visible numbers for the last couple of years, and it would be logical to see some fruits for the efforts of this company and its employees. Nuance is simply not losing all that many deals for which it competes to its competitors, and it has many partners which have successful track records.The fact is that Nuance sells Clintegrity and Dragon Medical in conjunction with Cerner, and it is not unreasonable to imagine that the success Cerner has seen in its bookings will soon be seen overall in medical bookings at Nuance. The fact is that transcription lines are in a multi-year decline, and the revenue impact of that decline, which has been mainly marked by consistent percentages of decline, seems like to compress in dollars. The fact is that the company has won more than its share of automotive deals, and the connected car market is a real phenomenon, and while there is not too much more to be said about smart TVs and smart ovens, Nuance customers are choosing to adopt IoT solutions at least in order to offer competitive features compared to other participants in the space. If people choose to talk to their plants, they can certainly be taught to adopt their ovens and TVs as pets and talk to them as well.The current consensus forecast for Nuance's growth for next year is a less-than-exciting 4%. The current quarter that will not be reported until almost Thanksgiving is forecast to see a 2% contraction in revenues. So, expectations are very modest for reported revenues, and they are almost certainly equally modest for bookings. EPS forecasts are a bit more optimistic. The company forecast EPS in the range of $.37-.41, and the consensus is $.39.When one takes the responsibility of writing articles, part of the obligation, at least in the view of this writer, is to try to provide readers with logical forecasts. The logical forecast for this company would be that it will exceed the consensus in Q4 by varying amounts - the most on bookings, second-most in terms of reported non-GAAP EPS and least on revenues. The most logical set of forecasts for the company to provide would be centered around have a bookings year with mid- to high-single digit growth, with EPS of about 10% and revenue growth of about 5%. Those are hardly an extravagant set of expectations, and will leave the company below its earnings per share going all the way back to FY 2012, with revenues basically flat on an organic basis since that time (Reported revenues would be up about 25% since that time, but the company has made numerous acquisitions, and its forecast for revenues this fiscal quarter show just a 7% increase from the revenues it reported way back in Q4 of fiscal '12.) Not the prettiest transition in the history of the software universe!ValuationOne thing that tends to happen when companies disappoint on expectations one way or the other consistently is that valuations compress - and compress below levels that seem reasonable. This company has an EV/S that has now reached 3X and is likely to be noticeably less than 3X for its FY '17 that starts in 2 months. Its P/E based on the consensus for FY'17 is a very modest 8.8X. The company has continued to generate about 115%+ of its reported non-GAAP EPS in operating cash flow. There is no reason to expect that the ratio will get worse; there is potential in the more ratable model for it to get better. But just using current ratios and current consensus numbers, operating cash flow ought to be about $540 million in fiscal 2017. Capex is modest - about $50 million/year - so that puts free cash flow at just below $500 million for fiscal 17. That is a free cash flow yield of 8.1%. Pretty close to deep value territory for a company that logically has far greater growth potential than might be deduced from those set of valuation metrics.Investors have to ask themselves if they have the patience to see this investment through. Many readers/investors will not have that patience, based on the lack of operating performance in the past couple of years. When many names are being valued with total abandon that is hard to logically rationalize, this is a rare case of a name whose valuation is modest at best and affords investors significant potential without having to envision wildly optimistic scenarios. But it is a tough call and a tough investment, and the record of negative alpha over the past year is deserved and frustrating.Wrapping UpRecommending NUAN shares in the wake of this quarterly performance and other recent quarterly reports is what might be described as a fraught exercise. Recommending patience to investors in these situations is a fraught exercise. But sometimes, contributors have to stick their necks out, and given the current share valuation, this is a situation where the rewards seem to outweigh the risks."
3958317,53622,2016-03-14T16:04:03-04:00,Nuance will buyback $500 million of its stock from Carl Icahn.The major implications of the transaction are discussed.Is the buyback part of a bigger plan?,"Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) recently announced it will buy back $500 million worth of its stock from Carl Icahn (NASDAQ:IEP). The agreement calls for the purchase of 26,315,790 shares, which equates to a stock price of $19 per share. Upon completion of the transaction, Carl Icahn and his affiliated entities will still own 34,468,833 shares, representing about 11% of Nuance's remaining shares. Additionally, Icahn will vacate the two board seats that he was given as part of the standstill agreement signed back in October 2013. Considering that this transaction could have major impacts on Nuance's liquidity and future, the potential implications deserve a more detailed analysis.Implication #1The most obvious implication of this transaction is that Carl Icahn has significantly shrunk his holdings, and thus control of the company. While still holding 11% of the company's shares is nothing to sneeze at, it can be looked at in a couple of ways: (1) It's the first step into liquidating the full position (without crashing the share price through open market sales), or (2) Icahn needed to raise cash for a number of possible reasons, and Nuance provided the easiest method.Under those two scenarios, the first would be considered a negative for Nuance's stock, especially given that Icahn's cost basis was reportedly around the $19-20 range. This means the original investment thesis was certainly not playing out as planned, and Icahn is trying to figure out a way to get out of the stock without taking too much of a loss. As to how the rest of the position would be liquidated, current and potential investors will need to come to their own conclusion, as open market selling would almost certainly crash the stock price.For the second scenario, it would be considered neutral for the stock. Icahn would remain a 10% shareholder (which maintains current SEC reporting requirements), and would benefit from a rise in the stock price. So even if Icahn's original investment thesis was still in play, it might have been the most stable and quickest way to generate a substantial amount of capital for his affiliates. And considering some of the volatility seen in his recent high profile investments, this theory would seem to have some legs to stand on.Implication #2The second major implication is the impact that the stock buyback will have on Nuance's liquidity. Per the last 10-Q (quarter ended Dec. 31, 2015), NUAN had $507 million of cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, substantially all of the company's cash hoard would be drained by this transaction, except for the cash collected so far in the current quarter and the $125 million promissory note issued to Nuance (by Icahn Capital LP) as part of the transaction.In Q1 2016, Nuance reported operating cash flow of $141 million and Capex of $21 million, which means that free cash flow was $120 million. As long as FCF is stable during Q2 and Q3 fiscal 2016, Nuance should not have a problem repaying the $125 million promissory note due June 7, 2016. It does indicate, however, that if the company wants to rebuild its $500 million cash hoard, it will need to suspend any additional open market buybacks for the next year. Therefore, some investors - such as myself - can no longer feel confident buying the dips, given that the company will no longer be able to put a floor on the stock price with open market buybacks.Implication #3The third implication is if the buyback is part of a plan hatched just to get Icahn off the Board of Directors. Under this scenario, CEO Ricci may have simply approached Icahn about what it would take to get him to resign his two seats. This could be viewed as either glass half full or glass half empty, depending on your sentiment.If you believe Ricci was simply trying to save his job and keep his paycheck and perks coming, then you would be skeptical that the company is on the right growth plan and believe the stock price will continue to languish. Conversely, if you feel Icahn may have only been trying to accomplish short-term fixes to boost the stock price, like cutting expenses to the bone at the cost of long-term advancements, then you could be positive on the transaction.Or maybe this was the continuation of a plan developed over the past year, which may help explain the following moves:Here's the interesting aspect of all these moves. Of the company's $2.1 billion of long-term debt, half of it is now convertible:Source: 10-QSo maybe all the recent share buybacks are intended to boost EPS and the stock price, which could ultimately help the company shed over $1 billion of its debt? Essentially, the plan would be to buyback large amounts of stock under $20, with the expectation that those buybacks would eventually be replaced by the dilution of the convertible debt at a stock price well over $30.TakeawayMy initial reaction falls on the glass half empty side, which has caused me to significantly lighten up on my long position of Nuance. Given Carl Icahn is loaning Nuance money just to turn around and buy shares from him, I'm a little skeptical about the whole arrangement. Why not just allow the transaction to unfold over a longer time period? Why is Icahn starting to exit his position now? Now that Icahn is no longer on the Board, will he become more vocal about his intention with his remaining 11% stake of Nuance (which is currently worth ~$700 million)? These are just a few of the uncertainties that will likely impact the stock price in the near term.*Image Source: Wikipedia"
4025314,98236,2016-11-21T19:48:15-05:00,"Nuance reported the results of its fiscal 2016 last Thursday.Results included a beat on EPS, a beat on revenue, and very strong performance on bookings.The company raised guidance a bit, and introduced some elements of fiscal 2018 guidance.The CEO announced he would retire in the middle of 2018.NUAN's shares are modestly valued, and it is reasonable to believe that the company could finally unlock shareholder value through dismemberment.","Just how blue are the skies for Nuance?Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) reported the results of its quarter and fiscal 2016 year-end last Thursday. Talk about saving the best for last, the company's results marked the end of the calendar Q3 reporting season, and based on the way I keep score, the results were the best relative to prior expectations of all of the companies that I track. Not on the headline numbers, although they were a modest beat, but on bookings, which were by far the best performance relative to expectations in the IT space last quarter. 45% growth in bookings is not something I expected, and I am still scratching my head at how it happened (Just kidding - the bookings result was because the company closed several major transactions that it had deliberately excluded from its forecast at the end of Q3 - it was year-end and closing large deals is a rite of passage for most software companies at the end of the year). The bookings overattainment was approximately $60 million or 13% above the company's forecast from August. The number of companies that beat revenue/bookings expectations by 13% at this scale are about equal to the number of times I have passed up a glass of a Chateau d'Yquem.I do think I should mention that while the 45% growth in bookings was an exceptional number, bookings for the year wound up growing by about 4%. Investors do look at quarters, but sometimes seasonality is not fixed, and it would be a mistake to think that Nuance is going to reprise its bookings performance, at least in percentage terms, in the near future. It has provided a conservative set of expectations for the current year that could readily be exceeded,-but I think double-digit bookings growth is at least a year or two away; I imagine that the company's operating margins will continue to expand, but not at the rates seen in the recent past.While Nuance's shares gratified holders for a change on Friday, appreciating almost 9%, this has been a very disappointing year for investors in this company. Indeed, while Friday saw positive share price action, the shares seem to have already run into resistance. Given the enormous overattainment in bookings, which are far more relevant than reported revenues in judging the company's long-term business health, the shares might have appreciated further…but then again, Nuance as a company has seen more false dawns than most other software vendors.That being said, the conference call featured comments from the CEO which are worth quoting directly. Mr. Ricci has not been much of a cheerleader over the years, and so I think that the foregoing is quite relevant in marking out the likely progress for the company.I should remark that being confident about 3% growth is nothing to write home about; that said, this is Paul Ricci and Nuance, and one takes what one gets. I would suggest that the comments about stronger bookings, revenue and profit growth are a bit inconsistent with the specifics of the prepared call remarks and are more in tune with a greater expectation than the company was willing to publish.Obviously, at this point, the preponderance of opinion does not believe that forecast, or anything like that forecast. I think I can fairly characterize the tenor of the conference call queries as dubious and tendentious. The shares of this company are priced at levels that belie expectations for any sustained growth. I myself, having waited to see a transition completed quarters ago, have a certain skepticism that the millennium has finally arrived. It really should have arrived long ago. And oh, yes, having had my patience tested to beyond the breaking point, I sold the shares a couple of months ago. Not the way one is supposed to invest.What should investors do? I see many more positives than negatives. The company is having demonstrable competitive success with its newer technologies and the sins of the past are abating.But the fact is, if the transition is winding down, as suggested both by the massive bookings overattainment and the comments the management has been willing to make, this is a very cheap name with plenty of upside. Given the current valuation discussed below, I think the shares are worthy of inclusion in a growth/risk portfolio, although I would be very price sensitive and buy a position over weeks and months. Most investors, institutional as well as retail, have had their patience sorely tested and are not sure Nuance is going to be a ""show-me"" investment for years to come, or at least until a new management is installed and evaluated.The company's forecast despite the results in the past quarter is not greatly changed from the forecast it made in August. Organic growth of 1%, inorganic growth of 1% and operating margins that are flat year on year, including the acquisition of TouchCommerce. None of that is going to precipitate any additional changes in estimates or ratings, I believe. Investors buying the shares today are going to have to rely on the company continuing to out-execute or on the company selling a piece of itself. It is easier for me to see the later, but then hope springs eternal with regards to the former.In the wake of the results and the guidance, Raymond James upped its rating on the shares from ""outperform"" to ""strong buy"" with a price target of $24. The average price target is just $20/share, and the average rating is between buy and hold. There is plenty of room for analysts to reverse their opinion.Company guidance basically suggests that revenues will grow by 2% in the current year, one-third of which is organic and that operating margins will rise another 50 basis points. The revenue forecast incorporates the assumption that an additional 3% of revenues will transition from perpetual streams to subscription models (70% to 73%). In other words, the company's basic organic growth rate is expected to be 4% this coming year net of all of the puts and the takes. The new sales forecast at its mid-point is about 2.5% above the prior analyst consensus. Presumably the new revenue estimate reflects the latest dollar strength, which is going to necessarily be some kind a headwind on reported revenues.The shares still have a painful loss of 15% YTD despite a 25% rally from a low set earlier this month. As a sometime shareholder in the name, and as a positive commentator on this site, this has not been a fun experience for me. Nuance is one of those companies that always should've, would've, could've, and never has done. Honestly. What I would describe as a blowout in Q4 is one of the few pieces of blue sky investors have seen in more than a couple of years. For the most part, it has all been about clouds, showers and dealing with transitions from dying product areas to new opportunities, but never managing to achieve the traction that the new areas seemed capable of generating.A lot of the share price history relates to the disposition by Carl Icahn of more than half of his position in Nuance's shares back in March and the concomitant loss of faith in NUAN's management and the dissipation of expectations regarding the potential for the company to get consolidated.As readers may recollect, Nuance would end up buying back the preponderance of Mr. Icahn's share sale and wound up taking on a considerable amount of debt in the process and ruling out any further share repurchase opportunities in the near term. The fact that long-time CEO Paul Ricci has announced his intention of retiring at the end of March 2018 is likely to renew takeover speculation.In addition, there are many who feel that Mr. Ricci has proven to be ineffectual in steering the company through multiple transitions, and there is obviously something that might be said for that argument. The fact is that while Nuance was first in terms of the development of natural language capabilities and of a form of AI, the company has not really been able to capitalize effectively on its first-mover advantages, and revenues have been stalled at or near current levels for several years now.In addition to Mr. Ricci's retirement, and the departure of the company's head of sales, Bill Robbins, I would pay careful attention to the announcement that NUAN is moving toward a sales structure that is totally divisional. Given the lack of almost any synergies between the various components of the company, it may be that a divisionalized structure will allow acquirers to bid on the pieces of the business they want and to avoid saddling themselves with other businesses that they find to be unstrategic. In particular, it becomes far more possible to conceive of Nuance accepting a bid either in a typical fashion or in some form of spin-merger for its healthcare operations from a Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) or even an athena (NASDAQ:ATHN) if they didn't have to buy the rest of the businesses.Just to put the bookings attainment in context, the sequential growth in that metric was 44%, and according to the company, some of the larger deals that it had withdrawn from the Q4 forecast because of their size did not close and remain in the Q1 pipeline. In the prior fiscal year, bookings actually declined sequentially between Q3 and Q4. It would seem reasonable to assume, given that nugget, that the outlook as provided for Q1 bookings, and perhaps revenues as well, is on the conservative side.Quarterly bookings were an all-time record, surpassing a quarter a couple of years past that had seen exceptional bookings in the automotive sector. As a result of the exceptional level of bookings, another metric which is worth tracking, the three-year value of recurring revenues, increased by 12% sequentially to another record.The bookings result was just enough to bring that metric to positive territory for the full year, and the company was able to report positive revenue growth for the full year as well. Quarterly revenues of $512 million were consistent with the top end of the company's forecasted range, were a bit more than 1% above the previous analyst consensus, and were flat compared to year earlier results.Non-GAAP EPS of $.41 for the quarter was also at the top end of the forecasted range and beat the analyst consensus expectations by $.02. Operating cash flow (CFFO) dropped by 8% year on year although the internals were strong. CFFO was 117% of non-GAAP net income, and DSO was unchanged despite the large deals that drove the revenue results. Overall, the decline in CFFO was driven by both the drop in stock-based comp and because of the recognition of a tax benefit, which really is not a function of operations in the September quarter.For the full year, CFFO grew by 16%. Free cash flow showed similar trends. Capex was up marginally for the year, but is just $13 million out of CFFO of $138 million. Overall, quarterly free cash flow was $125 million, and yearly free cash flow was $511 million. The increase in CFFO was despite a noticeable decline in stock-based comp, which dropped 8% for the year and which actually fell almost 30% in Q4. All of the opex categories continued to fall in Q4 versus a year ago by between 5% and 10%.The company continues to have a significant level of net debt. Much of the net debt has resulted from prior acquisitions, but the net debt increased meaningfully in the wake of buying back shares from major shareholder Icahn earlier this year. Gross cash on the balance sheet was about $580 million, and long-term debt is $2.4 billion. As the company completed the acquisition of TouchCommerce this quarter, it did not see any improvement in its net cash position.The title for this article, Blue Skies, was composed by Irving Berlin and was #1 on the hit parade in 1927. It ranked #1 again in 1978 based on a recording by Johnny Cash. Most lately, it has been sung by Sharon Van Etten in a Corona Beer commercial. For me, the most iconic recording was that of Ella Fitzgerald, and I can't say I have ever seen the beer commercial.The question for long suffering Nuance shareholders is whether these are to be long-term blue skies or just a break in the clouds. My inclination is more blue than cloudy - but challenges still abound.What are the possible clouds if the sky is now blue?One of the legacies of Mr. Ricci's tenure is that Nuance is a far more complex company to look at than many software vendors with annual revenues of $2 billion. Investors simply have not been willing to pay up for the shares in a roll-up, and the company has different strategies for different components of its business. The success of Dragon Medical, for example, really does nothing to enhance the value of the company's enterprise or mobility solutions, and there are few synergies between the solution offerings of Nuance either in terms of revenues or costs.About the only exception to that comment is the Viecore unit, a company specializing in implementing the kind of complex implementations that are inherent in deploying natural language projects for large enterprises. Even nine years after the acquisition of Viecore, Nuance has a differentiated set of implementation capabilities that allow it to compete successfully against many rivals that simply cannot address the customization capabilities provided by Nuance.Overall, however, I imagine that it is this rather crazy quilt of solutions, all having to do with voice, that has been a major deterrent to the ability of larger vendors to make an acceptable offer to consolidate the company. As mentioned earlier in this article, the fact that NUAN is moving to a more divisionalized structure may change that calculus in terms of making pieces of the company more attractive to potential acquirers.I imagine that most observers are concerned that a company of this scale is having to compete with vendors such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or IBM (NYSE:IBM). Many investors feel that Nuance goes head to head with these competitors and must need to have better technology or better pricing to succeed. And the hypothesis has been reinforced over the years by the fact that as more vendors talk about voice and as Nuance's revenues haven't grown, it must be competition with these behemoths that is the problem. Makes sense - it just happens not to be the case.Paul Ricci is many things, but being a fool is not amongst his character flaws. I will let his answer regarding the question stand on its own. Some readers will disagree. My own anecdotal checks suggest that Nuance's issues over the years have more to do with execution and the company's reliance on its older business lines such as transcription, far more than it has had to do with competition. But here is what Mr. Ricci said during this past conference call, and I think it is really far closer to the facts than anything else one is likely to see written on the subject by third-party analysts:As in any transition, the biggest pitfalls are those concerning the decline in legacy revenue streams. Once a business becomes legacy, it simply loses the attention of management, it obviously loses resources and potential customers have to be concerned by the level of support that is going to be provided for a dying product area.One of the nicer things about a transition like this as pointed out by the CEO during the course of the conference call is that as the declining businesses decrease in size, the impact of their decline necessarily diminishes. That is now happening at Nuance, and more than anything else is the single most substantial factor in forecasting that the company should return to positive organic growth and that the organic growth percentages ought to accelerate going forward.It may be hard to believe at this point, but Nuance at one point was built on the back of a business that aggregated dictated patient notes, shopped them to India, and delivered the transcriptions back to the physicians. This business grew consistently and noticeably for many years, and it was highly profitable and seemed almost to be on auto-pilot. If anyone wonders why the company reports ""lines"" in its prepared remarks, it is because of the importance of its transcription results in the past. The transcription business will decline for the foreseeable future. Ricci said thatThe company's reported healthcare revenues are also burdened by an additional transition from perpetual licenses to the cloud, which is one of the factors that creates terrific bookings, but has been and will remain a negative contributor to reported revenues. Management has forecast that the effect of that transition specifically will reverse in the second half of the current fiscal year which will significantly alter the trajectory of reported revenue performance, particularly for the 50% of the business that is healthcare and which may make that segment even more attractive to potential acquirers.It is a key predicate in terms of how this business will perform going forward and eventually how the stock will or will not work for the decline in transcription revenues to diminish. If it does, then many other financial metrics from headline revenue numbers and gross margins will all start to respond to a significant tailwind whose magnitude is certainly neither specifically forecast nor appreciated at the current share valuation.The other major area of secular decline has been the company's handset business. The number of handsets being deployed is not growing, the applications such as voice mail have become commodities and the service providers have to constrain their costs to deal with their own cutthroat pricing environment. It is obvious by now that the declines in the Nuance handset business are going to continue indefinitely.But again, as in medical transcription, there is no solution to the woes of the Nuance cell-phone business within its control. The company is forecasting, that at least in dollar terms, the revenue decline from the handset business will abate during the course of the current fiscal year and that will be sufficient to turn revenues from that division to positive growth.Nuance has a host of other solutions that it is selling within what is described as it mobile solutions group. For reasons buried in the history of the company, Nuance includes its automotive, IoT and other embedded solutions in its mobile business unit. While handset volumes are declining, the company is starting to see decent revenues from its royalties paid by its automotive clients, and it won deals with Daimler (DDAIY) and Ford (NYSE:F) this past quarter.Valuation in the midst of many moving partsHow much are Nuance shares really worth? There are easier questions to tackle - I would prefer for the Jesuits to take on this question. The biggest problem to address is what might the company's real long-term growth rate be? Might it reach double digits? Such a case might be made if one starts to think about sawing off the negative growth boat anchors. Management is basically talking about fiscal 2018 as being a happy year, but the company is still looking for organic growth of just 2-4% with bookings growth of 2-6%, although as mentioned earlier, in an answer to a query Mr. Ricci seemingly belied the numbers presented in the scrip. How does anyone handicap something like that, and is it worth doing so? I can answer that question - if the best that this company can do is to see bookings growth of 2-6%, and it isn't dismembered, most stakeholders will not experience any kind of joyous epiphany. I think the possibility of dismemberment is not insubstantial, and I think the possibility of double-digit bookings growth is greater than 50%. That is the way it should happen, but for most mere mortals, anything to do with this company is a bit of a guess.I think that investors would do well to look at the 10% year-on-year decline in ""lines"" in the company's healthcare transcription business and look as well at the growth to a record of the three-year value of on-demand committed revenues. Looking at the sequence of those two trends suggests to me that the potential for double-digit organic growth is on the table at some time in fiscal 2018. Basically, as the impact of the decline in transcription lines abates and as the impact of more long-term subscription arrangements compound, the company should have a chance to reach the empyrean of double-digit growth.The company has an enterprise value of $6.6 billion and it has forecast sales to be $2.050 billion. That is an EV/s of 3.2. The current consensus EPS is at $1.63, and the new forecast is basically at the same level. So, call the P/E about 10X, a rather compressed level, although one that is a function of the inability of the company to grow reported EPS for some years now.The company generated CFFO last year of $566 million and capex was $54 million. The company is forecasting that CFFO for the current year will be 110% of non-GAAP net income, which would in turn be $531 million.I do not have a crystal ball, but I would be surprised if both earnings and cash flow were not above the forecast. I am going to use $525 million as an estimated free cash flow estimate for this current year. That would provide a free cash flow yield of just short of 8%, a very reasonable valuation for this company, and one that would provide investors with 25-50% positive returns - returns which have been a very long time in coming. I do think that Nuance's shares offer positive alpha, and I think the potential for dismemberment needs to be actively considered at this point."

It was quite a bit warmer for Nuance and its shareholders in the wake of another quarterly beat and another raise in earnings guidance. In terms of the overall highlights of the quarter, operating margins continued their long-term improvement and were 660 bps higher than in the year earlier period. Bookings rose 7% in constant currency, deferred revenues were up by 18% and operating cash flow was $141 million, up 48% from the year earlier period and 125% of non-GAAP net income. The strength in operating cash flow was partially a function of a slightly better than anticipated level of perpetual licenses. In addition, the company continued to enjoy a continued reduction in DSO as revenues coming from multi-year agreements that are collected more or less automatically on a monthly basis continue to rise. It is not, I believe, really feasible for Nuance to continue to realize such a favorable ratio of cash flow to non-GAAP net income over an extended period.I had suggested in an article published on the Seeking Alpha site earlier this year that Nuance was on the cusp of a breakout in both its operating performance and concomitantly its share price. The results published by the company this afternoon validate the thesis that the company is making steady progress in terms of restoring a highly profitable business model, in developing a consistent revenue growth environment for its solutions and for migrating the company's business model such that revenues are more predictable and recurring than in the past. The share price - well the best one can suggest that it is still a work in progress.One factor that has continued to weigh on the company's booking performance is the continued decline in the company's medical transcription business. Many people don't realize just how big a transition that has been for the company to go through. At one time, the company was getting close to 40% of its revenues from medical transcription which is not now and is unlikely to be a growth business over the long term. At this point, the company's medical software solutions are now equal to its transcription business and are growing faster than transcription revenues are shrinking. If there was one surprise in the details of this call it was that the CEO suggested that there were growth opportunities he saw in medical transcription and he expected that these opportunities would surface in the balance of the year. From my own understanding of the numbers, if medical transcription revenues actually grow, or even if they stop declining for a while, Nuance will significantly overachieve the guidance it gave which is for just over $2 billion of revenues and non-GAAP EPS of $1.46 at the mid-point of the guidance range.In listening to the course of many calls from many different management teams over the years, one imagines developing a skill set in understanding the commentary of different executive groups. If I were to attempt to analyze the most surprising macro-comment made by CEO Paul Ricci it was his reasonably direct assertion that macro-trends in the global economy had not hurt the current performance for this company and were not expected to hurt performance for the balance of the current fiscal year. He called out two wins this past quarter in the financial services vertical - at Citi and at Banamex - as examples of users signing up for new initiatives - in these cases in voice biometrics - regardless of their own operating performance. He went on to suggest that the revenue model of the company, with such a large mix of recurring revenues, was somewhat immune to cyclical perturbation and that healthcare IT was more or less not correlated to trends in the broader economy.In my recollection, Paul Ricci is not in the habit of going out of his way to reassure investors - the contrary is more true most of the time. I was quite surprised by just how assertive Mr. Ricci chose to be regarding his confidence in the presented outlook and reading between his lines, one would reasonably conclude that he is looking for significantly stronger percentage bookings growth at some point during the balance of this fiscal year. Despite his enthusiasm, I would point out that it is more or less impossible that the company will be able to substantially grow its fiscal 2016 bookings metric when compared against the prior year which included an extraordinary level of bookings in the automotive sector that will be recognized as revenue over the next several years.Valuation MetricsNuance shares seem to be in a netherworld where they command little to no respect on the part of investors. Although the shares are up by 24% over the past year, they peaked in early December and are down more than 20% since that time. Lots of that is a function of the very weak market for tech stocks over the past couple of months. But I believe that part of that is doubtless, the general lack of effort on the part of the CEO to propitiate investors. For a company of its size, this business does as little as possible to try to communicate its message - giving analysts 30 minutes to ask questions four times a year is probably not a tactic designed to encourage much in the way of recommendations. The low point in that regard was Mr. Ricci's answer to a question about competition - he averred that it hadn't changed much - case closed, next case.For the record and using after-hours prices, Nuance shares are now selling at a bit less than 12X earnings. In the past 12 months the company generated total cash flow of $525 million and free cash flow of about $460 million. As I have written, the current ratio of cash flow to net income is not likely sustainable indefinitely at the moment, the shares sell for 15.2X free cash flow. Again, based on after-hours prices, the company has an EV/S of about 3.5X. About 30% of the operating cash flow is a product of stock-based compensation. That is down from almost 50% in the year earlier quarter.Because of the company's transition and its steady but uneven trend to cloud and subscription revenues, it is somewhat difficult to compare valuation metrics for Nuance to many other companies. It is almost impossible to try to reconcile all of the financial metrics that are provided to some objective standard of growth. As I pointed out in my initial report, a significant amount of growth is masked in the first couple of years after bookings, when the bookings primarily result in revenues that are recognized ratably either in a SaaS or subscription model. That being said, using the least controversial of the various growth metrics, constant currency booking, and adding to that some of the specific comments on this evening conference call and looking at the P/E and the relationship of market cap to free cash flow suggests that the shares, particularly in the wake of their 12% pullback since the start of this year, have significant upside. For what it is worth, the average price target of the nine analysts who cover the shares is $23-33% greater than the after-hours quote. It is conceivable in the wake of the company's performance, its guidance and its commentary that estimates will float up a bit and that price targets will tend to be revised upward, of course depending on the performance in the rest of the market.Specific Growth DriversOne of the particularly important demand drivers for Nuance at this point is something called voice biometrics. Currently, market research suggests most mobile users feel the need to reset their passwords every month. In addition, market research suggests that 85% of users, including this writer, are frustrated with existing authentication technology - I think the word frustrated is in lieu of something a fair bit stronger. In total, 90% of users prefer voice biometrics over the status quo and allegedly corporations can save $15,000 per user over a three-year span by switching to the new technology. I think that if anyone has ever lost their PIN or forgotten the answers to backup security questions, the advantages of voice are obvious.It appears that 2016 is going to be a year in which voice biometric solutions become standard and most corporations and government agencies are going to have to adopt the technology or face trying to work with a degraded user experience. I'm not sure, because management doesn't break out results with this kind of granularity, but it seems conceivable that some of the voice biometric contracts can be as large in dollars as the automotive contracts that have recently animated enterprise bookings growth. While Nuance obviously charges much more per car for its voice solutions than it can possibly charge for user authentication products, banks and other institutions have many times the number of authentications to process than there are cars to equip with voice. Indeed, at some point, voice biometrics will come to cars, I'm told, where voice is used in lieu of keys to open and start cars. (That hasn't happened yet but I believe it is supposed to be one of the on-deck innovations in the near future.)One of the other products that is propelling bookings growth is called Clintegrity 360 which is perhaps the core offering of Nuance Medical. For some years there have been standard codes that are used to document elements of patient care. The codes are necessary for patient billing, of course, and in the long run the use of these codes is supposed to improve patient care and lead to better results for patients. The writer is dubious about that later point - but not dubious at all about how Clintegrity is going to improve the accuracy and timeliness of patient billing and reimbursement to healthcare providers. It is hard to believe, but apparently the latest ICD-10 medical coding standards have 8 times the number of codes compared to the current ICD-9 standard. Simply put, what was awkward and cumbersome heretofore will now be completely infeasible for hospitals and doctors unless they use automated software solutions to read and translate electronic clinical documentation into these new codes. Nuance has something that is called a Clinical Understanding (CLU) engine that is intelligent enough to dramatically reduce errors and of course speed up the manual processes that are swamping hospital administration. Replacing hand coding with an automated process is often a long-term sell, but according to Nuance management, the tipping point has been reached here and the growth in absolute dollars of the Clintegrity solution is starting to overcome the revenue decline in the company's medical transcription business. It would be helpful, to be sure, if management chose to provide observers with just a little quantification beyond what I just wrote, my impression from anecdotal sources is that Clintegrity deals are starting to become very large and very pervasive and users are accepting the Nuance CLU as a standard.It probably sounds very dull and mundane to read about Clintegrity and how it is automating hospital coding and speeding up billing when compared to the far sexier medical diagnostics that IBM (NYSE:IBM) sells using Watson. On the other hand, hospitals these days are all about billing and getting reimbursed and this is one of the better ways to achieve that goal.Overall, management has guided to bookings growth for the current fiscal year of 2-5% at current exchange rates and a bit higher in terms of constant currency. I think it is likely that Nuance might have a breakthrough year in bookings based on the strength it appears to be experiencing with both its Clintegrity and its voice biometric solutions and the intriguing comment of Mr. Ricci about opportunities to sell more medical transcription services.ConclusionNuance reported another quarter of upside encompassing both revenues, earnings and operating cash flow. Deferred revenues, up 18% year over year, suggested that the company is building greater visibility than has heretofore been the case. The company has achieved another quarter of strong margin growth and margins may well have another leg of expansion beyond those forecast by management based on its current $125 million cost transformation program.Of particular interest to this observer were management comments regarding visibility and immunity from cyclical perturbations that have roiled shareholders in many sectors and particularly in tech in recent months. Needless to say the company CEO is not an oracle whose vision on macro correlation to company performance can be accepted without a bit of skepticism, but it was interesting to hear this executive avoid the excuse taken by many peers in other companies when reporting the current quarter and providing his outlook for the balance of the year.The combination of share price declines and improving operating performance has I believe led to a very favorable entry point for investors. Nuance shares have not been deep value since the days of the company's perceived liquidity crisis back during the Great Recession. But nowadays, the company's improving financials coupled with growth that has been masked from investors by the company's transition to a recurring model presents a very favorable and underappreciated combination of risk and rewards for investors."
3974564,98236,2016-05-12T14:19:00-04:00,"Nuance reported somewhat mixed earnings the other day with EPS beating and revenues slightly below expectations.Sub-headline numbers such as operating cash flow - up 33%, and deferred revenue balance - up 17% year on year, were a lot better than the headline numbers.The company's long running transition continues with recurring revenues now 71% of the total, up from 65% in the year-earlier period.The company's cost mitigation efforts are running stronger than had been anticipated.Concern about the company's competitive position ignores the company's strong position in providing customization and implementation services for what are still very custom solutions.","Nuance - Becoming a value name for the wrong reasons.Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) has been one of the more disagreeable names to cover over many years. The shares made a high in the wake of the introduction of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri five years ago that has never been equaled. Since that time, the company's business has endured a long running transition from a model based primarily on perpetual licenses to a model increasingly dependent on revenues from ratable sources.In addition to that transition, the company has been battling the impact of the decline in its medical transition revenues, which are increasingly moving to its software-based solution. It has been a very long journey and one that has obviously worn out the patience of some investors. Is there a real pot of gold at the end of Finian's Rainbow to be measured in investor returns? (In the show, no one gets the gold but everyone goes home happy.)Over the course of the last few months, I have written a couple of articles regarding this name and with regard to shareholder returns - well they have simply been wrong. Not much else to say. At this point, one can repeat the old bromide to the effect that ""it is a marathon not a sprint."" But if you own the name, that doesn't matter all that much.All of that being said, I think the quarterly results, fairly evaluated, were no cause for alarm and actually might be considered to be harbingers of better times - at least for the company. The shares are down a few percent since the earnings release. I would be a buyer of the shares and take advantage of some deep-seated misconceptions about the progress of this company although patience is likely to be required.The company's Q3 results - not clean perhaps but more than decent.Just to get it out of the way, Nuance missed its prior revenue guidance by about 1% and it lowered its forecast of revenues for the next two quarters by 1-1.5%. This company sells a mix of perpetual licenses, which are expected to decline both absolutely and as a proportion of the total and various kinds of subscription and usage based contractual arrangements that are recognized ratably.Last quarter, product licensing revenues declined by 9% year on year and ratable revenues increased by 7% on the same basis. At this point, hosting revenues are greater than licensing revenues and maintenance revenues rose as well. Total non-GAAP revenues for the period were essentially flat with the year earlier period. Overall, the revenue miss was less than 1%. And the company guided revenues lower than prior expectations for the balance of the year by between 1%-1.5% based on its belief that the switch to ratable revenues will continue to limit revenue growth for the balance of the year. That is the limit and the substance of the bad news.A bit more ambiguously, the company reported a net new bookings number that rose 3% year on year. That's probably consistent with consensus estimates given that the company had previously forecast net bookings growth of 2-5%. There are two things to note about the net bookings metric. One is that during the course of an accelerating transition to both on-demand and subscription revenue models, the metric is going to show lower growth than would be the case if the company made apples to apples comparisons.While terms are going to vary significantly from deal to deal, ratable deals will rarely be signed for the equivalent of the license revenue for a comparable amount of software. As long as perpetual license revenue are shrinking, bookings growth, as is reported by Nuance, is going to be facing a significant headwind. The other point to note is that net bookings, which is what Nuance actually reports essentially exclude the value of renewals except for the increased value of renewals above the ratable amount, which was recognized in the initial bookings cycle.Of course the whole concept of SaaS and other forms of subscription revenue models is that renewal contracts gradually build up and eventually significantly exceed the value of perpetual license arrangements. Most pure SaaS vendors do include the value of renewals in their bookings number and none of them have the issue of trying to account for a transition, which will inevitably under-report the value of business that has been sold.It has proven to be a significant barrier for perceptions of this company to overcome this net new bookings definition and that's not going to change all that soon, I expect.The good news is that the company reported an earnings beat of more than 8%. Non-GAAP earnings rose by 17% year over year. The company's cost rectification program has exceeded prior targets and expense discipline remains quite strong. Overall, the company raised its EPS target for the year from $1.52 to $1.56. Given the $.03 beat in Q2 and given the fact that this company has reduced outstanding shares by 7% in the wake of the transaction in which the company acquired $500 million of the stake of Carl Icahn and some affiliates. Somewhat curiously, Icahn continues to own about 11% of the shares in the company leaving one to ponder his motivations for selling $500 million of stock.Nuance has earned $.74/share in the first half of its fiscal year. Just the change in outstanding shares coupled with flat revenue and margin performance in the last two quarters of fiscal 2016 (ends 9/30) would yield a result that is $1.53/share in earnings. Although seasonal factors are less important as more and more of the company's revenues are ratable, there is still the inevitable seasonal bump in Q4. So, the earnings estimate is quite conservative and self-evidently leaves room for significant upside.Stock-based comp for this company has been essentially flat year over year through six months. Stock-based comp is running at 8% of revenues, significantly less than many other companies in the tech world report.Another positive metric was the growth in operating cash flow. So far this year, cash flow has risen by almost 30%. Cash flow for this last reported quarter of $160 million was an all-time record. The biggest factor in the increase in cash flow has been the substantial decrease in the GAAP net loss primarily due to the improvement in GAAP operating margins. In addition, receivables decreased due to an improvement in DSO.While much of the improvement in DSO was the impact of better collections, the shift from a perpetual licensing model with it where the customer is billed upfront for the license to a ratable billings model, where most charges are billed every month has a significant impact on the level. Overall DSO dropped from 74 days to 68 days, which generated a significant amount of cash flow. In addition, the other balance sheet items that make up cash flow showed a significant improvement of more than $40 million through the first six months of the year.Cash flow from operations is running at well over 130% of non-GAAP net income. It is not likely that it will be able to continue at that rate indefinitely during the midst of the transition from perpetual to ratable revenues. I think that cash flow from operations can run at $625-640 million for the full year. It was $301 million for the first half of the year. CapEx is running at an annualized rate of about $65 million. Free cash flow is likely to be around $550-$560 million for the full year.OK - the earnings release was decent, if not great. But what is the investment case for this company and how long do we have to wait before it becomes visible?Simply put, the investment case is that headline metrics will become increasingly positive as the transition draws to an end over the next 12-18 months. It is not a simple task to figure out what's really going on at this company from the standpoint of a definable growth number. It has been that way now for several years and the shares have or they have really oscillated back and forth but gone nowhere.The first thing to note is that the recurring revenue cohort of revenue has reached 71% up from 65% a year ago. One way to think about it, and most people will not likely accept this argument, is that the company has lost the equivalent of $70 million of license revenues in the past six months as business transitioned from up front licenses to ratable.Of course that assumes that all of the customers who bought ratable products would have bought perpetual license products if those were all that were on offer. Essentially, every dollar of increase in ratable revenue is probably the equivalent to $4 of what otherwise would have been license revenue. (Not the most precise way of looking at things but rather than go through a rambling discussion, I think the relationship is reasonable enough for the point I am trying to make.)Needless to say, at some point, there is a crossover and since 71% of revenues are now ratable, that crossover is pretty close. But honestly, I thought it was pretty close several months ago. Over time, as license revenues become an increasingly less important cohort of total revenues, it should be possible for ratable revenues to increase without a corresponding decrease in license revenues.In hindsight, this company might have done better and bitten the bullet and stopped selling perpetual license solutions - it would have killed reporting earnings for a few years. But investors have tended to look past those events in other companies such as Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Aspen (NASDAQ:AZPN) and even Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK). If investors could see the underlying progress to a total ratable model they would likely value the shares more highly even if reported earnings and revenues were lower. Here, the waters are so muddy that no one can determine exactly what is happening.I think the transition becomes clearer if one looks over a multi-year period. Back in fiscal 2012, this company had $658 million of license revenue. Ratable revenues at that point were $662 million. By 2015, license revenue had fallen to $475 million and ratable revenue had increased to $975 million. This year it appears that license revenue is on a pace to decline to about $425 million, while ratable revenues in total should reach nearly $1.045 billion. So, since fiscal 2012, license revenues have decreased by $235 million, or about 35%, while ratable product revenues have grown by $385 million or 58%.Overall, that is a pretty good trade, but at the moment, it doesn't look that way since the gross margin on license revenue is 87% while the gross margin on ratable revenues is just 36%. Over time, the gross margin on ratable revenue is going to increase markedly to the gross margins that are typically achieved by subscription companies of between 70%-80%. There were some signs of gross margin improvement in the just reported quarter.But beyond the simple mathematics of converting license revenue to subscription revenues, there's another equally significant transition underway in a couple of the company's key business units. The healthcare vertical is still the largest revenue producer for Nuance. Last quarter, about 51% of Nuance's total revenue came from its healthcare operation. Healthcare revenues were essentially flat last quarter and that is a combination of two significant factors. For many years, Nuance was essentially running a very large healthcare transcription service that utilized offshore labor to literally write up case notes that doctors dictated. That business, not too surprisingly, is in long-term secular decline. Management said that it is falling 5% year on year.In the meantime, most of the transcription customers are migrating to Dragon Medical and these days cloud-based Dragon Medical One. The company has to sell increasing levels of its cloud-based and subscription offerings simply to stay in the same place. The company's business in medical is quite a bit more sophisticated than simply voice recognition. The company uses its natural language technology to enable Dragon Diagnostics and Clintegrity.But most of those revenues are cloud-based at this point so despite their rapid growth, they are simply, at this point, serving to make up for the steady decline of medical transcription. Further, because most medical solutions are complex and need to be highly customized, it can take 12-18 months before a booking starts to be recognized in revenue.Many readers are familiar with the things that IBM (NYSE:IBM) is doing with Watson in the healthcare field. Nuance is a component and an adjunct for that in the world of diagnostics and clinical data information. It is an excellent growth business for Nuance but it is hard for observers to see that at the moment when medical transcription continues to decline.The other significant business in which product transitions are meeting up with a mix shift to ratable revenues is what Nuance describes as Mobile. Mobile revenues are 19% of the total and declined, in reported terms, by around 10% quarter on quarter. In the real world, mobile revenues are not likely to be declining, but it certainly looks as though that is the case.A few years ago, most of the company's mobile revenues came from pretty basic solutions such as voice mail to text and mobile phone provisioning and set-up. Again, hardly surprisingly, that business is declining rapidly as the price of handsets continues its steady decline and as handset shipments plateau and begin to decline.The largest growth element in mobile these days is intelligent voice solutions for the car and this company has won design awards for many, many car companies. These days, the hot area for the use of voice in cars is as part of intelligent infotainment systems. The issue with the company's automotive business isn't that the potential is far greater than the declines being experienced within the telephone handset space but that 100% of the revenue is hosted. And revenues can't be recognized until the cars with the technology are shipped which means that Nuance gets no revenue on design awards for at least a year and probably more after it wins design contracts.I have no idea as to whether or when autonomous cars go mainstream. Personally, I can scarcely wait for them. Driving in metro New York and particularly driving into Manhattan is the opposite of fun. I imagine, however, that if autonomous goes mainstream, voice commands of various kinds are going to be necessary. It seems highly unlikely that the kind of people who will want to drive or be driven in an autonomous vehicle are going to want to use a relatively awkward keyboard. If that is ever a real market, I imagine that Nuance will enjoy a significant market share.Five years ago, Apple's Siri, the voice component of which is based on Nuance technology, was considered cutting edge in the iPhone world. Nowadays, it is pretty much ubiquitous. Nuance sells the technology to many of the carriers around the world and the company customizes the specific offerings for the carriers. Of course, the cost of DragonGo and Dragon Personal Assistant, as these solutions are known, is far more than the per unit charges for voice to text, but again it takes time for the bookings that come from design wins to translate into significant revenues and even the bookings for DragonGo and Dragon Personal Assistant are materially understated since it is hard to forecast the revenue stream of a service that has never been offered before by a specific customer and which has not yet launched.As is true for many companies, Nuance has some obvious opportunities coming from the emergence of the Internet of Things ((IoT)) which will be part of its mobile revenue scheme. Some readers are skeptical that IoT is happening and others will be skeptical regarding Nuance's offerings. I can't assuage those concerns by rhetoric and IoT is not likely to produce revenue before sometime in FY 2017.The other two business segments in which Nuance operates are Enterprise and Imaging. Enterprise represents about 19% of total revenues and it grew 13%. The company has some ""hot"" solutions such as voice biometrics and the use of Nina, which is another flavor of a functionality essentially comparable to that offered in Siri. Nina is being used in what is called ""multi-channel intelligent self-service"" capabilities that are starting to replace first generation call centers. This was the fourth quarter of relatively decent results for Enterprise after a long, long transition.Imaging is the newest and smallest of the Nuance business units and it contributed about 12% of revenues. Imaging revenues declined 5% year on year. The division suffered from that age-old enterprise software disease end of quarter itis. The segment was said to have strong net new bookings growth although what that means in the context of failing to close several large deals at the end of the quarter is a bit difficult to understand. The improvement in operating margins more than offset the decline in revenues of this segment.Transitions almost always take longer than expected and have lots of ups and downs. This transition has taken longer than I had once thought. It has been burdened by the time it has taken for ratable revenues to significantly overtake traditional license revenues. And it has also been burdened by a second set of transitions in which older use cases are being replaced by new use cases. The new use cases almost inevitably are semi-custom solutions, they are 100% ratable and their impact is just now becoming apparent. How long before this company starts to print the kind of headline numbers that will excite investors? I have been wrong in the past as to just how long it will be before the true growth potential of this company becomes apparent. My guess at this moment is that a succession of breakout quarters is perhaps a year, perhaps 18 months away. My confidence in that projection isn't high. These shares are simply not for impatient investors although by now I doubt if the ownership base has many investors remaining who are really impatient.ValuationThe response to the Nuance earnings release was relatively muted. The shares dropped about 3% on a day in which the IGV tech-software index was flat. But as earnings and cash flow estimates rise, Nuance shares are starting to take on some elements of a value profile.In the wake of the earnings release and estimate tweaking, Nuance shares sell at a forward P/E for the next 12 months of about 10.5X. I suppose the value of that type of ratio is in the eyes of the beholder but it one of the more modest P/Es that Nuance has seen in many years. Given the relatively modest use of stock based comp at Nuance, the company probably has a lower relative valuation than might be suggested by just looking at the P/E.Nuance has a current market cap of $5 billion. It has a negative cash balance of $2 billion, which leaves an enterprise value of $7 billion. That yields an EV/S of 3.5X. Not the cheapest I have seen, but certainly a metric that could readily grow if the rest of the story plays out.Free cash flow, as mentioned above, is likely to be in the range of $560 million. As is the case for most tech companies, Nuance does not forecast free cash flow or operating cash flow and I have had to make some assumptions in coming to a free cash flow estimate. There are many elements in the cash flow analysis that would be difficult to forecast with all of the data in the world. But I think $560 billion is a not unreasonable estimate. Free cash flow at the middle of the fiscal year stood at $270 million.With a $7 billion enterprise value, the free cash flow yield is forecast to be 9.5%. That's certainly a relatively high free cash flow yield for this space and perhaps an indication that many investors are dubious about the company's transformation efforts.The biggest threat to the transformation of this company is going to come from potential competition. The rest of the trends are really well known and visible. Most of the applications that this company sells, which are likely to drive future progress already exist and have visible trends. And most of the solutions sets that are declining also are quite visible at this point. And the company has managed to squeeze OpEx and there is little reason to imagine that operating margin growth will not continue.But many analysts and investors think that the competition in this space is becoming greater than Nuance will be able to handle at some point. Again, it is hard to say that Google/Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the principal voice competitors at this time, will not be threats down the road. They have huge resources relative to Nuance and natural language/AI is going to be an area of focus for most larger technology companies because of its enormous future potential.The reasons that Nuance has won and keeps on winning, in its major markets and verticals, are primarily driven by its customization and engineering services capabilities. None of the technology it sells other than Dragon for Windows can simply be plugged in and made to operate. Every user has to have customization. Some years ago, Nuance bought a company called Viecore. Viecore was then and remains to this day the go-to speech/natural language customizing source. I think many readers probably underrate the differentiation that Nuance is able to offer because of the capabilities of its engineering and consulting services.I obviously cannot say that either Google or MSFT will not try to build similar capabilities. But it is not a trivial undertaking. One can't do a job posting at an online site and find developers or consultants who have experience in the field. I think that investors probably overrate the threat that's actually posed by both Google and MSFT.Summing UpNuance reported a relatively decent fiscal Q2, although one that illustrated that its transformation process still has some ways to go, and frankly more of a way to go than I had thought likely. Revenues were a bit soft. The company's bookings definition tends to obscure more than enlighten. The growth in deferred revenues of 17% year over year was the single most unalloyed sign that the company's revenue machine - its sales operation - is alive and well and doing what it needs to do. In addition, the company's cost transformation efforts are showing continued progress. A significant component in the growth of operating cash flow was driven by the substantial improvement in GAAP profitability. Stock-based competition is relatively small and has been flat over the last couple of quarters.While the transition to ratable revenues picked up some steam last quarter and recurring revenues increased to 71% of the total from 65% in the prior year, it is evident that there are transitions in the solution area that also are weighing on results. In particular, revenues of the company's older mobile handset apps are declining and the company's healthcare transcription business is in long-term secular decline being replaced by far more automated solutions that are sold by Nuance.As I pointed out, it is likely that company guidance, particularly for EPS, is unduly conservative in the wake of the significant decline in outstanding shares after the company bought 40% of Icahn's stake in the company. The CEO, Paul Ricci, during the course of the conference call actually talked explicitly about some expectations from fiscal 2017. That, in itself, is unusual for Mr. Ricci. He spoke to expectations for a 100 bps improvement in operating margins, which seems likely and probably less than internal targets.Many readers know Paul Ricci based on commentary regarding his compensation. It certainly hasn't been correlated with the company's stock price. But that being said, because of the lack of share price performance, Mr. Ricci's compensation is less than has been reported.Mr. Ricci talked about a 100-200 bps improvement in revenue growth compared to FY'2016. The ambiguity in that is that there will be little or no revenue growth this year so we are left to guess about what the company's outlook really might be for revenue growth. The consensus estimate for revenue growth next year is for 2.7%. My guess is that revenue growth will be greater than that.The company shares, because of lack of significant alpha, are coming to take on some of the characteristics of a value stock. But I believe that absent the transitions, the more likely longer-term growth rate for the company is in the low double-digit range and with rising margins to boot as the transition to recurring revenues starts to change the business model for the better.That Nuance is a show-me stock is, I think, self-evident at this point. It will not produce positive alpha, absent some rumors about its acquisition, until it starts to print traditionally good headline numbers. But patient investors are likely to be well rewarded by either holding the shares or in initiating new positions, I believe."
3781676,98236,2015-12-29T15:22:00-05:00,"Nuance is starting to see the benefits of its transition to selling complex Natural Language Processing Solutions.Nuance has forecast exceptionally modest targets for earnings, revenues and bookings growth for the current fiscal year.Nuance is dramatically under followed and less understood than many other information technology companies of its size.The company's transition to a recurring revenue model is probably two-thirds completed and very poorly appreciated or valued.Nuance is really a beneficiary of significant magnitude to the concept of the ""Connected Car.""","Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) shares have achieved a substantial level of share price appreciation during the course of 2015. Shares started the year at $14.32 and have appreciated by more than 40% this past year to current levels just over $20. And yet long-term observers and investors have heard the same tune for many years. At the start of the decade Nuance shares made an even greater journey, rising from about $15 at the start of 2010 to a high of more than $28 two years later before falling as low as $13.50 by November of 2013 and then beginning the present sustained climb at the start of this year.And for those interested in a bit more history, the same basic observation is valid - Nuance has been one of those companies with lots of promise that has had a hard time in sustaining operating performance at levels that have been sufficient to consistently attract investors. Why is this time going to be any different? Will the same discouraging scenario come back to haunt the unwary and the uninitiated again?This author has been around for the triumphs and the tragedies of this company for many years, watching it grow and then retrench for more than half a dozen years. That's a lot of punishment even by the harsh standards of the information technology space. And yet hope springs eternal - or so goes the saying - and I do think that this time Nuance has a better than even chance of achieving profitable and consistent double-digit growth.Nuance shares are potentially not unknown to readers of Seeking Alpha having recently been the subject of a three-part series by contributor Mark Chapman. On the other hand, given the company's size and its technology, the company seems to me to be significantly under followed at this point. At the moment, Nuance has 10 analysts publishing estimates. Tableau (NYSE:DATA), which is a company with a roughly comparable enterprise value and around 42% of the revenues of Nuance, is expected to have in 2016 no fewer than 29 published estimates.Just for the record, I'm not trying to disparage either Tableau or its shares, just pointing out how little hype Nuance has. Also, I'm not trying to suggest that Nuance competes with or is selling the same kind of software - my point is that these are both enterprise software vendors of comparable market capitalization. DATA is very well known by the investment community and very well hyped as well. Nuance exists in a seemingly quiet backwater.If one looks a bit further there are some other interesting comparisons. Thomson/Reuters has the average rating for Tableau at a 2.1 on a scale where 1.0 is a strong buy and 5.0 is a sell. Over the past year, Tableau has seen five coverage initiations, four have been buys and one has been a neutral. The average price target for the shares is just above $117 which would be a return of 23%, far better than the current year return which has been 14%By comparison, Nuance has an average rating of slightly less than Tableau but has seen only two initiations over the past year (they were both buys), the latest of the two being that of Raymond James on June 3rd. Not a single brokerage has initiated coverage on Nuance in the past seven months and the average price target of the nine brokers who are covering the name is $22.78 which is a mere 12% above current share price levels and certainly a marked deceleration from the performance of Nuance shares over the past year.There is a reason for that of course, and it's a pretty simple one. Analysts are estimating that Nuance is going to achieve something like 4% sales growth and they are forecasting less than 13% growth in EPS. Tableau on the other hand is expected to achieve revenue growth of 34% and earnings growth of 38%. Nevermind about absolute valuation metrics - no one who owns or is thinking of owning Tableau shares cares for that kind of analysis. All the positive analysts and all of the current holders and all of the prospective buyers of the shares are concerned with growth and the magnitude of earnings and revenue beats. Probably the single greatest factor in preventing Tableau share price from escalating further is the consensus view that growth in revenues will decelerate from 58% in 2015 to 34% for the 2016 year.Again, my purpose here is not to critique the valuation of Tableau. Plenty of people have done so since the company became public a bit over two years ago and plenty of people have been wrong. But the point that needs to be made again is simply this: Nuance shares are valued as they are in the context of limited information and with very modest growth expectations. With few analysts covering the name the likelihood of anyone straying far from the consensus is pretty low. And it isn't going to take some kind of unprecedented improvement in the outlook for the company relative to the current consensus to have a potentially dramatic impact on the company's share price. And while the kinds of investors willing to pay a huge premium for growth are obviously absent from the ownership profile of Nuance shares these days, some visibility that top line growth is accelerating coupled with other positive financial metrics is likely to find a relatively large universe of potential investors - although to be realistic, the kinds of investors for Tableau aren't going to be buying Nuance shares any time soon.So let's step back for a moment and try to evaluate with the tools that we have just how likely it might be for the company to achieve some kind of breakthrough results over the next 6-12 months. Before getting started on that exercise I want to point out for all readers who are not familiar with the name that Nuance is a roll-up. If you hate roll-ups stop here and spend your time sipping your morning coffee or admiring the Jets or mourning the Patriots or whatever else you might do. Don't bother to read further. Another point that ought to be made is that compared to most other software companies, Nuance does not offer and never will offer any kind of integrated suite of products. Most of what the company does can broadly be categorized as some form of voice recognition software. But the product offering probably most familiar to many readers, Dragon for Windows, has nothing whatsoever to do with the products that are sold to wireless operators or to automotive companies or to financial institutions and most importantly to hospitals and other healthcare providers. And a third point to make - this is a bear of a company to try to analyze. It has four segments that report revenues and operating profits which tend to have different demand drivers and which are in turn divided into different components. And all of these segments are at various stages of transitioning from the historically standard software model of perpetual licenses to various forms of subscription and hosted revenue models and these in turn have different and arcane revenue recognition standards.If all that scares you stop right now because it's a fact of life and it's unlikely to change any time in the near future. Again, just as a comparison point, Tableau Software basically does one thing - it provides users with business analytics software and it does it very well. Almost no one would argue that there are products in the market from credible vendors that match Tableau Decision or Tableau Server.Nuance, on the other hand, has multiple products in multiple business segments which have various levels of scalability and competitive differentiation. I promise I have no intention of trying to attempt to evaluate all of the things that Nuance does. But this is a complicated company to understand and evaluate and that's almost certainly one of the reasons that it hasn't been covered as extensively as might otherwise be the case. It also suggests part of the reason behind what I perceive to be a substantial share price appreciation opportunity.One of the keys to understanding Nuance is to try to understand the ongoing transition from the company's historical license revenue model to a model that's substantially derived from recurring streams of revenue. Recurring revenue in this case doesn't always mean SaaS/Cloud revenues. It means both hosted/cloud based offerings as well as subscription revenues. Over the past three years, recurring revenues as defined by Nuance have grown from 52% to 68% of total revenues while license revenues have declined from 38% to 23% over the same period. That trend is certainly going to continue although at some point in the next few years the percentages are going to approach an asymptote. When that happens, reported numbers for Nuance are likely going to show growth percentages far beyond anything that most investors currently anticipate.Since fiscal year 2012, traditional product license revenues have declined from $658 mil. to $475 mil. while recurring product revenues (subscription) have grown from $158 mil. to $254 mil. and hosted/cloud revenues have grown from $496 mil. to $721 mil. Overall, adjusted product revenues have climbed by 42% since FY'12 from $734 mil to $1044 mil. last year. I won't try to do the detailed math here although it's an interesting exercise. But if one tried to adjust the revenue streams from the different sources, it would show that Nuance has been achieving product revenue growth, which I think is the best category to consider, of something around 13%. (The calculation is based on converting reported license revenues to what would have been reported if all product shipments had been hosted - in year one hosted revenues average about 12% of reported license revenues and beyond that point, license revenues would add about 25% of their value to a hosted model). In the last fiscal year (ended 9/30/15), for example, Nuance reported essentially no growth in terms of both its total revenues and product revenues. On the other hand, making an apples to apples adjustment using the methodology described above, the company's product revenues grew by almost 5%. (To be clear, Nuance also derives revenues from Professional Services and from maintenance and support that it characterizes as recurring - on the other hand those revenues and their annual changes are driven by product revenues so I have excluded them from my own analysis.)In addition to reducing reported revenues significantly, the swing to a recurring revenue stream had eroded margins substantially. On a reported basis, in the early years of any contract, hosted revenues are far less profitable than perpetual revenues. Obviously hosted revenues require Nuance to develop a significant infrastructure on which clients can run Nuance applications. But in addition, and perhaps of even more significance, Nuance has to record all of its sales compensation expenses when they happen, i.e. up front, and it cannot recognize hosted revenues until the products it sells generate billings, i.e. the customer goes into production with the Nuance application. Nuance sells perhaps the most customized applications in the enterprise software world. There are no such things as a standard Nuance implementation. When it books a contract it has to spend large sums to get the application into production and it has to expense those costs while not recording any revenues even if it receives progress payments from its customers as is often the case. Again, to be clear, Nuance has a great business customizing and implementing its software and that business generates cash consistent with its expenses. The problem is that under current revenue recognition standards neither hosting revenues or consulting revenues can be reported until the user is in production.The rapid increase in deferred revenues which rose 22% last year and have risen by 38% in two years is basically a function of this trend and is part of the driving force behind the increase in operating cash flow in a period during which reported EPS growth has been negligible.I'm not going to try to attempt the exercise of trying to calculate what the ""real"" EPS might be adjusted for the headwinds of the transition, and obviously even operating cash flows are impacted by switching from a perpetual to hosted revenue model, but suffice it to say that the company would be far more profitable than its current forecasted EPS of about $1.40 suggests.I think that one might readily make the case from the above discussion that Nuance shares, even in the wake of the strong price appreciation over the past 12 months, remains significantly undervalued compared to peer companies. Nuance would appear to be a company achieving ""economic"" revenue growth in the mid-teens that generates more cash flow than reported earnings and which has substantial pricing power allowing it to generate relatively high margins that are likely to improve over time as its hosted and subscription revenue streams mature. While one is never really able to assess the motivations of others, I imagine that it was calculations such as these that influenced Carl Icahn to take a 19% stake in the company over the past couple of years. At this point his investment is just marginally profitable but one assumes that he is more or less pleased by the progress of management from an operating standpoint and certainly pleased by the level of margin improvement that the company has recently been able to achieve despite the transition headwinds.While I have consumed lots of space and many electrons trying to make the case that Nuance shares are a bargain hiding in plain sight, that's actually not the principle component of my thesis. If I believed that management guidance which calls for little or no revenue growth this current fiscal year with total revenues forecast to be about $2bil., modest EPS growth to about $1.40 at the mid-point and just 2%-5% growth in net bookings, I do not think I would have bothered to write about the company and its share price outlook at this point. It would take some fantastic exogenous event to get me to write about a company if I believed that its core business growth was really likely to be 2%-5%. Life is simply too short in the information technology to space to waste time and eyeballs focusing on companies with that level of growth regardless of their hidden values. The metrics presented suggest that Nuance is probably an attractive acquisition candidate as an acquirer would have the ability to look through the multiple transitions in the company's financial model. On the other hand forecasting something like an acquisition is a bootless exercise at the best.It is my own view writing today that Nuance has a significant opportunity to exceed guided ranges by a meaningful amount for all of the three principal metrics. Should that be the case, then operating cash flow and free cash flow as well will show meaningful upside although their precise relationship to non-GAAP earnings is really unknowable in advance. Before embarking on a hopefully brief explanation of my expectations, it's worth noting that Nuance is a company that has often dramatically exceeded its guided ranges. Indeed it did so yet again during the past couple of reported quarters. It's also true that at the start of the model transition and as recently as 2013 the company struggled to quantify how its model changes would wind up impacting reported numbers. But this is a company in which guidance is far from a science and the variability around forecasted targets is probably as great as any other company in the software space.As I have written earlier, Nuance is a tedious company to try to understand. That is perhaps one reason why it's under followed and undervalued. And of course it's a roll-up and that turns off lots of investors as well - until it doesn't. But Nuance has a dominant and leading position in one of the more important technologies that can change the computer/human interface over an extended time period. The basic break out technology that Nuance is offering in various flavors is something called Natural Language Processing (NLP). NLP is a form of artificial intelligence that is promoted by computational linguistics. Most people think of Nuance as a vendor of voice recognition software and jump to the conclusion that it's playing in a commoditized area without the ability to sell differentiated solutions. Nothing could be further from the truth.While the goal of NLP has been around for at least 50 years it's only the evolution of the technology in the past decade that has made solutions based on NLP ready for prime time. A significant amount of the technology that Nuance is using in its NLP offerings is part of the acquisition it made about five years ago when it purchased all of IBM's (NYSE:IBM) voice software which had been focused on developing the NLP opportunity. IBM has gone off to concentrate on the technology that animates Watson, its artificial intelligence offering, while Nuance, using the base of technology acquired from IBM, has concentrated on the actual speech interface. It's that technology and not voice recognition that differentiates what Nuance sells. And that's what I expect to create substantial upsides to the company's operating performance over the coming years beyond what management has forecast and the consensus estimates.The first manifestation of NLP from Nuance was in the Siri facility embedded in the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. While there has been a lot of mystery and speculation regarding Siri, the fact is that it was a development project for which Apple paid Nuance a flat sum somewhere in the range of $50 mil./year according to many knowledgeable observers. It was enthusiasm with regard to Siri and the Apple relationship that drove Nuance shares to the highs they achieved in 2011. Because the relationship with Apple wasn't based on a per phone charge it really had no financial leverage for Nuance which is one of the reasons why investors became disenchanted. In fact, I believe that the margins Nuance was able to achieve on its consulting relationship with Apple were probably negligible at best. But Nuance got invaluable experience in creating functioning NLP solutions that it has taken into various other products that have the potential to change the growth dynamics of the company.About three years ago, the company launched a product called Nina. Nina is to the company's enterprise market as Siri was to iPhones. Without attempting to provide a lengthy discussion regarding what the Nina technology does, from a functional perspective it allows users to re-launch call center technology. By using a natural language dialog, solutions embodying Nina can do away with the menus and frustration that usually animate automated transactions we all have had with call centers. Simply put, properly deployed, Nina can allow customers like us to use a call center without human interaction and get complex queries answered. It's one of the few things in the information technology space that produces a competitive advantage for the buyer and it is on the cusp of significant adoption. I do not intend to write the script for a Nina commercial. Nuance has a large staff that does that. But my own anecdotal checks have convinced me that the technology has essentially reached the tipping point where in many verticals, particularly including financial services, it's important to have the capability. Creating a better customer experience is a mantra for almost every customer facing organization these days. Nina is one of the few ways that Nuance customers can create improved customer satisfaction and call centers based on Nina technology are becoming a significant competitive differentiator for many Nuance customers.Nuance also has started to use voice biometric technology as a security feature. I would be loath to call Nuance a data security play but the fact is that voice biometrics work well on the desktop for many enterprises and can also ease all of the annoying security questions that these days are an inevitable component of the call center experience. For a long time, the enterprise space for Nuance has seen very little growth - there are very few potential users who do not have call centers. The Nina revolution has the potential and indeed the likelihood to change all of that. Breakouts are really difficult to quantify in advance - tipping points are always impossible to forecast except in arrears. That being said, it appears to this observer that Nuance has reached an inflection point in its Enterprise business.The largest business unit for Nuance has been and will almost certainly remain the company's healthcare segment. Healthcare produced 47% of the company's revenues last year and a slightly higher percentage of what Nuance describes as its segment profit. Many years ago healthcare for Nuance meant mainly off shored medical transcription services and the company still does some of that. But starting a bit over two years ago, Nuance rolled out a virtual assistant for healthcare called Florence that is also built on NLP. Basically Florence allows just about any smart device to be used as a dictation tool that allows physicians to dramatically improve work flows or clinical documentation as it's called in the industry. Instead of sending transcription to India and then getting it returned after some lag, Florence simply automates the entire process. Needless to say, Florence has dramatically cut into the transcription service business that Nuance has offered for many years but as the technology catches hold, it's my belief that most physicians will migrate to a Nuance solution that is going to have major growth implications going forward. Of course the gradual change from human-based transcription to cloud-based software services is going to have major margin implications as well. It was interesting to note that healthcare segment margins climbed by over 300 basis points sequentially and more than 400 basis points year-on-year in the last reported quarter despite the absence of any reported revenue growth. The Clintegrity suite of ICD-10 compliant solutions is the name that Nuance uses for its automated transcription services. Government regulations are increasingly going to drive users to automate and Nuance is going to be the outsize beneficiary of the trend.The company also offers what it calls its Dragon Medical Clinical Advisor again based on NLP technology that actually allows less trained medical personnel to enter routine diagnostic data into automated clinical information systems. Nuance has developed partnerships with many leading medical information software companies such as Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) and it often bundles Dragon Medical into large hospital procurements along with Clintegrity.Again, forecasting crossover points is a tricky exercise, but according to my own field checks, it would appear that the growth in Clintegrity and Dragon is starting to overwhelm the longer term secular decline in medical transcription services. Nuance doesn't break down precisely how it sets its booking forecast. From what I believe this is another area that will potentially yield substantial upside relative to guidance and the published consensus in the current fiscal year.The final area that ought to be discussed is what Nuance describes as mobile and consumer. The ""connected car"" has gotten a huge amount of hype along with the concept of autonomous vehicles. Of the two, the connected car is a reality so far as Nuance is concerned. Clearly the company's third fiscal quarter showed an outsize increase in bookings (47%) primarily led by large automotive companies' signing up for voice services in their automobiles. Nuance doesn't get a huge amount of revenue per car (probably less than $10 on average) and what it does get varies by the breadth of capabilities offered in each vehicle. But with US auto sales at an annual run rate modestly shy of 20 million units the recurring revenue potential for Nuance is substantial given the company's base and dominant market position. It will take at least a couple of years before bookings become revenues. Every design win means that Nuance has to customize an offering for each model. Until cars equipped with the software start to ship each win creates expenses and no reported revenues. It's interesting to see the scalpel that Nuance has been able to take to its expenses while having to deal with its very stringent revenue recognition model.Finally, what Nuance calls its mobile service operator business is becoming a major demand driver. It uses NLP technology to allow the service providers to let customers set up their own mobile devices without much human intervention and to try to upsell customers while they turn on their phones. The growth of this opportunity is being offset to a degree by the implosion in pricing and the slowing growth in the market for voice technology used in handsets. Obviously if you can buy an iPhone of some kind for $5/month, the opportunity Nuance has to collect growing revenues in what is probably a low growth or even a no-growth market by units is not great. While it's easy for me to see inflection points at work in both enterprise and healthcare, and while growth in automotive and other consumer devices looks to be inevitable, mobile is likely to be the lowest growth segment of Nuance bookings for the next 12 months-plus although this is clearly already baked into management's forecast.I have taken up more than enough of your reading time. The net of my thesis is that Nuance shares are significantly undervalued simply based on consensus numbers. But I think it's fair to say that this company has underlying growth opportunities significantly greater than forecast and that means that the upside is far more significant than is realized by much of the investment community. It would probably be irresponsible to posit the kind of earnings achievement Nuance could achieve. It wasn't that long ago when management was forecasting EPS of above $2.00 on a lower revenue base. That never happened of course as the transition storms swamped those forecasts. On the other hand it seems to this observer that if bookings growth can achieve double-digit trends this year and beyond it would be readily possible for the company to achieve more than $2.00 in EPS in the foreseeable future. And with that level of reported earnings coupled with double-digit growth in bookings - the appreciation potential that Nuance shares offer is probably significantly above 50%. Wishful thinking or day dreaming? I'm sure there are many doubters who have gone through long dry spells with this management. That being said, I think it not unreasonable to speculate that this is a time for investors to listen to the Nuance music."
3771546,53622,2015-12-22T11:57:16-05:00,"A history of excessive CEO compensation has turned many investors away from the company.Finally, CEO compensation is coming down to more reasonable levels.A focus on free cash flow growth could lead to multiple expansion, with two valuation scenarios discussed.","This is the third part of a series that lays out my rationale as to why I'm long Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN). Part 1 focused on the company background and the Imaging, Enterprise and Healthcare segments. Part 2 focused on the Mobile and Consumer segment, which coincidently appears to directly relate to Nuance's recent launch of Nuance Mix. To summarize the main thesis of being long Nuance:The CaveatAfter years of acquiring competitors to expand reach and enhance its competitive advantage, Nuance has amassed a rather hefty debt load of approximately $2 billion. Not only does this drain ~ $80 million of cash flow in the form of interest expense, but it makes capital allocation all that more important moving forward. With FY2015 FCF of $430 million, the company is leveraged over 4.6 times its ttm FCF. And to make matters worse, a large portion of the company's capital has historically been allocated to executive compensation, with CEO Paul Ricci taking home the cake:This $92.8 million in compensation over the past four years is just a mind numbing amount to me, particularly when you consider that it equates to almost 5% of the debt load the company has incurred. Shareholders have repeatedly voiced their displeasure with executive compensation, as once again this past year the ""say on pay"" vote was resoundingly voted against with 85% as ""no"" (and for those doing the math at home, I think it's safe to assume where Carl Icahn voted his 19% of shares).The compensation committee of the board does appear to be listening. Several changes have once again been made to the compensation policy, and the trend is going in the shareholders' favor. In addition, compensation appears to finally be falling more in-line with the peer group:Although a large portion of executive compensation is share-based and non cash, I believe it's a mistake to completely disregard and focus purely on Non-GAAP earnings. Similar to its peers, the Nuance board believes that issuing shares aligns management with shareholders and is the best form of compensation - and a majority of people would likely agree. But completely ignoring the ""non-cash stock based compensation expense"" line item in an earnings release can lead to underperformance, especially in the absence of significant revenue/earnings growth.Using a peer group of Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) helps illustrate the importance of paying attention to stock-based compensation. In general, the philosophy of each company is to buy back shares roughly equivalent to the dilutive impact. The chart shows the progression of share count over the past three years:Since continuously buying back shares is a necessary component of this type of compensation, it's important to look how much of each company's FCF is chewed up by it:While the percentage of FCF can vary widely each year depending on multiple factors (such as stock price, working capital adjustments, changes in capex, etc), the averages come out to 36% for both Cerner and Autodesk, 43% for Adobe, and 52% for Nuance - although Nuance did lower share count by 11.5 million shares (3.5% of total) in 2015. So what this indicates to me is that Nuance, and other software companies, should expect to use somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of FCF buying back shares in a typical year. This means that ""non-cash compensation expense"" is a very real expense, and investors will value a company with these expenses in mind, whether or not the company wants to admit the importance in earnings releases.Although valuation is driven primarily by future growth prospects and competitive position, it's hard to overlook this last impact that stock-based compensation expense may have. Of the three cloud ""transition"" companies I've been analyzing (Nuance, Autodesk and Adobe), they trade with the following valuations (for comparison, Cerner currently trades at a EV/FCF of 36):Both Autodesk and Nuance trade at roughly half the valuation of Adobe (and Cerner), which might partially be explained by the dilution ""overhang."" Overhang is the amount of dilution that would occur if every share available in each company's equity compensation plan was awarded/exercised. For Adobe, this adds up to a rather miniscule 3.2%, whereas for both Autodesk and Nuance it adds up to 9%. Therefore, this would likely put a short-term cap on some of the potential stock gains as a sustained rise in the stock price could be met with dilutive stock options being exercised, as indicated by the relative valuations.So to sum up my caveat: Shareholder return will be directly correlated with Nuance's ability to properly allocate capital, control expenses and generate FCF.ValuationNuance provided fiscal 2016 guidance with its prepared remarks for the Q4 2015 earnings release/conference call, which largely called for flat y-o-y results. I believe that the guidance is baking in very conservative assumptions, and much like this past year is setting the company up for an easy beat.My rationale is based on two specific reasons: (1) underlying business strength will beat out specific headwinds, such as negative currency impacts, and (2) executive compensation is now based on non-GAAP revenue AND earnings, which will continue to drive the company's newfound focus on controlling expenses and stabilizing operating margins. Based on this, I'm looking for Nuance to deliver between $480-520 million in operating cash flow, and after subtracting $60 million in capex, generate $420-460 million in FCF.In order to derive a valuation for the company, I'm going to consider two scenarios. The first scenario is based on the analysis I performed above regarding the need to use approximately 40% of FCF to offset dilution. In its recently-issued proxy, the company reported the expected burn rate (dilution impact from share awards) to be approximately 9.8 million shares, which in another good sign for investors has trended down over the past three years from 11.8 million, 10.4 million and 9.7 million in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively.The board of directors is obviously becoming more sensitive to these dilutive impacts given that the recent convertible debt offering allocated approximately $180 million in share buybacks, including 1 million shares from CEO Paul Ricci. Normally a CEO selling 1 million shares is a red flag, but in this case, the shares were already going to be sold pursuant to a 10b5-1 plan on December 28, 2015, and the buyback included 800,000 shares represented by the net exercise of stock options. Taking this into account, the ""40% FCF"" rule would peg fair value of Nuance at about $18.67 to $20.44 per share, or basically right around the current price.The second valuation scenario is if investor sentiment starts to turn in favor of the company, as competitive fears start to fade, the transition to the cloud business model nears completion, and issues with executive compensation are fixed. Under this scenario, multiple expansion would occur, which I'm assuming would start to close the peer group valuation gap to a range of 27-32x EV/FCF. This would equate to a share price ranging from about $30-36, which obviously implies hefty upside over today's price of around $20.Combining the two valuation scenarios, I derive my 12-month price target of $26 with what I consider to be a very comfortable safety factor, especially with all the recent moves the company has made in its capital structure. After recently paying off the $472 million in term loans with the issuance of the 1% convertible debt due 2035, the company does not have any debt due until the $1.05 billion in 5.375% senior notes mature in 2020, which gives it ample opportunity to use more than 40% of its FCF to aggressively buyback shares. Barring any major fundamental changes, I plan to confidently hold my current position and will use any dips below $19 per share to add. Good luck everyone and thanks for reading."

SoundHound is widely known for being the other ""Shazam"" app available for your smartphone. SoundHound's app ""SoundHound"" identifies songs and artists by listening to them. Their technology is even smart enough to identify the song by a user just humming the melody.SoundHound's virtual assistant, aptly named Hound, is currently in its beta, but even in a beta state it mops the floor with the competition. Hound is reportedly able to recognize words behind heavy accents, answering oddly phrased questions and doing it all at incredibly quick speeds.Typhone.nl had a test where they pitted Hound against its competition - GoogleNow, Siri and Cortana - and the results were impressive. In addition to being able to answer questions faster than the competition. Cortana was unable to answer the question ""How many days until Christmas,"" while it took Siri two tries and GoogleNow did it on the first try but gave a much longer answer than needed. Hound also is the only virtual assistant at the moment that can answer a follow up question.Source hereThe one issue Hound has at this point is that it would be a separate app, meaning that if someone wanted to use it they would have to take steps that they wouldn't have to if they wanted to use one of the built-in virtual assistants. Hound's creator, Keyvan Mohajer, thinks that if he can create a good enough product he'll be able to beat out the competition despite not being built into the hardware.If Hound works as advertised, it won't be long before they are scooped up by one of the big four (Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)).SoundHound will also be releasing ""Houndify"" to developers which will allow them to access their technology and incorporate it into their apps. SoundHound has reportedly partnered with Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) to develop enterprise solutions for the travel booking site.This isn't exactly good news for Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) and their Nina assistant which serves the enterprise virtual assistant market. Houndify will directly compete with Nuance's enterprise offering.To clarify a profound common misconception, Nuance does not provide the brains (NLU/CLU tech) behind Apple's Siri, they only provide the speech recognition technology. Apple purchased the company 'Siri'* in 2010 before refining it and offering it in it's iPhone 4S in 2011. In 2012, Nuance purchased a company called VirtuOZ (now Nina Assistant) which was developing a Siri-like virtual assistant for enterprise solutions. The founder and architect of VirtuOZ, Alex Lebrun, would leave just five short months later. Mr. Lebrun would later start Wit.ai which was recently acquired by Facebook.*If you have time to watch, this keynote provides fantastic insight.While Nuance has a maturing business in multiple sectors using their speech technologies, they have been doing so through acquisitions and IP collaboration. They are notorious for taking out potential rivals and then top talent leaving shortly.Worst of all, it is very possible that startups will resist any takeover attempts from Nuance or ask for larger premiums. These tactics could prove to become Nuance's undoing.We have waited patiently since 2012 for growth through technological advances and innovation. The business has massive potential but it looks like Nuance has moved too slowly. As far as we can see, Nuance only rode the coattails of the Siri launch in 2011 and pitched impressive analyst conferences to get investors excited. After that, there was a lot of talk with no measurable results.If Nuance becomes irrelevant, and their technology outdated, investors can place the blame solely on CEO Ricci and company. Their old guard mentality and vision did not keep pace of with the mobile revolution. Instead they have invested heavily in labor intensive businesses that provide low returns on capital.Recommendation:We believe Nuance is trading at the top-end of its range this year and could possibly trade close to $20. However, we take this technological advancement by SoundHound as a serious threat and a disruptor for Nuance. If Hound works as advertised, they could start stealing market share from Nuance.Until we learn more on how the competitive landscape will shake out, we are happy to take profits now at $18.25 per share. We do not take this reversal in recommendation lightly though believe it is the prudent one. Nuance has a poor history of profitability, ROIC and corporate governance. If fundamentals improve we will revisit.With the emergence of SoundHound, we currently believe this significantly reduces the probability of Nuance being acquired. We estimated a Private Market Value of $22.75 (a primary reason for our investment). If Nuance acquired SoundHound, this would relax our fears and we would revisit this speculative investment."

The company has been undergoing a transformation into a recurring revenue model. I believe this is a timely update to my two previous articles (1,2) on this stock as the company has been steadily meeting its objectives. The stock price is now on an upward trend and the fundamentals remain attractive.Third quarter earnings, reported in early August, topped guidance and analyst expectations and the stock price climbed to a 52-week high.NUAN data by YChartsKey numbers from the earnings report that measure NUAN meeting its financial objectives are recurring revenue growth, net new bookings and expense reduction. NUAN's healthcare segment accounts for about half of the overall company earnings. Recurring revenues from the healthcare segment were just under 80% while reported recurring revenues for the entire company were 68% compared to 64% for fiscal 2014. NUAN has increased its percentage of recurring revenue to overall revenue for 11 consecutive quarters. New bookings continue to fuel the growth in recurring revenue. Net new bookings for the recently completed quarter totaled $484 million compared to $330 million for the same quarter the prior year. The company is on target in reducing cost with a reported $50 million in expense reduction year to date.Fueling new bookings is demand from the automotive industry. In the recent earnings call, CEO and Chairman Paul Ricci said, ""We had an extraordinarily strong quarter in automotive bookings this year. Several large bookings with major automotive manufacturers that in total sum to more than $100 million."" One automotive customer is Toyota with the Entune and Enform products.Sales to the automotive industry are reflected in NUAN reporting a 24% year-over-year increase in deferred revenue. This is revenue that will be recognized in the future. ""We usually bill at the time a car is shipped, but the revenue is recognized over time, because it's a connected service and therefore has to be recognized over the useful life of that service. Our automotive bookings tend to be longer lived than most of our other bookings because, as you're aware, the useful life of an automobile is somewhat longer than many other devices. That's an attractive feature of that business in our mind, because it provides - we are building up as our bookings continue to mount in that business - we're building up a steady backlog of deferred revenues which create recurring revenue in that business over a long period of time and a stable foundation upon which to build,"" Paul Ricci at the recent earnings call.I got this far in writing about NUAN without mentioning Carl Icahn but no farther. It's noteworthy that Icahn has sat on the sidelines despite his large stake in the company and it's indicative that he approves. The stock is selling at a PEG of just .75 and with the growth of recurring revenue model having almost three years of success with the added kicker of deferred revenue giving this stock an easy-to-project future, Icahn can afford to sit idly and watch his money grow."

So naturally, when Facebook announced that it was launching a virtual assistant known as ""M,"" it caught my attention.For companies (and their competitors) I invest in, I try to keep an active eye on patent applications with hopes to monitor their competitive advantage and ability to adapt to technological changes. So on August 27, just one day after Facebook announced the launch of M, a Nuance patent application is published titled ""Automated Text Annotation For Construction of Natural Language Understanding Grammars."" As I read through the application, claim 12 really popped out:This sounds an awful lot like how M is supposed to work, does it not? The NLU system would attempt to provide an accurate response, but if unable to, it would request input from the user to help derive an accurate response.This prompted me to start digging a little deeper as to whether Nuance may or may not be involved with M. Facebook would have already had some type of working relationship with Nuance after Facebook purchased Mobile Technologies and its ""Jibbigo"" machine language translation app, which already relied on Nuance speech recognition capabilities. In addition, M was developed and launched by Facebook's subsidiary Wit.ai, which was founded by Alex Lebrun, who coincidentally was the CEO of VirtuOz before Nuance quietly purchased it in early 2013.Knowing how difficult of a task it is to develop VR and NLU systems, I find it odd that Mr. Lebrun would sell a successful company just to start all over with a new one. And how was he able to shortly thereafter start Wit.ai and launch a successful API with NLU capabilities? My guess? Lebrun is collaborating with Nuance and its cloud capabilities as the backbone of the API, which actually creates a win-win for both sides.Nuance would essentially be able to ""out-source"" its R&D to Wit.ai and all the developers using the API (since Wit.ai offers the API for free with the intent that developers will share their coding to help improve the overall functionality for all - basically akin to crowd sourcing), while Wit.ai benefits from access to the Nuance cloud.And remember, NLU for the consumer segment is the most difficult task to tackle, given the huge variations in queries. While a specific ontology can be expected for a bank call center or in a doctor's office, you never know what the consumer will be looking for. This is why the quality and accuracy gap with Google Now (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is so difficult for other virtual assistants to close, given the massive trove of consumer data available to Google.Just this past October, Nuance announced that it was now bringing VR capabilities to Pebble Smartwatches, which could be used in conjunction with a Dictation API that will allow developers to build voice-enable apps. And to add another piece of coincidence, where do you think that Wit.ai was originally located? Well in Pebble's offices, of course:And lastly, what do Nuance's public filings indicate about the potential for this collaboration that I am speculating about? Refer to page 62 of the 2015 10-K, in which it refers to Intellectual Property Collaboration Agreements:So does all this definitively mean I'm correct, or even if I'm, that there will a huge payback and that Nuance stock will explode? No, of course not. It will take time for VR/NLU to continue to gain acceptance and be used more often, and it's not clear exactly how much pricing power Nuance will have. For instance, based on various pricing plans I've seen, let's just assume that Nuance would receive half a penny per query on its cloud. That means that 5 billion queries, or about 15 per person in the United States, would contribute $25 million in revenue.What I find intriguing about this potential collaboration and with the Nuance cloud in general is three-fold: (1) using a ""crowd-sourced"" method to improve VR/NLU allows Nuance to cut costs - such as the cost cutting initiative currently going on - while also allowing the company to focus on projects with more defined payback; (2) a durable and significant competitive advantage is being built as Nuance solidifies itself as the ""plug-and-play"" option for developers and companies wishing to quickly deploy artificial intelligence (AI) and/or voice commands on connected devices; (3) I believe that voice technology - virtual assistants in particular - will start to become a key marketing tool for advertisers, as I previously detailed in this article. So as voice commands/interaction starts to garner mainstream appeal, Nuance is in a prime position to capture a meaningful portion of the market. And it's this advertising market I believe that Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are preparing for fierce competition to gain/defend, and not the healthcare or enterprise markets often cited by Nuance bears.Connected CarsI'd be remiss not to discuss the biggest near-term growth driver for Nuance, which is related to the connected car concept and its Dragon Drive platform. The platform won ""the prestigious 2014 Global Mobile Award for Best Mobile Product or Service for Automotive"" and is utilized by prominent car makers such as Audi, BMW, Daimler, Toyota and others. It's largely responsible for the huge jump in Nuance's operating cash flow, which increased 36% yoy to $487.6 million in FY 2015, and is a big reason for the 21.9% yoy increase in deferred revenue to $668.2 million. So while traditional valuation metrics based on revenue and earnings will miss this underlying strength, a large and stable recurring revenue base is being built that will underpin growth for years. This strength was highlighted on the Q3 2015 conference call:And to further clarify why deferred revenue should continue to grow and hide some of the huge growth in the automotive segment:For this reason, I believe that cash flow is the appropriate valuation methodology, which I'll delve into with the last article in this series on Nuance.One Last Catalyst To MentionThere is an under-the-radar catalyst that could really ignite interest in Nuance's cloud based VR/NLU capabilities - this would be an increase in minimum wages. In his 2015 State of the Union Address, President Obama urged congress to increase the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, or a 39% increase over the current $7.25. So if you're a fast food operator, I'm sure that a voice enabled drive thru or ordering station might start to be an appealing option, given how hard it may be to contain labor costs. Again, it would take time to work out the kinks and obtain widespread adoption of voice-activated solutions, but with constantly improving accuracy, I believe it's only a matter of time before voice/AI solutions start to infiltrate the restaurant market."

Part 2 will focus on Nuance's Mobile & Consumer segment, while Part 3 will tie everything together, including risks, and discuss valuation scenarios.Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) has proven to be a very elusive stock to get a handle on. Looking at a multi-year stock chart shows that the stock has been largely range bound between $13-20 after a precipitous fall from its all-time highs near $30 per share. And as someone who has been long the stock for several years, it has been frustrating to watch the stock go nowhere in the midst of an amazing bull run for the overall market. Although I believed all along that the market has been undervaluing Nuance and patience would eventually be rewarded, it has certainly been a tough ride. With several new developments to digest, I believe that the market will finally start to understand Nuance's business model, which will finally lead to continued gains.BackgroundAlthough most readers are probably somewhat familiar with Nuance's history, let's first start with some important background on the company. First of all, the company is a nightmare for an analyst to model and try to predict potential catalysts. As a supplier of technology and services to other businesses and manufacturers - often with strict non-disclosure agreements - there is not an easy way to monitor progress. Combine that with varying contract terms with each partner (perpetual license, term license, on-demand services, etc) and an investor/analyst is stuck wondering how each technological change may impact the company - whether positive or negative. So when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announces improvements to Siri, or when Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) announces new voice or imaging functions related to its Electronic Health Records (EHR), you're left wondering what the impact to Nuance will be.The current executive management team doesn't help much either. I'm not aware of any investor presentations the company has made (at least in the past few years) in an effort to drum up investor interest. And if you look through the company's SEC filings or on its Investor Relations website you can't find much information to base an investment decision on. Certainly not much information related to the addressable markets or key competitive advantages. You're basically stuck using the past financials and the financial guidance the company provides, including bookings.So when investors are performing their due diligense and try to establish their investment rationale, it's not very difficult (at least in hindsight) to see why Nuance's stock has languished. In addition to a difficult transition from a traditional software licensing company to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, the following difficulties pop out:With all these difficulties, what could there possibly be to like about Nuance? To answer this question, let's dig deeper into each operating segment.ImagingThe imaging segment finished fiscal 2015 with a couple big design wins with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and the Social Security Administration which may lead to some future growth, but overall I don't see it delivering material growth. It only accounts for about 12% of the current revenue base, but does sport a healthy profit margin around 38%, which makes it an important component to the company's cash flow. Given this low, albeit stable growth profile, I don't see a reason to discuss much more about the segment.EnterpriseThe enterprise segment has struggled from a revenue standpoint, with non-GAAP revenue declining 5% in FY 2015 compared to FY 2014. Profitability has held steady due to expense reductions, but a deeper look into the segment paints a rosier picture. The company continues to see strong demand for its voice biometric solutions and is finally starting to deliver on the strong bookings seen over the past few years as large scale client implementations are completed.The long implementation time is a key aspect that investors must recognize. To get a better sense as to why it takes so long to implement solutions in the Enterprise segment, consider this quote from Alex Lebrun, who was the CEO of VirtuOz when Nuance acquired it in 2013:""(VirtuOz) gave us a first-hand look at just how difficult and tedious a task speech and natural language truly were. Each natural language interface we created took three to six months to build and involved direction not only from our development team but also linguists and knowledge management experts. And because of the extremely high cost of setup, there was no solution tailored to smaller businesses or developers. No vendor was getting natural language user interfaces widely adopted, including us.""This ends up having two main impacts to Nuance. One, revenue growth will continue to take some time to show up despite significant progress made in implementing solutions. Two, a significant and durable competitive advantage is being built as these solutions are being implemented. Not only would a customer's business be impacted (through continuity) by an attempt to switch to a competitor's solution, but it also would be a lengthy and expensive undertaking.For these reasons, I believe the seeds are being sown for a long-term growth story to play out, which will lead to improved revenue growth and margin expansion. The story may take some time to play out, however, as high-margin license revenue continues to transition to hosted and on-demand solutions. Longer term, I see this unit being able to deliver between 5%-10% revenue growth with margins gradually expanding to the low 30% range.HealthcareThe healthcare segment is Nuance's largest, accounting for almost half of overall non-GAAP revenue. Similar to the other business units, it has struggled to grow as more customers are shifted to on-demand (cloud) solutions. Also, the medical transcription business has experienced volume erosion (and thus impacting revenue) as hospitals, doctors and other vendors transition to the EHR. Nuance is able to retain a majority of that transcription business through its Dragon Medical offerings and embedded solutions within products offered by partners such as Cerner and Epic (privately held), but near-term revenue will certainly be negatively impacted.The segment does appear to be on stable footing, however, as the company has reported strong interest in its clinical documentation solutions (CDI), likely driven by the recent conversion to ICD-10. In addition, new cloud-based offerings like its Dragon Medical Advisor offer a pretty compelling value proposition to clients, particularly with Stage 3 of Meaningful Use quickly approaching. Considering the apparent shift that has occurred over the past two years in the healthcare industry toward embracing technological and cloud- based solutions, I believe that interest in Nuance's healthcare offerings will surprise to the upside.Another aspect that I feel is not currently appreciated by the analyst community is the importance of clinical language understanding (CLU). CLU is the medical version of natural language understanding (NLU), and by working off a complete medical ontology, it basically allows for much ""smarter"" transcription records, leading to better patient care, doctor reimbursement and efficiency. Nuance has such a commanding lead in this market, I'm not even sure who the closest competitor would be.IBM (NYSE:IBM) has offerings through its well-publicized Watson AI, but Nuance and IBM are partners. Even Google might have a difficult time breaking into this market, even if it were interested. Based on my understanding of how Google's NLP engine works, it uses Google search rankings as a large factor in understanding how language is used. While this offers terrific insight as to why Google Now is typically ranked at the top the market in VR/NLU accuracy, it likely wouldn't work so well in a clinic or physician setting. And with every additional medical conversation transcribed and improved with machine learning, word error rates will continue to improve, as shown in this graph:Source: NuanceThis means that Nuance's lead in CLU will only expand as the Nuance cloud is better ""trained,"" which should eventually lead to revenue and margin growth that mirrors other technology companies with dominant competitive positions in their industry. In the near term, however, I'm looking for the company to deliver between 3%-7% revenue growth, with margins holding steady in the upper 30% range.Mobile and ConsumerNuance's stock seems to rise and fall with the perceived ""growth"" of the mobile and consumer segment. Despite the recent jump in the stock price to $20, which in my opinion is largely due to the optimism with the connected car concept, I believe there is a lot going on behind the scenes that Wall Street hasn't fully grasped. The second part of this article, which I hope to publish shortly, will delve more deeply into this segment.Click here for part 2."

After three years of its stock price being decimated in a robust market and economy, there are four main catalysts warranting consideration of Nuance.Source: Google FinanceOwning over 60 million shares, Carl Icahn carries a significant loss in Nuance. As one of the most active of activist investors, he seems largely undeterred by the staggering losses, increasing his holdings as the price declined. He hasn't publicly stated what his plans are for the company, but he's winning seats on the board, giving his son, Bret Icahn, a seat most recently.Tangible book value stands at -$5.25 per share, all but ruling out a breakup of the company. The company's ""goodwill"" balance sheet item contains $3.3 billion of its $5.8 billion in total assets.The company currently has poison pill provisions in place that are set to expire on August 19, 2015, opening up more options for Mr. Icahn. At its next annual meeting, the board will vote on an extension of the plan, but Mr. Icahn will be looking to move forward with his own personal agenda. Of the nine seats on the board, two are controlled by Icahn.Share BuybackIn April 2013, Nuance announced a $500 million share buyback. Since buying more than $300 million, the stock is down 25 percent. Remaining buybacks at such depressed levels are significantly more effective and could provide a healthy tailwind for future stock price appreciation.SalesSource: FactSet Research SystemsGrowing at an average annual rate of 15 percent since 2009, Nuance expects sales for 2015 to push $2 billion, up from $950 million in 2009. Sustained growth at that magnitude is impressive for any company, but Nuance has been unable to translate revenue growth into actual earnings.Until recently, Nuance's revenue growth came through acquisition of competing companies. Sales doubled in five years, yet net income declined from a $12 million loss in 2009 to a $150 million loss in 2014. According to its most recent earnings conference call, ""(Nuance) will be focused on growing recurring revenue."" Nuance will become profitable if it can continue its sales growth and reduce operating expenses.The Downside and Competition:The challenges that Nuance faces are not anything new. The company competes with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) in the voice recognition space. Both companies are vastly larger and have other business segments with which to monetize its technologies. Both are in a much better position to implement and create a better product.The other problem is its growth. Despite stellar sales growth, Nuance is no longer acquiring companies to buy its growth. It may not be able to sustain its previous growth rates. With an operating margin of near zero, the company cannot afford to lose any revenue.SummaryNuance's share price has been decimated and the company has few tangible assets. Its sales growth has been impressive while earnings growth has remained nonexistent.Despite the fundamentals floundering, the company is an undisputed leader in voice recognition software. Nuance will benefit from an increase in sales of voice capable devices like phones and the rumored Apple TV update.With a little shareholder activism to unlock value along the way, Nuance has positioned itself for a boost to its bottom line and share price. Investors interested in adding Nuance to a portfolio should consider doing so now, before results make it into the earnings calls."
4130340,98236,2017-12-07T09:24:14-05:00,"Last week, Nuance announced a quarter that was noticeably above prior expectations.Those expectations were quite muted do the malware incident that plagued the company and its customers over the summer.The company provided guidance that was a bit better than the prior consensus, although in absolute terms none to robust.The company, under its current CEO, has compiled a poor record of organic growth and profitability.The opportunities for a new CEO, expected to be announced in the next 3-4 months to enhance the operational performance of the company, or to sell it, are substantial.","Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) reported its financial results for both its Q4 and fiscal 2017 last week. The results, when compared to expectations, were relatively strong. Initially, the shares rallied significantly. Subsequently, partially because this is Nuance and partially because the market for tech has been in the midst of a vigorous correction, the shares have returned to the price that they were before the company reported its results.Nuance has been one of the most frustrating investments in tech/software with which I have dealt over the past decade or so. The shares are lower now than they were 5 years ago and even 10 years ago, and they hit an all-time high as long ago as 2012 in the wake of the hype surrounding the use of Nuance technology to power Apple's (OTC:APPL) Siri. I deal with a wide variety of investors in my work; when one mentions Nuance, the response is often dead silence when it isn't some kind of bemused groan. There are few companies with such promise in terms of technology that have done so poorly over so many quarters and yet are still around, infuriating many investors. Many readers are going to write about the lack of effective governance and the ability that the CEO has had to enrich himself while shareholders have received no/negative returns. And that is not because the company has lacked some compelling technologies. The company's natural language technologies, which have become pervasive in terms of the products that Nuance offers, are built on elements of an AI paradigm that is becoming well accepted.At one point, Nuance had achieved a run rate of EPS of $2/share. Revenues were comparable to current levels. Subsequent to that time, the company has been through restructurings and transitions of a bewildering variety and quantity with encouragement and then the exit of Carl Icahn. Yes, most of the EPS decline was a function of the decline of the company's medical transcription business and its handset business… but still. Needless to say there are some observers, including this writer who thinks that paying the CEO tens of millions in compensation to produce this record that goes back to fiscal 2011 is little short of criminal... and maybe not short of criminal.The key issue in writing articles for this site is whether investors should buy the stock. I confess I have not yet pulled the trigger in terms of establishing a position although there is certainly temptation to do so. Overall, valuation is modest, and expectations - well, real expectations for those who have followed this name are even more modest. We know that the CEO will be departing sometime in the next several months, a consummation that will cheer most investors. Recently, in an article published on this site, one writer suggested that a particular implementation of Nuance technology within its critical health care vertical would be significant in creating a major growth driver for this company. Whether that is true or not or really whether the products will have the amount of impact suggested by the author, the company has more than enough green shoots to support faster growth than it has forecast.One really doesn't need to deal with Nuance shares if either the current consensus numbers or guidance are significant metrics in terms of establishing a likely set of expectations for this company. Given the record of the past few years, both company forecasts and analyst projections have not been terribly accurate. For the record, currently, Nuance is forecasting that it will grow organic revenues by 2-4% in this current fiscal year, and by 3-5% next year which runs through September 2019. The decline of the company's medical transcription business continues and it's only by the end of this fiscal year that Dragon Medical, the software replacement for transcription, will eclipse transcription as the largest revenue contributor in the company's health care business segment.But as part of the company's prepared script during its latest conference call, the CEO said it was worth noting that the company's pipeline metric grew by $900 million, or about 30% over the course of the year. Maddeningly, we do not know how prior quarters were in terms of pipeline or how the record has been of converting pipeline to bookings either lately or over time. But if the pipeline has grown by $900 million and revenue expectations are only $2 billion, with 74% of revenues being recurring… well, the number is certainly pregnant in terms of potential upside. I suppose many readers simply want to know… will Nuance exceed the consensus consistently? I have to think with this metric in hand, that there is a good chance of that happening. Simply put, if is now over $3 billion - and that would appear to be the number that fits the disclosure, it would seem that bookings over the coming year would support more than just $50-75 million of revenue growth.The company is expecting margin gains next year - given what happened to margins in the wake of the malware incident that crippled the operations of this company's medical transcription business this summer, that would be more or less inevitable. It is expecting modest but continuous improvements in operating margins in 2019. At some point, management - really the incoming CEO when he/she is announced - is going to need to figure out whether or not to prioritize margins or growth. Current non-GAAP margins in the mid-20 percent range are not nearly high enough if the company's growth is no more than 3-5% organically.Overall, at the midpoint, the company is forecasting non-GAAP EPS of $1.10 for this current fiscal year, equivalent to the current consensus. Based on its commentary, its preliminary forecast for non-GAAP EPS in fiscal 2019 is about $1.18-1.20, slightly above the current First Call consensus. The real question then is can this company exceed both the growth and EPS targets and that will be the focus of much of the balance of this article.While some readers will be familiar with this story, it is well, I think to note that Nuance is in the midst of recovering from a serious data breach that came close to shutting down segments of this company's business for several weeks this past summer. While the details of the breach are still a bit sketchy in terms of precisely what happened, when it happened and why it happened, the results were dramatic. The company estimates that the incident cost it $68 million of foregone revenue (3.5% of the total for the prior fiscal year) and cost EPS of $.13.And yet those numbers are really only based on direct costs as the company can establish them. Inevitably, the real results of the breach would probably include bookings/revenues that didn't happen for some period of time and the loss of reputation in a very competitive Health Information Market (HIM). There is, needless to say, more than a bit of difficulty in presenting stakeholders with a comprehensive view of the economic impact of the breach on Nuance. It is harder still to know, when the issue of reputational loss will be completely mitigated - although apparently Nuance responded rapidly and completely to the impact of the breach.Just how many HIM customers wound up deserting Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) for competitors will never be known. Just how many potential new customers deferred their decisions or chose competitors will never be known. Just how many customers didn't extend their Nuance installations will never be known.The company estimated that the breach caused lost revenues that were about 10% of what would have been reported this past quarter. This was less than the initial estimate, but the ancillary impacts are really unknowable. The company's presentation suggests that the company would have seen growth overall of 3% year over year, rather than the decline of 6% that was actually reported.The company has reported that its earnings for the quarter would have been consistent with those of the prior year after adjusting for the breach. While the numbers add up in terms of the adjustments considered by the company, the real impact is probably more considerable. Indeed, the impact of the malware incident on earnings is expected to last into the current fiscal year because of the necessity of spending more for enhanced security and additional security infrastructure.This is one of those cases in which the glass is half full or half empty depending on the point of view. The company obviously has suffered substantially from the breach, and the recovery is more of a process than might be anticipated. The company probably has an advantage in terms of real data security now compared to its prior position, but the dissection of how and why the breach took place is far from transparent.The actual restoration of service for users came during July/August. The company has reported that its Healthcare segment delivered record new bookings in the last quarter that ended in September. Again, that is obviously a positive, but some of those bookings were the result of users deserting Nuance transcription services for Nuance Dragon Medical software. Overall, the company reported that the breach was responsible for the loss of $10 million in bookings - but that is an estimate of the direct impact of the breach. The real impact for this company on bookings will never be really known.The company is now forecasting organic growth for this current fiscal year of 2-4%. Given that it lost at least 3.5% of revenues because of the breach in the prior fiscal year, that is the equivalent of forecasting no growth. Bookings growth of 10% for the year and yet no organic growth - hmmm. The company increased its deferred revenue balance by 7% year over year, which might be suggestive that the organic growth forecast reflects both conservatism and possible additional unseen elements.The company apparently suffered cash losses of $120 million as a result of the breach or about 25% of the total that it would otherwise have attained. At the least, the breach wiped out cash flow last quarter. Again, the actual costs, both direct and indirect, on the CFFO metric will never be really known.Can Nuance return to robust growth? That is a question on which the jury is still out. And it is, of course, the crucial aspect of drawing an investment conclusion. Again, the issue is not because the company lacks for high growth potential but because it still has to get through revenue losses from declining businesses. The magnitude of the transition was always greater than this writer had anticipated, and it has been, frankly, not my finest hour as an analyst. The company, despite its size, is only covered by 8 analysts, a relatively small number. That reflects the difficulties many analysts, including this writer, have had in covering the business both because it has so many pieces that have disparate growth rates and because of the magnitude of the transitions that have essentially eliminated organic revenue growth for the better part of a decade. Real transparency, as opposed to furnishing many numbers, has not been a hallmark of investor relations for this company. Perhaps, in time, and under a new CEO, that too will show improvements.One of the problems for an analyst in trying to look ahead through disaggregation relates to the fact that the malware incident impacted different portions of Nuance unequally. The largest single element of the impact was focused on the impact that malware had on the company's s transcription business. The incident impacted many different numbers as well, by differing percentages. Just to look at a couple of significant impacts, recurring revenues were reported as 71% for the quarter, down from a year earlier. But absent the impact, the company suggests that recurring revenues would have been 74%. Non-GAAP operating margins fell to 20.7% for the year, impacted by 760 basis points because of the incident, and likely more than that looking at non-quantifiable ancillary impacts.Overall, and adjusted for Nuance's estimate of the impact of the malware incident, Healthcare, the largest segment of revenue for this company achieved 2% adjusted organic growth last quarter. Dragon Medical revenues are growing at 19% organically and some of the company's clinical documentation solution and diagnostic solutions (the subject of the article previously cited) are also showing strength. Clinical Documentation Improvement (CDI) is a major demand driver within healthcare. I have linked to the specific Nuance offering in the space. Given the results seen in medical last quarter and context of those results, I imagine that the potential exists for medical to show significantly greater than 2% organic growth next year. Management is suggesting that its transcription business will continue to decline, reaching $250 million or about 12% of revenues. That is a decline of $16 year on year, and down from $400 million in fiscal year 2016. At some point, the decline in transcription revenue is likely to approach some kind of asymptote. As this happens, and as the other components of health care continue to grow at double digits, it seems likely that segment growth can climb noticeably over the next several quarters.The Enterprise segment of Nuance continues to grow organically, although at somewhat pedestrian rates. Much of that has to do with the continued impact of migration to ratable sources; bookings as opposed to revenues continue to grow at double digit rates which caused segment margin to contract noticeably in the year. Again, that transition is probably close to complete which might permits bookings strength to be reflected in organic revenue growth and in improved segment operating margins.Nuance Enterprise includes such technologies as biometric voice authentication and Nina, the virtual digital assistant. Bookings continue to rise at double digit rates - higher this past year than the prior year. It is hard to know how to model Enterprise, in particular. Obviously, if bookings are rising at double digit rates over several years, at some point, the organic growth rate ought to achieve an increase beyond 4%. Just exactly how much of the reported revenue of this segment is being constrained by the switch of its customers to the cloud has not been discussed at this point - one of those transparency issues that has been a hallmark of this company and which has hobbled share price ""progress"".Mobile is the third major business segment for Nuance. It has been growing in the mid-single digits for some time now. Mobile is the component of the Nuance business that has exposure to the connected car market, and that is its main growth driver. About 63% of the revenue from mobile comes from the automotive segment, and that segment continues to enjoy both double digit revenue growth and some substantial design wins that provide the company visibility for several years into the future.There, no doubt, are still some pockets in mobile revenue that relate to 1st generation solutions that have been sold to carriers, and are still in decline. We do not know the specifics of the revenue Nuance derives from handset implementations of its technology, and the rate at which that is declining. But that said, however, it does seem, at least based on the numbers that have been released, that Nuance certainly has the potential of seeing its Mobile segment show accelerating growth throughout this year and into the future.Imaging, the smallest business segment for Nuance, has seen substantial underperformance for the last couple of years. Imaging is a bit less than 13% of the company's total revenues. Bookings were surprisingly strong; revenues declined 5% and the operating margin declined noticeably. This year, bookings are forecast to be driven by a ""transformative wave of product innovation,"" with 12 major releases planned. That said, the company is only forecasting slight growth in revenues in the coming fiscal year.The company has forecast that the growth in its deferred revenue balance will taper somewhat in the year. Again, the forecast is a bit puzzling in the context of the bookings growth forecast and the indication of strength in the company's pipeline. Just another sphinx-like comment that at the least needs to be mentioned.I will comment about valuation specifically in the next section. But to get positive on this name, I think investors have to believe that current growth forecasts are lower than reality, that the company can do a better job in restoring margins to historical levels or that the business will be bought. Nuance does have lots of technology that it self - evidently does a poor job in leveraging. It would, most likely , be a synergistic acquisition for many vendors of both hardware and software. I could readily make the case that it should be sold. And I could also make the case, that particularly in the wake of a coming new broom, that both growth and margins will do better than the consensus forecast. I can't prove that - but I think it logical.As mentioned, Nuance shares are reasonably valued and present a decent investment if the estimates are too low. On the raw numbers themselves, as they are represented by the company forecast or the First Call consensus, the shares are valued at levels that probably support average future share price performance.The company has a projected diluted share count of 301 million, and its current share price is a bit above $15, which produces a market capitalization of $4.5 billion. It has a current net debt position of $1.8 billion which yields an enterprise value of $6.3 billion. That, in turn, produces an EV/S metric of 3.1X based on the company's current sales forecast for the current fiscal year. Not expensive, but not deep value either.Nuance has produced a forecast EPS of about $1.10 at the midpoint for its current fiscal year. The forecast is based on operating margins that are lower by 100 basis points in all to reflect additional spend when compared to forecasts the company had made prior to the malware incident. This forecast is predicated on extra spend for permanent improvements in security infrastructure and additional spend related to ramping development costs in automotive and enterprise to reflect emerging, additional opportunities. Nuance has typically exceeded its EPS forecast - indeed it did so this last quarter, and I have little reason to believe that will not be the case for fiscal 2018 as well.Overall, GAAP expenses, excluding one-time restructuring costs, grew by 5% last quarter. I would be surprised if growth in opex weren't flat or even down some in the coming fiscal year, with gross margins returning to pre-breach levels over the coming quarters. The company has been reducing stock based comp steadily throughout last fiscal year. Overall, stock-based comp has fallen to about 5% of revenues, a relatively low number for that metric in the universe of IT vendors. That might help a bit with valuation, but for the most part, stock-based comp expense continue to be ignored by investors. But even with a P/E of 13X, Nuance shares are not quite cheap if the company can't escape single digit growth territory.The company is forecasting that it will generate $400 million of free cash flow this current fiscal year. That would be well less than the level generated in fiscal 2016 and thus is a number that could readily be exceeded. Somewhat less than half of cash flow from operations is coming from the use of the use of stock-based comp. Much of the cash flow is likely to be used to repurchase debt, with some potential for the company to resume repurchase of shares or to use some cash for mergers and acquisitions on an opportunistic basis.The free cash flow yield of 6.3% is not inconsiderable, and the odds are that it will turn out higher than that. Still, there are companies in the IT space that have greater free cash flow yields - again, the real question is whether this company can exceed mid-single digit growth.Should you buy Nuance shares. I think on balance, the risk/rewards are slightly tilted positively. The company has more potential upside and while not a ""deep value"", its share price certainly reflects its checkered past and its somewhat cloudy outlook. I think that the collection of businesses that make up the company ought to be able to produce more than mid-single digit growth, although precisely how much more than that is unknowable. I think a new CEO can hardly do worse than the current leader in terms of wringing both efficiencies and faster growth out of the assets that this company has developed. And the fact is that simply because the company hasn't really monetized its assets, it has become a company that would be attractive to a variety of acquisitors.The tech investment of one's dreams - hardly. But perhaps a reasonable GARP candidate for those who believe in the potential redemption of companies as well as people."
2969416,76425,2015-03-03T14:26:08-05:00,A third activist fund has taken a position.Quarterly earnings again beat expectations.Chart double bottom signals a trend reversal.,"Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) is recognized as the premier voice and recognition technology company in the world. This company grew by spending heavily to acquire its competition, a formula that has not worked out well with many publications labeling CEO Paul Ricci as the worst CEO. NUAN has been undergoing a transformation in its earnings model, now relying heavily on recurring revenue. I think there are reasons to be optimistic about NUAN's transformation and future prospects.Reviewing NUAN's net new bookings, cash flow, and recurring revenue stream provide an indication that and NUAN is on target with their game plan. Theories that NUAN will be acquired or do a spin off are becoming less frequent but activist interest is increasing, and that is a good sign.New net bookings fell 5.5% Y/Y in FQ1 to $303.8M. The company cited currency exchange issues as a partial cause but still forecast FY15 net new bookings growth of 4%-5%. Despite labeling the results ""disappointing"" CEO Paul Ricci stated in the recent earnings call, ""we do expect for bookings growth to accelerate in the back-half of the year simply because of the timing of some of those deals. And of course, Nuance historically as always had a strong quarter in its fiscal fourth quarter relatively speaking in both bookings and revenues.""Cash flow grew 22% over the prior year. Management has put the cash right back in to support the stock price with an ongoing share buyback program having spent $200 million out of the approved $500 million.Recurring revenue grew 4% year-over-year and now comprises 66% of our total revenue as the company continues to succeed in shifting their earnings model away from licensing deals to more predictable and stable recurring revenue. The company believes that it is at the point were declining licensing revenue will have a lesser impact on earnings growth from recurring revenue.Takeover or split up rumors have been abundant since Icahn became involved in 19. Goldman research concluded that there will be no buyout and lowered NUAN to a SELL rating. ""We do not see NUAN as a potential acquisition candidate."" But new rumors continue to pop up. A possible BAIDU takeover was the subject of this article. But NUAN may end up alright on its own.A technical evaluation indicates a turnaround in stock price. There seems to be a change in direction. The stock price had been in a downtrend, but a trend reversal is in progress after a double bottom formation in December. (chart)During the last quarter, another activist fund, Okumus took a 5% stake joining Icahn who owns 19% and ClearBridge at 7%. This is noteworthy, as hedge funds tend to be ahead of the crowd in finding value. Okumus is not as well known as Icahn but is not an industry lightweight. The Okumus Fund was recently in the lead in the HSBC hedge fund sweepstakes.On February 5th, the company reported EPS of $0.25 beating estimates by $0.03 and revenue of $489M ahead of estimates by $2.13M. On fundamental valuation, NUAN is cheap and that as evidenced by the increasing interest from hedge funds. The stock sells at a modest PE of 13 and a PEG of .63 despite analysts' projections of earnings growth for the next five years of 20%.Despite beating estimates, management was very cautious about forward guidance and it is still too early to call NUAN a turnaround story, but there are signs that a turnaround is taking shape and that a foundation for earnings growth has been laid out."
3187416,53622,2015-05-15T11:51:25-04:00,Nuance finally appears to have hit an inflection point.Tailwinds will allow the company to return to growth.The valuation is extremely appealing.,"Shares of Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) have been up sharply since announcing Q2 fiscal 2015 results. While the company posted flat revenue y-o-y, non-GAAP earnings of $0.30 beat the $0.28 in the prior year. Net new bookings were $304.7 million in the quarter, which was substantially lower than the $419.8 million posted in the prior year. Although currency headwinds impacted the Q2 2015 results and bookings to a certain extent, what exactly have investors been seeing that caused the sudden accumulation in the stock? I believe there are 4 tailwinds that are starting to gain momentum, and that this past quarter marked the long awaited inflection point for the stock.Tailwind No. 1: Mobile & ConsumerNuance shares typically trade up or down based on the performance of the mobile & consumer segment, despite accounting for just under 25% of the company's overall revenue. I guess a majority of investors see the segment as the one with the highest growth potential, particularly with the explosion of connected devices using voice recognition, IoT, and personal assistants.The company has noted that the consolidation of the smartphone industry, along with increasing on-demand services, has made it difficult to deliver growth over the past couple years. But based on the Q2 results, tailwinds in the automotive solutions division will drive growth in the coming year. In the Q2 2015, Nuance reported $116.7 million in revenue, and more importantly, a doubling in segment profit over the prior year. The strong performance was driven by a $21.1 million increase in auto license sales, thanks to a $100 million booking that was noted in the Q2 2014. In addition, the company reported new design wins in the auto segment with a ""leading US maker"" and a ""leading European maker"" that contributed to new bookings, which should continue to drive growth in the segment.A few other important numbers that show the continued strength of the mobile & consumer segment are:Overall, the investments in the mobile & consumer segment are starting to bear fruit as the connected car concept is gaining momentum, and I am looking for continued growth in the near & long term.Tailwind No. 2: ICD-10Nuance's topline growth in the healthcare segment over the past few years has been largely driven by acquisitions, which is why I believe that investors have turned skeptical about the segment until a clear path to organic growth can be seen. As Electronic Medical Records [EMR] continue to be adopted, the company has been dealing with volume erosion in its bread & butter business of on-demand transcription, which has had an impact on near-term revenues. But the bigger issue, at least in my opinion, has been the continued uncertainty with the transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10. Despite a recent attempt in congress to implement an ICD-10 ""transition period"", it appears that the ICD-10 conversion will finally be implemented on October 1.Nuance offers a strong package of solutions for hospitals and physicians with its Dragon Medical, Clintegrity 360, and PowerScribe 360 solutions, with Clintegrity 360 the biggest benefactor from ICD-10 conversion. Given the continued uncertainty with ICD-10, many hospitals and physicians have been delaying the implementation of new solutions until the change is officially mandated. Therefore, assuming that the October 1 deadline is maintained, I am expecting to see strong growth in revenue and bookings going forward, as customers utilize Nuance for professional services and maintenance & support with CDI during the transition. In addition, through the company's partnerships with leading EMR vendors like Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) and Epic, the continued adoption of EMRs across the US and around the world should only increase the demand for Nuance's products, given the efficiencies that can be achieved through voice recognition and clinical language understanding [CLU].Tailwind No. 3: International ExpansionNuance currently reports about 26% of its revenue from markets outside the United States. The company's R&D budget has ballooned over the past several years, as seen below:A decent chunk of this R&D budget has ostensibly been to work on increasing the performance of transcription and CLU in foreign languages. In its 10-Q, Nuance notes:As the CLU of foreign languages continues to improve for Nuance, I expect to see increased demand for Nuance's products as connected devices and efficiencies can be realized internationally. In its Q1 2015 results conference call, Cerner indicated that it expects to see increased EMR adoption:Tailwind No. 4: Cash FlowDespite the stagnant revenue numbers being reported over the past year, the operating cash flow and deferred revenue have solidly grown, indicating that the overall business is healthier than the headline numbers indicate. In the Q2 2015, operating cash flow jumped 37.8% to $119.9 million, compared to $87.0 million a year ago, while deferred revenue grew 26.3% from the prior year. Considering that operating cash flow as a percentage of non-GAAP net income was 121% in the quarter, revenue and earnings growth should follow suit and see a dramatic rise over the next year as that deferred revenue is recognized.Given this strong cash flow, it's not a surprise that the company started aggressively repurchasing its shares, and that the BOD also recently authorized an additional $500 million of buybacks. In a previous article, I compared Nuance's valuation to a few of its peers that went through a similar SaaS transition: Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). Assuming relatively flat numbers over the rest of this year and using the lower valuation comparable of Price/FCF of 23x and EV/Non-GAAP earnings of 39x, fair value for Nuance would be $31 and $42 per share, respectively. Given this undervaluation, I think that buying back shares aggressively is prudent strategy until the valuation gap is closed.Despite having $2.14 billion in long term debt, the debt load is not much of a concern right now. At the end of the second quarter, Nuance reported about $475 million of cash & investments on its balance sheet, and does not have any debt due until August 2019 (which is $474 million of term loans). Although the term loans carry the most restrictive covenants compared to the rest of the company's debt, it only carries an interest rate of 2.75% right now. Therefore, I would like to see Nuance management use the majority of ifs FCF over the next year or two to buy back shares, at least until the share price approaches $30 and the capital can be deployed more efficiently elsewhere.ConclusionWith tailwinds finally forming and stabilizing the company's top and bottom line, Nuance appears to have finally reached an inflection point. Strong cash flow generation gives the company flexibility in its capital deployment, as many of its investments over the past several years appear to be paying off. I currently look at Nuance shares as a cheap value play on being able to return capital to shareholders through share buy backs, and will look to add on any dips."

NUAN focuses its solutions in 4 main business sectors: healthcare, mobile and consumer, enterprise, and medical imaging. Through the modernization of the healthcare industry, NUAN stands to make a fortune in selling healthcare solutions and medical imaging information systems through recordkeeping and analyzing software of medical records in digital form, making an industry-leading Powerscribe 360, and having a unique bioinformatics platform. In the mobile, consumer, and enterprise space, NUAN is pushing the trend of interconnected devices and more interaction between technological products and humans; NUAN makes voice-to-text, voice-to-maps navigation, automated speech recognition, biometric speech security systems, and cloud-based mobile applications. NUAN summarizes its core competitive advantages as extending technology leadership, vertically integrating themselves to be an all-service solutions provider, increasing subscriptions sold and increasing other recurring revenues, and making strategic acquisitions and partnerships.Financial ChartsNote: Orange line denotes a projected number.Source: Data from FactSet and Google FinanceSource: Data from FactSet and Google FinanceSource: Data from FactSet and Google FinanceEnterprise ValueSource: Yahoo FinanceWall Street Analyst EstimatesSource: FactSet and Yahoo FinanceBusiness Segment AnalysisSource: Yahoo FinanceSource: SEC 10-K FilingMarket Competitors to NUAN by Business SegmentThere are very few quality companies in each business segment that NUAN operates in. Out of its business segments, NUAN seems to have the most competitive advantage in healthcare and the faces the most competition in enterprise.List of Potential AcquirersApple (NASDAQ:AAPL): NUAN already provides the voice recognition software to Apple's digital voice assistant, Siri, for all Apple mobile products. There are also rumors of Apple poaching the best NUAN employees to improve Siri. Apple can easily use its war chest balance sheet and acquire patents, talent, and ideas in order to develop a better in-house voice recognition, digital assistant, and artificial intelligence platform for its millions of Apple devices.Samsung (OTC:SSNLF): Samsung may want to shift away from the Google Android platform and into its in-house developed Tizen operating system. Having a decent voice assistant in new Samsung phones would be a value-added commodity if they decide to drop the Android platform in the future and reduce dependency on Google. In addition, a Samsung acquisition of NUAN would create a tough situation for Apple in voice recognition and artificial intelligence.Amazon: Amazon acquired a voice recognition startup called Yap in late 2011, and Amazon has not made a great return on this investment. Amazon buying NUAN would improve Amazon's web analytics and could revolutionize the retail industry with voice-activated online shopping.Twitter (NYSE:TWTR): The social networking site could benefit from having voice-activated tweets to make it easier for consumers to share content. There is also precedent for social networks to be involved with speech recognition software, considering that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) recently acquired a voice dictation startup called Wit.at.Microsoft: In an effort to bolster Cortana, its artificial intelligence/pattern recognition platform and voice assistant, Microsoft could acquire NUAN to directly compete with Google Now/Google Voice Search and be an industry leader in the speech recognition subindustry. In addition, Microsoft is already a top five customer of NUAN, demonstrating that Microsoft already believes that NUAN makes good products.IBM: In a continued effort to build up its data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning capabilities, and cloud enterprise solutions, adding NUAN's voice recognition system could be valuable to IBM. In addition, NUAN is already a top five customer of NUAN.Other Companies: St. June Medical (NYSE:STJ), Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A), McKesson (NYSE:MCK), Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO), and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) would benefit from purchasing the medical imaging and other healthcare solutions departments of NUAN.Institutional HoldingsThe top six institutional owners of NUAN own 42.6% of NUAN, which is a fairly high percentage given the concentrated nature of the holdings. Importantly, Carl Icahn and ClearBridge Investments are activist investors and own over 25% of NUAN. Activism investors usually have the tendency to increase shareholder value.Risk FactorsAs usual, no company is perfect, and NUAN does exhibit a few risk factors for investors. First, NUAN has significant debt with variable interest rates, and a rise in market interest rates would negatively affect cash flows and increase debt service requirements. Second, NUAN has made numerous acquisitions and has goodwill valued at $3.4 billion. Further acquisitions could dilute existing shareholders. Third, NUAN has adopted a poison pill, which could block Carl Icahn's shareholder activism, leading to less shareholder value being unlocked. Finally, Microsoft's Cortana, Google's voice search, and Google Now will provide stiff competition to NUAN's products in terms of voice recognition, speech-to-text, and artificial intelligence.Disjointed ManagementI have a fundamental belief that the current NUAN executive management do not work well together to maximize shareholder value. First, the executive management immediately moved towards a shareholders' rights plan (poison pill) to block Carl Icahn's steep buying of NUAN stock. This aggressive action against Icahn just screams of defense and a lackluster effort to engage in meaningful discussion with Icahn. Second, the executive management is not currently pursuing a sale or spinoff, which is irksome considering that more shareholder value would be unlocked. Third, while some NUAN Directors have purchased NUAN stock, the current management team, including Chairman and CEO Paul Ricci, continue to sell NUAN shares. Ricci sold 348,082 shares on November 28, 2014. I really hope that either the executive management makes a turnaround effort for the company, or Icahn and other investors change the company leadership, turnaround the company, and explore a sale through activism.My ProposalNUAN is an extremely undervalued business and is worth close to $7 billion in my opinion. Two potential triggers for the stock to trend upward include Facebook's recent of acquisition voice dictation startup, Wit.ai, and Carl Icahn's ~19% activist stake in the company (his firm is currently holding a loss in this position). NUAN has an incredibly strong business in healthcare and medical imaging: less competition, more NUAN product differentiation, and high profit margins. While NUAN's enterprise and mobile departments still fair well, NUAN faces lower profit margins and stiff competition from large technology companies. Overall, I propose to spin off or sell the enterprise, mobile, and consumer business segments of Nuance Communications. This will streamline the company to focus on its high-margin core strengths: healthcare and medical imaging. Luckily, a few companies would strongly benefit with realized synergies from acquiring NUAN's enterprise and mobile departments. Overall, with a spinoff or sale and a subsequent consolidation of NUAN's corporate activity, efficiency and shareholder value will tremendously increase."
2760225,80135,2014-12-17T15:22:20-05:00,"Voice recognition technologies are likely to witness growth during the next five years. Nuance is a prominent player in this space.The stock under performed during 2014, thanks to the net loss during the year.Consequently, the stock is trading quite cheaply, presenting investors with an opportunity to buy.FCF, EVA and PE based valuations reveal significant upside.","Sometimes beaten down stocks provide great value for prospective investors. This report is dedicated to one such stock that is Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:NUAN). The stock was an underperformer during 2014 as it lost 25% of its value during the last six months. Negative net income might be the reason Nuance underperformed during the last few quarters. However, with income expected to bounce back going forward, the stock seems quite underpriced. This report will discuss the valuation of Nuance in detail using the PE, EVA and FCF approach. Let's start with a brief introduction.Nuance Communications is a technology company that belongs to the application software industry. The company is involved in the provision of voice recognition and natural language solutions for consumers and enterprises. Nuance's primary solutions include customer service virtual assistants, speech recognition for consumers, professionals and businesses, and transcription and clinical documentation software and services for the healthcare industry. The company basically markets its speech-to-text solutions for different industries.Popular productsSome popular products of the company include Clintegrity 360, Nina Virtual Assistant, Copitrak and Dragon. Brief details are as follows:Clintegrity 360 is a clinical documentation solution that includes hands-free documentation, coding, documentation improvement and quality management services for the healthcare industry.Nina Virtual Assistant, as the name indicates, is a virtual assistant that automates customer services. The company claims that the virtual assistant delivers customer service through a human-like conversational interface.Copitrak is a cost management and cost recovery solution for law firms. The software offers features like recovering client-billable expenses, recording client information and allocating expenses to a particular client.Dragon, a speech recognition software, converts speech into text. Nuance offers separate solutions for consumers, professionals and businesses.Revenue classificationThe company generates its revenue from licensing its products or obtaining royalties from OEMs. Licenses are offered on a perpetual basis or term basis. Revenue for hosted services is based on volume of usage, number of seats or number of devices. Anyhow, the company serves four segments, including healthcare, mobile and consumer, enterprise and imaging. See the chart below: Source: Nuance earnings press releaseThe chart depicts that the company generates most of its revenue from healthcare, thanks to popular solutions like Clintegrity 360. During fiscal 2014, the company posted nominal revenue growth of 3.7% supported by 10.4% and 3.3% growth in enterprise and healthcare segment, respectively. However, the consumer segment and imaging segment offset this growth by 5.9% and 3%, respectively.Some other significant facts about the company include the following:Vantage Point - ValuationIn this section, the valuation of Nuance is explored in detail. Valuation metrics like PE, FCF and EVA are used to analyze whether the equity is cheap in the current scenario.Cash-flow approachNuance generates healthy cash flows. The company generated average operating cash flow of $408 million p.a. for the last three years. As net income is negative for the past two years, cash flow to revenue relation is analyzed to build a cash flow projection for the company. See below:Source: Yahoo Finance and author's calculations.Now, average OCF/revenue ratio is around 22.6%. This will be used as a starting point to project future cash flows. It can be argued that the ratio is declining year over year. The counter argument is that earnings are expected to witness double-digit growth going forward. OCF/Revenue ratio also will improve. Anyhow, to be prudent, a ratio of 20% will be used for calculation purposes. Average capital expenditures, as calculated above, will be used as a starting point, which also is assumed to remain constant going forward.Projection of revenue growth is a difficult task. Industry growth projections and recent revenue growth trends for the company are explored to select the growth figure. 7% growth for the next five years is assumed for calculations. This is a very cautious estimate. Industry experts are projecting double-digit growth. TechNavio projected a CAGR of 22% during 2012-2016 for the global voice recognition market.Source: TechNavio, BCC Research and ReportsnReportsAnalysts are expecting growth of 5.5% p.a. for the next two years. 7% seems to be a viable growth figure for the company given the combination of analysts' forecasts and double-digit industry growth.Miscellaneous assumptions:Source: Focus Equity estimatesSo, FCF-based valuation reveals an upside on around 23% relative to the current stock price of Nuance. Let's explore the EVA approach. For those of you not familiar with EVA, read this.EVA approachAs earnings are expected to grow at a much higher rate than revenue during the next five years, EVA may be the best approach to analyze Nuance. Sticking to the analysts' consensus for this one might be a good idea as well. Assumptions are as follows:Source: Focus Equity estimatesEVA-based valuation reveals a potential upside of 26%. Note that the assumptions are quite cautious. Analysts are expecting earnings growth of 20% p.a. for the next five years. Growth rate used in the above projection equates to CAGR of 11.5% during 2015-2019.PE approachNuance seems pretty cheap on a PE basis. The company is trading around 11.50 times forward earnings while earnings are expected to grow at CAGR of 20% p.a. during the next five years. The application software industry attracts a PE of 40.5, according to Yahoo Finance. Industry average mentioned by Reuters is 25.85. Thereby, Nuance is very cheap on a PE basis. A multiple of 15 is very reasonable, rather prudent for Nuance. PEG ratio of 0.62 also indicates that the stock is undervalued. Anything below 1 is considered cheap from a PEG perspective. PE-based valuation reveals an upside of 30% based on a justifiable multiple of 15.Source: Focus Equity estimatesFinal thoughtsTechnologies like voice recognition and speech-to-text are being adopted at a decent rate. Industry experts are forecasting double-digit growth. Nuance is a prominent player in the industry. Therefore, it is highly likely that the company will capitalize on the growth prospects in the industry.Now, from a valuation perspective, the stock seems a buy. FCF, EVA and PE based valuations project upside of 23%, 26% and 29%, respectively. This translates to an average equal weight price target of $17.8, or 27% upside. Neither of the valuations provides any downside evidence. All in all, I am inclined to rate the stock as a buy amid cheap valuations.For a different vantage point on Nuance, you can go to SA's analysis tab."
2786945,76425,2014-12-30T03:00:55-05:00,NUAN has established leadership in a growth industry.Earnings have stabilized.NUAN is diversified across many industries.Icahn has a large stake and is known for obtaining shareholder value by splitting up whole into parts.,"Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) is recognized as the premier voice and recognition technology company. It has become the predominant player in what was previously a fragmented industry. NUAN spent over four billion dollars in buying out its rivals, outspending its free cash flow while increasing debt and reporting decreasing margins to fund the acquisitions.The stock price is currently off about 20% from its 52 week high and almost 50% off from its 3 year high. Time to change strategy. Instead of licensing deals, the game plan is now growth from recurring revenues. For the full 2014 fiscal year, NUAN received 64% of its overall adjusted revenue from recurring revenue, up from around half in fiscal 2012. Licenses represented just 26% of adjusted revenue, down form 38% in 2012. Nuance clearly established a successful shift in executing its new strategy as it beat estimates for the recently completed quarter and provided 2015 guidance reflecting organic revenue growth and stability in operating efficiency, providing investors with reasonable expectations of what to expect from the now dominant player in a growth industry.The technical picture also indicates that the stock has found solid bottom support. The chart indicates a very positive double bottom has formed. In the meantime, hedge funds have become interested. Most notably, activist Carl Icahn has taken a very large position.Icahn is known for taking a stake in a company and forcing the company to enhance shareholder value by buying back shares, increasing the dividend or breaking itself up. Here's the problem for Icahn....NUAN's acquisition strategy has resulted in a company that serves multiple segments, including automotive, healthcare, mobile, imaging and consumer sectors. Healthcare represents about half of revenues. There aren't any potential suitors who would be interested in acquiring the company as a whole unless it would be as a defensive move to prevent a rival from acquiring it.Potential takeovers have stirred the pot. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a major customer of NUAN's as it uses Nuance's technology for its voice recognition system for the iPhone, known as SIRI. AAPL has been rumored to be interested in acquiring NUAN or perhaps to be pressured into the move by Icahn who has an ownership interest in AAPL. NUAN's stock fell on news that AAPL has been developing its own voice recognition software, but then came rumors of Samsung as a potential suitor that have not let to anything so far.On fundamentals, NUAN looks cheap. The forward P.E. of 12 and a PEG under 1 are clearly lower than comparable tech stocks. The forecasted growth rate is over 20%. Deutche Bank has a price target 44% higher than market price. Morgan Stanley sees 20% upside. There are several analysts coming in between Deutche Bank and Morgan Stanley's forecasts.NUAN has over 4,000 patents and patent applications, serves over two-thirds of Fortune 500 companies, offers software in over 50 languages, and is clearly the leader in its field. The chart, the earnings and the fundamentals indicate that a bottom has been formulated. Icahn first established a position in NUAN in early 2003. His brand of shareholder activism may result in realizing a boost to shareholders from splitting up the company and making it easier for Apple or Samsung or perhaps someone like Microsoft to come around and buy. In the meantime, the biggest downside risk in buying NUAN shares is that Icahn loses his patience and sells his stake."
2706275,22786,2014-11-25T07:20:05-05:00,"Nuance reports quarterly results November 24, 2014.Catalysts are likely absent in the report.Firm showing progress, but investors need results from management to come sooner.","Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) will report quarterly earnings after market close on November 24, 2014. The company's stock price is underperforming the tech sector, trading flat for the year. Nuance is up just 0.2 percent in 2014, compared to the 19.45 percent rise in the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:QQQ) index. Nuance badly needs positive catalysts to ignite a rally. Unfortunately, investors may only look forward to cost-cutting for organic growth. The firm might surprise the market with improving revenue from the healthcare sector. Still, the chances are not good Nuance will generate enough revenue growth to offset a drop in licensing revenue.Nuance needs a catalystNuance shares will likely trade in a narrow range. There is no visible catalyst that will help grow on-demand subscription and transactional revenue enough to replace licensing. However, there is hope. In the third quarter, backlog grew. The company thinks the backlog will contribute to revenue some time in its fiscal 2015.Another potential catalyst for Nuance is its mobile division. Revenue from mobile grew last quarter, and could improve again. Despite the growth, the mobile segment, notably the smartphone segment, faced pricing pressure again in the quarter. Sales from connected solutions offset this pressure.Revenue from automotive customers was also a strong performer. As automobiles adopt voice recognition in their user-end experience, Nuance will benefit.Insider sellingInvestors should note the recent insider selling. Nuance executives sold 161,500 shares in the first two weeks of November:Source: SEC LiveThere are other troubling trends for Nuance. Over the last five years, net profit was erratic. Debt-to-equity also rose since 2011. Heavy spending requirements in new business ventures are hurting the company's balance sheet.Source: marketVis.ioEven though the long-term past trends were erratic, Nuance is balancing lower revenue growth with higher efficiency and productivity.Bottom lineNuance is making progress diversifying its revenue from a variety of sources, including healthcare and automotive. This will take longer than investors expect. This might mean investors will demand a change in executive leadership to accelerate the transformational plan. Nuance may not show improving margins within the next few quarters. If there are no management changes after that time, the stock will likely fall further still."
3068956,28141,2015-04-14T10:05:01-04:00,"Cortana and Siri are coming to your PCs.Intel's Partnership with Nuance is a win, win.We expect Nuance's Consumer & Mobile segment to finally return to growth.","By Ted Rasa and John ZurzLast year, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) asked users how often and what they used mobile voice search to do or find, and the answers were exactly what you would expect. Teenagers and young adults were quick to adapt to the new technology, with 55% of teens using it at least once a day - to make calls, ask for directions, answer questions and get their scheduling right - while adults didn't use it quite as much; about 41% used it once a day - overwhelmingly to get directions, write texts and make calls.These numbers don't tell us anything we didn't already know, and if anything, they confirm it: that we do like our digital personal assistants - Siri, Google Now and Cortana - and that we do use them, frequently. Mostly while watching TV.So it makes sense that everyone is eager to bring our favorite mobile assistants to our home computers and other devices. This past March, Reuters reported that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is bringing Cortana, through an app, to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Android devices by the end of the year, as well as to Windows 10. Apple is likely to announce that Siri will be making the move to OSX at the next WWDC in June, and Google has also already begun moving Google Now to Chrome. Meanwhile, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has teamed with Nuance in an attempt to bring virtual assistants to our home computers and laptops.The announcement was first made in 2012, but finally began bearing fruit last year, when Intel announced that Nuance's (NASDAQ:NUAN) Dragon Voice Recognition technology was being built into its PCs. In short, no longer would you have to buy the Dragon app or program, so long as your computer uses the latest Intel chips. By doing this, Intel is not only bringing Dragon to every computer with its newest chips, but the company is creating a framework that will allow Microsoft, Google and Apple to our computers with greater ease, as much of the heavy lifting - on the technology side - will have been done already. In doing this, Intel and Nuance are creating a foundation for them to build and expand on.It turns your computer into your very own virtual assistant, one that is always listening. If you have or know someone who has an Xbox One, then you already know how it works - your computer will always be listening for a command, ""Hello Computer,"" and when it hears the command, it will turn on and carry out whatever order followed the command. For example, you could wake up and say, ""Hello Computer, what's today's forecast?"" and get a forecast. All without a single click of your mouse.""It doesn't matter what state the system will be in, it will be listening all the time,"" said Ed Gamsaragan, an engineer at Intel to Technologyreview.com. ""You could be actively doing work, or it could be in standby.""What makes Intel's approach different from the current one is that it isn't sending your commands out to the cloud to analyze and figure out what you want, which everyone else currently does, which is why there is a lag time of a few seconds before your phone gets you the information you asked for. Intel does it on the computer itself.Based on a new generation of smaller transistors, Intel's Core M chips have features as small as 14 nanometers. The new architecture also makes the chips more power-efficient and cooler than before, and as such they won't require cooling fans. The chips also allow for even thinner laptops, tablets and phones. Last summer, Intel showed off a prototype laptop that was only 0.28 inches thin - thinner than an iPad Air, but not by much, while having more computing power than the iPad.Eric Limer of Gizmodo writes:While Nuance has been helping Intel bring virtual assistants to our PCs, its consumer and mobile segment has not been doing well in recent years. It announced in quarter 1 of this year that the Dragon Desktop Voice Recognition line has not met expectations and is down year-over-year.For the last three years, Nuance's packaged software offering, Dragon NaturallySpeaking, has been in decline.Apple does license Nuance's voice technologies, but it doesn't seem to be helping the bottom line. As such, it probably isn't a royalty per iOS device sold deal, and is likely a blanket license, which isn't very good for Nuance's top and bottom lines.We don't quite know the details of Nuance's deal with Intel, and how it will be profiting from what appears to be a very lucrative venture, but we can hope the company has learned from the Apple deal and will be making royalties off of every Broadwell packaged with Nuance Voice Assist that Intel sells.We've seen in the short time that virtual assistants have been available on our mobile devices that they enjoy a certain amount of popularity, with 55% of teens and 41% of adults using them once a day - so it was only a matter of time until they made their way to our PCs. From here, with the rise of wearable technologies like the Apple iWatch, and the ever-advancing tide of the Internet of Things, we'll see our virtual assistants on our wrists, in our cars and in places we can't yet even dream of.There are going to be issues with bringing virtual assistants to everything else, the size of wearable tech will pose an issue, as will the fact that no two cars - even different models by the same company - have the same digital architecture, and the world will have to become more digital to accommodate them... but the tide is rapid, already rising and irresistible.In this case, it's driven not only by profit, of which there can be much, but by our own dreams. All kids dream of having the communicator watches from Bond movies or being able to tell a computer what you'd like to eat and have it get the meal for you, like in Star Trek - in fact, Google found 45% of teens and 36% of adults would like for their virtual assistants to be able to order them pizza.Virtual assistants, and wearable tech, are like flashy sports cars that shoot fire out the back in that way, they're the sort of thing everyone wanted as a kid but never thought they would ever get. The difference is you can actually have a virtual assistant without spending hundreds of thousands of dollars.Intel's OpportunityWith the help of its Voice Assist and RealSense technologies, Intel is not just sustaining its PC moat, but also maybe even widening it. Additionally, building an architecture with Nuance will help Intel lead the way in emerging world of IoTs and the smartphone/tablet business.Nuance's Consumer & Mobile SegmentIf Nuance is able to monetize its voice-recognition technologies properly, we believe the additions of new voice-enabled devices, partners and languages will return the company's Consumer & Mobile segment back to growth in 2015.For example, Apple just announced that Siri would support 8 new languages in the iOS 8.3 release, and the highly anticipated Apple Watch will further propagate the use of Nuance's technologies.With Nuance's stock price range-bound for months and massively underperforming, these next couple of months could get very interesting."
2496945,58811,2014-09-15T20:24:06-04:00,Voice ads are on the rise and could be a major hit.Capitulation bottom late last year is confirming and current entry is hard to beat.M&A highly probable.,"So Far So GoodIn the last several months Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) has been selling off, moving from a high of $19.50 to the mid $15's. In my previous article I stated, ""My personal view is that Nuance stock saw a capitulation bottom the day after the last earnings release."" At the time of that article, an investor could have bought Nuance at just over $15 and rode it up to $19.50. Even though the stock is back down at the $15 level, I am still firmly of the belief that the stock did in fact see a long-term bottom last November and that the long-term trend is now up.New let's take a look at what has happened since my last article and see what effect this all has on the ""brighter days ahead for Nuance"" theory.The first item of note is a simple one: the 200-day moving average has now turned upward for the first time in two years. Additionally, the stock saw a Golden Cross in June with the 50-day crossing above the 200-day. Thirdly, on a weekly chart the stock made a huge break of the upper Bollinger band on big volume in June. While I'm not investing in Nuance for technical reasons, these are nonetheless confirmations of my thesis.In the last two earnings releases we saw that growth is alive and well at Nuance, but hidden from the casual spectator due to revenue elongation. But under the surface a few metrics shine a light. In Q2 bookings were up 43% and deferred revenue was up 30%, and Q3 bookings were up 17% and deferred revenue was up 32%, versus a year earlier. The transition from up-front revenue to recurring revenue causes the headline numbers to show stagnant growth while these metrics show the underlying reality.We also saw in May that George Soros took a stake in Nuance. As to the other major investor, Carl Icahn, he has held on to his 20% stake and his two appointees remain on the board.So Now What?HEALTHCARE - First we have an ICD-10 deadline coming up in October 2015. This means that healthcare entities have a year to complete the changeover to ICD-10 coding. Those in the industry will be looking at the best systems to handle the new coding method, which means ample sales potential for Nuance with its ability to save time for all involved via speech interfacing. Nuance explains it best: ""To ensure appropriate reimbursement in ICD-10, patient information must be highly specific and clearly recorded. Nuance Healthcare provides ICD-10 ready clinical documentation and coding solutions. These solutions will include Computer Assisted Physician Documentation (OTCPK:CAPD), a breakthrough technology being developed for clinical document improvement (NYSE:CDI), and computer assisted coding (NASDAQ:CAC).VOICE ADS - Another area of potential growth lies in voice ads. Announced April 2013, we have yet to see this really take off, but we are now beginning to see it adopted. Millenial Media is now offering it as a service, and this article from AdWeek.com shows the huge potential. This page from XAPP Media is a demo of the actual ads where consumers can say things like ""Email me a coupon,"" or ""Download app,"" after the tone, to engage with the ad. Instead of advertisers saying remember this 800 number then call us, you just prompt your listener to say okay and you connect with them. Want to try it yourself, just download the free NPR News app.Additionally, there is a trove of data to be collected here from accents to gender identification to background clues, etc. And as we know from Facebook and Google, you can make a lot of money if you can utilize data to enable advertisers to target their ads.A few notable quotes from the AdWeek article…M&A - On June 16 the WSJ reported that Nuance had recently held talks with Samsung and P-E firms about a potential sale. Then on July 26 dealReporter said that the talks were slowed by complexities. What exactly is going on here is not that important. What is important is that Nuance is the dominant superior player in the voice recognition space. As a ""neutral"" party licensing their technology to any and all comers, big companies like Apple and Samsung are okay. But if any one of them buys Nuance, it can quickly become a battle of the bids as each company realizes they don't want to rely on their competitor to license key technology, especially a technology that takes a lot of time to develop. My guess is that Icahn's plan is to get all his ducks in a row and then get the bidding war underway. A comment from SA author dgulick sums it up nicely, ""comparison to Apple Maps is a good one, a Siri that can't understand you is a move Apple absolutely *must* avoid!""ALL THINGS VOICE - Beyond these specifics, there is the simple fact that we're moving more and more towards a voice-interaction world. Banco Santander México is using voice biometrics to identify customers, voicemail-to-text is coming into the main stream, the move towards wearable devices will push more voice interaction as devices get too small to press buttons on a screen. The list goes on and on as to how people would prefer to use voice to interact with devices if it works properly, and Nuance stands to benefit from all of that.CONCLUSION - In a market where technology stocks are getting 20, 30, 50 times sales valuations, having an opportunity to buy a company at 2 ½ times sales with huge growth potential as well as outright buyout potential is hard to pass up. Mr. Market has offered a very nice entry point that I believe offers a very compelling risk/reward."
2582515,28141,2014-10-22T07:48:08-04:00,Nuance is the industry leader in Voice-Recognition Technologies and a fast-growing Cloud Computing Company.Recurring Revenue equates to 65% of all sales.Private Market Value of $22.75 per share should be conservative price tag.,"Over the course of 2 years, I have closely watched and studied Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN). One could classify this company as misunderstood because of an ambiguous executive management. I often find myself giggling at frustrated sell-side analysts during conference call Q&As. The stock itself has behaved very poorly and I have taken advantage of the decline with additional stock purchases.My Investment Thesis in a nutshell:As the eco-system of voice-enabled devices and apps grow, so will Nuance. I also believe we are very close to a tipping point.One of the latest apps sporting Nuance's technology is the new Domino's (NYSE:DPZ) Pizza App for smartphones.After reading Barron's over the weekend, I happened to discover a very interesting note in the ""Activist Spotlight."" Private Equity firms and strategic investors often acquire software companies at multiples of recurring revenue. On September 30, Tibco Software (NASDAQ:TIBX) was purchased for $4.3 billion or 7x its recurring revenue by Vista Equity Partners.Since the buyout, rumors had emerged at Nuance during the summer. I thought it would be prudent to create a valuation based on the 7x recurring sales multiple paid for TIBCO.During last August's Q3 conference call, CEO Ricci stated that Nuance's sales are now 65% recurring revenues and growing. If we use the same valuation metric for Nuance, we have a Private Market Value (PMV) of $8.74 billion or approximately $22.75 per share.Current Market Cap: $4.73bCurrent Enterprise Value: $6.14bTotal Buyout Value: $8.74bBuyout Market Capitalization: $7.24b (Current Mkt Cap * 1.53)/Shares Outstanding) equates to ~$22.75 per shareFor a company that is a leader in its industry and close to the tipping point, I consider this valuation to be cheap. A few months ago, I wrote an article, ""Nuance: It's All About the Debt Redemption Baby"", speculating that management could be prepping the company for a buyout (of +$23.30/share) or outperformance with the purchase of convertible debt. Coincidentally, the price using the Recurring Revenue multiple falls right into this range. This comparable buyout valuation only helps solidify my conviction on Nuance."
2618435,53622,2014-10-30T13:43:43-04:00,"Nuance's transition to a recurring revenue model has pressured the stock price.Due to fears about losing Apple as a customer, I provide a Nuance valuation ex-Apple.An inflection point is nearing, with potential 35%-82% upside.","It's typically not a good idea being long Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) through earnings. The past four earnings/conference calls have led to a drop of 9%, 3%, 5%, and 18%, respectively, typically due to difficulties meeting expectations and/or lowering guidance. Management keeps noting the difficulties of the company's transition to a recurring revenue business model, with faster-than-expected erosion of revenue in healthcare transcription volumes and consolidation in the smartphone industry impacting the mobile segment. The tide may be about to change for shareholders, however, as the valuation gap between Nuance and other Software as a Service (SaaS) peers begins to close.Year of TransitionWith Nuance due to report FY2014 and file its 10-k on November 24, shareholders will have a chance to put this past year behind them and get a glimpse of what management is expecting for the year ahead. But first, let's take a look back at a few comments from last year's Q4 2013 conference call, which clearly indicated that FY2013 would be a year of transition for the business model, which would pressure revenue:Understanding that investors will have a difficult time embracing this transition as growth appears to stagnate, management decided to help investors determine progress by reporting bookings:While the addition of bookings has been helpful, I made particular note of the last part of that quote:Given that fiscal '14 closed on September 30, 2014, investors may finally be able to look forward to a year of renewed growth, which could mark an inflection point in the stock.Reasons for OptimismAlthough Nuance is expected to report lower earnings and flat revenue for FY2014, investors should look beyond the headline numbers and pay attention to the signs of improved profitability for FY2015. For instance, look at the y-o-y growth in bookings, total deferred revenue and estimated 3-year value of total on-demand contracts:Since management has not given any guidance related to fiscal '15, the speed at which the bookings and deferred revenue will hit the top line is uncertain. Given that uncertainty typically leads investors to ""sell first and ask questions later,"" I expect investor sentiment to gradually improve, as investors are able to start modeling future revenue and profitability trends with more certainty as they begin to have more data to work with.Despite the disappointing year (if share price is used as the determining factor), I'm surprised that Nuance doesn't get more credit for its ability to generate strong free cash flow (FCF), which reflects the increasing impact of recurring revenue models. I'm defining FCF as operating cash flow minus capex.As you can see, FCF has been increasing each quarter thus far in fiscal '14, totaling 220.8 million through three quarters. And if you add in the FCF from Q4 2013, Nuance is currently sporting a healthy FCF yield of 6.3%.Apple FearsEver since the iPhone 4s was released in October 2011, there has been plenty of speculation regarding Nuance's role with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and its well-known virtual assistant, Siri. Nuance finally admitted that it provides the voice recognition (VR) that powers Siri, but shortly thereafter, various reports started popping up that Apple had set up a research team to improve Siri and possibly replace Nuance's VR. Then, over this past summer, a fresh round of speculation started popping up, which even led to a ridiculous article posted here on Seeking Alpha that ""Apple Could Take Nuance Down.""But when you consider this quote from Nuance's Q3 2014 prepared remarks (my emphasis added):I don't think it's a done deal that Apple has replaced Nuance, or is even planning on it. Nonetheless, just to be conservative, let's take a look at how much an Apple-less Nuance would actually suffer.If we assume that Nuance's mobile and consumer segment profit will remain flat q-o-q in Q4 2014, then the company would report FY2014 mobile segment profit of $72.2 million. Given that Nuance generates revenue from Samsung, LG, its PC business and its automotive business in this segment, I find it unlikely that Apple would account for even a third of the segment profit. But just to be on the conservative side again, let's back out one-third of the segment profit coming from Apple to adjust the financials ex-Apple. This means that Nuance's FY2014 mobile and overall profit will be reduced by about $24 million, or about $0.09 per share. Using the low-end of guidance, this equates to non-GAAP FY 2014 EPS of $0.94 ex-Apple.Peer ComparisonAfter backing out potential Apple-related earnings from Nuances's FY 2014, let's take a look at how Nuance is currently valued in relation to Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), which are SaaS peers going through a similar transition to recurring revenue models.Since not all earnings are created equal, I also like to look at how each company is priced based on its free cash flow. Given that Nuance has been reporting operating cash roughly equal to earnings, I am backing out $0.09 FCF/share to account for ex-Apple.And to account for the net debt of each company, here is a look at the enterprise value (EV) to non-GAAP earnings.But Isn't Voice Recognition Getting Commoditized?Apart from worries about losing Apple as a customer, most Nuance detractors point to fears about voice recognition becoming commoditized by the likes of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While it's true that both of those tech titans have their own virtual assistants in Google Now and Cortana, the common thought appears to be that both companies are willing to give away their technology for free, thus commoditizing Nuance and causing its revenue and margins to fall. But a little bit of research will indicate that these fears are overblown.Cortana was just recently launched, and in typical Microsoft fashion, appears to be playing catch-up to the current tech scene. And while Google Now is certainly a good product and will be a natural fit into Google's R&D and future product offerings, Google has long sought to protect its core search business. This is no more apparent than when looking at Nuance patent application 20140316785, which has the following field of invention (my emphasis added):In addition, if VR and virtual assistants were truly commoditized, then wouldn't two of the biggest Android manufacturers, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and LG (OTC:LGEIY), be using Google's offerings in lieu of Nuance? I realize that Samsung is trying to break away from Android with its Tizen operating system. But the point is, why would these companies have well-established relationships with Nuance if their current operating system came with similar functionality for free? In a similar vein, inquisitive minds would wonder why Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) partnered with Nuance for its speech commands in PCs, instead of extending its long-time alliance with Microsoft.Diverse BusinessEven if some of these fears in Nuance's mobile segment actually do start to materialize, it's important to understand that Nuance actually has a pretty diversified business. Its largest segment is actually the healthcare segment, generating 48% of the company's revenue and 60% of the profit through the year's first nine months. The enterprise segment is the third-largest of the four segments, generating 18% and 13% of the revenue and profit respectively. The imaging segment is currently the smallest, clocking in at 11% and 14%, but still contributes a healthy amount of cash to help support R&D and growth in the other segments.Although I've heard many investors complain about the multiple business segments and clamor for a break-up, I don't think this would be the appropriate action right now. While the imaging segment may seem unrelated to the rest of the business at first blush, it actually fits in more than expected. Through Nuance's PowerScribe 360 service, radiology image sharing has been added to the company's healthcare cloud. And as stated by Peter Durlach, senior vice president of marketing and strategy at Nuance, ""The healthcare division of our company accounted for about $911 million in revenue this year... and $130 million of that had nothing to do with voice recognition.""Speaking of the healthcare business, Nuance appears to have built a very solid moat in the VR and Clinical Language Understanding (CLU) space through its own products and numerous acquisitions over the past several years. While these acquisitions have required the company to take on almost $1.3 billion of long-term debt, and have admittedly had disappointing results thus far, the fact that Nuance has just about a monopoly in the space can't be overlooked. Add in the potential upside of a virtual medical assistant and world-class partners like Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) and Epic which dominate the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) space, Nuance's healthcare division appears to be poised for growth.So How Much Upside Could There Be?If you believe that easier comps, bookings growth and better visibility into the company's transition to a recurring revenue model will bring about renewed investor confidence, then an investment in Nuance could lead to big gains as the valuation gap with its SaaS peers begins to close.My preferred method of valuation is based on the price/FCF, which implies the following upside:And remember, this is based on the current financials ex-Apple, meaning that the upside could be much greater if an Apple relationship is maintained or possibly expanded.Other RisksIn addition to the risk of losing business from Apple and VR being commoditized, there also are a few other risks that investors should be aware of. One risk is that voice apps, virtual assistants and other human-machine interactions may not garner the type of acceptance with the business community or consumers as currently expected. This would significantly reduce the demand for Nuance's core offerings and make the company's debt load a little more worrisome. Although the $479 million of term loans don't mature until August 2019 and the $690 million convertible debt isn't due until 2031, investors will certainly pay attention to the company's cash flow.Another risk is the fast-changing tech world and Nuance's ability to adapt and maintain its dominant position in VR and NLU. The new fad is with neural network NLP, which some have speculated as being the future of human-machine interaction. But with Nuance on pace to spend $336 million in R&D in fiscal 2014, along with having over 3,000 patents and 1,100 patent applications, I believe that Nuance will be up to the task. This also is represented by the fact that Nuance supports 80 languages and dialects, and can provide natural-sounding synthesized speech in 151 voices.Executive CompensationAnother well-covered topic related to Nuance is the seemingly excessive level of executive compensation. An interesting item to note about this, however, is the recent resignation of a board member who was on the compensation committee. This leads me to believe that investors may see a change in executive compensation philosophy when the company releases its proxy and annual shareholder materials.ConclusionIt has certainly been a rough transition to a recurring revenue model for Nuance shareholders over the past couple years. I'm looking for management guidance and remarks on fiscal 2015 to mark an inflection point as investor confidence slowly starts to rebuild. In addition, the ""Apple Fears"" will prove to be unfounded and relatively inconsequential to Nuance going forward. And with a very well-known and respected activist investor in Carl Icahn having two board seats, I think shareholder interests will be well represented in board meetings and will soon start showing in the share price. Overall, I am looking for 35%-82% upside in the next 12 months."

The headline numbers were:Although the fourth-quarter results were very strong and beat my expectations, the revenue and earnings guidance for FY15 were disappointing. Nuance management guided for FY15 non-GAAP revenue of $2.02B to $2.08B and non-GAAP EPS between $1.10 and $1.20. In a previous article, I opined that improved profitability and better revenue visibility would mark an inflection point for the stock as growth resumed and investor confidence returned. This guidance will likely do little to improve investor confidence, however, as the earnings midpoint of $1.15 marks a miniscule 2.7% growth as margins are once again expected to shrink.That being said, I do have a feeling that Nuance management was trying to control expectations and provided guidance that may prove conservative if operational efficiencies are realized. And with a forward P/E of 13.3 and cash flow that should exceed $360 million, I expect the company to begin aggressively buying back shares after redeeming $250 million in debt last quarter. Lastly, Carl Icahn still holds two board seats, and some of his maneuvering in the board room may become clearer when the proxy materials are released in December. I still plan to hold my shares in Nuance as I don't see much downside right now, but the guidance certainly tempered my enthusiasm on the potential upside."

However, despite an increase in revenue, its non-GAAP net income declined to $88.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $110.4 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, in the prior-year period.The reason behind this drop in earnings can be attributed to high executive compensation that Nuance executives generally take home. As pointed out by Seeking Alpha writer Andrew Lim in his Pro article back in March, Nuance execs take home a whopping 90% of its operating income. As such, it is not surprising to see why Nuance is still not profitable on a GAAP basis, and even its non-GAAP net income is now declining, due to a drop in operating margins. In fact, in the last quarter, Nuance's operating margin was 23.9%, down from 29.1% in the year-ago quarter.Apple's threatOn the other hand, Nuance is in danger of facing competition from Apple, which is its customer right now. Nuance supplies the technology for Siri to Apple, but it has been reported that Apple is developing an in-house solution. As reported by The Next Web:So, it looks like Nuance is in danger of losing a client such as Apple going forward. So, in case the rumors regarding a sale of the company do not materialize, Nuance will be a risky bet.Some positivesHowever, there are some positives for Nuance bulls. The company increased its bookings by 43% from the same quarter last year to $638 million in Q2, and exceeded its 15% annual bookings growth guidance in Q1. However, the caveat is that these bookings in the second quarter were a result of several deals that happened earlier in the year than originally anticipated, including one large connected service deal in the automotive market.In addition, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has chosen Nuance's voice and language solutions for its portfolio of mobile apps. Through this agreement, Oracle will use Nuance Cloud Services to add speech recognition and synthesis to certain mobile apps that support Oracle applications.Weak fundamentalsBut, the positives are brief in nature. A closer look at Nuance's fundamentals and earnings growth projections will give investors a reason to worry. Nuance has a weak balance sheet, with cash of $809 million and a massive debt of $2.37 billion. The company's current ratio is also weak, at 1.67. Also, for the next five years, analysts expect Nuance's earnings to grow at a CAGR of just 0.76%. Considering that the company's bottom line got worse in the previous quarter, Nuance doesn't look like a good buy.ConclusionNuance shares have done well this year, but the performance might not be sustainable. Moreover, investors shouldn't buy the stock on the basis of speculation. Nuance is trading at its 52-week high and has weak fundamentals, while its financial performance isn't up to the mark as well. So, it would be a wise idea for investors to stay clear of this stock.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In recent weeks, negative headwinds hurt the recovery: Nuance admitted a takeover would be complex, third quarter results were weak, and next quarter's outlook was lighter than expected.Nuance shares fell sharply after third quarter earnings were announced.NUAN data by YChartsThird quarter highlightsGAAP revenue was nearly flat, at $475.5 million, but bookings rose 16.7 percent to $547 million. Deferred revenue rose 32 percent. Quarterly losses grew to $52.25 million, up from a loss of $34.97 million last year. This is due largely to a surge in stock-based compensation, which rose from $39.2 million to $55.38 million in Q3. Non-cash stock-based compensation nearly doubled, to $10.53 million, in the professional services and hosting segment.Healthcare and mobile/consumer were the two top contributors to revenue. Healthcare accounted for $240.1 million of revenue, while mobile and consumer solutions added $109.2 million.The research and development cost line item also rose from $8.7 million last year to $12.96 million.Nuance ended the quarter with $888.5 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.Progress of transitionNuance's revenue model transition in health care was a challenge during the quarter. Even with backlog providing a boost, the firm still expects revenue will fall short of analyst expectations. Recurring revenue is not accelerating, but Nuance plans to accelerate sales in the mobile channel.Nuance said on its conference call on-demand revenue exceeded products and licensing revenue.OutlookNuance forecast lower revenue, but expected bookings would improve in the next quarter. The firm expects gross margin improvements are achievable through better operating efficiency. Bookings benefited from a shift towards recurring and subscription revenue. Dragon Medical, MFP printing solutions, and automotive contributed to a stronger bookings number.ChallengesAcquisitions did not add as meaningfully to Nuance's bottom line as previously hoped. The imaging business unit, along with a faster-than-expected transition in the revenue model weighed on the revenue forecast for Q3. Nuance admitted Nina mobile solutions was a more complex product for customers. This slowed implementation for the product. Nuance expects that despite the longer implementation time, sales will accelerate over time.Bottom lineSince a takeover is off the table, at least for now, and the transition in healthcare and from subscription sales is taking longer than previously thought, the downside could accelerate. Investors will be less confident Nuance will realize its hidden value this fiscal year. Nuance remains an attractive value play, but investors should look at selling Nuance now. Prudent investors may add Nuance at prices below $15.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

        Apple is reportedly developing its speech recognition software, and has hired former Nuance employees.
        Apple's CarPlay can hurt Nuance's automotive prospects.","Speech technology provider Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) is in a soup. Known for providing the technology for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) voice assistant Siri, the company is going through troubled times. Nuance is still unprofitable, and has a negative return on equity of 6%. In addition, Nuance's revenue growth has slowed down remarkably, while it has a huge debt load of $2.37 billion as compared to cash of just $809 million.An acquisition looks unlikelyRecently, there has been chatter on the Street that Nuance is exploring a possible sale and might be acquired by the likes of Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). As reported by the Wall Street Journal:Hence, it is unclear whether Nuance will be able to find a buyer, and investors should consider this as more of a rumor. Moreover, given the fact that Nuance has weak fundamentals as stated earlier, it might not be able to find a buyer.The company is still not profitable and its bottom line is expected to grow at the rate of just 0.76% for the next five years, worse than the growth of 3.75% in the last five. In addition, Nuance has a weak current ratio of just 1.67, indicating that the company might find it hard to meet short-term obligations, which doesn't make it good value at a market cap of almost $6 billion.However, Nuance shares have appreciated on rumors of a sale, and if this turns out to be just a rumor, then they might fall.Apple going its own wayMoreover, it looks like the company is about to suffer as one of its major clients, Apple, is reportedly developing its own speech recognition software. Although Nuance doesn't report the amount of revenue it generates from Apple, still, considering the huge number of iPhones that are sold around the world, it can be expected that it generates sizable royalty revenue from Siri. Moreover, it looks like Nuance is already facing problems due to Apple's in-house moves. As reported in the company's latest 10-K:It won't be surprising if Apple moves awaySo, it is possible that Apple is already taking away some business from Nuance, as a result of which it saw lower licensing revenue in mobile last fiscal year. Moreover, there are indications that Apple is making its own speech recognition software, while Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another threat. According to a report on Forbes last year:Hence, there's a probability that Apple might move away from Nuance. Now, Apple has a team of ""top speech technologists in Boston to eventually eliminate its dependence on Nuance for Siri,"" according to The Next Web. In fact, Apple has poached certain Nuance employees, such as Gunnar Evermann, who specializes in developing speech recognition technology; Larry Gillick, who is now Chief Speech Scientist, Siri at Apple; and Don McAllaster, another ex-Nuance employee who is now Senior Research Scientist at Apple.The CarPlay threatSo, the writing seems to be on the wall for Nuance, and there is a strong probability that Apple is going its own way. Also, if Apple uses its own technology in Siri, this would be harmful for Nuance's automotive business as well. Nuance's connected car platform, known as Dragon Drive, is used by the likes of Audi, BMW, Daimler, Chrysler, Toyota (NYSE:TM) and others. Now, Apple is coming with its own solution, known as CarPlay, and this might spell trouble for Nuance.Apple had launched CarPlay earlier this year. CarPlay is a rebranded version of iOS for automobiles, offering hands-free calling functions, Siri search, messaging, and maps. More importantly, Apple has tied up with several well-known car manufacturers for the use of Siri. As stated in an earlier post:ConclusionHence, quite clearly, Nuance can come under pressure from Apple. The company already has weak fundamentals and huge debt. The advent of Apple's own speech-recognition platform can spell trouble for Nuance and constrict its growth further in the long run. So, investors are best advised to stay away from Nuance as it looks like a risky investment.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2441955,56382,2014-08-21T11:56:47-04:00,"Nuance Communications is struggling, as the company is going for a change of the business model.However, Nuance should see more predictable revenue streams in the future as a result of its business model change.Nuance's latest innovations are clicking well, allowing the company to pen new deals.Nuance's bottom line is expected to grow at a faster rate in the coming five years than the last five.","Speech recognition specialist Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) started the year brightly, but the stock seems to have hit a speed bump after reporting its third-quarter results. Nuance reported weak numbers for the third quarter on account of rising costs and a transition in its business model.A weak performanceThe numbers were not only below Street expectations, but also down on a year-over-year basis. In addition, management gave a weak outlook. Consequently, its stock has declined around 5% since its results were released on August 11.Nuance's adjusted revenue for the quarter came in at $486.81 million, which is marginally less than $490.8 million in the year-ago period. Its non-GAAP net income also fell to $87.6 million from $109.5 million last year. On a GAAP basis, its net loss widened to $54.2 million from $35 million last year. In addition, its operating margin declined to 23.5% from 28.1% in the same period last year.Hence, Nuance struggled last quarter. But now, the question is, will Nuance get better in the future?Transition painsThe numbers in the previous quarter were, no doubt, not up to the mark. Nuance, however, is undergoing a transition from traditional software license sales to a subscription-based business model. In the former model, the company used to get instant revenue when the product was sold. However, in a subscription based model, the payment from customers is spread over the entire period of its use. In the long run, this model might be more beneficial, as it ensures more predictable and recurring source of revenue.But, the problem is that management has not clearly revealed the entire proceedings of the model shift and there are a lot of grey areas, which the investors are not fully aware of. According to Canaccord Genuity's Richard Davis, ""Nuance seems to be a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma.""Positive indicatorsBut apart from these headwinds, Nuance has certain deals that could fuel its growth in the coming days. China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) has leveraged Nuance's speech technology to provide better support and service to its callers, who previously had to listen to a series of phone menus, which were quite confusing. According to a Nuance release:This customer win is a testament to Nuance's strong product development, and since it is being used by China Mobile, which is among the world's biggest telecom companies, it can be expected that the company might land more such deals going forwardIn addition, Nuance has also launched its new Dragon software that will allow PC users to convert voice messages into written text.According to a report:Also, Nuance has incorporated various measures to reduce its expenses that enabled the company to reach the mid point of its earnings guidance during the third quarter. Management said:Yet, it will be too early to call this as a turnaround since management is not very optimistic about the near-term, and it consequently lowered its outlook. According to research firm FBR Capital Markets:ConclusionCurrently, Nuance does not have any signs of a trailing P/E because it is incurring losses. However, its forward P/E seems attractive at 14.33, which shows that its bottom line will improve in the future. Moreover, its business is undergoing a transition period, because of which it facing various challenges. But once the transition is complete, investors can expect a steady flow of revenue in accordance with its new business model.Because of a poor set of numbers during the previous quarter, Nuance's share price has declined. But, over the next five years, its earnings are expected to improve at a CAGR of almost 10%, which is way better than the last five year's average of just 3.75%. So, investors should consider capitalizing on Nuance's recent drop as the company's performance is expected to improve in the future."
1980291,58811,2014-01-30T10:44:07-05:00,,"Ah, yes, earnings season. Where we all gather around the laptop, crack open a cold one, and watch our stock drop 20%. OK, maybe that's not the typical experience, but any Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) investor over the last year knows what I'm talking about.On Jan. 21, Nuance announced preliminary results for the first quarter of $487-$491 million in revenues vs. previous guidance of $477-$487, and EPS of 23-24 cents vs. guidance of 18-21 cents. On this news, the stock rose 8%.My personal view is that Nuance is turning a corner long term. While the preliminary results are encouraging, official earnings will be released after the bell on Feb. 10. Here's what I'll be watching for in Q1 earnings for confirmation/contradiction of my long-view thesis.GuidanceGuidance has come to be the holy grail of Nuance earnings releases. It's getting to the point where the actual earnings could be skipped entirely and a one-paragraph press release spelling out guidance would suffice.Looking back at the last four earnings releases, Nuance stock dropped roughly 20% on three of those occasions. The actual results were not the issue (one-cent miss, six- cent miss, one-cent beat), but rather each was accompanied by dismal guidance, with full-year projections always taking a hit. It was blamed on everything from sales execution to weakness in Europe to a decline in manual transcription of medical records to revenue model transition.Once again, Nuance investors will be sitting on the edge of their seats awaiting this quarter's guidance. John Bright of Avondale Partners said that ""starting fiscal 2014 with a solid beat will begin to restore confidence and credibility."" I agree, but any reduction in guidance, especially for the full year, will cause the stock to continue on its downward slide regardless of the actual Q1 results.On the other hand, an increase in full-year guidance would be extremely positive for the stock. In my last article I argued that Nuance has various forms of potential for brand-new revenue. If the company sees any of these new revenue streams coming online, they would be apt to bump up the full-year guidance. That would not only be good news in its own right, but would also signal a sea change in the company's earnings giving even more reasons for bulls to cheer.Whatever the case, be very sure that guidance will play a large role in the future direction of Nuance stock.Stock BuybackAs of the end of the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, Nuance had completed $185 million of its $500 million stock buyback authorization announced last spring. I'll be keenly watching to see how aggressive the buyback was this quarter.My personal view was that Nuance stock saw a capitulation bottom the day after the last earnings release. All the earmarks are present. The stock traded over 60 million shares, 20% of its float, in one day while dropping from $16 to $13. From that point the stock climbed steadily back to its 50-day MA before gapping up on the preliminary earnings last week.If management saw fit to aggressively buy back stock at that $13 level, it would provide further confirmation that the bottom is in. Normally I wouldn't expect management of a company to have a trader's mentality, but with Icahn on board, it would be a classic move for him to push for an aggressive buyback at an historic low.On a side note, a comparison of the Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) chart from Oct. 1, 2012, to Feb. 1, 2013, shows a striking resemblance to the Nuance chart for the past three months. I think most investors would agree that HPQ experienced a capitulation bottom in November 2012.Click to enlarge images.Hot TopicsOne of the interesting things about Nuance is that it defies categorization. It's a PC software company, a healthcare company, a mobile device company, and a call center company. Icahn gave it the not-so-thrilling name of ""The Voice of Healthcare"" -- not exactly creating goosebumps. I prefer ""Mobile Advertising 2.0"" or ""The Go-To Company for Wearables."" So I'll be looking for any substantial discussion in the press release or earnings call regarding hot topics, specifically mobile advertising and wearable tech.At this year's CES, Nuance demonstrated its technology for wearable tech. Wearables have the potential to drive voice activation technology quite rapidly as it is the only realistic way to interact with these devices that, due to their size, don't allow for the typical touchscreen interface. I believe it's only a matter of time before stocks associated with wearable tech go the way of social media and 3D printers, namely up.On the mobile advertising front, Nuance announced last April its launch of Voice Ads, a technology that utilizes the microphones in mobile devices to create two-way advertising. Since its announcement this technology has flown completely under the radar with almost no coverage. JetBlue had the first campaign in the fall, and now Toyota (NYSE:TM) is out with a voice ad that demonstrates its in-car voice commands. Amazingly, Nuance has sold Toyota an advertising technology to demonstrate Toyota's automotive voice technology, also provided by Nuance -- talk about cross-sell!The ultimate point here is that any meaningful discussion of Nuance making inroads into mobile advertising and/or wearable tech, especially if tied to improved earnings, will no doubt cast the company in a very nice light.New MetricsIn the last earnings release Nuance told us they'll be adding a new metric to the earnings releases in the form of bookings. This, in conjunction with the estimated three-year value of total on-demand contracts, allows investors to see the ongoing business from another angle beyond just standard revenue and earnings. Because the company is transitioning from license model to on-demand model, it's a way of saying, ""Hey, look, we're not booking the revenue up front, but the same or better business is coming in the door.""They've introduced the metric, I'm sure it's not by accident, so I'm eager to see (with a grain of salt) what shows up on those particular lines. Maybe I'm making things too Icahn-ic, but I actually see him lurking in this updated reporting metric. This along with the newly arrived ""What's Next"" section of the Nuance website shows a company trying to work on its image. I believe the core thesis of many of Icahn's investments is buying companies that are misunderstood and being discounted as a result. The next step is to get them un-misunderstood, which is what Nuance seems to be doing.Organic GrowthThe other metric to watch is organic growth. As seen below, organic growth has become non-existent, going from 13% in 2012 to -3% in 2013. I believe that this drop is due to both the transition to an on-demand revenue model and the fact that Nuance acquisitions were made for long-term positioning at the expense of short-term numbers. So the fact that there is a lull in organic growth is not of particular concern, but it does deserve a close watch as it needs to be a temporary lull that eventually picks up steam again.ConclusionNuance is a multi-faceted, misunderstood, undervalued company undergoing a temporary dip in growth and is on sale as a result. That's my thesis, and I'm sticking to it -- unless the earnings results steer me in another direction. All companies that have long declines start with what could potentially be a temporary decline, so investing in this manner requires close attention to the company and its potential to resume growth.Disclosure: I am long NUAN.

2119053,56202,2014-03-31T18:52:23-04:00,Nuance has introduced a variety of new and impressive products that could drive its business higher.But Nuance could be hurt big time if Apple develops its own speech system and cuts off its relationship with Nuance.Nuance’s management takes home a handsome pay and this could limit its growth.,"Voice and language solutions provider, Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN), has seen some good times this year with revenue growth of 15%. The company has been reporting some good developments in the business that could lead to more gains going forward. However, as Seeking Alpha writer Andrew Lim wrote, Nuance could also be a value trap due to high executive compensation, an aggressive acquisition strategy and steep debt. So, should investors remain positive about Nuance's prospects or stay away from the stock? Let's find out.Positives galoreNuance has seen tremendous progress in segments such as healthcare, mobile & consumer, enterprise and imaging, thus recording 26% year over year growth in bookings in the previous quarter.Nuance has built a strong portfolio in healthcare, driving significant demand from this sector. Nuance's growth is primarily driven by the recent product developments in healthcare solutions, such as Dragon Medical 360, Clintegrity 360, PowerScribe 360 and healthcare diagnostics that have led to high demand from retail as well as wholesale customers. Nuance anticipates higher growth in the second quarter as it is receiving positive response from its recent healthcare products, such as computer-assisted solutions and CLU-based solutions.Nuance is also seeing strong growth in its mobile & consumer segment, recording handsome revenue of $115.3 million. The company has observed a significant improvement in its prospects after the recent launch of Nina -- the intelligent virtual assistant -- for its key customers such as Denso (OTCPK:DNZOF), Fiat (FIATY), Fujitsu (OTCPK:FJTSY), GM (NYSE:GM), Hitachi (HICHY), Kapsys, LG (OTC:LGEAF), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Samsung (OTC:SSNHY), Volvo (OTCPK:VOLVY), and Yanfeng Visteon. Nina has both web and mobile-based solutions for its clients that provide a voice-enabled intelligent virtual assistant. Nina is finding good traction in the market and Nuance expects it to yield good returns in the future.Nuance has also launched an upgraded version of Dragon Dictate for the Mac, equipping it with improved and accurate voice recognition, along with audio file transcription capability that has attracted consumers around the world. With this new innovation, Nuance anticipates higher growth and market share improvements going forward.Nuance is also focusing on imaging solutions to drive its growth. It is finding good traction in this segment, providing imaging-based solutions to clients such as ABN AMRO Bank, Canon (NYSE:CAJ), Falabella, IKEA, Prince George, Ricoh (OTCPK:RICOY), Stinson, and Tetrapak. As the world is moving toward virtualization and digitization, Nuance is focusing aggressively on its imaging solutions, expecting this segment to deliver positive results in the long run.Nuance provides various imaging solutions such as Critical Test Results Management, Radiology Decision Support, Paper Port PSP, streamlining clinical documentations, etc.Turning to the negativesNuance faces some real trouble from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), its customer for Siri, the voice assistant in Apple's devices. It was reported last year that Apple was focusing on creating its own speech technology in an effort to move away from Nuance. In fact, Apple had gone to the extent of recruiting a couple of speech scientists from Nuance itself as it looked to develop its own technology.It should also be kept in mind that Nuance's revenue growth has already slowed down a lot and any such development would lead to a big loss for the company. In the previous quarter, Nuance reported just 1.7% growth in revenue, while its earnings are expected to decline this fiscal year.Moreover, as Seeking Alpha writer Andrew Lim pointed out in his Pro article, Nuance's management team takes home a whopping 90% of its operating income. For a company that's looking to grow its business by investing in the technology of tomorrow, this is not a good idea. Nuance should be investing in its growth rather than executives taking away a major share of the profit from a company that's currently incurring a loss.Couple that with a relatively big debt burden of $2.36 billion, as compared to a cash position of $775 million, and Nuance might not have much room to flex its arms as it looks to grow its business.ConclusionThere's no doubt that Nuance is coming out with really impressive products, as we saw in the first half of the post, but the danger of losing the Apple account and management missteps could be a big threat for the company. In addition, revenue growth has slowed down to a trickle and this throws Nuance's growth story in jeopardy. So, investors should be cautious while investing in Nuance, as this investment could go sour.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1955201,22148,2014-01-20T11:33:41-05:00,,"Historical analysis from Schaeffer's suggests that the annual adjustments in the NASDAQ-100 index typically provide buying opportunities for the stocks that are removed. As an example, the stocks kicked out last year averaged 57% returns for the year compared to only 34% for those added to the index last December. See the table below. The index makes a yearly adjustment at the end of December to rerank the top 100 non-financial stocks that are listed on the NASDAQ exchange.Table - NASDAQ-100 ReturnsThis year's removal included five stocks with three of them falling out due to other stocks surging. Those stocks include Fossil Group (NASDAQ:FOSL), Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP), and DENTSPLY (NASDAQ:XRAY). These stocks actually had a solid 2013 placing them in the unique situation of not being beaten down stocks.Conversely, the stocks of Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) and Sears Holdings (SHLD) provide intriguing removal stocks after a weak couple of years. Both stocks underperformed the market gains with Nuance down a smashing 30%. Another intriguing aspect to these two stocks is that famed investors are bullish on these stocks while the index is dumping them. Typically, investors don't get the opportunity to load up on stocks below these investors buy in points.Beaten and bruised SiriNuance Communications offers investors the unique combination of a beaten stock down where investors can buy the stock below legendary activist Carl Icahn. Mr. Icahn has been consistently buying the stock during the recent downtrend and now owns around 19% of the outstanding stock. Worth noting is that Icahn made a famed investment in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) that was removed last year. The stock has soared from under $100 when pulled from the index to over $375 a month ago.Nuance is a developer of software for voice commands and natural language products that continues to struggle due to the switch from perpetual licenses to subscription services. Revenue growth has plunged to single digits with organic growth near the flatline while earnings continue to drop with upfront expenses adding up to develop the subscription services. Analysts forecast revenue to only grow 6% next year with fiscal year 2015 earnings below those of the recently ended fiscal year 2013.The combination of a stock price that has dropped around 50% from early 2012 highs and a legendary investor buying up the stock sets the tone for the typical stock that the removal from the NASDAQ-100 provides the opportune investment.Weak retailerSears Holdings offers an intriguing investment where famed mutual fund investor Bruce Berkowitz owns a large stake in the stock. Not to mention that CEO Eddie Lampert had legendary returns prior to starting Sears Holdings. Berkowitz via Fairholme Capital Management owns a roughly 19.5% position in the stock. Combined with the roughly 50% controlled by Eddie Lampert via personal shares and his ESL Partnership, the two control nearly 70% of the outstanding shares.While investors typically focus on the retail operations of Sears Holdings, the company is much more focused on monetizing vast assets including real estate and the announced spin-off of Lands' End. In fact, the recent deal to lease the second floor of its store at the King of Prussia Mall to Dicks Sporting Goods is another sign of the shift towards a REIT. In the process, the Sears portion of the store will be redeveloped into a smaller, focused operation.The company still operates vast retail operations that will generate revenue exceeding $36 billion for the year. The biggest concern is the negative earnings that could pressure cash flow, but the company has numerous assets that it can unload including the real estate, a 50% position in Sears Canada, Lands' End, Automotive Centers, and various other assets.Whiles Sears hasn't had a vastly negative stock in the last couple of years like Nuance, it has still underperformed the indexes by a wide margin.Bottom lineThe studies show that stocks removed from the NASDAQ-100 after weak periods typically show strong returns over the next year. Of the five stocks removed on December 23, Nuance and Sears Holdings share the traits of the stocks that rebound the most. Even more interesting is that the removal of these two stocks is fighting the moves of legendary investors.Disclosure: I am long SHLD. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2066263,62613,2014-03-05T11:43:36-05:00,,"Nuance just can't seem to find their voice at the moment.In January, Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) was busy promoting promising new applications for its voice recognition software at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show. Boasting its innovative interface on Omate's TrueSmart wearable device along with its novel language technology compatible with Smart TVs and automobiles, Nuance piqued the interest of many consumers and investors alike. Fast forward to February, Nuance 2014 Q1 earnings report displayed results that were middling as quarterly revenues were $490 million versus analyst estimates of $485.15 million and EPS of $0.24 versus street estimate of $0.21. The Q2 guidance however, disappointed investors who were anticipating more. As a result of several earnings letdowns, Nuance stock has dropped dramatically in the past six months from $20 to the $15 range. Nuance, a company with a next generation technology, Fortune 500 partners and Carl Icahn in its corner has the characteristics of a winner, yet continues to struggle to add value to shareholders.Investors are bullish on Nuance due to Fortune 500 partners, revolutionary voice biometrics technology and a solid product line including its own personal assistant software. However, Nuance is disguised as a value trap until the company can start executing on its limitless potential. At the moment, Nuance is a company that has underachieved due to a growth plateau. Nuance's growth rate was increasing at an impressive rate until calendar year 2013. Since then, YOY growth rates for revenues have decreased to 1.67% for Q1 2014. To compare, YOY growth rates were 28.2% in Q1 2013 and 18.7% in Q1 2012. The reason for these jaded results can be placed on the lack of a strong management team and Nuance's shift in revenue recognition model.Management (Or lack thereof)Nuance's management team, led by CEO Paul Ricci, is hindering growth by taking home large compensation packages which have, in turn, eroded shareholder value. During fiscal year 2013, Nuance management took home approximately $43.1 million in compensation - two thirds was granted to CEO Paul Ricci.Executive compensation that is nearly 90% of operating income is unacceptable no matter how you cut it. Taking into consideration how operating income has declined YOY and that the company is now running a net loss only adds salt to investors' wounds. I won't even mention the pitiful performance of Nuance. Yet somehow management still manages to get away with bloated bonuses. This treatment is intolerable by any metric. Nuance, a ~5B company, is paying executives approximately as much as S&P 500 companies that are worth 10x that amount.Nuance currently has $2.36 billion of debt on their balance sheet, meaning a lot of restrictive covenants weaken Nuance's ability to compete and transition itself in a fast changing environment. This accumulated debt has been used on the acquisition spree that Nuance has partaken in the last couple of years to maintain leadership status in voice recognition technologies. Though debt for market share dominance could be seen as a fair trade-off, there comes a time when integration must transpire. This is where Nuance has struggled as seen by its sluggish growth and bloated debt.During their most recent conference call, Nuance announced further acquisitions are in progress which could contribute to the company's top line in the second half of the year. In other words, management continues to increase shares issuable and debt for ""growth"" through acquisition. This strategy could be rationalized if Nuance had best in class integration; however, as investors have seen in prior years, that is not the case. So why continue a failing strategy?Transitioning PeriodNuance has seen sluggish growth metrics, as management puts it, due to its revenue recognition policy which is shifting to a subscription based model. Prior to this shift in policy, Nuance utilized a license based revenue system that required a lump sum payment at the purchase of a product or service. Now, with a subscription based revenue model, Nuance will be paid in smaller increments. Theoretically, this reduces revenues in the short-term but creates a sustainable and perpetual inflow of income.One company that has seemingly succeeded with a similar approach is Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). Back in April 2012, Adobe announced its Creative Cloud service, a change in business model by offering products on a subscription basis instead of the more traditional ""paying once and installing it"". This new model would allow applications such as PhotoShop, which were very expensive to begin with, to be more affordable for consumers who will now be charged monthly. In turn, this is anticipated to increase demand for Adobe products and also expand its customer base.Can Nuance Execute a Similar Strategy?CEO Ricci stated that in Q1 2014, strong sales in healthcare and automotive segments helped achieve a 26% growth in bookings over Q1 2013. Currently, bookings are an estimated 3-year value of contracts for Nuance language and voice technologies that depict business operations from another angle beyond the standard revenue. As Nuance's business model changes into a subscription basis, growth should increase exponentially due to greater booking figures, which will in turn result into long-lasting revenue. Or at least this is what the company expects.Offering products and services at a cheaper upfront price should drive consumer demand and a source of perpetual revenue stream for Nuance. Nuance reassured that they will be able to meet their target of 15% bookings growth for the year. This is encouraging for investors as the company expects to return to the same strong growth and profitability enjoyed in prior years. Management has talked a big game thus far, but has yet to provide any real support. During the latter half of 2014 and fiscal 2015, earning releases will determine whether management has executed this strategic shift successfully. Until some progress is shown, I stand by my value trap notion.Icahn Offering Investors a Glimpse of HopeCarl Icahn may be fended off a larger interest in Nuance by a poison pill provision, but he is known, when given the chance, to wield the axe on management teams for the better of the company.Forest Labs (NYSE:FRX) is the primary example of what Carl Icahn can do for a company lacking a competent management team. A little over 4 years ago, Icahn saw potential when he purchased around 11% of Forest Labs; the company was profitable and had a strong outlook, but did not have a suitable management team or strategy. Icahn fought hard through two proxy votes and finally settled for enough seats on the board to sack management and bring in his own. Since Icahn's involvement with Forest Labs, the company has seen its market value raise $17 billion. The changes Icahn influenced for Forest Labs proved to be huge as Forest Labs is being bought out for $25 billion by Actavis, an investment that pocketed Icahn $600 million.Icahn is calmly watching how Nuance progresses but history has shown that he could get relentless for the good of future and current investors. This process will take time, as seen with Icahn's Forest acquisition over four years ago; however I highly doubt he continues to sit around much longer as Ricci and his team suck away value. Nuance is in dire need of shareholder activism and Icahn is the best in the business. Though I am hopeful that Icahn will take action, but until he does so, Nuance has no catalysts that could drive value. This brings me back to my original thesis; until I see some execution, Nuance is a value trap.Numbers Scream ValueNuance stock price is currently hovering around $15 per share, a range it has been stuck on for the last quarter. As seen below, valuation metrics indicate that Nuance is a cheap stock when side by side with other relative companies. Dare I even classify it as a value play? This is where I believe the trap is planted.A forward P/E of 12.4x is quite discounted for a company that is leading an industry expected to triple in the next 5 years. As are the other metrics shown below. When comparing Nuance's metrics to companies that have similar subscription based business models and software leading technologies, Nuance stands out. Yet, unlike Adobe and Autodesk, Nuance is not trading near 52-week highs. Actually, it's quite the opposite as Nuance is trading near its 52-week low. This value trap is disguised by the alluring aura of voice recognition technology and its disruptive potential.ConclusionThough Nuance possesses all the right characteristics of a breakthrough investment, its performance says otherwise. Don't get me wrong, I am a big believer in voice recognition and the technology's disruptive potential. However, currently, Nuance is not being directed by the right people to realize this potential to its fullest. Until significant changes are made to Nuance management and until the subscription based model shows traction, I will stand by the belief that Nuance is a value trap.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2030081,53422,2014-02-19T03:35:12-05:00,,"Nuance Communications' (NASDAQ:NUAN) shareholders have been in for a rough ride in 2013. Multiple setbacks including profit misses and analyst downgrades have driven shares of Nuance Communications down to the $15 range. At the end of April 2013 Nuance Communications was trading at $23.38. Its stock oscillated from $13.00-23.38 over the last 52-weeks and mostly consolidated in an increasing stock market. On November 25, 2013 Nuance Communications issued a profit warning with respect to full-year earnings as the switch to a subscription-based business model is impacting short-term revenues and earnings. Shares of Nuance Communications quoted at $15.99 on November 25, 2013 but dropped sharply lower to $13.00 the next day: A decline in market capitalization of approximately 19% in just a matter two days.As a contrarian investor Nuance Communications was another textbook example of emotional investors throwing away their shares and panicking about near-term revenue contraction. Truth be told, I missed the collapse of Nuance Communications at the end of November 2013. Not surprisingly, shares quickly recovered most of their losses as investors successively got over their panic hiccough. I have previously recommended Nuance Communications (here) because the company is a leader in speech recognition and imaging applications and could be bought at the same price it was trading at in 2008 or 2009.Since my last article about Nuance Communications was published on December 24, 2013, the stock price hardly moved. While the share price shortly rose above the $16 mark, Nuance Communications can still be bought at what I consider to be a bargain price of $15.(Source: Yahoo Finance)First quarter resultsOn February 10, 2014 Nuance Communications released first quarter results which I were not totally disappointing:Nuance Communications' Chief Financial Officer Tom Beaudoin commented first quarter results:MisconceptionsNuance Communications is a provider of voice and language solutions for enterprises and consumers and has pursued a series of acquisitions to complement its service offering in Healthcare (for instance, the acquisition of Transcend), Mobile & Consumer, Enterprise and Imaging. Top-tier companies such as Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Volvo (OTCPK:VOLVY), DHL, IKEA, Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) and others are Nuance's customers and indicate that Nuance's product technology has a high degree of maturity. I currently see two reasons why Nuance Communications trades at just $15 per share and has suspended its recovery rally.First, Nuance's acquisition strategy has led to negative free cash flows over the years that still make it difficult to forecast a normalized level of capital expenditures. As such, there is still considerable uncertainty with respect to Nuance's recurring cash flow profile and underlying profitability. However, Nuance Communications is a consolidating force in the industry with a desire to penetrate niche markets, and cash flows should markedly increase in the coming years as a result of those transactions.Secondly, after the company's share price plunged on two occasions in 2013 (see chart above) because of earnings misses, negative expectations are now largely priced into the stock. Ultimately, this benefits Nuance Communications as it will be easier to outperform pessimistic earnings estimates. A potential revenue- and EPS outperformance could could be a powerful catalyst for Nuance's stock.ConclusionNuance Communications still trades relatively cheaply at just twelve times forward earnings which seems low compared to the high valuations usually seen for industry-leading tech companies. I think the company would be well advised to digest its past acquisitions for the moment and concentrate on developing a recurring earnings stream to show investors that the company now indeed can grow organically. Low earnings expectations ultimately will work in favor of Nuance and I would expect that it is now easier for the company to outperform pessimistic analyst expectations. After all, Nuance Communications provides the speech recognition engine for Siri, a digital personal assistant used in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone and iPad products which speaks volumes about Nuance's technology leadership in its software field. Carl Icahn, renowned activist hedge fund investor, reportedly increased its stake in Nuance Communications which only adds to the appeal of a long position in the innovative software maker.Moreover, Nuance Communications' negative free cash flows and low share price could make the company itself a takeover target. Its leadership position in speech recognition and imaging implications also makes the company highly attractive for strategic buyers aiming to get their hands on industry-leading technology. As potential buyers I could imagine Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), tech-crazy Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or IBM (NYSE:IBM). Even without a takeover, Nuance Communications has a high standalone value: It has a strong market position in its field and a lot of rebound potential given the over-the-top consolidation in 2013. I hold a price target of $20 on shares of Nuance Communications reflecting about 35% upside potential even without a takeover bid. Contrarian, speculative BUY.Disclosure: I am long AAPL.

1903361,35121,2013-12-17T14:21:36-05:00,,"In a recent article, I discussed how unwarranted executive compensation at Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) was holding the company back from reaching its full potential while also destroying shareholder value. Another topic under scrutiny has been Nuance's declining financials due to the transition from a licensing revenue model to a subscription based model, including software as a service ((SaaS)). The short term implications of this move have lowered the company's operating results and forward guidance which in turn have altered shareholder perception. However, in the grand scheme of things, a subscription based model will benefit Nuance. I believe this is widely misunderstood and will ultimately help Nuance double in price next year.SaaS gaining traction; replacing licensing revenue modelThe software industry is in the midst of a transitioning period as vendors are trending towards subscription based business models. PwC released a comprehensive report describing this trend and its budding outcomes. As Nuance investors are seeing, it will be tough for the financial community to let go of the old perpetual-licensing revenue model which booked sales as large up front deals. Instead, revenue will be replaced by small subscription fees that will bring more stable revenue streams in the longer run from a broader user base.As the above chart from PwC's report shows, subscription revenue has already gained traction amongst some of the largest global software companies. With Creative Cloud, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) was the latest large software player to adapt changing nature of overall market and switch completely to a subscription model. As a result of the transition, Adobe saw a decline in both revenue and earnings for fiscal year 2013 when compared to results a year ago. YOY revenue and earnings fell 8% and 65%, respectively. Adobe also trimmed its sales and profit forecasts for the upcoming quarter which underscores the extent of income that will be lost in the transition. Yet, even after these rather disappointing results, Adobe shares are up more than 50% in the last year. Investors and analysts are giving Adobe management credit for progress in the number of new cloud subscribers despite the light financials to this point.Investors not extending Nuance any leniency; pessimism could be overdoneAs shown by Nuance's steady decline in stock price, it is evident that Wall Street is not taking the same lenient approach during their transition period to subscription revenue. For fiscal year 2013, Nuance revenues were up 12% YOY while profits declined by more than $300 million into a net loss. Management slashed 2014 guidance while blaming lower profitability on the move to offer subscription based sales.The comparable table above shows the lower valuation multiples assigned to Nuance in comparison to other software companies utilizing the subscription revenue method. Adobe and Nuance are in similar positions regarding their changeover in recording sales, yet for Adobe, valuation multiples have been adjusted by analysts who are confident that the adoption of new model will be successful. The market has not embraced Nuance the same way. As I will explain below, the discounted valuation of Nuance has been caused by management's ineffectiveness rather than the company's future prospects.Most analysts covering Nuance have taken a conservative wait and see approach. I believe this is because of the uncertainty surrounding Nuance now that Icahn is expected to weigh in on management oversight. Anticipated shareholder activism should result in realizing value through cost cutting and better financial performance. This will certainly influence analyst outlook, who will be prompted to attribute higher growth multiples to Nuance even during their transitioning phase. Adjusting Nuance multiples to Adobe's range is a sensible notion since both companies are undergoing the same transition and as a result have had similar changes in financial performance. In spite of this similarity in results, Nuance has tanked while Adobe has soared. Valuing the leader in voice recognition software at comparable multiples to Adobe would lead to a price at least double current value.Push For Smarter TechnologyIn the last decade, there has been a push for ""smarter"" technology. Nuance is a frontrunner in this movement by developing how we interact with computers. The natural language processing (NLP) market is expected to grow from $3.8billion in 2013 to $9.9 billion in 2018. This represents a CAGR of 21.1% from 2013 to 2018. The approaching growth opportunity will ultimately benefit Nuance and other subscription revenue businesses in NLP market as a broader user base will result to more stable revenue streams.Demand is becoming more prominent in healthcare as the US government is pushing for adoption of electronic medical records while also undertaking the ICD-10 coding standard in October 2014. Under legislation passed last year, the Department of Health and Human Services set aside $27 billion to help healthcare providers convert patients' health records into electronic documents. Currently, only 20% of doctors and 10% of hospitals use electronic medical records, showing the considerable growth to be realized. The effects of this regulatory push can be seen in Nuance's healthcare segment, which was the fastest growing in fiscal 2013 providing nearly 50% of company sales. The implementation of electronic medical records and ICD-10 will provide Nuance business opportunities in improving documentation process, while reducing the burden of the transition.Nuance commands leading market share in nearly every category in which it participates. With the NLP market almost tripling in the next five years, Nuance's market leading position enables them to gain most from this coming expansion. In addition, Nuance has assembled critical intellectual property, organically and through acquisitions, that will fight off looming competition. This will ensure the company remains the industry leader throughout the upcoming growth period.In line with peers, Nuance is worth at least 2x current priceIf Nuance was trading in line with peers, even at a conservative P/S multiple of 5x, the company would be valued at around $29/share. The in-between transition period will not be appealing for short term results. However, subscription based revenue will prove to be beneficial for Nuance as they solidify a growing user base that will, in time, produce steady revenues. Icahn's presence suggests changes that focus on maximizing bottom line outcomes are imminent. Collectively, Nuance's position as a leader in a growing industry and activist involvement merit higher valuation premiums than what the company is currently being allotted. The market's misunderstanding of Nuance stock offers investors an opportunity to buy the company at discounted prices. It is only a matter of time before Nuance follows the success of other software companies that have implemented subscription revenue.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in NUAN over the next 72 hours.

2007121,23625,2014-02-10T03:52:34-05:00,,"Nuance Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:NUAN) is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings after the market closes on Monday, February 10th. Nuance Communications is an American software and communications technologies company. Nuance stock got a boost in January when the company preannounced better than expected December sales. However, in the 4 trading days following the report, the stock's 8% gains were completely erased. This quarter Wall Street is expecting Nuance to report slightly less revenue than FQ1 last year and 40% less profit.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors. (Click Here to see All Estimates for Nuance Communications)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Nuance to report 21c EPS and $486.46M revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 22c EPS and $486.11M revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting Nuance to beat the Street's expectations on profit but come up slightly short on revenue.By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly, it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing a smaller differential compared to previous quarters.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 21c to 23c EPS and $482.00M to $489.00M in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a smaller distribution of estimates compared to other quarters.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A narrower distribution of estimates signaling more agreement in the market, which could mean less volatility post earnings.Throughout the quarter, the EPS estimate from Wall Street decreased from 32c to 21c while the Estimize consensus remained flat at 22c. Over the same time period, Wall Street reduced its revenue expectation from $490.45M to $486.86M while the Estimize forecast increased at the end of the period from $484.40M to $486.11M. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and rising analyst expectations at the end of a quarter are often a bullish indicator. The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is BB9166 who projects 21c EPS and $482.00M in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season BB9166 rated as the 20th best analyst and is ranked 57th overall among over 3,800 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case, BB9166 is expecting NUAN to report in-line with Wall Street on profit but come up short on sales.This quarter the Estimize community expects Nuance to match Wall Street's consensus on revenue and beat the profit forecast by a small margin. However, both groups expect Nuance's year over profit to be down by a considerable amount and the company will need to continue to cut costs to restore EPS to previous levels.Disclosure: No positions."
1914341,53422,2013-12-24T04:41:15-05:00,,"Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) presented decent y-o-y revenue growth in fiscal year 2013. FY 2013 non-GAAP revenue was reported at $1.96 billion compared to $1.74 billion in fiscal year 2012 (an increase of 12.6%). Non-GAAP net income came in at $428 million or $1.33 per share compared to $555.9 million or $1.73 per share in 2012.GAAP revenues increased 12.3% to $1.86 billion vs. $1.65 billion in 2012. 2013 produced a GAAP net loss of $115.2 million or $0.37 per share vs. GAAP net income of $207.1 million or $0.65 per share in 2012.Nuance Communications also repurchased 9.8 million common shares at an average price of $18.81. The total repurchase amount yielded $184.4 million.Historical performance vs. peersShares of Nuance Communications have lost about 31% in value over the last 52-weeks. Shares are now trading so low that risk-seeking investors might want to consider an investment after shares rebounded from a new 52-week low at $13 at the end of November.Compared to other software technology companies, Nuance Communications has done poorly for shareholders. MICROS Systems (NASDAQ:MCRS) gained 22%, Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) 30% and Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) 80%. Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) lost 9% and Nuance Communications 40%.Free cash flowsNuance Communications has engaged in an extensive acquisition strategy in the past that was largely financed with debt. The table below summarizes Nuance's cash flows over the last three years and includes my cash flow projections for 2014. The bottom line is that free cash flows to equity (after net borrowings) are estimated to remain negative in 2014 which unfortunately renders the free cash flow valuation model meaningless.Market valuationSince Nuance's free cash flows are negative, I compare Nuance Communications' P/E and P/S ratio to a group of application software makers that are in the same market capitalization category of around $3-5 billion.Nuance Communications presently trades at a forward earnings multiple of 12.64 which is a 34% discount from the peer group average P/E ratio of 19.15. Nuance is the cheapest company in the peer group and offers investors a current earnings yield of 7.9%. Fortinet fetches a massive premium bringing the P/E ratio up to almost 34.A similar picture emerges when peer group constituents are evaluated based on the price/sales ratio. Nuance Communications quotes at 2.57x sales and is the most attractive application software maker of the benchmark group. Again, Fortinet carries the highest valuation ratio at 5.25 times sales.Nuance Communications trades at a 34% discount to the average peer group P/E ratio of 19.15. In addition, Nuance trades at a discount of 28% to the average peer group P/E ratio of 3.57. On a comparative basis, Nuance Communications seems to be a good deal for investors.ConclusionNuance's extensive acquisition record overshadows its financial results. Despite substantial operating cash flows, the company achieves negative free cash flows because of a constant stream of acquisitions. However, operating cash flows have been positive and purchased growth should eventually contribute to Nuance's cash flow generation ability. Investors can now purchase this leader of speech recognition and imaging applications at just above 12 times forward earnings. Also, investors can buy Nuance Communications at the same price it quoted at in 2008. Long-term Buy for investors who seek exposure to a cheap, strongly growing software company that is trading close to its 52-week low.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1877951,24821,2013-12-04T15:59:19-05:00,,"For those that read my article on November 14 recommending to purchase Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) at what was then $113 per share have enjoyed gains of approximately 7% in just over two weeks as it sits now at approximately $121 per share (far outpacing the S&P 500 approximately 2% over the same time frame). Not a bad return, but again, I recommended in that article, as I am doing myself, to hold that stock for the long-term and to judge investment returns over the long run. It is always worth being reminded that stocks in the short run are a voting machine, but in the long run a weighing machine (credit for that great wisdom goes to Benjamin Graham and echoed frequently by famed investor Warren Buffett). Moving along, one of the most active stocks this past week on a down note was Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN). The company was hit hard as it came in with disappointing guidance and investors expressed their disgust by sending shares lower approximately 15% on massive volume of 64 million shares: 16 times its daily average. This stock is of great interest to me though as the largest shareholder by far is sure enough Carl Icahn at approximately 17% and not far from the company's poison pill provision of 20%.Carl has been simply stellar throughout his investment career (as noted in this article) and done particularly well the past 12-18 months with investments such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Herbalife (NYSE:HLF), Hain Celestial (NASDAQ:HAIN), and Forest Laboratories (NYSE:FRX). However, one glaring weakness has been Nuance, which is now down 30% the past six months and 40% year to date. To give a quick background on the company, Nuance is a premier voice-recognition and languages solutions software company. Perhaps the company's most well-known product is ""Siri"" which is the voice recognition software present on every Apple iPhone. Financially, the company is starting to look cheap at just a forward P/E of 11x (this is including the company's revised downward guidance) while churning approximately $400 million annually in free-cash-flow. This translates into roughly a 10x price/market capitalization ratio and 16x price/enterprise value, which is definitely reasonable. The company is also well capitalized with approximately $875 million in cash and virtually zero short-term debt allowing the company to have some great options, including repurchasing more shares at these depressed prices.What really entices me most about the company though is that Icahn Enterprises just recently in October gained two board seats and the company has routinely showed through Forest Laboratories, Herbalife, and other companies throughout the years that ALL shareholders gain when Icahn gets a board seat(s). Consequently, Icahn and company will now be able to push forward with some great potential shareholder enhancing activities, while investors are also able to fall-back on owning a world-class software company.Disclosure: I am long NUAN, IEP.

1905661,58811,2013-12-18T13:39:13-05:00,,"Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) is my favorite stock for 2014. Here I'll explore why I believe the bad news is behind the stock and why the future is as bright as ever.Activist Onboard and On BoardLet's start with the obvious - Carl Icahn now owns 20% of the company. While this in itself is not sufficient reason to buy a stock, it's a good starting point. Further, an investor buying at current prices would be buying the stock at a 20% discount to Icahn's average price.Interestingly some of the bad news now priced into the stock involves Icahn, that being that he does not seem to be pushing Apple or anyone else to buy the company for a quick flip. The most-of-the-year trading range between $18-$20 I believe reflected this speculation, and once it was tweeted by Icahn that he was in it for the long haul, the stock quickly dropped.In the same tweet Icahn revealed that he had placed two people on the Nuance board, one being his son whom he credits with his Netflix success. This helps to remedy another piece of bad news priced into the stock….Executive CompensationIn a previous article on Seeking Alpha, For Investors To Stay, Nuance Must Cut CEO Pay, the author pointed out that in 2012 nearly half of Nuance's operating income was eaten up by executive compensation. Paul Ricci took home 37 million making him the 16th highest paid CEO that year. This all while the stock made its way from a high of nearly $30 two years ago to today's $14 level. The upside to this story is that shareholders will back Icahn in any effort to reign in this kind of comp which plays into my thesis of the bad news being priced in and bright days ahead.Growth by AcquisitionOn this point I will give Ricci some props. While many slam Ricci for a growth by acquisition strategy, I'll commend him for market dominance by acquisition. Nuance now sits in the enviable position of being on the forefront of a secular growth industry, and being the lead player from almost every angle. Nuance is poised for growth in healthcare, text to speech, speech to text, natural language understanding, clinical language understanding, voice biometrics, digital personal assistants, enterprise solutions, automotive, TVs, mobile devices, smart phones and more.The bad news priced in here is the perception that Nuance wastes money on acquisitions, both in terms of the acquisitions themselves and the integrations costs thereof. Here again Icahn plays a role in leading the shareholder demand that the time for acquisitions is over and the current market dominance needs to now be capitalized upon. This would allow shareholders to no longer fret over the acquisition party, and focus instead on the benefits of the now-completed past acquisitions.Revenue TransitionJust as a number of other software companies have or are experiencing, Nuance is transitioning from an upfront license revenue model, to a cloud based on-demand model, or SaaS. In the long run this is not a problem, but puts a dent in the numbers short term. This to me translates into a good company being temporarily on sale. This is not finally the point, however. The root problem here is that Nuance has not seen any organic revenue growth to speak of in the last number of quarters. This stalled growth has been reflected in many instances of downward guidance from one quarter to the next, which has ultimately sent the stock down in a big way on each occasion.So if that is the bad news priced in, what's the upside that will turn that around? In a small way, it's the increase in on-demand services beginning to offset more and more the reduction in license fees. Another aspect is Nuance beginning to report a ""bookings"" metric that shows the growth in bookings of the on-demand contracts rather than the sole focus on revenues.Far more important however is the wealth of opportunities Nuance has for entirely new revenue.Voice BiometricsIn May it was announced that Barclays Wealth & Investment Management had deployed Nuance voice biometrics. In October it was announced that Barclays won the ""Best Application of Technology"" Award at the 2013 European Call Centre Awards as a result of Nuance technology.The new process allows a bank or other entity to identify their customers through their voice alone. The process runs in the background allowing the customer service rep to get straight to the business at hand instead of spending time asking security questions. Barclays gave two rather stunning stats regarding the old system versus the new - one, that they saw a 90% reduction in complaints about their verification process - two, that the process was reduced from 2 minutes to 10 seconds.Considering that this makes customers happy and saves time, it's not a stretch to see many institutions implementing this quickly. Additionally, voice biometrics has the potential to replace every security speed bump out there from pin numbers to passwords to security phrases and security questions. Any revenue generated in this domain would be new revenue, growing the top line for Nuance.Voice AdsIn April Nuance announced Voice Ads. The first US based campaign to use the technology was Jet Blue in a campaign where users are taught to speak ""pigeon."" The interesting thing here is that voice ads can transition advertising from a one way conversation into a two way conversation, which is how sales works best. Think about any good salesperson, they begin with a question and engage. Additionally, it allows companies to collect data from customers, and potential customers, in many ways. While you or I may not immediately see all the possibilities, advertising pros are nothing if not creative.Quoting Opera Mediaworks CEO Mahi de Silva, voice ads are a ""natural step to how you can use the technology of smartphones and tablets. We're excited about voice, and we have a large number of campaigns that will be using this technology in Q4 this year.""Again, any revenue generated in the arena of voice ads is completely new revenue.ConclusionThe market can be very shortsighted, and as a result can deeply discount very promising companies. I believe Nuance is being discounted for all the wrong reasons and the market will take notice in 2014. A combination of Icahn activism, new revenue streams, large growth potential from existing revenue streams, a new market outlook in terms of bookings growth rather than up front bulk payments, all look to be converging in the coming year.Disclosure: I am long NUAN.

In bull markets, this divide tends to be overlooked as the majority of stakeholders are profiting from the rise in stock prices. However this starts to raise eyebrows when management fails to deliver, yet pockets the same bloated amount.The financial crisis brought compensation to the agenda of governance experts who proposed rules to implement certain reporting standards. Under SEC rules, companies are required to provide extensive information about the compensation of their CEO and other named executive officers. Companies are not, however, required to disclose the same compensation information for other employees. This is currently being reviewed by the SEC and could be a subject of change that would require public companies to disclose the ratio of the compensation of its chief executive officer (CEO) to the median compensation of its employees.Earlier this year, Bloomberg released the ""Top CEO Pay Ratios"" list to show the divide between the salary of the average employee and CEO of each respective company. Atop the list were JC Penney (JCP) and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) two of the most profitable shorts of 2013.(Click to enlarge)Nuance: the Good, the Bad & the UglyNuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) has the features of a stock that would normally rouse investors. They are the market leader in a voice recognition technology that oozes with potential and also have the backing of one of the most successful investors of our time. Yet, as the overall market has surged to new highs, Nuance has faltered to yearly lows. The company's recent performance has had a drag on share price, raising investor doubts about the future of Nuance in a fast moving technology sector.Since the above Bloomberg list measured the ratios of top 250 S&P 500 index companies, by definition, Nuance did not qualify. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see how CEO Paul Ricci would rank if Nuance were to be included in this shameful list. Ricci was the 16th highest paid CEO in 2012 taking home $37 million, an unjustifiable figure by any measure. At its peak in early 2012, Nuance was a sub $9 billion company, a market cap that has dropped to half that figure today ($4.5B). To put into perspective, Ricci was paid double that of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Otellini who leads a company 30x the size of Nuance.Nuance doesn't disclose the average worker pay, so the average figures obtained from GlassDoor were used as a reference when calculating the CEO pay ratio.As seen above, with the assumption of using GlassDoor average salary figure, Nuance would rank in the top 50 according to Bloomberg`s list. Keep in mind; the $93,655 salary figure used for the average Nuance worker is higher than any of the comparable figures that Bloomberg uses in their list. If we were to calculate the pay ratio with the average pay of workers that Bloomberg classifies in the ""Computer Systems Design and Related Services"" industry, Nuance would climb into the top 40. Ricci's compensation at approximately 400x the average worker is absurd no matter how you cut it.Numbers don't lieManagement's goal is to maximize shareholder value. In 2012, Nuance executive compensation totaled $55.3 million or 44% of total operating income. This absurd figure shows that management has in fact destroyed shareholder value by pocketing nearly half of what could have otherwise been allocated to creating value. If executives had any basis to justify this sort of compensation it would have been through a soaring stock price. However, those leading Nuance have been profiting at the expense of shareholders who have suffered as Nuance price fell to lows not seen since 2009.(Click to enlarge)As seen above, Ricci's compensation has risen 8 fold in the last five years from under $5million to the most recent $37 million. Even during the company's decline since 2012, the CEO has enjoyed colossal earnings at the expense of shareholders.2013 compensation figures are expected to be released within the month as the proxy statement is filed. Operating income for fiscal year 2013 fell to a disappointing $48.5 million along with stock based compensation for all employees which would indicate that the same trend should be expected with executive costs.For Nuance to be considered a legitimate turnaround candidate, compensation is an issue that must be dealt with in either significant pay cuts or forceful resignations. With share price slumping, there should be absolutely no reason for any sort of extended perks. In a November 8k filing, the Nuance Compensation Committee approved enhancements to the existing severance of key directors. At the very least, this move suggests that changes are coming, but not before shareholders are robbed one last time. With unjustified benefits at the center of attention, the 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders will be an event to keep an eye on for possible developments.Shareholder Activism NecessaryThe voice recognition market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 22%, offering Nuance an opportunity to continue being the frontrunner in the breakthrough technology. The company has already established itself as a leader in the mobile sector through licensing their voice recognition technology to giants Apple and Samsung. Though voice recognition is still considered to be in its infancy, Nuance has diversified its offerings to be applied in industries across the spectrum such as health care, automotive and education to name a few. Concentrating on the future growth of its industry, Nuance is transitioning from a perpetual-license model to a subscription revenue model. Short term results have been impacted due to weaker revenue that is instead being stretched out over time so the company can enjoy the benefits of recurring revenue streams. By and large the technology is not the reason behind Nuance's slump; rather executive self-indulgence has destroyed company value.Carl Icahn`s near 20% stake and two seats on the board presents investors with a glimpse of hope that much needed change is coming. Carl Icahn will have the essential tools to implement changes. On April 29th, the board approved a $500 million repurchasing program, of which about $315 million remain available for repurchase. The company sports a cash balance of over $800 million. Combine this with the fact that shares are trading at deflated levels and one can surely expect that Icahn will pressure for aggressive buybacks.Nuance's aggressive acquisition strategy in years past requires cost cutting as integration and acquisition costs have eaten away at profits. Since 2011, the company has splurged nearly $2 billion (see below) in acquisition that have added unnecessary costs weighing Nuance bottom line. An activist investor like Icahn is expected to push for leaner operations that aim to maximize bottom line growth. Therefore avoidable costs from acquisitions and a surplus headcount are in line for reductions. Below is the breakdown of acquisitions and the amount Nuance spend each fiscal year.Hopeful investors see the potential value in Nuance's voice recognition technology; however they need assistance realizing it. This is where an activist like Carl Icahn can add value. Nuance shortcomings can be reversed with a management that seeks the best for its shareholders. Though the company faces tough obstacles in 2014, Icahn's increasing stake improves the prospect of Nuance once again returning to its previous highs. In the meantime, shareholders should view this as an opportunity to pickup discounted shares while the turnaround is under construction.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1870301,38201,2013-12-02T02:02:19-05:00,,"Since the mobile and consumer segment is one of the highest revenue contributing segments of Nuance (NUAN), any rise or fall in the revenue from this segment directly impacts the company's overall performance. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the revenue from this segment was down over 24% year over year. This had an impact to the bottom line, as the percentage of the segment's profit contributing to its revenue declined from 51% to 29% in the fourth quarter this fiscal, year-over-year.Nuance-Varolii AcquisitionNuance recently acquired the interactive notification specialist Varolii for an undisclosed value. This company is known for providing cloud-based outbound engagement solutions. Through this acquisition, Nuance aims to benefit from Varolii's outbound communication portfolio. Varolii was known for its personalization and analytics of its outbound services, while Nuance didn't have such technology earlier. Through this acquisition, Nuance will offer this portfolio along with its existing inbound virtual assistant solutions for mobile as well as web applications. Also, both companies overlap 45% of their respective customer bases, making it an attractive opportunity for Nuance; as it will market its complete product portfolio mix to its existing customers, as well as to Varolii's customers.Based on SoundBite's (SDBT) acquisition by Genesys in May this year, which it acquired at twice the revenue of SoundBite; Varolii is also anticipated to be acquired for twice the revenue generation by Nuance. Since SoundBite and Varolii were market leaders in this segment, the Nuance-Varolii deal could be around the $90 million to $100 million level.In the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, Nuance's enterprise segment generated about $86.4 million in revenue, which is over 17% of the total revenue of the company. Given that Varolii's industry is bound to grow from $324 million in annual revenue of 2011, to $500 million by 2014, I expect it to be one of the major contributors to Nuance's growth through its enterprise segment. Meanwhile, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Apple (AAPL) are rumored to be forming their own voice assistance section. Even if these rumors are said to be true, I believe the enterprise segment will at-least support in maintaining the top-line of the company.Consumer segment future prospectsDue to high margin issues, many customers delayed their contract renewals, leaving on-demand and professional services to generate the majority of the revenue. This led to a decline in this segment's revenue of approximately 16% in the quarter ending June year over year. This was one of the major reasons Nuance experienced a dip in profits, leading to a net loss of around $35 million in the same quarter. Given that this segment contributes about 25% to the company's total revenue, it came with an event to bolster this product line and aid this segment.Nuance organized an event called Early Access Program, inviting all the app developers of Samsung products. This includes Samsung's Galaxy Android lineup and the Smart TV devices. Here, Nuance showcased its various speech models to developers, which they can use in their existing apps, or create new apps. They can use Nuance's voice technology for improved performance and quality voice experience. Nuance's portfolio included 40 different languages and 61 voices for text-to-speech. About 17,000 developers from around the globe attended this event.Given that one out of three smartphones sold globally is a Samsung product, this provides a huge growth opportunity for Nuance. Based on this strategy, I expect growth in the product and license revenue of Nuance in the coming quarters, along with better revenue results in comparison to the 2012 fiscal year.Smartphone War ContinuesOn the other hand, Nuance benefits from the sale of every smartphone or tablet of Samsung and Apple, as it generates revenue on a license per device basis. Apple and Samsung both have posted great results with their recently launched products. Apple recently launched fifth generation iPad Air, sales of this new iPad have exceeded expectations by 30% in its first weekend sales. The fourth generation iPad recorded sales of three million units in the first week of its launch. Though Apple has yet to disclose the weekend sales figures, based on upgraded features and the product's sales history, I expect it to surpass the older generation's record. Also, the iPhone 5s and iPhone 5c launched earlier last month posted sales of nine million units in the first three days of the launch, higher than the previous year's iPhone 5 launch sales figure of five million units in the same period.Apple benefits on the margin side, as it sells its products on high margins compared to its costs. For example, the new iPhone 5c launched last month, having almost the same configuration as the old iPhone 5, costs $30 less than the iPhone 5 in terms of manufacturing cost. The cost of a new iPad Air ranges between $274 and $361, while Apple sells it in the range of $499 to $929. This lets Apple generate gross margin of approximately 45% for the $499 version, and 61% for the $929 version. In the past five years, the financial statements of Apple have been impressive and should reflect a similar performance in the coming future.Its competitor Samsung isn't far behind when it comes to sales records. Samsung shipped over 81 million smartphones worldwide in the third quarter this year, while Apple managed to sell about 33.8 million smartphones in the same period. Its latest Galaxy Note flagship posted sales of five million units in the first month of its launch. Overall, Samsung expects to sell over 100 million products from its Galaxy lineup and Note series this year, which I feel is an achievable target based on its popularity around the globe.Buy for long-term benefitsNUAN data by YChartsThings haven't been on Nuance's side in the past two months, considering its stock price performance. The share price of Nuance took a dip of over 29%. This was after the announcement of two board members from Mr. Icahn's side, signing a standstill agreement, whereby Mr. Icahn cannot exceed share ownership by 20% in Nuance before its 2014 annual meeting, and the management cutting the 2014 fiscal year's revenue guidance. This led to a fall in Nuance's share price.Compared to the previous fiscal years' billion dollar investments, it seems Nuance is reducing its investments this fiscal year. This should bring down the transaction or acquisition related costs, indirectly aiding the bottom line. Overall, the fall in stock price just made the stock more attractive, if you are considering a long position in this company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Fusion Research is a team of equity analysts.

1876051,25120,2013-12-04T05:12:23-05:00,,"Investors in Nuance Communications (NUAN) have seen increasing losses recently, adding to an already very difficult 2013. Last week, the diversified conglomerate best known for its speech and translation technology released a disappointing set of fourth quarter results.The transition into a SaaS-based revenue recognition cycle for its cloud offering has a huge impact as well, as investors are not pleased with the guidance for growth in the next year. Yet after shares have seen a 50% correction over the past two years, there are some potential catalysts which could unleash further potential.After activist investor Carl Icahn initiated a stake in the company, there is potential for significant value creation going forward on the back of deal-related activity, a break-up of the company or a departure of key executives.Fourth Quarter ResultsNuance generated revenues of $472.2 million, up 0.7% on the year before. Analysts were looking for revenues of $489.6 million.The company reported net losses of $32.3 million, or $0.10 per share for the final quarter. This compares to earnings of $0.36 per share last year.Non-GAAP earnings came in at $95.2 million, resulting in earnings of $0.30 per share, down from $0.51 per share reported last year. Analysts were looking for non-GAAP earnings of $0.29 per share.Looking Into The ResultsAfter reporting solid revenue growth, even into 2013, this growth almost came to a standstill in the final quarter of the year as revenues inched up by just 0.7% on an annual basis.This slowdown is due to an 8.1% fall in product and licensing revenues which came in at $192.3 million. This was offset by a 5.9% increase in professional services and hosting revenues which came in at $208.4 million. Maintenance and support revenue growth was very solid, but the contribution to revenues was just $71.5 million.While revenue growth was disappointing, it is resulting in lower margins due to the mix. Gross margins of product and licensing are 87.4%, and it is this business being under pressure. The professional services and hosting business which showed revenue growth only displays gross margins of 29.6%.As a result, firm-wide gross margins fell to 57.9% of total revenues which is down, 5.5% on the year before. At the same time, operating expenses were on the rise, resulting in a double impact on operational earnings. As a result, income from operations fell from $46.6 million to just $3.7 million...And AheadFor the first quarter of the fiscal 2014, Nuance Communications sees revenues of $477 to $487 million. Non-GAAP earnings are seen between $0.18 and $0.21 per share.Analysts were looking for first quarter revenues of $486 million and earnings of $0.31 per share.Full-year revenues are seen between $2.03 and $2.09 billion, as earnings are seen between $1.05 and $1.15 per share. While analysts were looking for similar revenues at $2.07 billion, they were modeling for non-GAAP earnings of $1.41 per share into the coming year.ValuationNuance ended the year with $846.8 million in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. Total debt stands at $2.35 billion, for a net debt position of $1.5 billion.Nuance generated annual revenues of $1.86 billion for the year, up 12.3% on the year before. GAAP losses for the year came in at $115.2 million compared to earnings of $207.1 million in the year before.Trading around $13.50 per share, the market values Nuance at $4.2 billion. This values equity in the firm at 2.3 times annual revenues.Nuance Communications does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveLong-term holders in Nuance have seen decent returns, although investors have taken quite some losses in 2012 and 2013. Shares have steadily risen from lows of $3 in 2004 to a peak of nearly $30 per share at the start of 2012.Shares have fallen to lows of $20 at the end of 2012, and after witnessing losses of nearly 40% so far this year, shares trade at just $13.50 per share.Between 2009 and 2013, Nuance increased its annual revenues by a cumulative 95% to $1.86 billion. The problem has been to turn these revenues into real profits, as the firm reported large losses, partially due to one-time expense this year.Investment ThesisNuance is facing a difficult time as it tries to sell more software as a cloud computing product, rather than traditional software products being installed. As revenues are being recognized on a SaaS basis, rather than upfront, this transition has a huge impact on GAAP revenues during the transition period.Therefore, Nuance is providing booking numbers as well, as they are a better reflection of the company's real current performance. Nuance rationalizes the move towards the new billing model as customers demand this SaaS basis, while it creates recurring revenues and improves the predictability of the business.For 2014, bookings are seen between $2.15 and $2.25 billion, up 14.6% on the year before at the midpoint of the range. While bookings seem solid, analysts are not impressed with the focus on earnings. CEO Ricci remarked that the company tries to balance between near-term financial performance and long-term success.Of course, Nuance is best known for the software that runs Siri on Apple's (AAPL) iPhone. While short-term pressure is already resulting from the shift to a subscription-based business model, Nuance has been deferring deals with phone makers as it tries to hold on to higher pricing as well. This will result in no meaningful organic growth in the mobile phone segment the next year, which is a setback as roughly a third of revenues are being generated by mobile and consumer businesses.The big shift in the business model takes a toll on the margins, with operating earnings taking a big toll this quarter. Investors are not too pleased with the transition, given the very poor share price development over the past two years. These poor developments attracted interest from activist investor Carl Icahn, which has bought a big stake in the company, known for its voice and language technology.Given that Icahn took a stake into Apple as well earlier this year, and given the strong business relationship between Apple and Nuance, some sort of consolidation might be a big push for shares.Icahn holds a nearly 17% stake in Nuance, and his presence could be a driver behind a deal or tie-up. Nuance is supplying to Samsung's Galaxy line and Apple might be interested in Nuance given the technology offerings. The ""limited"" enterprise valuation at $6 billion in relation to Apple's cash balances and the relationship of Icahn could spur deal-related activity going forwards.Even if some sort of a deal might not materialize, Icahn could push for a break-up of the conglomerate. Nuance is active in healthcare, its promising mobile business, the enterprise business and imaging. These businesses arguably have little to do with each other, creating a poor rationale behind such a conglomerate. A possible deal would be obviously applauded by shareholders which are very dissatisfied with CEO Ricci's acquisition strategy.As such deal making activity, a break-up of any form, or a departure of Ricci, all spurred by Icahn could be a huge driver going forward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1652232,22829,2013-08-22T16:11:43-04:00,,"By Brenon DalyEven though Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) is a company that does a lot of buying, the serial shopper has made it clear that it doesn't want to be on the other side of a transaction. The speech recognition vendor, which has spent more than $1bn on a dozen deals over the past two years, announced earlier this week that it would be putting a 'shareholder rights plan' in place by the end of the month. The defensive measure (also known as a 'poison pill') effectively scotches any unwanted M&A approaches.In other words, exactly the type of unwanted approach the company is likely to get from its largest shareholder, who has a history of making unwanted M&A approaches to tech companies. Carl Icahn has steadily snapped up Nuance stock. His stake, according to the most recent SEC filing, is now a mountainous 51 million shares, or 16% of the company.With Icahn unlikely to play the role of spoiler in the planned Dell LBO, we suspect that he'll have more time to spend on his other activist investments very soon. Probably on the top of his hit list is Nuance, as the company has already put up subpar numbers in two quarters this year. Nuance stock is down about 15% in 2013.Unlike Icahn's earlier stirrings against BEA Systems or Lawson Software, however, there isn't an obvious single acquirer for Nuance. The reason stems largely from the fact that the Burlington, Massachusetts-based company has four separate business units. (Collectively, those divisions should produce about $1.7bn in annual sales when Nuance wraps its fiscal year at the end of next month.)Instead, we could imagine that Icahn might push for a breakup of Nuance, arguing that the value of the individual units - on their own - is higher than the current $7.4bn enterprise value of the company. After all, Icahn has experience in that sort of agitation too, having helped spur a breakup of tech giant Motorola at the beginning of 2011.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1729712,38201,2013-10-04T15:14:04-04:00,,"In the first week of September, Nuance (NUAN) announced that its voice and language technology will be featured in the recently launched Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) devices as the S-Voice. These devices are its smart watch, Galaxy Gear, and the latest version of the note series, Samsung Galaxy Note 3. The smart watch represents the first ever use of Nuance's voice and intelligent systems-based technology, which is installed on the wearable computing device.The sales of these products are expected to start from the first week of October through various network providers like AT&T (T), Sprint (S), and Verizon (VZ). Last year, with the launch of Galaxy Note 2, the company posted sales of over 5 million units worldwide within the initial two months post launch. With improved specifications and quality, we expect the company to show even better performance in terms of sales this year. Meanwhile, Galaxy Gear will attract only a certain set of customers. Though the smart watch industry is growing at a high rate, this year there would be a nominal business. Based on ABI research reports, this industry is expected to sell around 1.2 million smart watches globally this year, with future growth projected to be over twenty-fold in the coming two years.This will indirectly expand the landscape of devices for Nuance's cloud service business. We believe Nuance will still benefit as its voice technology is compensated based on usage, unlike the per device license revenue model. Although not many sales are expected, the improved functionality of the S-Voice will attract more mobile users to take advantage of the app.Not a piece of cake this time for SamsungIn comparison to last year, this year Samsung won't find it easy to maintain its market share in the smartphone industry. Sony (SNE) has launched two products, Sony Xperia Z1, and Sony SmartWatch 2, directly competing with the above Samsung devices. The Xperia Z, which is the predecessor of Xperia Z1, posted great results post launch. The smartphone recorded sales of 4.6 million units in just 40 days of its launch. Its features are a 5-inch Full HD screen, waterproofing, and a 20 megapixel camera. Sony launched SmartWatch 2 with tons of improvements compared to the previous one. It will have features like waterproofing, longer battery life than Galaxy Gear, and is priced cheaper. In support, Sony and other developers have already created over 200 apps for this device, making the product extremely competitive.The Apple threatEarlier, there was news of Apple (AAPL) secretly assigning a team to further develop its Siri voice technology, which is currently provided by Nuance. After investor Icahn's tweet on August 22, regarding his conversation with Apple's CEO Tim Cook, things have totally changed.In addition to the buyback plans, there is a huge possibility of talks, or 'magnitude' as described in the tweet, regarding Apple acquiring Nuance in the near future.This can happen based on Mr. Icahn's 16.4% stake in Nuance; he is also one of the major stakeholders in Apple. It is said that he might force Apple to acquire Nuance, since he finds the company presently undervalued. Mr. Icahn finds this deal lucrative for Apple, knowing that Apple is a strong believer in this technology, and it uses Nuance's technology in the much appreciated personal voice-assistant 'Siri'. Additionally, Apple was the first mobile manufacturing company to bring in such an advanced voice-assistant application that would actually help navigate, place reminders, and also search the web for any subject. Today, Siri has continued to advance with the latest version of iOS.The deal wouldn't be a huge burden for Apple given its cash pile of $150 billion, as of its third quarter of fiscal year 2013, and Nuance being valued at $7 billion.What brought us more confidence regarding this acquisition possibility was Nuance's reaction towards Mr. Ichan's strategy of increasing his stake further to 20%. In order to prevent any hostile takeover situation, Nuance adopted the 'poison pill' strategy. Through this strategy, the company offers its shareholders the right to purchase shares at discounted rates, indirectly stopping an individual, or a company, from gaining control over the targeted company.Voice is considered the future in technology, with its growing importance in almost all sectors. Given the brand name, and clientele of Nuance, Apple won't leave this opportunity if this comes to it, considering the growing popularity of Siri technology installed on its products. Also, it needs to compete with Samsung's S-Voice, which has progressed significantly, despite a late arrival in the industry compared to iPhone's Siri. In order to compete against Samsung's growing market share around the globe in the mobile industry, Apple will always have to continue to show innovation in this software, being its USP, and this will help in further growing its market share too.Perfect moment to buyThis stock is presently undervalued based on its price-to-book ratio at 2.26 times, which is lower than the industry standard of 25.1 times. Given the fundamentals, we expect the enterprise segment of Nuance to continue its growth at more improved rates in the coming quarters. Additionally, once the smart watches or wearable devices go mainstream, it will provide meaningful impact to the company over time, based on its forecasted growth. Since the news of a hostile takeover possibility, Nuance's stock price has remained stagnant from its previous downward trend on the year-to-date basis. This indirectly shows shareholders' support of the possible event, as the acquiring company is one of the most admired brands in the technology industry.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1627542,22786,2013-08-11T22:01:23-04:00,,"Looking at some raw data of Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN), the initial reaction is to take a pass on this company. These indicators include: weak quarterly earnings reported over the past two quarters, dropped non-GAAP earnings, declining operating margins, and lower cash flow from operations.Yet, a closer and careful analysis of Nuance Communications reveals a different story: revenue was still higher last quarter and the company has a healthy balance of cash in its book. Nuance is a company in transition. By sacrificing short-term profits, Nuance wants to be positioned to generate recurring revenue in the long term. This will be accomplished in two ways: raising cloud-based offerings and boosting development. There are many more reasons to look at Nuance as a company to grow. By early 2014 and beyond, investors will reap the benefits of buying shares in this company.There are 3 reasons to be bullish on Nuance.1) Share buybackNuance used its excess cash to buy back its common stock. In the third quarter (for the three months ended June 30, 2013), the company bought back $103 million worth of shares.2) Transition from license to on-demand revenueTransitioning away from licensing revenue will hurt near-term revenues. The long-term benefit will be increasing the recurrence and the longevity of recurring revenue. In the last quarter, mobile cloud transitions grew 80%, while connected devices grew by 100%. Hosting revenue is still just 32% of total sales, but this is up from 30% last year. Despite the impressive growth in mobile, investors should be cautioned that the rebound will not be substantial next quarter. It will not be until fiscal 2014 when growth will be meaningful to the earnings reported on quarterly results.3) Transition to Natural Language ProcessingOn its condensed consolidated statement of operations, Nuance reported a sharp increase in research and development costs. Costs rose from $56.1 million last year to $73.1 million, a 30% increase. This is owed to Nuance developing natural language processing (""NLP"") and reasoning based systems. Previously, the company offered only voice-recognition solutions for customers. Since NLP solutions are in high demand in the mobile market, this move will pay off in the future.RisksAs with any company transitioning away from core offerings, the risk for Nuance is no different. Nuance will face higher deferred revenue moving forward. In Q3, deferred revenue was $266.1 million on June 30, 2013, up from $206.6 million as at September 30, 2012.A steady increase in on-demand revenue is not assured. Last quarter, it dropped due to weakness in the healthcare segment and issues in some international markets.Costs in research and development could escalate uncontrollably as Nuance expands its product line. Nuance has an aggressive development plan, but investors should not expect the company to allow costs to run wild. The firm has a plan to increase staffing in R&D. This will allow the company to execute on its growth plans while maintaining costs.Alternative InvestmentsInvestors interested in mobile device suppliers could consider Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) or OmniVision (NASDAQ:OVTI).SYNA data by YChartsThese companies benefit from the enormous growth in smartphone products made by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), or Nokia (NYSE:NOK). These suppliers also have a price to sales ratio that is lower than that of Nuance:Data Source: Yahoo FinanceOmniVision makes image sensors for numerous industries, including the mobile market. The company is scheduled to report earnings on August 29, 2013 after the market closes. According to its fact sheet, 65% of revenues came from mobile phones in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. More recently, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Motorola selected OmniVision's OV10820 sensor for the Moto X. The sensor is 10.5MP and provides low-light image capture for the phone.Synaptics, which makes the touch interface for devices, is trading at close to yearly highs. Synaptics was previously covered in October, 2012. At the time, shares were trading below $25. In its most recent quarter, the company reported record profits: $106 million or $3.11 per share. This is a 35% increase from last year. Unlike Nuance, Synaptics was further ahead of its product development, and was able to reap the rewards much earlier. Synaptics forecast during its conference call for smartphones to be more than a $1 billion market.Nuance for long-term investorsLower profit margins will scare away many investors. It might keep Nuance shares stuck in a tight trading range. Shares could be stuck between $18 and $20 based on the trading pattern so far in 2013. Margin pressure should be expected as a consequence of gaining recurring revenue for on-demand. As the market for Nuance expands in fiscal 2014, the margin will improve.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1648982,53622,2013-08-21T10:39:43-04:00,,"Over the past several years, Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) has been a rumored acquisition target by several large tech companies, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Up until this past year, Nuance has seen pretty explosive growth in both revenues and profits, with revenue going from $868.5 million in 2008 to $1.65 billion in 2012 and net income going from a loss of 30.1 million in 2008 to a profit of 207.1 million in 2012. But fiscal year 2013 has been quite a disappointment for the company through the first 3 quarters. While revenues have still grown, profit margin has dramatically declined and the company has been busy cutting its own profit estimates since the investor meeting in December 2012. In the Q2 conference call, CEO Ricci said that healthcare transcription volumes were down more than expected and that there were some ""execution"" issues. On the Q3 call, after cutting Q4 EPS estimates to $0.24-$0.32 versus the analyst consensus estimate of $0.38, Ricci stated that the company was holding off on some deals to maintain pricing discipline and that the transition to ""recurring"" revenues would be a slow transition. While this dramatic decline in profits is frustrating to investors as the stock price languishes, I found myself wondering how so much money is being spent on R&D and Nuance's cloud infrastructure without a clear picture on how Nuance will see a return on its investment.At the 2012 Investor Meeting last December, Nuance laid out 3 key investments it was making, beyond its healthcare franchise: Biometrics, cloud infrastructure to support smart TV's and connected cars, and ""Wintermute"". The company has provided additional color and design wins for biometrics, smart TV's and connected cars, but not much has been said about Wintermute. Wintermute is a virtual assistant that would be able to span multiple devices and manufacturers. Being that Nuance technology powers Apple's ""Siri"" function, it seems odd that Nuance would spend heavily to create a competitor to a key customer product. My guess is that a specific social networking company with 1.15 billion MAU's approached Nuance about developing a customizable virtual assistant that could be integrated into each user's profile and used in almost every medium in today's connected world. But why would a social networking company, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), be interested in either purchasing Nuance or integrating Wintermute into user profiles?Wintermute would allow Facebook users to essentially create a personal assistant that would interact with them in almost every facet of their day. While making the daily commute to work, a user could use their voice biometrics to unlock their phone and sign into their Facebook account, send updates and have friends updates read to them through their Bluetooth while starting their car, order a breakfast or coffee from a local restaurant so that it was ready for pickup and simultaneous payment as they arrived, or be able to use their virtual assistant to update their work calendar and send emails through voice commands when caught in a traffic jam. Once at work, through a Facebook profile, a user could utilize one personalized intelligent assistant with Nuance's Natural Language Understanding (NLU) no matter whether Apple, Samsung, Google, Microsoft or any other product is used. After work, a user could utilize their personal assistant to make a dinner reservation while driving home. Once at home and ready to settle on the couch, a user could power up their smart TV and stay connected to all their friends while watching TV.So if Facebook really did purchase Nuance, how would Wintermute be monetized? In addition to making a Facebook profile become an integral part of a users day, Facebook would be able to monetize Wintermute by using Nuance voice ads. Instead of traditional radio ads that target the general audience or a particular radio station, Facebook would be able to integrate the Nuance cloud and Facebook user profile to specifically target voice ads to applicable users. This would mean that while listening to Pandora (NYSE:P), a voice ad could ask a driver whose profile notes that they are an avid Do It Yourselfer, that Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is currently offering a discount to the first 100 listeners who respond. The user would then be able to respond to the voice ad, and possibly have a conversation with the ad to have a product or demonstration ready for them when they arrive. This same concept for voice ads in the car could also be applied to Facebook users while watching a Smart TV.Recent announcements to back my theory of a possible Nuance acquisition or partnership include:Given the strong IP position that Nuance has and its variety of business units, it is very difficult to try and examine what a potential purchase price of Nuance would be. My guess is that Nuance would expect a minimum of 5 times sales, which would be approximately 9.25 billion or about $30 per share. Even if Nuance isn't purchased, its position as a neutral party (i.e.- Switzerland effect) with a leading position in Natural Language Understanding, will lead to handsome returns as the personal assistant technology wars heat up.Disclosure: I am long NUAN.

1633762,24279,2013-08-14T04:58:43-04:00,,"Before I discuss Nuance Communication's (NASDAQ:NUAN) Q3, I would be remiss not to mention that corporate raider Carl Icahn recently increased his stake in the company to 16%. According to Investopedia, the definition of a Corporate Raider is:I can't speak for Mr. Icahn's intentions as to why he is taking such a large position in Nuance. For all I know it may be a passive investment like his stake in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), but one thing I can tell you is that he probably sees opportunity here. News just broke that Icahn is taking a stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Nuance is the engine behind Apple's Siri technology. Perhaps there will be a shotgun wedding for the two companies somewhere down the line. In any event, I would think it would be positive for Nuance in maintaining a large and influential client like Apple.Nevertheless, Nuance is going through some growing pains from the transition from perpetual licenses to cloud-based delivery. According to the company's prepared statements (.pdf file) for Q3:Negative effect indeed. Nuance projects Q4 sales of $470 million to $500 million. That's below consensus of $520 million. Blended gross margins for fiscal 2013 will decline by between 450 and 500 basis points. As CFO Tom Beaudoin states in the Q&A session: ""I think you should model margin improvement as being modest next year.""If you examine the chart below carefully, you can see where all of the organic revenue growth came to a standstill in 2013.This is a direct correlation from two phenomena - the shift away from desktops to mobile, and the move to the cloud. The company isn't giving guidance for 2014 yet, but Yahoo Finance shows a consensus sales growth of low single digits, $1.96 billion for this year to $2.09 billion for 2014. It's putting a lot of pressure on shares.Earnings are another story. Nuance expects Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $.24-$.32. They predict Fiscal Year 2013 earnings to be in the range of $1.27-$1.35. They had previously forecast earnings of $1.33-$1.45. Some of this decrease could be from litigation expenses. CEO Paul Ricci explains:Another reason for the decline in revenue and earnings for Q4 is that some of their mobile customers are delaying contracts. Clients want lower prices, and Nuance is not giving discounts to their superior technology. Mr. Ricci believes in delaying deals for the sake of price discipline. Sales from their mobile segment constitutes roughly 30% of revenues. Revenue from that division dropped 14% in Q3.The company has an aggressive buyback plan. As of July 31, 2013, they have spent $174.6 million out of their authorized $500 repurchase plan, repurchasing 9.283 million shares. They expect to continue to execute their repurchase plan tactically. Their plans incorporate a full-year, weighted share count of 322.5 million diluted shares.In a bull market, the equity trades at $19.50, near the low point of their 52 week $18-$26 range. In my opinion, the stock would have traded lower after poor guidance for Q4, but the anticipation of Mr. Icahn's potential fiscal actions have buoyed the stock. Nuance is primarily a domestic company with 72% of their revenue coming from the United States. There's a big opportunity for overseas expansion. However, the company has a history of being unprofitable, although the last few years have been in the black.I'm long the stock because I use Nuance products, and believe they will remain the leader in voice-recognition technology for the foreseeable future. Although earnings are under pressure, the going rate of $19.50 seems reasonable of you utilize a price/sales metric of 3.38. Price/book is 2.2. Those are low figures for a technology company. Although I didn't buy the stock because of Icahn's stake, he's there nonetheless. I expect him to raise some dust at the next shareholder meeting. After all, he's an ""activist shareholder"".Disclosure: I am long NUAN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it.

1475701,21820,2013-06-03T00:17:26-04:00,,"Last week, Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) chief executive officer Paul Ricci confirmed what investors had thought for a long time. Nuance, the popular voice recognition company, confirmed its relationship with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). ""We're a fundamental provider for Apple,"" Ricci offered up when asked about popular Apple component SIRI. While this Apple connection was making news headlines, Nuance acquired a company that could transform one business segment and offer value investors solid returns.Tweddle Connect offers in-car ""infotainment systems"". This will give Nuance a further lead in the connectivity of automobiles. Nuance currently provides Dragon Drive for customers like Audi, BMW, Chrysler, Ford (NYSE:F), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Hyundai, and Toyota. Tweddle Connect has relationships with Toyota (NYSE:TM) and Lexus. Dragon Drive provides several technologies that are becoming increasingly popular in automobiles.Automobiles that use Tweddle Connect allow users to connect to Bing, iHeart Radio, OpenTable and Pandora. Nuance is planning on combining the technology with its Dragon Drive technology. Nuance paid $80 million in cash for Tweddle Connect. The deal is expected to close by the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Nuance expects the acquisition to add $25 million in revenue and $13 million in cash flow in fiscal 2014. That number should jump going forward, as Nuance leverages existing relationships with automobile manufacturers to use Tweddle Connect technology.ABI Research estimates that connected automobiles will grow at a 30% compound annual rate. They expect the number of connected automobiles to grow from 16 million to 53 million by the year 2017. Automotive News estimates that there will be over 200 million connected cars by the year 2016.In the most recent reported second quarter, Nuance saw an impressive 15.9% increase in revenue. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter was $484.0 million. Earnings per share were $0.34, which was a decrease from the previous year's $0.43. The decrease came from a lower operating margin of 29.1% (vs. 36.8%). Management was disappointed with the results, but investors should be encouraged by this recent acquisition.The mobile and consumer unit was the second largest revenue generator for Nuance in fiscal 2012. The unit saw revenue of $508.3 million, which was an increase of 29.2% from the prior year. In the fourth quarter earnings report, Nuance named Delphi, Audi, Ford, and Nissan as new bookings. In the second quarter, Nuance saw mobile and consumer sales of $116.2 million, which was only a 1% increase. The acquisition of Tweddle Connect should easily take that business unit back to the double digit growth it has come to know and love.Shares of Nuance have been hit hard in 2013. Shares are down 18.5% and trade close to fifty two week lows. Investors continue to see Nuance as only a play on the success of Apple products. Investors should take advantage of Nuance's depressed share price and ride the company into the future. Someday every new automobile will come connected, helping drivers perform several apps and tasks by voice command. Nuance will be the company to take advantage of this growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in NUAN over the next 72 hours.

1453861,24279,2013-05-22T13:17:59-04:00,,"In investing circles, some things need little introduction. Take Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN). Nuance is synonymous with voice recognition, and its technology is held in high regard worldwide. Mainstream investors became aware of the company a few years ago when its science was the backbone of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri platform on the iPhone. When anything Apple was in vogue, Nuance shot up to $31, but has since fallen on hard times, and crosses the tape at $19.In a nutshell, Nuance is in a transition period - from desktop to mobile computing, and from just plain old software to software as a service, or a subscription based model. Q1 was terrible. Q2 was like a sequel to a horror movie. In Q2's prepared remarks issued by the company, next quarter's revenue will be $480-$495 million and earnings per share are projected to be $0.30-$0.34. This is below a consensus of $554 million in revenues and EPS of $0.49. Full-year guidance also missed. Some of the blame was on poor execution in the sales department.For the second time in three months, the stock dropped from the mid $20s to the high teens, and some investors took notice. Most notably, billionaire financier Carl Icahn who previously had accumulated a 9.3% stake in the company. After the conference call, it was disclosed he increased his holdings to 10.7%. Like Nuance, Mr. Icahn needs no introduction to those that follow the market. Whether it is a televised battle with Bill Ackman over Herbalife (HLF) or the killing Mr. Icahn made on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Mr. Icahn is a financial celebrity.One thing that is consistent with Icahn is that he's not in this for the consolation prize. He puts himself in a position to win. Many investors believe the atmosphere is poisoned for Nuance. It's a lost cause. I feel this is short sighted, and with the ""passive"" investment Icahn took in Nuance, he's giving the company a stay of execution. After all, the pressure Icahn can put on a company is the stuff of legend, even though he has not stated what his involvement will be with the speech recognition entity.Even with the increased holdings for Icahn, if we do get an overall market correction, Nuance shares may go lower, but they seem to be forming a base in the current market melt-up. I prefer to bottom fish in good solid companies that hit speed bumps. This is why I took a position in Nuance at $19. However, the company may be stuck in neutral for the next few months, especially if comments during the conference call are any indication.In playing Devil's Advocate as a shareholder in Nuance, let's look at some of the less than stellar statements that management published just three short weeks ago that caused the sell-off:Management believes that it will take until 2014 to show a resumption of organic growth. That Fiscal Year 2014 organic growth will be in the mid to upper-single digit range. So we're not talking about hyper-growth for at least two years, if at all. To increase shareholder value, the company has authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of its outstanding shares subject to market conditions. A share buy-back is standard operating procedure for companies that have fallen out of favor.However, you usually do a buyback when the company is selling for a discounted price. With a current P/E Ratio of 40, this is still an expensive stock. This makes me wonder what Mr. Icahn has paid for his stake. If it's over $19, he may not exercise patience for very long. The annual Nuance Communications' shareholder meeting next January could prove very interesting.In late April, The Wall Street Journal speculated that Nuance had hired Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) for advice concerning Mr. Icahn. According to the article:In the Q&A session during the most recent conference call, Daniel Ives from FBR Capital Markets directly asked Nuance CEO Paul Ricci: ""Can you confirm you've hired a financial adviser in terms of working with your strategic alternatives?"" Mr. Ricci dodged the question, and stated: ""I can say that Nuance is very well advised and we work with many firms."" There was no follow up question, nor specific mention of Goldman Sachs.The Bottom LineWith the possibility of being under the thumb of Icahn, coupled with residing in the upper echelon of technology, the Nuance breakup value could be more than a sum of its parts if current management can't get back to its previous growth trajectory. I've always liked this company, however, that doesn't necessarily translate into a rising stock price. I believe with the Icahn stake, the handwriting is on the wall for Nuance. In a year from now, shares could be considerably higher, from change within the organization, or pressure from outside the company.Disclosure: I am long NUAN.

1454791,20568,2013-05-22T16:25:43-04:00,,"By Kevin CookNuance Communications (NUAN)  has consistently been a Zacks No. 4 Rank (Sell) or No. 5 Rank (Strong Sell)  since disappointing the Street in February, with its first-quarter  (fiscal year 2013) results.And its 2QFY13 results, unexpectedly reported on April 30, didn't help  the cause any. The company was unable to offer any clearer guidance  about the state of its  turnaround.And while many investors stepped aside from the muddy December quarter  and were rewarded for doing so in the March one (check out my price  chart below), one giant among them accumulated a 10% stake. I am speaking, of course, of Carl Icahn who reported in an SEC filing on  April 30, he was the holder of nearly 34 million shares. Clearly, he  sees something that the analysts don't as earnings estimates continue to  head down.Can You Hear Me Now?Nuance is a leading provider of speech recognition technology and voice  interface software that enable the information and services of  enterprises, telecommunications networks and the Internet to be accessed  from any telephone. You find its technology everywhere from corporate  call centers to consumer devices.The company's solutions enable voice transcription and automation within  the healthcare, mobile, and desktop verticals.

One Wall  Street house, Wedbush Securities, recently initiated coverage of Nuance  with an Outperform rating and a $23 price target.""While the company clearly has issues to resolve (sales execution,  better managing the shift to recurring revenue sources), we view the  risk/reward as favorable at current levels.""To join this optimistic view, you have to believe that company (or Carl)  can turn things around.

1707532,54532,2013-09-23T04:51:33-04:00,,"After crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time in 2006, the voice-recognition market has grown exponentially in the last few years. The global industry stood at $38.4 billion in 2010 which equates to an annual growth of more than 100 percent. Within the industry, Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN), a pioneer company, was able to capture a large chunk of this historic growth. Over the years, the company was able to register an annual growth rate of 23.5 percent in its revenue due to the increased adoption of technology by the healthcare and consumer segment.The company is working for Apple's Siri and Samsung's S-Voice and has been tipped to be one of the fastest growing companies in the coming years. It is this high potential for growth that has attracted the attention of the highly regarded equity investor, Carl Icahn. Recently, Icahn has shifted from being a passive investor in the company to being an active investor and increased his stake to 16.9 percent. The occurrence of these recent events and the high potential for growth in the company brought my attention to Nuance, and in this article, I will analyze whether the company offers an attractive investment opportunity.A History of High GrowthNuance expanded its technology portfolio and enhanced its product offerings through various acquisitions. This has enabled the company to grow its revenues at an exponential pace over the last few years. Since 2008, the company's revenues have grown at a 5 year CAGR of 22.4 percent and its earnings per share has improved significantly from a net loss of $0.18 per share in 2008 to net earnings of $0.65 per share in 2012.Source: Company Financial StatementsIn the last five years, 2008 was the most fruitful year for the company in terms of revenue growth. Revenues grew by more than 44 percent due to the 5 acquisitions undertaken by Nuance during the year. Overall, the company has conducted more than 25 acquisitions since September 2008, with the largest number of acquisitions being made in the current fiscal year.Source: Investor Day PresentationThe company's margins and earnings have improved significantly over the years. The revenue growth along with a better product mix has enabled the company to improve its performance and profitability. The company has been able to increase its revenue per head count in double digits which also contributed to the improvement in its margins. In terms of product mix, a shift towards on-demand and mobile based technology has greatly helped the company in improving its margins as these products and services are sold at high margins.Source: Company Financial StatementsThe frequent acquisitions undertaken by the company has enabled it to improve its geographic distribution of revenues. The international segment contributed approximately 29 percent of the total revenues in 2012 as compared to 23 percent in 2008. This shift significantly reduces the risk of Nuance as a wider geographic outreach makes the company less vulnerable to a single market/economy. This was also important as the increasing competition in the domestic market is making achieving further growth a bit more difficult. With an expanded geographic outreach, the company will now be able to find and exploit the growth opportunities in other markets as well.Segment AnalysisThe company operates under four segments; Healthcare, Mobile and Consumers, Enterprise and Imaging. The healthcare segment is the largest for the company contributing approximately 38.5 percent of the company's total revenues. The use of speech recognition technology is increasing in this particular sector due to the new health care regulations which are focused on reducing health care costs. To comply in letter and in spirit with the new regulations, hospitals and practitioners need to adopt this technology in order to avoid penalties and be eligible for receiving compensation from the government to those who have successfully adopted the Electronic Health Record within a stated time frame.Healthcare revenues have increased at a CAGR of 23.3 percent over the last 5 years, reaching $669.4 million in 2012. Healthcare was the most profitable segment of the company in 2012, operating at a profit margin of 47 percent. I expect this segment to continue to growing at its current pace, at least for the next two years after which the growth will slow down when the time frame given by the regulators expires.Source: Company Financial StatementsMobile and Consumer is the second largest segment of the company under which it provides voice recognition applications for cars, smart phones and other consumer devices. This segment has experienced a growth of more than 20 percent in its revenues primarily due to the exponential growth in the use of smart phones and other digital devices. The company currently provides software services to Apple and Samsung's customers for voice enabled functions. The company also provides services to leading car manufacturers such as Audi and BMW. Mobile and consumer segment is the second most profitable segment for the company and generated profit margin of 44.8 percent in 2012.Under its enterprise segment, the company provides call center solutions to businesses. It saw an exponential growth in its revenues during the earlier years as businesses were adopting the voice recognition technology in an attempt to cut their costs. However, since then the growth has slowed down significantly. The segment contributes approximately 19 percent of the company's total revenues and has achieved a CAGR of 6.7 percent in its revenues over the last 5 years. Due to the rising market competition and the slowing demand, this segment currently operates at a margin of 27.3 percent, which is the lowest as compared to other segments of the company.Imaging has been the fastest growing segment for the company. Under this segment, the company provides print management solutions. The segment's revenue grew at a CAGR of 30 percent over the last 5 years. The fastest growth was achieved in 2010 (91.2%) due to a series of successful acquisitions. This segment contributed nearly 13.1 percent to the company's total revenues in 2012, with a profit margin of 40.1 percent.The Future OutlookIn its most recent quarter, the company has achieved a growth of 8.8 percent in its revenues as compared to the last year. However, the company was unable to translate this growth in its bottom line and thus, reported a net loss of $0.11 per share as compared to a net profit of $0.25 per share in the last year. The slower growth and declining profitability has prompted the company to cut its annual earnings outlook.The sole reason for a decline in the company's revenues during the recent quarter was a decline in the revenues of its Mobile and Consumer segment by 16.2 percent. The reason was that some of the company's mobile customers have delayed renewing their contracts with the company as it continued to charge higher prices for its products. The management also expects the company's revenues and margins experience a decline as it transitions from its current lump sum model to a cloud based subscription model. Despite all the negative factors swirling around Nuance, I believe the company will register growth in the medium and long term on the basis of the growing demand for voice recognition.The global voice recognition market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.8 percent, reaching $58.4 billion by 2015. This means that the industry will provide Nuance a great opportunity for growth in the upcoming years. Amongst the various segments, I expect Mobile and consumer segment to register the highest growth in the long run. With the low penetration of the voice recognition technology, there is ample room for the company to achieve growth in the future. However, the company is bound to face increased competition and loss of some key customers, as the big technology companies, such as Apple and Google, are working on developing their own voice recognition softwares. Despite all this, I believe that the expanding global market for voice recognition provides Nuance a substantial opportunity to grow in the foreseeable future.Another factor that may cause a hindrance in the growth of voice recognition and related technology is the difficulty of providing integrated services and solutions to customers over multiple screens that an average individual uses in his/ her everyday life. The problem arises from the diversity of hardware and performance specifications, thus making it difficult to develop a single application that can work on all devices. However, Nuance seems to be working on addressing this problem. The company's new project, named Wintermute, will enable the company to provide cloud based personal assistance solutions across various platforms. Although this technology is in the initial stages of its development, its launch will bring a revolution in the industry and provide substantial growth to the company.Despite the slow growth projections for the industry as a whole, I think Nuance will be able to make an exception and achieve high growth in the years to come, either through the introduction of the new technology or through its ever increasing international presence.ConclusionWith the increasing adoption of the voice recognition technology across all platforms and various industries, Nuance will be able to register high growth in the upcoming years. Also, some problems need to be resolved, such as multi screen integration. Once these problems are clear, the industry will start experiencing exponential growth once again and Nuance, being the lead researcher in the industry, will be able to enjoy the early mover advantage. The error rate in the company's voice recognition software has decreased by 18 percent year-on-year which will enable businesses to make a seamlessly transition to this technology as a means to control their costs and improve efficiency.To sum up, I strongly believe that Carl Icahn's active stake in the company will set a support level for the company's stock price and potentially reduce its downside risk. Based on all the aforementioned factors, I think the company provides a valuable investment opportunity and thus, I will give a buy recommendation for Nuance Communications.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1871861,22786,2013-12-02T13:41:14-05:00,,"Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) traded sharply lower after reporting quarterly results that spooked investors. Shares are now 45% below a 52 week high, and are down around 15% in a month. In reporting a net earnings loss for the quarter, should investors have a contrarian view on Nuance by turning bullish? There are three things that suggest Nuance may be in the process of finding a bottom at current levels.1) Bleak result temporaryNuance lost $0.37 per share (GAAP), which pulled earnings down to $1.33 per share for fiscal 2013. This pales in comparison to the $1.73 per diluted share in earnings last year. Cash flow also declined to $395M, down from $473M last year. The company ended the year with $846.8M in cash. 9.805M shares were repurchased at an average of $18.81. This is at a price much higher than its recent price of around $13.58. Total revenue declined from $468.78M last quarter to $472.24M, while total cost of revenue increased to $198.74M.Investors reacted by selling off shares:NUAN 6 Month Total Returns data by YChartsOn its press release, the company tried to put a positive spin on its growth initiatives, since it is entering new growth markets, developing new solutions, and steadying its recurring revenue. Nuance won new businesses or design wins with mobile customers. The healthcare segment remains the most important revenue generator as it accounted for $120.3M. Further customer wins would suggest an end to the revenue decline experienced in Q4.2) Growth areas expandingExpanding product solutions is central to Nuance's growth strategy. The company expanded its healthcare business, by encoding clinical information to management and billing activities. Dragon Medical Solutions continued to improve last quarter, and will provide meaningful growth to the company in the future. Clintegrity offers solid natural language processing solutions and is being well received by healthcare providers. By reducing and even eliminating documentation errors, customers save time and increase accuracy when using Nuance solutions.Nuance stumbled in executing growth in e-subscriptions last quarter. An improvement in this area will contribute to better results in fiscal 2014.Mobile and consumer markets continue to be important for Nuance, even though growth is decelerating here. In the enterprise space, Nina products will provide virtual assistance for mobile websites and applications. This will mean more costs related to research and development.3) Recurring revenueInvestors should continue to expect revenue to decline in the short term, as Nuance shifts its business model from perpetual licenses towards recurring revenue sources. Cloud-based services will also contribute to recurring revenue. The growth rate for subscription-based revenue is expected to be slow. Nuance wants to take a moderate approach, which will result in high customer retention. In contrast, companies like Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) shifted to a subscription model very aggressively for its creative suite. Its success led to Adobe shares reaching at a 52-week high and are up 50% in 2013.Nuance is taking a slower approach compared to Adobe because of its more traditional customer base. For example, the automotive business provides steady sales, and Nuance does not want to disrupt the continuity by too great a level. In the mobile space, the virtual system solutions based on the Dragon product is being sold in new markets and channels. Competitive pressures will continue to be a factor as consolidation takes place. Nuance said that revenue from cloud services will not become meaningful to growth until the second half of fiscal 2014 at the earliest.RisksBookings could come in lighter again next fiscal year. They were weaker than initially forecast in 2013, as acquisitions made the figure more difficult to predict.ConclusionNuance shares have lost their premium built up over the last few months. It is no longer viewed as a mobile growth play. In addition, it is no longer benefitting from a Carl Icahn premium. Investors are recognizing that organic growth will not come from smartphones this year, but from the automotive sector. A transition towards subscription revenue will also hurt results, but Nuance is repositioning itself to as a stronger player in the natural language solutions market. With the premium now removed from shares, investors will be rewarded as Nuance transitions itself to reignite growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1316731,46791,2013-04-03T04:31:39-04:00,,"Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) is widely known for its speech recognition technology that is at the heart of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) beloved Siri. Although Nuance's mobile applications are only a part of its 1.4 billion dollar business, they are the lion's share of Nuance's claim to fame. Voice recognition makes the ""Kirk to Enterprise"" popularized by the first intergalactic mobile phone on Star Trek in the late 60's a coming reality. Many will use their voice to control their phones and all will find some use for voice activated features.Nuance is the Dragon at the gate of voice technology with its acclaimed Dragon suite of apps: Dragon for Email, Dictation, Search, a Personal Assistant and the Commander Dragon Go. Nuance also owns Swype, which perplexed Apple iPhone users have been wanting for years. Apple blames security issues for refusing to allow Swype on its devices. If Apple owned the company, the security issues could be easily addressed.Swype is available on all Android phones (NASDAQ:GOOG) and is standard on all the Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) S models. Swype makes texting easy, cool and fun. For people with large hands, texting on the S3 or S4 Samsung phones with Swype is a great experience while texting on the iPhone is just annoying. Voice technology along with Swype could make texting on the iPhone the best experience out there once again.Icahn has purchased shares but does not intend to influence the direction of the company. This indicates he has confidence in current management and other investors should as well. Warburg Pincus, another investment group, reportedly owns 14 percent of Nuance. Clearly, Nuance is a company that Apple should buy to integrate the voice activation technologies into its suite of mobile devices. The only question is will Apple act to take the lead again in mobile technology or cede the crown to Samsung?Nuance's price tag would be spare change for Apple's cash hoard. The 4,000 patents for voice technology, Dragon and Swype brands would pay for the purchase just by themselves. The integration of the technology into the reportedly coming larger iPhones would be seamless. Apple would own the patents and thereby force Samsung and others to license speech recognition technology from Apple.That, in addition to the 1.4 billion dollars in sales, would add to Apple's top line. There is little downside for an Apple purchase. It would be nice to have the choice to give Siri another voice like Hal from 2001, Nomad from Star Trek or just mimic Star Trek's computer voice. This would be a feature people would enjoy and make the iPhone fun again. Even if Apple does not purchase Nuance, other buyers might see an opportunity to derail Siri and beef up their own phones.Samsung seems like a natural choice because the company is committed to making smartphones that surpass or equal Apple. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and BlackBerry (BBRY) have a great opportunity to keep their foot in the door and put a Dragon at the gate. By buying Nuance, either company would have leverage to become the third major player in the smartphone field. Google (GOOG) has a history of clever acquisitions that negatively impact Apple like buying Nik photographic filters which are the best filters for Apple's Aperture. Google has plenty of reasons to want to keep Apple from leapfrogging Android in the voice recognition technology. Overall, Nuance is in the mobile phone sweet spot and is trading far from its 31 dollar high last year. At 20 there appears to be a significant upside. In the case of a buyout, significant gains may be forthcoming.The simple weekly chart shows the stock is under accumulation. A way to hedge your bets for a small gain and limited loss is to consider selling at the money puts. The January 2014 put options are around 4. If the company is sold, the price is likely to be in the mid twenties or even thirty. This would make a good profit and if the stock sells off you would be buying it for $16 a share, which would put you in good company. At this price, Nuance deserves a serious look both as a long-term buy and as a speculative buyout.Disclosure: I am long AAPL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1429751,22786,2013-05-13T10:45:49-04:00,,"After trading as low as $18 in 2013, Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) crawled back to above $23 before plunging again, thanks to a disappointing second quarter earnings report. Investors gained confidence in the shares when Carl Icahn took a 9.3% position in the company. The former high-flier once had positive momentum stemming from the implementation of Siri voice recognition software in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices.Does the latest sell-off suggest more downside to come despite Icahn taking a bullish position in the company?Voice-Recognition Competition for Nuance is ComingNuance gained greater attention from investors after Apple released Siri, but like every other new thing in technology, voice-recognition solutions offered by Nuance do not have a moat. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) released Google Now, which lets users launch a search through search commands. For now, Google's voice recognition solution will have limited impact for Nuance. Google Now only works on the most current Android operating system, Jelly Bean. On an Apple device, users need to first launch the Google Search app.Quarterly Results: The Good and the BadNuance reported a GAAP sales increase of 15.6% in its second quarter of 2013. Revenue grew 53% in healthcare, 1% in mobile and consumer, and 4.4% in the imaging segment. Revenue declined 18.5% in the enterprise segment.The company lost $25.8 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to a $0.9 million net income last year. Non-GAAP earnings were $0.34 per diluted share, down from $0.43 per diluted share last year. There are a number of other troubling figures in the results. Margins (non-GAAP) dropped to 29.1%, down from 36.8%, while operating cash flow dropped to $93.1 million, down from $100.5 million.Another notable result was that in the professional services and hosting segment, revenue grew from $155.5 million last year to $213.3 million, or up 37.1%. The cost of revenue for this segment grew at a faster pace, up 42.5% to $138.5 million.Nuance ended the quarter with around $1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, but has an outstanding debt of $2.34 billion.Alternatives: Companies Growing Outside PC SectorTo offset its exposure to the weak PC market, Nuance is growing its presence in mobile. Similarly, Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) supplies touch-screen solutions for the PC and mobile sector. The company recently raised its quarterly guidance above consensus. Synaptics expects revenue of between $190 million to $205 million, well-above the $158.2 million consensus, thanks to stronger sales from the mobile space.OmniVision (NASDAQ:OVTI), whose shares rose from around $112 to close at $14.33, makes image sensors for computers and mobile devices. The company also supplies sensors for Apple devices. In February 2013, the company provided quarterly earnings guidance that was below consensus. OmniVision expects sales will be as low as $300 million on earnings of $0.14 - $0.29 per share. The consensus estimate was for earnings to be $0.32 per share on sales of $371.4 million.(Click to enlarge)NUAN data by YChartsData Source: Yahoo Finance. Forward P/E (Price of Profit) from Kapitall.comConclusionNews that Carl Icahn held a position in Nuance gave the company a temporary catalyst in support for its shares. On April 30, Icahn raised his position to 10.7%, up from 9.3%. This raises the possibility that the corporate raider will instigate changes to improve shareholder value. Another short-term rally is possible, but the medium term outlook is cloudy. Nuance already raised spending in Research and Development from $54 million to $72.6 million in the first quarter. As Google, a heavy-weight market maker in the mobile space, enhances voice-activated solutions, Nuance will be more dangerously reliant on Apple.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1423331,22148,2013-05-10T07:33:55-04:00,,"As with any company that offers software services, the ongoing shift to the cloud and on-demand services has been disruptive to revenues and profits in the short-term. The issue previously impacted Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and now Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:NUAN) has been greatly impacted by the shift.The company is a leading provider of voice and language solutions for businesses and consumers around the world. Its technologies, applications, and services make the user experience more compelling by transforming the way people interact with devices and systems.Nuance trades around 52-week and multi-year lows even as stocks around the world have soared to all-time highs. The company recently rushed out a weak Q213 report that disappointed investors by slashing full year guidance. The main culprit was a swift shift to on-demand services away from perpetual licenses. This move causes revenue to be recorded over an extended period thereby greatly reducing current revenue. The company though did a horrendous job of quantifying the shift in the earnings report and conference call.Q213 Earnings HighlightsThe company provided the following highlights for Q213:The numbers highlight a company struggling to meet estimates rather than a broken company or stock. In fact the shift to on-demand services has led to a dramatic increase in the bookings to $2.1 billion, up 52% from $1.4 billion in the previous year. The company though didn't quantify how much of the revenue shifted to later periods that would've in the past been recorded in the current quarters.This strong bookings growth will benefit revenue in the second half of this year and fiscal 2014. So while the shift from near-term license revenue to royalty and on-demand pricing models impacts the guidance for the year it doesn't impact the long-term potential of the company.Due to these factors Nuance dropped earnings from analyst estimates of $1.83 to a range of $1.33 to $1.45. The amount is also a substantial drop from earnings of $1.73 last year.Carl Icahn Loads UpThe corporate raider used the 18% selloff following the weak guidance to add to his position. Carl Icahn increased his stake in Nuance to 10.72% from 9.27%. Per the SEC filing, the legendary activist bought an additional 4.23 million shares bringing the total to nearly 34 million shares worth around $650M.The stock traded between $18.75 and $19.75 on the day in question. With the stock closing at $19.04 and spending a considerable amount of time holding that level the likelihood exists that his firms were loading any time the stock traded below $19.In addition to the Icahn purchases, the company announced a $500 million stock repurchase plan. The combination of the two plans provide over a $1 billion in support of the stock at the current levels around $19.Launch Of Voice Ads/BiometricsAs mentioned in the last article, Nuance recently announced the launch of the Voice Ad product for mobile phones. This product promises to use the voice-activated technology of Nuance to create incredible interactive mobile ads. The company hopes that speaking to an ad will create a lasting impression for the brand as opposed to the mostly ignored display ads.Now Nuance is rolling out biometrics with Barclays for customer identification. Barclays is utilizing the FreeSpeech voice biometrics solution to securely and automatically confirm the identity of customers. It becomes the first financial services firm to deploy passive voice biometrics as a primary means to authenticate customers in their call center.These products combined with the better than expected growth of enterprise virtual assistant Nina Mobile, the company has several interesting products to drive growth.Google Fears OverblownAll of the recent weakness has helped drum up fears that the weakness might be more related to competitive pressures instead of a forced shift in the business model. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) recently hired tech evangelist Ray Kurzweil to focus on enabling computers to truly understand and even speak in natural language.The company recently launched an app on the iPhone and iPad to bring Google Now voice search in direct competition with Siri developed by Nuance for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Reading a recent interview from Forbes with Ray and its clear that the focus is on improving search and developing that interaction with the following statement:Not that anybody expects Google to stop at only search if the technology is robust enough for virtual assistants in the enterprise sector or even transcribing medical records. For now though, the company doesn't appear to have any plans other than to develop the technology and enable it for better answers to search queries.Stock PerformanceThe stock performance over the last 2 years has been utterly dismal. The stock peaked at around $31 in early February last year and eventually traded down to $18. The stock trades only slightly above the lows around $16 back in August 2011. That period was wrought with fears of another financial collapse and has led to a massive market rally since those days. Nuance hasn't participated.The below chart highlights the lack of returns from Nuance along with the big gains by Google during that time period:NUAN data by YChartsConclusionWith the last article, the suggestion was to wait for the stock to drop back to $20 before investing. Anybody waiting long enough can now buy the stock right around where Icahn loaded up twice. Nuance has several strong products just beginning to generate revenues that could turn into big products making the stock an attractive value.Unfortunately, the company wasn't clear about the impact of the transition to on-demand services. Until the impact is more clearly understood, the stock is likely to languish at these levels. The longer the stock hangs at these levels the greater the potential exists that another company such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Yahoo (YHOO) purchases the firm. The addition of the voice recognition expert might provide unlimited potential in the hands of a cash rich firm wanting to compete with Google in mobile search or the enterprise market.Disclosure: I am long NUAN.

1316951,38851,2013-04-03T06:24:24-04:00,,"Things are getting better for Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:NUAN). Carl Icahn, now estimated to be worth $20 billion by people who do the calculations, has acquired 9.3% of the company. There have also been some favorable stories from within, just not as felicitous.There are plenty of articles on Seeking Alpha that discuss Nuance. If you care to review my other one, written after the recent earnings disappointment, it is accessible here.Here is a list of what now may be other key considerations:(1) Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the company's mega cap competitors; and also a customer. From what I read, its Surface tablet product is now selling.(2) A 9.3% NUAN stake would be worth about $550 million, and about an average size holding for Carl Icahn personally. Various funds have also disclose shared voting power, per SEC documents (including three Master Funds, an Onshore Fund, an Offshore Fund, a Partners Fund, a Capital Fund, two Enterprise entities, and perhaps IPH GP is controlled by him too). If Nuance's next Report reveals deterioration, despite what could be improving results from the Microsoft partnership, the implications could manifest. There might already be enough power to try and place someone--such as Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP) President, Daniel Ninivaggi--on the Board. If not, votes are probably continuing to be amassed.(3) Until something new happens, I do not see the stock price going below $20. Too many shares have been soaked up for that (including stakes taken by other funds).(4) Obviously Icahn's presence is more helpful to Nuance shareholders than CFO Thomas Beaudoin's insider sales. There is no indication that the former party is done buying. The company's finances have been a concern under the latter.(5) NUAN remains compelling. A stream of press releases announces exciting new technologies and products, most recently Voice Ads.It must be a thrill to take control of a company. Terms like ""Poison pill"" and ""Shark repellent"" are applicable to those who attempt to do so. A method that could perhaps lead to having the resources for such a presence in corporate America is to take profits at times like now, which I have done.Icahn is one of my favorites. I remember when he could not afford Clorox (NYSE:CLX). Some others are not as enthusiastic about him. Most of us can buy and sell without causing a stock's price to move 5.7% though, which is what happened on April 2, 2013.IEP itself appears worthy of consideration for those who invest in limited partnerships. It offers distributions, and because the CEO has said he intends to be paid in additional depositary units, there may be another effect that almost has similarities to a regularly executed buyback program. He owns over 97 million shares, out of 108 million outstanding. There has recently been insider buying, followed by $200 million in dilution. At the current unit price of $55.14, and based on a $1 per share February distribution increase, the yield is 7.25%! An obvious consideration is that virtually everything is in one set of hands.Needing to look out for myself, I am hoping to repurchase shares of NUAN when the effect of the buy-in publicity subsides. Even though it is tangibly helpful to investors, a different party may be taking control of the company in the near future and most of us do not have his tactics to utilize. No one is clearly better versed at this type of thing than Carl Icahn.Meanwhile, an intraday low below $21 may present another opportunity to be a shareholder.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in NUAN, IEP over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1316821,22148,2013-04-03T05:05:45-04:00,,"Anybody following previous articles on Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:NUAN) knows that the company and stock have been incredibly appealing, yet the scenario never existed to load up on the stock. The company has had a decent growth profile and it has compelling technology, yet the combination hasn't lead to stock returns over the last 18 months due an over reliance on mergers and the accumulation of debt.The company is a leading provider of voice and language solutions for businesses and consumers around the world. Its technologies, applications, and services make the user experience more compelling by transforming the way people interact with devices and systems.Nuance is famous for being the technology behind the Siri product used by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which recently hit 52-week lows. Ironically within the same day reports of two potential catalysts hit the wires that could push the stock higher.One catalyst is technology driven by the company and another is in the form of an outside agitator that has purchased a considerable stake in the stock. Will either be enough to get this technology leader back into the mode of benefiting the shareholder via stock gains?Major Agitator Carl Icahn ArrivesAfter the close on Monday, it was revealed that billionaire Carl Icahn bought a 9.3% stake in the company. Icahn is famous for agitating management into making changes that theoretically benefit shareholders. He has been successful lately with major stakes with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Herbalife (NYSE:HLF). Investors following Icahn into those positions could have made decent returns. Others, such as the investment in Chesapeake (CHK) only worked if an investor exited the position at the same time and others such as Navistar (NYSE:NAV) have struggled.The only concern is that the filing shows that Icahn has only taken a passive stake indicating that he isn't pushing for change. While Icahn clearly has derived that the stock has value without change, the current management team hasn't been able to achieve gains for shareholders. Has Carl been successful in passive investments and will he actually stay passive?Launch Of Voice AdsPrior to the open on Monday, Nuance announced the launch of the Voice Ad product for mobile phones. This product promises to use the voice-activated technology of Nuance to create incredible interactive mobile ads. The company hopes that speaking to an ad will create a lasting impression for the brand as opposed to the mostly ignored display ads. Will voice ads be the compelling reason brands move to mobile from large screened PCs and TV experiences? Imagine the day when consumers can interact with the ad to find the nearest location that sells the item or maybe a coupon to spur the purchase decision.The company already has creative advertising agencies on board and is working with leading independent mobile ad networks such as Millennial Media (NYSE:MM), Jumptap, and Opera Mediaworks. With the agencies and mobile ad networks in place, voice ads could be a hit by the holidays.Check out the video on AllThingsD with Mike McSherry showing off a prototype of the technology. Obviously the ad is a rough example of what can be done, but imagine the level of creativity that can be built into the ads as the market gets a hold of this technology.According to Forbes, Nuance will take in an estimated 1-2% share of revenue from the ad networks that use the technology in their ads. The costs of voice-recognition ads will tend to cost companies slightly higher than the normal $10 per thousand views for rich media.Was Guidance That Horrible?Even after the 5.7% jump Tuesday on the Icahn news, the stock trades at less than 11x forward earnings. At a market cap of $6.75B, Icahn could do limited agitating and obtain a higher valuation for this stock.While most investors get caught up in the momentum buzz of the earnings season, the ultimate valuation is based on the earnings potential of a stock and not the momentum. The company still forecast 24% revenue growth for both Q2 and fiscal year 2013. Not bad for a stock trading at only 11x forward earnings.The company has a lot of technological expenses that should work out to a rebound in earnings growth in fiscal 2014. And this issue could be where Icahn works the best. He is famously working on turning Chesapeake Energy into a cost-cutting machine now that the CEO has been forced out.While Nuance in the short-term is facing the software trend towards usage-based pricing that elongates the revenue cycle, the company continues to 'splurge' on deals that hint at the company being unable to control spending and focus on the existing products. Icahn's presence might help cut back on those deals that have left a very cash flow positive company with a lot of debt.Stock PerformanceThe stock performance over the last 18 months has been dismal. The stock peaked at around $31 in early February last year and eventually traded down to $18. The recent gains from the Icahn purchases only got the stock over $21. It is still substantially below the highs as the S&P 500 hits all-time highs.The below chart highlights the lack of returns from Nuance along with the major mobile ad network working with voice ads:^SPXTR data by YChartsMillennial Media is another favorite stock that could benefit greatly from this technology. The interesting news is the lack of Apple amongst the news. Apple runs the 3rd largest mobile ad network. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has the largest mobile ad network, but it is busy trying to create its own voice-recognition software so the exclusion isn't surprising. All providing a greater example of why an independent network such as Millennial as an advantage.ConclusionThe Voice Ads product increases the already attractive technology position of Nuance. Whether the current management team can turn that into shareholder wealth is another issue. The recent addition of Carl Icahn could help turn the stock around as he hopefully agitates for shareholder returns.The stock is very attractive at $21, but investors need to understand that past positions of Icahn haven't gone straight up. Investors waiting for a slight pullback to $20 will be more aligned with the great investor that clearly bought below $20.While voice ads could be a huge catalyst to income, Icahn might be a bigger catalyst to stock gains.Disclosure: I am long MM.

1316591,25432,2013-04-03T02:34:16-04:00,,"Shares of Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) were up some 5.7% Tuesday on news that Carl Icahn initiated a stake in the company. I recently wrote an article on investing alongside Carl Icahn through his master limited partnership which trades on the public market, Icahn Enterprises (NASDAQ:IEP).On the very day the article was published, the press reported that Mr. Icahn took a 9.3% passive stake in Nuance. Investors should note, however, that while Mr. Icahn beneficially owns 9.3% of Nuance, the deal was consummated through fifteen different investment vehicles owned by Mr. Icahn. Based on my read of the Section 13G filing, Icahn Enterprises, the master limited partnership investable through the public markets, holds a 7.43% beneficial stake in Nuance.Nuance appears to fit certain criteria in which Mr. Icahn invests, which include: (1) financial/balance sheet restructurings; (2) operation turnarounds; (3) strategic initiatives; and (4) corporate governance changes.In February 2013, Nuance's equity price slumped 19% after it reported Q1 earnings due to missing analyst revenue targets, European macroeconomic concerns and muted expectations in the near term, even as Nuance reported it grew Q1 FY 2013 revenue and operating cash flow 29% and 37% year-over year, respectively.Price:Nuance is currently valued at about $6.8 billion, down from a peak of about $9.3 billion in early 2012.The company also is in a net debt position of about $1.4 billion, bringing the enterprise value to about $8.2 billion. At that price, does Nuance represent a bargain?Nuance Business:Nuance provides voice-recognition software solutions, primarily to two segments: (1) mobile and (2) healthcare.I suspect Mr. Icahn sees great value in both, considering the markets should grow on the back of secular growth trends in each segment. And, considering that Nuance has lagged the market over the past year, Nuance appears like a classic, out-of-favor contrarian pick. In addition, I suspect investors also punished Nuance for its affiliation with the out-of-favor Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which utilizes Nuance technology for Siri. When one can say that a supplier of Apple was punished for its affiliation with Apple, both companies might be worth a look for value investors.As it relates to the Nuance business, there appears to be significant value in the healthcare segment as the industry goes through an operational disruption. Revenues grew at a blistering pace, up 49.6% year-over-year. According to reports, Nuance has developed technology with the ability to extract discrete information from paper-based files and transcribe it to electronic medical records. One of the hallmarks of President Obama's Affordable Care Act includes reducing administrative cost and burden by shifting to electronic medical records, an area where Nuance is poised to add considerable value.The mobile business will likely benefit from significant tail winds, thanks to its leading position in voice-recognition in the mobile market. Revenues in its mobile and consumer segment increased 20.4% year-over-year. It's also reported that Nuance is now attacking the $8 billion mobile ad market through its service called Voice Ads, presenting another opportunity for growth at Nuance.Finally, Nuance reported $629.3 million and $183.1 million in US federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards as of September 30, 2012, respectively, both of which will offset future tax obligations. Part of those NOLs, however, relate to stock-based compensation previously expensed, and when that portion of the NOL balance is used, management will record it as additional paid-in capital when realized. Nuance also reported foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $420.4 million, of which it recorded a valuation allowance of $89.4 million. Management didn't apply a valuation allowance against the US portion. Therefore, it is more likely than not that it will benefit from the full value of the US NOLs. Collectively, the NOLs will allow Nuance to offset $1.14 billion in future income, saving the company some $343 million in future taxes (based on a 30% tax rate).Conclusion:Nuance is a very innovative company levered to growing markets. With the stock up some 5.7% after the news of Mr. Icahn's passive stake and up some 18.5% since hitting a low of $18/share in February, investors should proceed with caution. The market is clearly repricing Nuance, and with the recent rise in the share price, the equity value has increased accordingly, by about $1 billion since hitting its low. Another, more risk averse way to play Nuance, may be investing in Icahn Enterprises, which trades at a discount to its net asset value.Mr. Icahn holds Nuance shares at better prices than investors can obtain today. I'd go with the smart money to get exposure to Nuance. And Mr. Icahn looks sagacious sporting his new, white beard. His recent trades are certainly acting as a confirmation of his investing wisdom.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in IEP over the next 72 hours.

1315471,24276,2013-04-02T15:23:46-04:00,,"Reports that investor Carl Icahn has taken a 9.3% stake in Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) caused a big pop in the stock after-hours yesterday, some of which got taken back in Tuesday trading.It's the second big tech deal Icahn has made in recent days. He has also tried to engineer a takeover of Dell (NYSE:DELL) and suddenly appears, rocking a white beard and no tie, on the cover of Forbes.Icahn is buoyed by his recent success with Herbalife (NYSE:HLF), which has held firm since he came in on the buy side opposite Bill Ackman, and Chesapeake Energy (CHK), which is up 10% since he moved founder Aubrey McClendon to an April 1 retirement. Icahn has also become the largest investor in Transocean (NYSE:RIG), which is up 13% so far this year.His recent Forbes profile is a typical ""big fish"" piece, and attempts to spin the idea of ""lone wolf"" investors like Icahn taking the place of hedge fund managers like Ackman, but beyond that the question occurs, are you right to follow in this fish's wake?Icahn is arguing that there is undiscovered value in Nuance, which dominates the market for voice recognition but has failed to capitalize on it. The company's new VoiceAds service has attracted a lot of media interest since its announcement, based on its promise to not only speak the ad's text but interact with mobile users.But Nuance has done a lot of other neat stuff without getting much reward. Its technology is behind Apple's Siri. Its Dragon line of dictation programs are the market leader.The problem here is that Nuance became the leader in voice almost by default. Mighty Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been unable to capitalize on voice even though it gives the basic technology away. The technology actually originated with IBM, which offered VoiceType as early as 1997, spun out something called ViaVoice in 1999, then sold that product to ScanSoft, which Nuance later acquired.Icahn is 77. He has always focused on near-term profits, turning over his portfolio regularly when he got what he wanted. What he seems to want from Nuance is a plan to increase profits from its voice technologies.It's an open question whether such a plan exists. I would only be interested in this idea if I were ready to follow each move Icahn makes with Nuance, and each move Nuance makes, being prepared to always pull the trigger when something pops. It's a trade, not an investment. That said, if you like trading it's something worth doing.Disclosure: I am long IBM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1207821,38851,2013-02-20T15:06:43-05:00,,"For those who have not been following Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:NUAN), a leading company in voice recognition technology identified with Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri, it just reported an awful fourth quarter. Not only did it miss estimates by $0.01, but it guided down. The stock dropped so much that it was excessive.Yes, Nuance may have just played the part of a waiter bringing cold soup: its rebuke has been harsh. Analysts have been downgrading. Yahoo! Finance's mean recommendation is now at 2.1 in comparison to last week's 1.8. Professionals have bearing on a equity pricing, it is something that many institutions heed, in varied measures, and that retail clients use in their decisions. However, as a favorite columnist Brett Arends says, ""Buying the[ir] 10 most popular stocks each year would have brought you total losses of 11% over the past five years.""Scrutiny toward the real problems that have caused the depressed price is deserved. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Paul A. Ricci presents an organized summary of the company's three difficulties:There is at least one other matter not fully addressed in the Conference Call questioning that needs to be noted: the company's unimpressive-at-best financial statements. Its new 10Q shows $2,330 mln in long-term debt and $961 mln in cash (a $485.8 mln term loan is due in March, 2016). Its total assets are listed at $6,099 mln, with the largest component being goodwill worth $3,235 mln. However, the company anticipates slowing its investments in R&D and sales and also ""Will realize significant savings from the consolidation of acquisitions.""Let's turn to operations. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a key partner and listed competitor, has not been the world-beating superstar of decades past. Some of its strengths lie in office productivity software and its commercial customer base. For its FY13 Q2, Servers and Tools product revenue is up 9%; and for datacenters, its SystemCenter revenue grew 18%. There has been much attention directed at how much impact the Windows 8 product cycle can have on the company's top and bottom lines. Thus far, results have been underwhelming, and Nuance expects ""That the Windows business...will remain weaker…throughout the course of the year.""The company is transitioning away from reliance on Windows. Its virtual agent software is realizing growth and offers future opportunity. Several different markets are being targeted, which is exciting. Potential end users of this technology that enables customer self-service include airline, banking, insurance and retail businesses.With the downside of disappointing partnership results priced in, there is value here. Even though MSFT pays a nice dividend, yielding 3.3%, Nuance, as a partial derivative, may have a better risk/reward. A recent Microsoft presentation says: ""We are positioned for growth across a massive addressable market from tablets to laptops and Ultrabooks to all-in-ones."" Thus, if customers actually upgrade their operating systems, or Surface can gain any traction, there could easily be a substantial impact for the inexpensive NUAN.There are other prospects. Management expects revenues from Nuance's Wintermute hybrid solution with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) across a number of platforms in 2014. In general, there is ""Confidence in a number of new deals"" closing over the next year. Though overall organic growth is forecast to be slow, the tech sector appears to be more of a boon than a concern for the company's future, despite a widely-observed decline of the desktop PC.There may be another positive, too: bottoming and stabilizing gross margins, which have declined 2.1 percentage points to 60.5%. At the end of the Q4 2012 conference call, Scott Zeller of Needham & Company asks about them in consideration of business shifting through on-demand and the cloud. Mr. Ricci's response: their 200 to 250 basis point year-over-year differential is ""The right target.""Nuance's acquisitions have been watched, noted--and criticized. Though resources are easily wasted through buying, and operating synergies are only realized in many cases when nonperforming assets are spun off or sold, NUAN is a smallish mid-cap, worth roughly $6 bln. Eventually, if such a corporation keeps purchasing competitors, suppliers, and start-ups, there are fewer components. Nuance obviously has a terrific foothold in the marketplace and may easily prevail as the global leader in voice recognition software. Further, its only listed competitor in healthcare is the privately owned M*Modal.The real, glaring problems are with the company's healthcare business and geographic EMEA results. As slight mitigation, though EMR (Electronic Medical Record) volumes will weigh on results for the next few quarters, management is actually expecting revenue streams from its newly acquired coding products later in the year. If the EMEA situation is merely macro in nature, results should not get worse and the company's products are likely to slowly penetrate a stubborn marketplace. Though there is not much cause for immediate optimism here, the stock remains attractive.NUAN is cheap by many important measures. It trades at 9.2 x 2014 earnings while analysts project a five-year growth rate of 16.67%. MSFT itself trades at a lower multiple of 8.87x, but analysts only see it growing at 8.4%, lagging the software industry and technology sector's 19% and 18%, respectively. For comparison, the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) trades at 13.78 x forward earnings. I do not think NUAN is going much lower and is likely to slowly move higher.Nuance has terrific business with smartphone users, and reported results being particularly strong in Asia. Its customer base and ability to increase revenues in this market are not suspect at this time. It continues to be a key supplier for both Apple and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), two of the largest companies in the world.Here is a chart that visually shows the recent sell-off. Notice that the Bollinger Band width has caught up? The stock price is now within a standard deviation of its 20-day moving average. To me, it is not a reason to buy or sell; but is an interesting technical observation (a W or double bottom here may signal a move higher to some; I am likely to act before then and write a March covered call at a $20 strike price if the stock rises much over $19).Nuance reported a disappointing quarter. Sellers made their feelings known. The stock dropped to levels that offer significant upside.Disclosure: I am long NUAN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1242691,43861,2013-03-04T01:43:26-05:00,,"Last week, I overheard my twelve-year-old daughter asking her iPad, ""Siri, could you do the dishes for me?"" Since Apple (AAPL) introduced Siri on the iPhone 4s, intelligent voice technology has finally made it to the consumer market. Most high-end smartphones now have the voice ""personal assistant"" built into them. Luxury cars are also equipped with the same technology. The technology has evolved from pure voice recognition to artificial intelligence (AI), which can understand human language, analyze the content, and respond accordingly. It is reasonable to expect that in five years, all smartphones, TVs, PCs, tablets, GPSs, and game consoles will come with the ""voice assistant"". A fair percentage of cars, high-end appliances, and toys will also have this technology built in. The market potential is enormous. All the new gadgets expected to come out in the next couple of years, whether it is an iWatch, iTV, or Google (GOOG) glasses, will have voice interaction as one of the primary interfaces. One company that stands out in this field is Nuance (NUAN). The following are several reasons why it is currently an opportune time to buy Nuance.1. Leader in the industryNuance is by far the leader in the voice technology industry. Currently, it faces little competition. The list of its mobile customers will help you see the point. Key mobile customers for Nuance are Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Audi, BMW, Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Chrysler, Dell (DELL), DoCoMo, Ford (F), Volkswagen, GM, HTC, Huawei, Kyocera, LG, Oi, Nokia (NOK), Intel (INTC), IBM, Panasonic (PC), Pantech, Prosodie, BlackBerry (BBRY), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Sony (SNE), Telefonica, Telstra, T-Mobile (OTCQX:DTEGF), and ZTE. Major automobile manufacturers and almost all smartphone players are on the list. The gross margin, which has remained around 70% for six years, is also an excellent indication of weak competition.In today's market, the most prominent example of the mobile device interface is Siri, the voice assistant that is in the latest iPhone and iPad. It is widely suspected that Siri uses Nuance Technology. Siri's co-founder, Norman Winarsky, admitted, ""Nuance has far and away the most IP in speech synthesis technologies in the industry."" Nuance has also developed its own voice personal assistant ""Nina,"" which is well received by the market. For Nuance, the only potential serious competitor is Google. Google has been developing its own voice technology for the past few years. Given the history of Google and its talented R&D team, it is quite possible that in a year or two, Google will be very competitive in this area. However, Nuance has a very substantial head start. Unless Google's product is vastly superior to Nuance's, companies that are already using Nuance's technology will be unlikely to change their vendor. Because Google is a competitor of most smartphone companies, it will probably be more comfortable for these companies to deal with Nuance.2. Market potentialsNuance has four lines of business: Health Care Solutions, Mobile and Consumer Solutions, Enterprise Solutions, and Imaging Solutions. I will focus on the top three.Health Care Solutions is the largest revenue and profit generator for Nuance. In 2012, the revenue generated was $669 million and profit was $314.9 million. The organic growth for revenue was 11%. The reason for using organic growth is that Nuance has made quite a few acquisitions in the last few years. The demand from the health care industry is fueled by the need to computerize medical records. Voice interface is a much more convenient and time-saving solution than typing on a keyboard. Due to government spending cuts in the health care industry, growth has slowed down a bit. However, the need for computerization of all medical documents is still very strong. Nuance is the number-one provider for the health care industry in voice interface solutions.Mobile and Consumer Solutions' business has the greatest potential for Nuance. As I mentioned earlier, voice interface is quickly becoming the norm for mobile device users. The advantage of voice interface for automobiles is extremely obvious for safety reasons, and I expect all major car manufacturers will adopt this technology. As AT&T CEO Stephenson put it, ""The way we think about the car is that it's just a big smartphone on wheels in the future."" All the new wearable gadgets, such as iWatch and Google glasses, will have to be voice activated as well because the surface is too small for a touch screen or keyboard. The revenue in 2012 for Nuance in Mobile and Consumer Solutions was $508 million, with a profit of $228 million. The organic revenue growth was 23%. Given the market potential, the growth will see strong acceleration in the next two to five years.Enterprise Solutions mainly deals with service-oriented companies. Nuance's customers include the majority of the top 25 global banks, the majority of global Telcos, the majority of global airlines, and most of the Fortune 100 companies. This line of business is more mature and cyclical, and the global economic environment will have an impact on the growth. In 2012, the revenue in Enterprise Solutions was $228 million, with a profit of $91 million. The organic revenue growth rate was 10%.Overall, Nuance is expected by the market to grow its sales at least 20% in the next year. I won't be surprised if the rate exceeds 20%, given the potential new gadgets and consumers' enthusiasm for the voice interface.3. Strong fundamentals and low valuationNuance traded over $31 shortly after Apple's debut of its iPhone 4s with Siri built in. But the latest earnings report slightly missed the estimates, and the stock took a beating and went down to the low $18s. The miss is mainly due to the slowdown in the health care sector and Europe. Despite the miss, the fundamentals are still very strong. From 2006 to 2012, its revenue grew from around $400 million to over $1.7 billion; the net income grew from $67 million to $556 million (42% annual growth rate); EPS grew from $0.37 to $1.73 (29% annual growth rate); and CFFO (cash flow from operation) grew from $60 million to $470 million (40% annual growth rate). Nuance has maintained its gross margins close to 70% while achieving these impressive growths. The average of next year's EPS estimate from analysts is $2.02, which yields a forward P/E of 9 at current price around $18. Given the expected growth rate around 20%, the valuation is very low. It is an opportune time to buy the stock.4. Potential takeover targetThe low valuation and high growth potential have made Nuance a very attractive takeover target. The relatively small market cap of $5.77 billion should also make it easy for an acquirer. Apple, Samsung, or IBM may consider taking over Nuance. The strategic importance to Apple or Samsung is obvious. All mobile devices need voice technology, and Nuance is the leader. IBM, however, is the best fit among them. Nuance has worked with IBM in Health Care Solutions for a number of years, and health care is an important area for IBM's growth. Voice technology has evolved from voice recognition to voice intelligence that requires intensive R&D on artificial intelligence. IBM has the most advanced AI research among all high tech companies. The combination will advance the voice intelligence technology to a new level.ConclusionThe prime time for voice technology has arrived. Voice interface will become the norm for mobile devices in five years. Nuance is the clear leader in the industry with few competitors. The growth rate over the last six years has been very impressive. The slight miss of the earnings estimate has created an opportunity to buy the stock at $18.Here is Siri's response to my daughter's question ""Can you please do the dishes for me?""""I have found six restaurants within one mile radius."" Smart, a very smart answer!Disclosure: I am long NUAN, AAPL, INTC. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1177121,22148,2013-02-13T03:39:06-05:00,,"Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:NUAN) remains a stock long on potential and short on performance. The company reported Q1 2013 results that largely missed estimates and provided disappointing guidance. The stock initially sold off 18% the following day and continues to get cheaper by the day after hitting 52-week lows on Tuesday. While the company continues to disappoint, the market ignores the valuation. A company that earns nearly $2 a year is still a company that generates strong profits regardless of its ability to meet estimates.The company is a leading provider of voice and language solutions for businesses and consumers around the world. Its technologies, applications, and services make the user experience more compelling by transforming the way people interact with devices and systems.The company that is famous for being the technology behind the Siri product used by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) now infamously has a similar valuation metric to that customer.Q1 2013 HighlightsThe company reported the following highlights for Q1:The main issue investors have with the stock is the plunging margins. Costs appear to be rising faster than revenue making investors concerned that the competitive environment is starting to take a bite out of the results.3 Main IssuesThe company highlighted 3 major factors contributing to the weak results and disappointing guidance.Weakness in Europe isn't surprising considering the environment on that continent that existed during the last quarter of 2012. The conversion to new medical systems will hurt short-term, but towards year-end that sector will pick up with the products from the acquisitions. While the company didn't provide details, the ultimate concern has to be whether the company is hurt from the shift to tablets from PCs. Business that existed on PCs may not automatically shift to a Nuance product on all the new tablet versions.GuidanceFor all the talk about the company missing Q1 estimates, Nuance actually hit the exact mid-point as originally provided below:The company provided the updated guidance for Q2:The trends toward usage-based pricing in mobile, term-licenses in healthcare and on-demand services in enterprise will have a tendency to elongate revenue cycles compared to the perpetual license model. As with the factors above, these issues are as much a shift in the product mix as any competitor problems.A concern with the updated guidance was naturally the low-end estimate of only earning $0.36. The company was clear that the numbers are very dependent on whether several major deals close during Q2 or Q3. So Again the mix and timing of new products is as much at fault as anything else.Stock PerformanceThe stock performance over the last year has turned dismal. The stock peaked at around $31 in early February last year and now trades below $19. In fact, the trading on Tuesday sent the stock to new 52-week lows and places the current price on par with the average back in 2011. Long-term investors can't be happy after this last selloff.As mentioned in the last article, the $19 level was a great buying opportunity, but if the stock didn't hold then it was technically broken and could head lower.As the 2-year chart shows, Apple has easily outperformed Nuance even after its recent major selloff.2-Year Chart - Nuance CommunicationsNUAN Total Return Price data by YChartsValuationThe stock remains one of the cheapest technology companies around. The slight cut of FY 2014 earnings forecasts from $2.11 to $2.05 has been completely over shadowed by a gigantic stock loss now approaching 25%. The forward P/E has now dropped to 9x estimates placing the valuation in line with Apple. Ironic considering the valuation in the market and possibly highlighting that investors see its results tied to that of the diminished customer going forward.ConclusionAfter reading the earnings report and listening to the conference call, it is difficult to understand the reason that investors continue to push the stock down. Sure the Q2 earnings guidance was a concern, especially at the lower end, but then again investors weren't paying up for the stock. Nuance is now very cheap compared to full year guidance and expected 2014 growth.The new products suggest the company has the ability for strong growth over the next few years. The demand for language-enhanced technologies appears to only be expanding in contrast to the stock price. The healthcare sector might be experiencing some turmoil, but the new products should turn the division around in the next couple of quarters.While the stock offers an attractive valuation at these levels, the technicals suggest the stock might get cheaper by the day as it heads to previous lows around $17 before bottoming. At those levels though, investors should load up to invest in the technology with a clear growth trajectory over the next decade.Disclosure: I am long AAPL.

1065511,25062,2012-12-14T15:07:57-05:00,,"Relative ValuationHaving recently turned a corner in profitability, Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) trades at a PEG ratio of 0.0762. For reference, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a PEG of 0.2012. Nuance is 1/60th the size of Apple.Nuance has an EV/EBITDA TTM of 25.07. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) is 47.55.Nuance has a Price/Sales ratio of 4.075. Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) is 8.137.Unlike the three comparables mentioned, Nuance has an effective monopoly in its core business, which is speech recognition. Such hyper-specialization in core business often results in fragility. But the focused niche model is not risky for Nuance, as Nuance provides must-have, custom solutions in several growing categories.Thus the stock appears cheap on relative valuation alone. One can get the explosive transformation potential for free.Transformation PotentialThrough speech recognition and artificial intelligence (AI), Nuance leads a revolution in use of technology. Siri is just the beginning.When humans communicate with each other, we do not pass written notes with yes/no icons and blank textboxes sketched in them. Instead, we nod or shake our heads, and we speak (listen) to transfer complex ideas. It is efficient and comfortable for us to communicate conversationally. Computers do not have the right to make us change our habits; it is only temporary that we conform to technological limits.Strategic PositioningAs limitations are dismantled by Nuance, developers are increasingly designing their applications to be ""native"" for speech recognition. Nuance is the only company maintaining a complete vertical stack in this area, has highly defensible IP compared to ""rounded corners"" patents, and a multi-year head start applying the nuances of this technology.Google's Glass will help bring speech recognition UX to the mainstream, but Google is not direct competition for Nuance. Partners rely on Nuance as a neutral party, or ""Switzerland"" - Google will never occupy this category (Google is ""China"").Google has already established itself as a complement to Nuance. For example, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) currently partners with Nuance in Android phones, and Samsung is not the only one. Thus Google's participation in 2013/2014 next-generation speech recognition is likely net-positive for Nuance, as it accelerates the UI paradigm shift.TimingPerhaps only 1% of speech recognition's core usability potential has been realized. Does that mean we are only 1% done in terms of timing?Consider the Human Genome Project, which was 1% done after 7 years. Scientists thought it would thus take 700 years. Ray Kurzweil modeled it exponentially and correctly predicted it would be done in a couple of years. Here's what he says about Siri in his latest book:This reference to Siri as a first-generation product refers to her AI capabilities--Kurzweil is saying Siri's second generation will show distinctly improved human-like thinking. The first-generation label does not refer to speech recognition.In speech recognition usability, Nuance is further along than a first generation. This is important to note. If speech recognition usability progresses on a logarithmic growth curve, and the early portions of that curve have been drawn already, usability's rate of improvement is approaching extreme speeds.Now, let's look at some of the trends Nuance is involved in.Enterprise Trend80% of startups with IPO potential are now B2B. B2B stocks like LinkedIn (LNKD), Salesforce, and Yelp (NYSE:YELP) have dramatically outperformed consumer stocks like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN).Nuance solves problems in this space by replacing service workers with artificial intelligence software. This allows businesses to communicate with customers more quickly, more thoroughly, and more cheaply.Payments TrendPotential for profit in the payments market is huge. Here is an example of how huge it is. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is a darling tech stock almost entirely because it has PayPal; PayPal is the historical leader in payments. But PayPal's founder Elon Musk suggests PayPal is screwed. The potential for profit in the payments market is so huge, nobody cares that Elon Musk is bearish on PayPal.Nuance lets customers log in verbally using voice biometrics, which is the most frictionless way to handle payments. Frictionlessness is crucial in payments as it results in a higher conversion rate. In the foreseeable future, selling without voice recognition payments may be like trying to sell today without credit card acceptance.Healthcare Trend90% of American doctors have not yet adopted electronic health records. Developing country healthcare is one of, if not the, world's fastest growing industries. In the latest earnings call, Nuance provided such aggressive guidance for its healthcare growth that the Goldman (NYSE:GS) analyst incredulously asked Nuance to repeat it. The guidance is based on Nuance's established growth rate in this sector, and Nuance has been beating overall guidance for several quarters.Illiteracy Trend87% of American adults scored below ""proficiency"" in document literacy testing. Nuance will destroy the barrier between document literacy and information technology. We are talking about a usability difference of comparable scale between televisions and books.Smart MoneyI recently offered a hypothesis to suggest how intellectual-property-heavy business models are undervalued. Clear thinking in the area has been sacrificed as it leads to uncomfortable conclusions:Paul Krugman, who has an economics Nobel, weighed in on this issue three days later (see also):Side note: Albert Wenger, who is Fred Wilson's USV partner, has a solution for this social problem: unbundle the benefits of employment, so that each can be distributed more efficiently:I am not trying to solve society's problems in my investment thinking. However, when extremely smart people like Paul and Albert confirm the power of intellectual property in modern economics, that is useful confirmation in establishing the value of Nuance within an IP asset class.Mad MoneyCramer said ""stay away"" from Salesforce stock when it traded at $24. He presently loves Salesforce at $166. He has been scaring investors away from Nuance at $22 with the same ""it's not cheap enough"" and ""I don't get it"" line of reasoning he used on Salesforce.Hypothetical NUAN Ratings Model Through 2014Strong buy below $30. Buy below $55. Hold below $90. Sell below $135. Strong sell above $135.NUAN data by YChartsDisclosure: I am long NUAN. I am short CRM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

What initiated the sell-off, was that the company cut its fiscal 2013 sales forecast to $2.15 billion to $2.2 billion, down from a November projection of $2.17 billion to $2.22 billion. The stock was already underperforming the market over the last six months on concerns that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone growth was slowing. Although a disappointing report, the company is still growing rapidly and long term investors should be rewarded by buying shares at these levels.Nuance Communications provides voice and language solutions for businesses and consumers worldwide.6 reasons NUAN is providing a great long term entry point at under $20 a share:Disclosure: I am long AAPL, NUAN.

(NASDAQ:NUAN) remains valued relatively cheap; investors continue to complain that the company is a serial buyer of other technologies instead of building on the existing strong product base. According to TechCrunch, the company has struck again with the purchase of virtual assistant specialist VirtuOz; a company that recently made news with a sizeable deal with Windstream Corporation (WIN).Nuance is a leading provider of voice and language solutions for businesses and consumers around the world. Its technologies, applications, and services make the user experience more compelling by transforming the way people interact with devices and systems.Besides this potential purchase, the company announced several interesting deals at CES suggesting the future remains bright and the owner of the android mobile operating system isn't the threat that most fear.VirtuOz DealWhile the deal has yet to be officially confirmed, it does sound compelling as a combined offering with the existing Nina mobile virtual assistant developed by Nuance. TechCrunch didn't provide much in the way of financial impacts to actually calculate the impact of this deal. Most investors hope that it's a small tuck-in deal instead of one large enough to require additional debt financing.VirtuOz is a leading provider of intelligent virtual agents (IVAs) for online marketing, sales, and support. Windstream recently launched Wendy using VirtuOz technology. See below picture of the virtual assistant sure to attract users:The company claims to lead the market for successful use of intelligent virtual agents, having processed 166M conversations in 2011 for customers such as PayPal, Michelin, SFR, GameFly, and Symantec.Any investor listening to the recent Financial Analyst Day presentation might've gotten a heads-up on a potential deal in this area after management talked passionately about the future of virtual assistants.CES AnnouncementsThe company made several announcements at CES including a multi-year collaboration with ZTE on voice-enabled android-based phones and voice-enabled deals with carmakers Chrysler and Hyundai (OTCPK:HYMLF). While the later deals expand on numerous services already provided to the automotive industry, the ZTE deal further highlights the lack of impact from Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) voice recognition software as android carriers still prefer to build services around Nuance-enabled capabilities.Nuance also unveiled the Swype Living Language as a further evolution of the intuitive and intelligent keyboard. This new technology uses crowdsourcing to analyze new words and phrases in real-time, continuously updating our language dictionaries.Debt ConcernsWhile the company remains extremely profitable and cash flow positive, it has made numerous acquisitions via debt that place the balance sheet in an unfavorable situation. When fighting off the likes of Google and start-ups, the company will need a stronger balance sheet in the future.The net debt of nearly $900M isn't an issue yet in this low interest rate environment, though investors would prefer the company use the strong cash flow to pay down debt instead of making further deals, especially if the deal requires financing outside of existing cash on hand.Earnings IncreasesThe stock remains one of the cheapest technology companies around. With a cash flow run rate of around $600M based on Q3 and Q4 numbers, the stock trades at less than 12x those cash flows.The stock also trades at around 11x forward earnings estimates compared to a 5-year growth rate of 17% expected by analysts. Any time the growth rate exceeds the forward earnings multiple, the stock is considered cheap.In fact, analysts recently boosted earnings estimates for both fiscal years 2013 and 2014. See below table from Yahoo! Finance:ConclusionAfter reading the Financial Analyst Day transcript, the company has so many exciting initiatives that could lead to massive growth over the next 3-5 years. Investors appear to fear competition that isn't likely to exist. Nuance provides a very compelling investment thesis over the long term. Unless the company paid a ridiculous price for VirtuOz that will involve more debt, the stock should be owned as analyst estimates continue to rise for the next few years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in NUAN over the next 72 hours.

927661,25062,2012-10-16T15:25:26-04:00,,"Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) is not a patent troll. It is a patent dragon, having sued and bought out most of its competitors in voice recognition. Voice recognition is emerging as the next definitive interface, like the keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen were. If Nuance can continue to dominate the category, today's forward P/E of 13 will look downright insane in hindsight.Like patent trolls, Nuance would be hurt by stricter interpretation of software patents. Patents are coming under increasing scrutiny. Many economists are saying they should disappear altogether. The legal monopoly Nuance has built up through years of lawsuits and acquisitions could fade. This would leave it to compete entirely on technological merit and business relationships.The technology competition problem for Nuance is Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). A lot of money was made by shareholders in Google's IPO, but since the IPO more money has been made by shorting Google's victims, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Google enters an established industry with a cheaper, more efficient product, and often destroys more earnings than it creates. Good for consumers, bad for competitors - the latter group desperately turns to the FTC for protection.I salute Nuance shareholders for visualizing the revolutionary impact which voice recognition will have on user experiences. Here is a typical description of Nuance:It's just a matter of when...The key to success so far for Nuance investors has been patience. Ten years of investment have produced a triple. So I cannot knock bulls for saying it's just a matter of time. I cannot knock bulls for finding a smarter way to profit from Siri. But we have to consider what Google is good at. Google is good at emulating the human brain, and Google works to get better at it every day.Google already participates in cloud computing, voice recognition and translation, so Google already competes with Nuance in theory. But practically speaking, Google is just beginning to polish its product in this area. We're talking about the company that makes Priuses drive themselves, well enough to be allowed on public roads. We're talking about the search engine that was built on strict automation principles: Google's code takes the long route and is more robust for it. We're talking about the global leader in AI.Due to the strictly automated way Google's code in AI is built, a product might take some time to get off the ground, but once it does, it can gain momentum quite quickly.Basically, the human brain is too big to be reproduced by a computer, but some functions of the human brain, like voice recognition, could conceivably be reproduced by a really big computer.In order for voice recognition to replace text input, it has to allow almost perfect accuracy. Google's neural network approach shows potential here.It's all about engineering momentum. Google seems to be gaining momentum. Ironically, the momentum is in fixing 20% of the problems in an 80/20 situation.To Google, voice recognition is part of its broader ecosystem. For example: Project Glass, the next iPhone, includes voice recognition. This ecosystem strategy means Google will put a lot of resources into voice recognition, but can still offer it for free. Such ""spillover"" has famously diluted the pricing power of competitors like Microsoft. This situation would be similarly devastating for Nuance, especially without software patents to fall back on.Nuance is not Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Nuance cannot beat Google by being more cute. Voice recognition is a utility, not a fashion accessory like smartphones.Nuance has a demographic of smart investors. Normally this is a good thing. But remember that smart investors are quicker to sell when things go wrong.Conclusion: NUAN, despite a very reasonable forward multiple, appears to be an ""avoid"" until certainty arises in software patents and Google's voice recognition capabilities.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

The provider of voice and language solutions reported its fourth quarter results on Monday after the close.Fourth Quarter ResultsNuance Communications reported fourth quarter revenues of $468.8 million, up 27.7% on the year before. Revenues including lost revenues related to accounting treatments of acquisitions came in at $490.1 million, below analysts expectations of $497.5 million.The company reported GAAP net income of $117.6 million during the quarter, which compares to a loss of $5.1 million last year. Earnings per diluted share came in at $0.36 per share, compared to a loss of two cents last year. Non-GAAP income rose to $164.9 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. Non-GAAP earnings beat analysts consensus of $0.48 per share. Non-GAAP operating margins rose 110 basis points to 37.2%.CFO Tom Beadoin commented on the results:Detailed InformationHealthcareRevenues for the healthcare business came in at $189.3 million, up 33.6% on the year before. The unit reported strong new bookings including new contracts from Beaumont, Providence Healthcare, US Army Medical Command and the Veterans Health Administration.Mobile & ConsumerRevenues for the mobile and consumer business rose 32.7% to $143.2 million during the quarter. Nuance booked new customers including Acer, Amazon, Audi, Ford, Intel and Samsung, among others.EnterpriseRevenues in the enterprise division rose 11.5% to $89.1 million on a GAAP basis. The division reported growth on new contracts from Geico, Citigroup, Cigna and Telstra.ImagingRevenues for the imaging business rose 25.5% to $47.2 million on a GAAP basis, on new contracts from Amazon.com, Canon, Deloitte and EMC.OutlookFor the first quarter of its fiscal 2013, Nuance Communications guides for quarterly revenues of $484 to $500 million, ahead of analysts expectations of $472 million. Guided earning per share of $0.33-$0.37 per share, fall short of the consensus estimates of $0.41 per share.Nuance Communications guides for full year revenues of $2.17-$2.22 billion, ahead of consensus estimates of $2.04 billion. Annual guided earnings per share of $1.84-$1.94 came in ahead of analysts consensus of $1.84 per share.ValuationNuance Communications ended its fiscal 2012 with $1.13 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with roughly $2.12 billion in short and long term debt and convertible debentures, for a net debt position of roughly $1 billion.For its fiscal 2012, Nuance generated annual revenues of $1.65 billion. The company net earned $207.1 million, or $0.65 per diluted share.The market currently values Nuance Communications at $6.4 billion. This values the firm at 3.9 times 2012s annual revenues and 30-31 times annual earnings. Shares trade at 2.9 times annual revenues and merely 11 times next year's earnings.Nuance currently does not pay a dividend.Some Historical PerspectiveYear to date, shares of Nuance Communications have fallen roughly 18%. Shares started the year around $25 per share in January and swiftly rose to $30 in February of this year. Shares fell to lows of $20 in June after the company closed the acquisition of Transcend Services. Shares rose back to $25 in September of this year, currently exchanging hands around $21 per share.Language services are hot, thereby benefiting long term shareholders in Nuance Communications. Shares rose from lows of $4 in 2005 and swiftly rose to $20 in 2007. Shares fell back to lows of $8 during the financial crisis after which shares rose to all-time highs of $30 in the beginning of 2012. Between its fiscal 2009 and 2012, Nuance boosted revenues by approximately 75% to $1.65 billion. The company reported a modest loss of $19.4 million in 2009, followed by a $207.1 million profit this year.Investment ThesisNuance's fourth quarter was decent, accompanied by a strong outlook for its fiscal 2013. Despite the strong revenue growth, and even stronger earnings growth, the valuation seems very appealing at just 11 times 2013s guided annual earnings.There has been a lot of debate regarding the company's future fate. Some commentators argue that a large player like Google (GOOG) or Apple (AAPL) might make a bid for the company. The former company has announced its intentions in the field of artificial intelligence and develops own speech and translation services. Apple's Siri uses Nuance's technology already. Nuance's current market capitalization, even when including a significant control premium, is very modest for these players.Others point out that Nuance's defense of patents might result in a loss of competitiveness over time. Furthermore, the emergence of other technologies might erode the protection of Nuance's patents. The company boosted its patent portfolio by making acquisitions and lawsuits in recent years.While Nuance looks very appealing to me at today's valuation, based on its recent growth trajectory, I refrain from investing. It remains too hard for me to make an accurate estimate of the company's fate with regards to future technological developments.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1028321,22148,2012-11-26T11:33:24-05:00,,"Though Nuance Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:NUAN) remains relatively obscure in the investment world, most technology investors know that it powers the Siri voice recognition for the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. Typical of Apple suppliers, the associated stock performs poorly.The company is a leading provider of voice and language solutions for businesses and consumers around the world. Its technologies, applications and services make the user experience more compelling by transforming the way people interact with devices and systems.The company reported strong Q4 2012 results that handily beat estimates with earnings coming in ahead of the $0.48 analyst estimates by $0.03.Q4 2012 HighlightsThe company reported the following highlights for Q4:With cash flow from operations up 45%, the company is showing strong execution. The company is benefiting from increased demand in mobile phones, automobiles, televisions and healthcare applications. Design wins and partnerships with Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung will propel growth in the future.Q1 GuidanceThe original guidance for Q4 was on the low end of expectations when the company reported back in August. Typical of the company lately, the actual numbers beat the high end of the $0.46 to $0.50 estimate. Now the company has provided the following guidance that disappointed the market:While the Q1 revenue number is in line with analyst's numbers, the company guided considerably below earnings estimates of $0.41. Higher development costs are cutting into earnings as the company builds for 2014 revenue growth. Interestingly, the full year numbers were above expectations at that time of $1.84. Analysts have now raised guidance for 2013 to $1.89. The recent history suggests the numbers might hit $2 by the time fiscal 2013 is over. In fact, don't be surprised if Q1 doesn't end up around the previous target of $0.41.Debt ConcernsWhile the company remains extremely profitable and cash flow positive, it has made numerous acquisitions via debt that place the balance sheet in an unfavorable situation. When fighting off the likes of Google and start-ups, the company will need a strong balance sheet.Clearly the net debt of nearly $900M isn't an issue in the low interest rate environment, though the company might want to start showing that the strong cash flow will lead to reduced debt levels. The below chart shows the constant net debt position of the company:NUAN Long Term Debt data by YChartsStock PerformanceThe stock performance over the last 2 years remains disappointing considering the growth of voice-enabled services. The company just reported 32% cash flow growth for the last 12 months yet the stock is virtually flat.Though the stock attempted to break out in September, it is now down to $21 again. This level is virtually where it traded for most of 2007 prior to the financial crisis and now forms a triple bottom.2-Year Chart - Nuance CommunicationsGoogle ThreatA huge risk exists that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has developed a better speech recognition service via Google Voice Search. While it isn't designed to be a virtual assistant such as Siri, the app has many examples where users think it provides a better voice search experience. Just last week, Slate pronounced Google Voice Search as the technology about to fulfill Apple's broken promise of talking to technology.Farhad Manjoo sees both services as flawed, but Voice Search is the most useful in his opinion. According to him, the ""Knowledge Graph"" provides Google with a dynamic database that better keeps up with the flexible and constantly evolving world.ValuationThe stock is currently one of the cheapest technology companies around. With a cash flow run rate of around $600M based on Q3 and Q4 numbers, the stock trades at less than 11x those cash flows.The stock also trades at less than 10x forward earnings estimates compared to a 5-year growth rate of 17% expected by analysts. Any time the growth rate exceeds the forward earnings multiple, the stock is considered cheap.Using either metric, this hot technology company trades at a discount to the market showing that investors clearly place a huge discount on the stock due to the risks from Google.ConclusionAfter reading the earnings report and listening to the conference call, it is difficult to understand the reason for another earnings selloff. Sure the Q1 earnings guidance was low, but the stock is very cheap compared to full year guidance and expected 2014 growth.The new products suggest the company has the ability for strong growth over the next few years. The demand for language-enhanced technologies appears to only be expanding in contrast to the stock price. The threat from Google remains real especially in the mobile sector that accounts for roughly 30% of revenue. The company has dominant positions in the Healthcare and Enterprise sectors that appear unlikely impacted by the current Google efforts.The stock offers an attractive entry point right around these levels. If the stock breaks below $20 and definitely below $19, it will technically be broken. At these levels though, investors can make a gamble on the technology with a clear exit strategy.Disclosure: I am long AAPL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1058771,24279,2012-12-11T18:23:57-05:00,,"On December 6th, Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) held their Analyst/Investor Day Presentation, and shed a lot of light on their prolific catalogue of products for 2013 and beyond. Artificial intelligence. Voice biometrics. Collaborative filtering. Speech recognition. Predictive models. Tech-savvy terminology like this is peppered throughout the transcript. Although Nuance has established a beachhead in voice recognition technologies, CEO Paul Ricci and his cohorts believe there is a paradigm shift currently underway. This was the crux of the presentation.Just like investing, speech recognition is less than a perfect science. It's a complex and multidimensional business. Nuance is arguably the top company in the sector. If we peel back the layers to examine the behind-the-scenes processing of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) voice generated Siri platform, you'll find Nuance Communications at work. It's undetermined whether iPhone aficionados have completely bought into the technology, but in increments, the science is improving with the advent of intelligent systems. I utilize their Dragon Dictation application on my iPhone, and for lack of a better expression, it works.Nuance is engaged in three primary markets: mobile & consumer, enterprise self-service, and healthcare. Although I'll be touching on the medical and corporate call center aspects of Nuance's business, the primary thrust of this article will focus on the mobile and consumer division. This is because although all three segments are thriving, it's the mobile and consumer space that is growing the fastest, and may elevate the company to elite status.Right off the bat, CEO Ricci states that Nuance has a privileged position across most of the leading smartphone platforms in the world. The company is very excited to have cemented a series of agreements with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), and they are going to extrapolate that smartphone leadership position to other connected devices. Most notably televisions, desktops, laptops, tablets, and automobiles. Mr. Ricci expounds on this:This computer science is called ""Deep Belief Networking"", where neural networks are applied to speech recognition and other pattern-recognition problems. In essence, algorithms are utilized to synthesize all of the user inputs on a communications device. Previously, it was cost prohibitive, and the technology just wasn't there. You needed a mainframe to crunch the numbers. However, with cloud computing becoming the norm, as opposed to an outlier, the technology is moving forward. Nuance is putting a full-court press on the science to maximize user experience on multiple devices.Vlad Sejnoha is one of Mr. Ricci's go-to guys and explains the process:What's happening is that as more and more of your devices are connected to the cloud, the sample size of what your inputs are become much larger, and enables not only the end user, but multiple users to improve the process. This includes not only speech recognition capabilities, but other input procedures like manual data input on the keyboard. Mr. Sejnoha goes on to say:This is not a half-baked idea. However, we all know that human behavior is not very logical, and although Nuance Communications is making improvements to previous input technologies, instantaneous gratification may not be in the cards for awhile. You still may be frustrated with some of Siri's capabilities. It's a slow motion process. Let's examine the company's three business segments individually to determine what is in store for 2013.Mobile and ConsumerMike Thompson is the General Manager of the mobile division. Here are some bullet points as to what the company's strong assets are for their most visible division for the next few years.The mobile and consumer division has growth between 25% and 30% each year for the past four years. It's important to note that back in 2009, they had no connectivity revenue at all.EnterpriseRobert Weideman is in charge of the enterprise area of operations. Think call centers, or, automated customer service solutions. As Mr. Weideman noted: ""You don't want to frustrate customers with speech recognition that doesn't know what you're saying. You also don't want a robotic voice talking back to you."". I thought it was interesting that 60% of all phone calls to contact centers emanated from mobile devices.Because of global partners like Avaya, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Huawei and Genesys, Nuance is able to expand their language portfolios on a worldwide basis. Natural Language Understanding and voice biometrics help the company maintain a lead in international automated customer service. Last year the division achieved 12% revenue growth. Seven percent of that growth was organic.Health CareNuance has established an indisputable market-leading franchise in front-end speech and capture. With physicians, this dovetails into adapting Dragon Medical to take advantage of government subsidies from the HITECH Act. The HITECH Act is part of the US Government Stimulus Plan where almost $30 billion has been slotted to reimburse physicians and hospitals for adopting electronic health records (EHR) in their practices. With a current minuscule market penetration of 10%, the US Government's goal is to equip 90% of doctors with electronic health records by 2019.Janet Dillone heads the medical division of Nuance. She reports that 2012 had very strong double-digit organic growth, a top-line of $670 million, and a three year CAGR of 20%. This was helped by strong relationships with Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), the largest healthcare IT company in the world, and Epic, one of the fastest growing healthcare IT companies globally.ConclusionThis was a dense and meaty report. Far too much information to be effectively covered in a few short paragraphs. Nuance's public profile has recently been elevated with the inclusion of Siri in the newer iPhones. It initially goosed the stock, but it has since come down to more reasonable valuations.Tim Cook, Steve Jobs' hand-picked successor at Apple recently nixed Google's mapping application, so continued relationships with Apple are not guaranteed. However, my take is that because of the public outrage from jettisoning the Google app, Apple will probably stick with the technology leaders going forward for native applications. Nuance certainly fits that bill.I think the planets are aligned for Nuance to make a multi-year run. Just utilizing regression analysis, Nuance looks primed to continue its slow and steady ascent on the stock charts. The going rate for the equity is $22, very close to its 52 week low of $19. The 52 week high was $31. Crunching the numbers courtesy of Yahoo Finance, we can see that its projected 5 year CAGR is 16.5%, and the current P/E is 11.5. On a PEG Ratio metric, that is a bargain.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in NUAN over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
581851,23407,2012-05-11T14:24:53-04:00,,"Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) may be best known for its Dragon Naturally Speaking software, which helps PCs understand voice commands. But investors should be more focused on its healthcare and customer care products and its position as the go-to leader in voice controlled consumer electronics.I've written before about Nuance's Siri connection with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). In the FYQ1 conference call back in February, Nuance's CEO Paul Ricci cited unprecedented demand for its solutions. Likely, thanks to Siri's revolutionizing how consumers interact with their phone.This demand propelled Nuance's FYQ2 revenue 22% higher to $390.3 million. It also provided Nuance with enough volume and pricing power to drive earnings up 34% to $0.43.The quarter proved strong enough for Nuance's CFO Tom Beaudoin to use ""unprecedented"" again to describe interest in Nuance's voice solutions. And, for Mr. Ricci to describe interest in mobile and consumer devices as ""intense"" thanks to competitors ""racing"" to implement voice.Sales were up big across all segments.More than ever, medical services are digitizing healthcare records, providing significant opportunities for voice driven solutions tied to updating and accessing information. As a result, healthcare - which is Nuance's biggest market - saw revenue jump 23.9% last quarter to $149.9 million as license sales increased. As Nuance's products become better at understanding clinical language, demand will continue higher.In its mobile and consumer segment, phones, autos, tablets and televisions are increasingly embracing voice control. This helped sales increase 22.8% to $115 million. As voice gets deployed in more and more devices, Nuance will benefit from recurring revenue tied to usage. This will really pay off as innovation allows the technology to be deployed globally.Siri inspired demand helped Nuance ink new deals in the quarter, including what was described as a material contract with a leading consumer electronics OEM for mobile and ""entertainment"" devices. Overall, the company noted mobile and consumer bookings were significantly better than any of the previous 12 quarters.In Nuance's enterprise segment, which produces a solid stream of future service and maintenance revenue, voice recognition remains a great way for companies to manage customer care. Growing demand for customer self service voice products helped segment sales grow 23.5% to $91.4 million.Finally, the company's eCopy ShareScan products, which capture data from paper and input it into business apps, helped imaging segment sales climb 41.6% to $61.3 million. Bigger deals tied to enterprise networks fueled the growth.All this strength supported a boost to FY13 guidance.The company now sees revenue of $1.72-$1.76 billion in FY13 - above analysts' $1.71 billion forecast. This will help Nuance add to its $976.8 million cash position, providing it with plenty of room to continue to acquire complementary technology and young up-starts, such as its recent acquisitions of Transcend and Vlingo.Given summer is historically a weak period for Nuance shares - it's only finished July higher than it starts May in two of the past 10 years - any weakness may prove a great opportunity to buy ahead of stronger end of year sales.Disclosure: I am long NUAN."
579291,24936,2012-05-10T16:20:38-04:00,,"By Steven EdwardsWhat is language worth? Think about the difference between a chimpanzee and a person - only about 2%, DNA-wise. Physically, the chimp is stronger and has prehensile feet. He can certainly climb trees better, to gather the high-hanging fruit, but nevertheless, the chimp is an endangered species while humans rule the earth.Language is what allows us to cooperate one with another. Language is what allows our minds to conceptualize. Language is what allows us to gather information.Machines are much better than us, when it comes to manipulating information, but despite their awesome speed at computing, they haven't been awfully smart. Until recently. By now, unless you're stranded on an asteroid somewhere, you have come into contact with Siri (Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface), the voicebot in Apple's iPhone 4S. You may have also caught the act of Watson, the Jeopardy-playing computer.Probably neither Siri nor Watson could pass a Turing test, wherein a judge tries to distinguish a computer from a human. But they are getting close, and they will only get better with time. Already, Siri was the subject of a Big Bang Theory episode where one of the nerds fell in love with her. Think about how many proposals of marriage that Siri handles every day. Does she understand what is really contemplated in that proposal? Does she get the joke? Philosophers can argue about what a machine understands. But as long as the machine is interacting with us in a way that we understand, what difference does it make?Though Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will not officially acknowledge it, the speech recognition software underlying Siri comes from Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN). Siri isn't all that Nuance does. It sells the Dragon voice dictation systems that turn voice into text. The company has applied this technology to medical dictation, so that doctors can make comments on their patients' charts without having to resort to the keyboard or expensive medical transcriptions services. The company also supplies text into voice services for mobile phones. Its automated voice turns up in GPS devices and services and of course, on call routing services.Nuance is also collaborating with IBM (NYSE:IBM) to team Watson analytical capabilities to Nuance's voice and clinical language features in the healthcare industry.Of course Nuance isn't the only business that is involved in voice recognition. Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) System Seven operating system can be set up to respond to voice commands. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is involved with voice search and text/voice conversions. But these are still pretty primitive compared to Siri.Once upon a time, there was a whole host of small companies working on natural language processing. Nuance has achieved its dominance in the field the old fashioned way; they bought out the competition. Nuance, in its present form, was created when ScanSoft, a firm originally dedicated to optical character recognition, bought out Nuance in 2005, and kept the name for the surviving firm. Prior to that, it had acquired the Speech and Language division of Lernout and Hauspie (which brought the Dragon dictation software) and in 2001, and Nuance's primary competitor, SpeechWorks in 2003. Since then, they have taken over Dictaphone Corp., Mobile Voice Control, Inc., Voice Signal Technologies, Phillips Speech Recognition Systems GmBH, Jott Networks, Spinvox, MacSpeech, PerSay, SVOX, Loquendo, Vlingo, and most recently, Transcend Services, among others. Most of these transactions have been small by Silicon Valley standards, but have resulted in Nuance controlling much of the intellectual property surrounding speech recognition and processing.So what is it all worth? Until recently, Nuance had only rung up a stream of losses. Consequently, its current price-to-earnings ratio of about 160 seems a little rich. It missed earnings expectations in its latest quarter, but going forward, analysts see the company earning $1.60 per share in 2012 and $1.82 in 2013. Its current price of 24 doesn't seem all that out of line for this techy stock tied to the Apple phenomenon, at about 13 times 2013 earnings. The price-to-book ratio is about 3.0, but the book value is stacked with intangibles, given the history of acquisitions. How do you value all the speech recognition patents? Nobody really knows.But science fiction aficionados will appreciate that Siri and her clones will inhabit all machines going forward. You will talk to your house and your car and maybe your coffee machine and they will talk back to you. The technology is now at hand for a C3PO type robot, complete with fussy English accent if you want it.Of 19 analysts covering Nuance, 15 rate it as a buy or outperform, while only one rates it a sell. I think it is a screaming buy, mainly because Google, Apple and Microsoft are sitting on mountains of cash. The market cap of Nuance is over $7 billion, but that is not out of reach for any of these three. I can't think of a better acquisition than Nuance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
791901,22148,2012-08-08T17:30:52-04:00,,"Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) has long been known as the technology that powers the Siri voice recognition for the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. Now the company is moving into the mobile virtual assistant area with the new Nina app technology. With a flat stock performance, Siri has done very little for the stock price. Will Nina make shareholders happier?The company is a leading provider of voice and language solutions for businesses and consumers around the world. Its technologies, applications, and services make the user experience more compelling by transforming the way people interact with devices and systems.The company reported strong Q3 2012 results that handily beat estimates with earnings coming in ahead of the $0.40 analyst estimates by $0.05.Q3 HighlightsWith cash flow from operations up 41%, the company is showing strong execution. The company is benefiting from increased demand in mobile phones, automobiles, televisions, and healthcare applications.Q4 GuidanceThe guidance for Q4 was on the low end especially in the revenue category. The company just beat estimates by $0.05 suggesting either some pull forward of revenue or the company being too conservative considering the bullish tone of the conference call. Either way, investors shouldn't be too focused on the literal numbers provided.Nina - Mobile App Virtual AssistantThe company introduced Nina, the virtual assistant for mobile customer service apps, on Monday. This technology gives companies the ability to quickly add speech-based virtual assistant options to existing iOS and Android mobile apps.Nina combines Nuance speech recognition, Text-to-Speech (TTS), voice biometrics, and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) technology hosted in the cloud to deliver an interactive user experience that not only understands what is said, but also can identify who is saying it.AllThingsD has a good review of the product noting that the voice-based biometrics could improve security of mobile banking apps.Nina also provides the ability for the company to acquire enterprise customers and diversify away from the major phone makers.Debt OfferingThe company has proposed to raise $600M at attractive rates in order to pursue accretive acquisitions in the future. This deal would raise total debt to $2B and net debt to $900M until spent.Stock PerformanceThe stock performance over the last 5 years is rather shocking considering the growth of voice-enabled services. Though the stock hit $31 earlier this year, it is now down to $21. This level is virtually where it traded for most of 2007 prior to the financial crisis.5 Year Chart - Nuance CommunicationsNUAN Total Return Price data by YChartsRiskThe risk remains that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) will be able to develop a competing or even better product for Android phones. Or Apple will do the same for the iOS mobile devices. Or even worse that voice-enabled technologies will become a commodity item on any device whether mobile phones or in medical applications.ValuationThe stock is currently one of the cheapest technology companies around. With a cash flow run rate of around $600M based on Q3 numbers, the stock only trades at 11x those cash flows.The stock also only trades at 12x forward earnings estimates compared to a 5 year growth rate of 17% expected by analysts. Any time the growth rate exceeds the forward earnings multiple, the stock is considered cheap.Using either metric, this hot technology company trades at a discount to the market showing that investors clearly place a huge discount on the stock due to the risks.ConclusionAfter reading the earnings report and listening to the conference call, it is difficult to understand the reason for the 3.5% selloff today. Sure the revenue guidance was low, but the stock is very cheap.The new products suggest the company has the ability for strong growth over the next few years. The demand for language enhanced technologies appears to only be expanding in contrast to the stock price.The stock offers an attractive entry point right around $21.Disclosure: I am long AAPL.Additional disclosure: Please consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions."
884551,35411,2012-09-24T11:25:52-04:00,,"The voice recognition marketplace is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (OTC:CAGR) of 8.8% between 2010 and 2015. Meanwhile, the subsection of this market for voice recognition software solutions is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.8%. At these rates, the overall size of the market is expected to reach 58.4 billion by 2015. And make no mistake about it: these growth rates are occurring at a time when the economy is stagnating. Imagine the growth of this sector in a robust economic recovery!At the very center of this thriving and potential $60 billion marketplace? Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN), a company based in Burlington, Massachusetts that focuses on speech technologies. It has come to dominate the market for voice solutions through research, growth, and an aggressive acquisition strategy. Most recently it purchased Ditech Networks to continue improving its mobile voice offerings.Central to my investing thesis in this company is the barrier to entry, which is centered around NUAN's intellectual property (IP). Voice recognition technology is not easily developed. And, NUAN has not been shy about protecting its IP. Its voice-technology related patent stable is formidable. It holds 274 granted voice patents and 104 pending. Interestingly, four are specifically related to SIRI and some to ""voice activated"" search commands, more on which below.In a professional capacity, I have been using speech-to-text software for seven years. The software translates my speech at a fast conversational rate to document text, including punctuation. It also controls my computer in opening or closing programs. I even ""tell"" my microphone (which is perched on top of my center monitor) to ""go to sleep"" or ""wake up"" so that it does not record or respond to extraneous noise when I am on the phone. I have used PowerScribe and a host of Dragon products (both from NUAN) as well as a number of non-NUAN speech products. I can promise you that after you ""train"" the computer to your voice, the NUAN products are first-rate. I dictate with a 98% accuracy rate. But such accuracy does not come cheap: my latest NUAN program cost approximately $1600.I like to think about the price of some of these advanced programs and the occasional complaints from users (i.e. consumer complaints about SIRI) as paralleling the early days of the PC market. Everyone thought early PCs were neat and corporations were early adopters. But, it took significant technological advancements and a couple decades for the PC to really penetrate the average family's home and add value. I think the voice recognition market of today is analogous to the PC market in the early-mid 1980s.When we reflect on the consumer segment of this business, it is only recently that this voice activated technology has begun to make inroads into the consumer experience. SIRI on the Apple iPhone (NASDAQ:AAPL) was perhaps the most high profile case, but when you look around you see a plethora of products coming to market with basic voice activated features (from cars, to phones, to tablets, to navigation systems). I imagine that in 10-15 years, voice activation technology will have penetrated into a much larger number of consumer electronics.Let's review. We have a core voice recognition market growing at nearly 10% per year. We are in the early stages of mass consumer penetration for this technology, which could increase that growth rate well beyond expectations. And (lucky for us!) we have a dominant company in that market with NUAN. Not to be discounted is also the high barrier to entry of the voice patents and speech kernels that NUAN has been developing and honing for more than a decade.You would think that such a company would trade at a sky-high valuation, right? Perhaps something like Amazon's 300+ P/E multiple? Nope! Wrong! Here are the stats for NUAN:I don't like to buy companies solely based on buy-out potential. However, I will say that NUAN seems like a perfect takeover target for any large technology company that wants to continue expanding its consumer voice offerings. In particular, I feel that AAPL will continue to refine SIRI and move voice solutions to its tablet and computers. At a $12 billion acquisition price, NUAN would be worth $38/share (more than 50% upside). An acquiring business could spin off the corporate services and healthcare businesses into a subsidiary and take advantage of the voice technology in consumer and mobile applications.So, what could go wrong? Well, voice technology could have slower than anticipated penetration into consumer products. Like SIRI has shown us, for many people voice technology is still a novelty. It's not quite reliable enough to gain widespread use. We need continued improvement in the technology for voice technology to jump from a niche field to a ubiquitous product. For others, NUAN acquisition-induced debt is an issue. However, I think this has been money well spent, and its debt-to-equity ratio is still conservative. The final point critics have against NUAN is that it is expensive. However, I have to disagree. When you take into account the expected and potential growth, I think it trades at a very reasonable risk-reward multiple.For all these reasons, I expect NUAN to outperform the market over the next decade. With reasonable assumptions in the growth of Voice technology, I think it can grow its stock price 15% per year annually over the next decade (assuming it remains independent). And, if it gets acquired, even better for us!Disclosure: I am long NUAN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

809201,23407,2012-08-15T13:35:57-04:00,,"Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone's Siri is infinitely more well known than Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN), the voice recognition company powering the famous virtual assistant. And that's okay with Nuance, which is enjoying double digit growth customizing voice solutions across healthcare, consumer and enterprise clients.I last updated readers on Nuance back in May. In the piece I noted, ""Given summer is historically a weak period for Nuance shares - it only finished July higher than it starts May in two of the past 10 years - any weakness may prove a great opportunity to buy ahead of stronger end of year sales.""So, with a fresh EPS report to dissect and exiting yet another tough seasonal period for returns, how likely is it shareholders will be rewarded when tailwinds return?CEO Paul Ricci isn't shy about touting Nuance's opportunities.I noted in previous articles Mr. Ricci's use of ""unprecedented"" in describing demand. In reporting FYQ3 numbers, Mr. Ricci didn't back away from this view, saying in this week's earnings call ""in previous quarters we have indicated that the pace of the market activity suggest to us an unprecedented level of interest in our solutions.. This remains our perspective.""He also kept his lingo in line with last quarter in saying mobile and consumer remain ""intense"" and OEMs continue to race toward implementing virtual assistants.Of course, it's to be expected the CEO will be the company's top cheerleader. The real proof comes from the numbers. And they seem to back Mr. Ricci up.Top line sales were $431.7 million, up 31.3% YoY in FYQ3 - a fourth consecutive increase in year-over-year growth. GAAP net income nearly doubled to $0.25 while non GAAP came in at $0.45, up from $0.35 a year ago. Operating margin was 36.1%, up from 35.4% and cash from operations rose 41.4% to $141.5 million.Q2 growth was driven by healthcare and consumer.Given how much attention is being paid to voice driven consumer devices, it probably surprises some readers to learn Nuance's biggest segment is healthcare.The company's voice dictation products generated $184.5 million in revenue last quarter, up 32.4% from the prior year. And the trend is likely to continue as everyone from pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) and electronic medical technology company Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN) embrace voice driven solutions.Although healthcare is Nuance's largest revenue generator, consumer is closing in quickly.Despite sluggish Apple iPhone sales last quarter, Nuance's consumer segment saw revenue increase 42.2% to $132.4 million as royalty revenue climbed, more OEM's incorporated voice and usage milestones kicked in.While Siri is the highest profile voice assistant, Nuance powered systems are deployed in 70 Android mobile devices, including those made by Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). Solutions are increasingly being built into autos, such as those from Chrysler, Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY) and Toyota (NYSE:TM) too.And voice will make its first significant presence in television this holiday season. The TV market remains huge, with 247.7 million units sold in 2011. Given the size of the market and excitement surrounding voice controlled content, Nuance expects TV to add upside as early as next year.Outside of its two largest segments, the company also sells customer driven voice solutions to enterprise customers. Such sales increased 6.6% to $74.5 million last quarter. And it provides image capturing systems too, which generated $56.8 million in sales, up 32.7% from last year.It's pretty unlikely consumer companies will suddenly stop competing with one another. Instead, they'll continue to embrace next generation technology. Just as smart devices embraced voice following Apple's Siri, you can expect other markets will see a similar rush to next generation features. Given such a backdrop, Mr. Ricci's enthusiasm seems warranted.Disclosure: I am long NUAN."

On April 26, the company preannounced great Q2 results that sent the shares higher by about 10%. Since then, the stock has given back nearly all of its gains. The valuation metrics come in mixed on the stock but lean towards undervalued with the trailing valuation metrics suggesting that the stock is overvalued while analysts and on a forward P/E valuation the stock comes in undervalued.The company is going through a little bit of a transition after its acquisition of Transcend that may be causing some hesitancy on investors' parts. With Transcend, Nuance will accelerate access to and expand its customer base within the small- to mid-size hospital market, which comprises approximately 90% of hospitals in the U.S. and increasingly demands cost effective, voice-enabled, clinical documentation solutions to achieve Meaningful Use and the transition to ICD-10. Below is an in depth look at the valuation metrics and stock chart.Valuation: Nuance Communications' trailing 5 year valuation metrics suggest that the stock is overvalued at these levels as all of the metrics are above their respective 5 year averages. Nuance Communications' current P/B ratio is 2.9 and it has averaged 2.5 over the past 5 years with a high of 4.1 and low of 1.4. Nuance Communications' current P/S ratio is 5.2 and it has averaged 4.5 over the past 5 years with a high of 5.9 and low of 2.8.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow Nuance Communications is $30. That is upside of 30% from today's stock price of $23.4 and suggests that the stock has room to run from these levels.Forward Valuation: Nuance Communications is currently trading at about $23 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $1.81 next year, an earnings increase of 11% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 12.9. Taking a look at the company's publicly traded comparisons will give us a better idea of the stock's relative valuation. Informatica (NASDAQ:INFA) is currently trading at about $47 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $1.89 next year, an earnings increase of 17% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 24.8. ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS) is currently trading at about $62 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $3.2 next year, an earnings increase of 12% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 19.2. VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN) is currently trading at about $41 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $2.19 next year, an earnings increase of 18% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 18.5. The mean forward P/E of Nuance Communications' competitors is 20.8 which suggests that Nuance Communications is undervalued relative to its publicly traded competitors.Earnings Estimates: Nuance Communications has beat EPS estimates 3 times in the past 4 quarters. The company's EPS figures have come in between -2 cents and 1 cents from consensus estimates or about -5.6% to 3.2% from analyst estimates. The company's earnings come been relatively close to consensus estimates which suggests that analysts are good at projecting the company's results and share upside from earnings surprises will be limited.Price Action: Nuance Communications is up 5.4% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500, which is up 1.9%. Looking at the technicals, the stock is currently below its 50 day moving average, which sits at $25.00 and below its 200 day moving average, which sits at $23.76.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

532721,23407,2012-04-26T15:49:41-04:00,,"The brightest light in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) quarterly earnings report came from sales of its iPhone 4S, whose most defining feature is the voice recognition assistant Siri. The phone's eye popping growth, particularly in Asia where it launched in January, was likely behind Nuance's (NASDAQ:NUAN) upside guidance issued on April 26th.Of course, consumer sales to OEMs like Apple still account for less revenue than Nuance's healthcare division, which is riding a wave higher in medical transcription. But, voice driven consumer electronics are increasingly important to Nuance's growth story.Following the launch of the 4S last fall, phones at Nuance were likely lit up by manufacturers looking to close the gap with Apple. In Nuance's Q4 earnings call, CEO Paul Ricci described interest in its solutions as ""unprecedented"". For Apple , the same description could easily apply to the iPhone.The engine behind SiriAnd, while suppliers like Nuance can't refer directly to Apple, the company was born out of DARPA funding to SRI International, just like Siri.Possibly the best smoking gun related to Nuance providing the engine behind Siri comes from an SRI press release in 2010. In it SRI writes, ""Siri has also partnered with Nuance Communications to power its robust speech recognition capabilities - the same technology behind the successful Dragon Dictation and Dragon Search and Apps for iPhone"".Sales growth is driving earnings higherApple has long wielded its purchasing power might among suppliers, pressuring margins at players including Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Broadcom (BRCM) and Triquint (TQNT). However, unlike chipmakers there are few alternatives for voice recognition. This gives Nuance a bit wider moat than some of the other members of Apple's supply chain.Nuance expects FYQ2 earnings per share to reach $0.42-0.43, above the street's $0.38 guess. Revenue should reach $416-$418 million, which is also nicely higher than the $402.95 analysts expect. The company's CFO, Tom Beaudoin cited 14% organic revenue growth and strong enterprise sales behind the growth. The guidance is also solidly above Nuance's February projection of $0.36-0.40 per share in earnings on $395-415 million in sales. We'll get the full report on May 10th.Future voice driven products offer growthAnd, while Siri didn't find its way into the new iPad, a pared down version of voice recognition did. It's likely Nuance is behind that too. If it is, it isn't a stretch to assume Apple has its eyes set on a fully fledged Siri in its 2013 iPad update.But, Nuance isn't limiting itself to computers, phones and tablets. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January, the company rolled out its Dragon TV offering. The product brings voice to television, allowing companies to build voice and touch apps specifically geared toward video. This offering would seem to dovetail nicely with future iTV products - a hobby whose mention was conspicuously absent from Apple's conference call.Disclosure: I am long NUAN, QCOM."
820581,24154,2012-08-21T16:13:24-04:00,,"The 6,000 people workforce at Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) are, in one way or another, behind most of the voice technology products that consumers and business use each day.Think iPhone, Siri, Chrysler, DirecTV, LG Technologies, etc. Think call centers, healthcare voice systems, voice activated products, etc. That is Nuance, somewhat quietly functioning as an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) behind today's leading voice recognition products. The company designs and develops speech technology products for customer service call centers, the healthcare sector, and, of course, mobile devices.The Burlington, Mass., company's 2011 sales were approximately $1.4 billion, and management recently announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2012 showing a 31.3% increase in revenue ($431.7 million over $328.9 million). Net income ($79.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared with $41.6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. Operating margin was up slightly (36.1%, up from 35.4%).On an extremely positive note, cash flow from operations was up 41.4% ($141.5 million over $100.1 million). Nuance ended the third quarter of fiscal 2012 with a balance of cash and cash equivalents of $539.6 million. Their market Cap is 7.22B, with their stock price trading at around $24 with a 52wk Range of 16.32 - 31.15.Extremely competent management and acquisition prowess has enabled the company to grow significantly since the late 90's into a powerful firm with significant partners with sales representation in more than 70 countries. Chairman and CEO Paul Ricci has, since 1999, strung together strategic acquisitions and business alliances that have transformed the company into the world's leading provider of speech solutions.So with strong quarterly and annual financial performances, a good future with contracts and relationships with some of the tech industries biggest players, technology that is deep rooted and growing in industry, and strong patents, what is next for Nuance Communications?Perhaps to become part of Apple. Reportedly, Apple has approximately $120 billion of cash on hand, and that continues to accumulate at about 4 billion per month. Apple's stock closed recently at $665.15 a share, making their market capitalization at $623.5 billion, the most valuable company in the world, at present and to date.Again, Nuanc 's current market cap is 7.22B. Apple could pay a premium of $10 billion and not put a dent in its cash reserves. Furthermore, at its current cash accumulation rate, it would recover that cash investment in less than three months. At present, Apple licenses the use of its voice technology Siri from Nuance. It's becoming a more important aspect of what Apple does with its products. It is an understatement to say that speech recognition technology has a bright and profitable future.From a competitive standpoint, if Apple doesn't buy Nuance, someone else with significant cash on hand could. Someone like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), increasingly becoming the chief rival of Apple, specifically on the mobile device front, where the likes of speech recognition lives. Apple has quietly continued to purchase technology and companies throughout the last 18 month period. Its latest was AuthenTec, (NASDAQ:AUTH) a mobile security company, for $356 million in cash, pocket change for Apple.Nuance matters. They are an important company to the top leaders in the technology field across the board. Their significance is growing every quarter, with every new product release that incorporates their technology into new products. It is likely they are on the acquisition target list of multiple firms. A bidding war could erupt if they are put in play, driving up the share price significantly. Good for shareholders, not so for the acquiring firm.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The deal is  Nuance’s largest purchase since its last significant medical acquisition  in April 2008, when it paid $363m for eScription. Nuance had earlier  acquired Transcend competitor Webmedx for an undisclosed amount in July  2011. Each of these transactions bolsters Nuance’s healthcare division.Nuance is handing over $29.50 per share in cash for Transcend,  valuing the target’s equity at $313m (Transcend had no debt and about  $13m in cash at the end of 2011, so the enterprise value is slightly  lower at $300m). The per-share offer is a 40% premium to Transcend’s  closing share price the day before the deal was announced and, with the  exception of a brief uptick in July 2011, the highest price Transcend’s  shares have seen since 1996. However, the valuation for the company is  lower than a precedent transaction. Using enterprise value, Nuance is  valuing Transcend at only 2.4x trailing sales. Meanwhile, its pickup of  eScription, an SaaS provider of voice recognition and transcription  services, was valued at a loftier 8.1x trailing sales. Some explanation  for the discrepancy is the premium given to SaaS companies and  difference in margins. EScription had an equally lofty operating margin  of 39% compared with Transcend’s 16%. Further, Transcend’s SaaS platform  was relatively nascent, having hit the market just last summer.The Transcend buy follows a record year of dealmaking that saw Nuance  announce eight transactions worth nearly $400m. But the buying spree  may not be over, given the continuing consolidation in the transcription  and voice recognition sector. Even MedQuist (OTCPK:MEDH), a relatively infrequent  acquirer and Transcend’s chief competitor, bought three companies in the  past two years, including M*Modal for $130m in July 2011."

It's hard to imagine Apple isn't planning Siri integration in both products. But, more importantly, competitors are eager to close the technology gap with Apple - suggesting phones are ringing more loudly at Nuance since Siri's debut.Last week, investor's gave a collective yawn when Nuance reported fourth quarter mobile and consumer sales rose 23% from last year. Speculators bid shares up 13% in the two weeks ahead of earnings, only to take shares similarly lower following the company's seemingly lackluster earnings.But for investors willing to look beyond the whipsaw, a much more bullish story emerges. Sales across Nuance's healthcare, enterprise and imaging business all increased. And while mobile is an increasingly important contributor to revenue growth, the company's biggest segment by sales remains healthcare, which is undergoing a seismic shift away from manila folders.The bullish sentiment was evident in Nuance's conference call, during which CEO Paul Ricci used terms such as ""unprecedented"" to describe product interest and ""meaningful"" to describe future revenue contributions from contracts currently under negotiation.In the quarter, sales rose 19% across the entire company and earnings increased 21%. For comparison, growth at other Apple vendors including Triquint (TQNT), Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS), Omnivision (NASDAQ:OVTI) and Broadcom (BRCM) all came in lower.Apple's goliath purchasing power gives it margin compressing might when negotiating deals with suppliers, which has weighed on supplier profits. However, Nuance's products are different than other vendors, which typically sell Apple highly commoditized chips and components.While there are many different sources for chips, there are far fewer options for voice recognition. And, this gives shareholders a needle moving benefit as Nuance relationship with Apple deepens.Disclosure: I am long NUAN, BRCM."

As the No. 3 player in a fragmented market plagued with inconsistent service, it would seem that Transcend Services (TRCR) should have a strong multi-year growth story ahead of it.Troubles Show Themselves In Q4Although Transcend generally has a strong record regarding customer retention and service quality, translating that into revenue growth has been a little more challenging lately. Nevertheless, the company did deliver about 10% organic revenue growth in the last quarter, with overall reported revenue growth of nearly 22%.Profitability was more challenging, however. Gross margin was flat (and below sell-side expectations) and adjusted operating income was down about 6%. Reported operating margin fell over 10 full points and though the comparison was better on an adjusted basis, it was hardly good.Transcend not only had to absorb some higher medical costs (they self-insure for employee healthcare), but there were ongoing costs and disruptions tied to restructuring their Indian outsourcing operations.A Cogent Plan For 2012Management knows that current margin levels won't cut it, and the plan to improve margins in 2012 makes sense. Transcend is going to look to convert more customers to its proprietary platform (which reduces costs), increase speech recognition usage, offshore more work, and increase the productivity of its offshore operations.OK, that's a good plan. But how realistic is it?Offshoring to India is commonplace in transcription, and Transcend, Medquist (MEDQ) and Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) all do it. It's not just a simple case of ""let's do more of that,"" though. For starters, scandals and problems with past offshoring have led some hospitals to either demand a lower rate for offshored work or contractually forbid it altogether. What's more, wage inflation in India is an issue as the cost advantage (15-20%) isn't quite as large as some believe.Likewise, increased use of the company's proprietary speech recognition platform (Beyond TXT) may be a little harder to leverage. Like offshoring, some clients don't like automated speech recognition systems and will either demand a lower fee or will not allow its use at all.Opportunities And Challenges For The Long HaulWhile the healthcare transcription market is arguably at least $12 billion a year in revenue, Transcend focuses on a narrower niche (community hospitals) that includes about one-quarter of that. Luckily, that's more of a marketing decision than a platform issue. If Transcend wanted to expand into other practices, the leverage opportunity would be relatively straightforward.Transcend also has ample organic and acquired growth potential. Somewhere between half and two-thirds of hospitals reportedly in-house their transcription and could be targeted by Transcend, Nuance and Medquist in the future. What's more, while Medquist and Nuance are considerably larger in terms of share (more than double Transcend's share), they together account for less than 20% of the market and a lot of the remainder are mom-and-pop operations that lack the scale to compete effectively.That said, transcription is still regarded by many as antiquated and a practice that needs to be phased out in favor of e-records. Doctors are going to fight this battle tooth-and-nail, but eventually the turnover in the physician community (older docs retiring and younger, more tech-comfortable docs replacing them) and the sales efforts of healthcare IT firms like Allscripts (NASDAQ:MDRX), Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), McKesson (NYSE:MCK) and Quality Systems (QSII) are going to move the market away from traditional transcription.I also question if Transcend can really drive a lot of leverage out of its proprietary speech recognition platform over the long term. Given that is Nuance's core business and also an area of focus for companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) (which also provides a lot of IT services to the healthcare/hospital community), I just wonder if the company is vulnerable to a better proprietary mousetrap.The Bottom LineThose concerns aside, Transcend does have excellent service scores, good retention and a clean balance sheet that should facilitate further transactions. What the company lacks, though is a consistent record of improving free cash flow conversion. Though the returns on capital look good, the declining cash flow efficiency concerns me at present.I'm actually comfortable projecting a low-teens rate of compound free cash flow growth over the next decade. Unfortunately, that's only good for a price target basically in line with today's price. If Transcend can improve those margins and get free cash flow conversion back into the mid-to-high teens, there's definitely upside into the high $20s, but I'd want to see better evidence of that progress before fully committing to a position in these shares.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Shares of Transcend close the day up 39%, while Nuance trades 2.5% higher, since the company made a great deal.The deal: Nuance Communications and Transcend Services announced a definitive agreement for approximately $325 million, all to be paid in cash. Nuance has roughly $900 million in cash, so financing the deal should provide no problems. The cash offer of $29.50 per share represents an almost 41% premium over the closing price the day before. The shares closed at $29.18, leaving another $32 cents to be picked up by investors who expect the deal to go through. With the deal expected to close on or before March the 20th, this leaves a 1.1% return for just a two week period.Transcend Services: Transcend, a medical transcription company, generated $125 million in revenue for 2011; it net earned $19 million that year. Nuance pays approximately $325 million, which is 2.6 times annual revenues and 17 times earnings, which is a very good price for the fast-growing company. As recent as 2008, Transcend generated $49 million in revenue, on which it earned $6 million.Nuance Communications: The acquisition of Transcend is a nice addition to the existing businesses of Nuance. Besides the fact that the combined entity had $1.5 billion in revenues in 2011, it also raised the growth profile, as Transcend is growing at a much faster rate than Nuance. Besides growth, Transcend's net margins of 15% beat the mere 2.9% that Nuance generated for 2011. In comparison to Transcend, Nuance itself is valued at $8 billion, which is roughly 6.0 times annual revenues and roughly 200 times annual earnings.Investment thesis: Nuance made an incredible deal. It bought a much more profitable company, which grows at a much higher pace than its own business. To make it even better, it acquired Transcend at a much lower valuation compared to its own stock. Despite the great deal, Nuance remains rather expensive unless it continues to improve net margins to substantially higher levels. With the stock near the all time high, I am not a buyer, although I applaud the deal.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Nuance is even rumored to be the company behind Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri. Neither Apple nor Nuance is saying definitively, but Nuance's official line is that ""Apple licenses Nuance's voice technology for use in some of its products."" Companies that work with Apple are notoriously required to be furtive about their business dealings, so it is difficult to glean more information.The popularity of the iPhone 4S and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Kinect are shining the spotlight on voice recognition technology; although the core technology is not new, it is finally ready for primetime. Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android has similar voice recognition offerings that compare favorably to Apple's offering but do lag behind. The consumerization of technology is spurring the demand for more simple technologies and user interfaces that are more operable for the mainstream.The three main product lines targeting end-users are individuals, business, and healthcare. Importantly, this is in addition to Nuance providing its underlying solutions to third parties, such as Apple, via licensing agreements. Some facts about Nuance that highlight the depth of its research and development (""R&D""):Financial ReviewNuance has recorded positive EBIT in the past three years, but only logged net income in 2011.Ordinarily I do not recommend companies that have losses in two of the last three years, but Nuance is a unique case because it is still essentially a developmental company, and is minimally exhibiting a positive trend. Upon first glance, the balance sheet appears strong, but upon closer inspection the majority of Nuance's assets are intangible. Out of the 4.1B in total assets, 3.1B are intangible (goodwill and intangibles), or 76%. This is slightly alarming, but the current ratio is still 1.8, indicating sufficient liquidity.Total cash flows from operating activities have been positive and are growing at an approximate 15% rate per year. As a development company, the key focuses are liquidity and solvency, as your objective is to ensure that the company can stay viable while it finances its R&D. Nuance fits this criteria with its current ratio and positive cash flows from ops.Nuance is not the next Apple. Apple was a once-in-a-lifetime investing opportunity because it was the perfect storm of both external (rise of PCs) and internal (Steve Jobs' brilliance) factors. I dislike when people call a stock ""the next Apple,"" but it is true that few other companies have the dedication to innovation and solutions that Nuance have.The company is dedicating to developing or acquiring the underlying technology for advanced input methods. This is embodied by Nuance's $102.5M acquisition of Swype, Inc. Initially it appeared strange for a company known for voice input technology to be acquiring a company specializing in tactile input, but CEO Mike McSherry clarified his vision in an interview with TechCrunch:It is now apparent that Nuance's vision is not simply voice technology. Nuance's well defined vision is to be the leading communication company, a space that is becoming more and more valuable.Nuance also recently acquired Vlingo, a competitor with a similar voice service offering. This is another acquisition that is ideal because it strengthens a competitive advantage. It certainly appears that Nuance's management team ""gets it,"" and has a laser-focused strategy that it is continuing to execute.How To Play ItWhile trailing PE is a staggering 220, the forward PE is a more digestible 14 (FYE 2013). I recommending going long NUAN 30 Jan 2013 calls, currently trading at $3.10. If you are less confident you could substitute in the 27 Jan 2013 Calls currently trading at $4.30, which have the largest open interest.Seeking Alpha contributor Rocco Pendola points out:The most important question to ask when investing is ""why."" Why is the PE so high? Why is the forward PE so low? The answer is that investors are very optimistic about the company's future prospects. If you agree with the premises presented above and believe in Nuance's future prospects, then you do not have to fear the high PE. A high PE is only one of many potential warning signs, and does not automatically indicate a short candidate.Disclosure: Author is long AAPL and GOOG, and may open a long position in NUAN at any time."

This footprint expansion will certainly have a knock-on effect for their suppliers. Anticipating which supplier's revenue and profit may skyrocket is a game many play - herein I make a bullish case for one of those suppliers.The impact of the Siri personal assistant on the iPhone 4S has been nothing short of astounding. Upon the release of the 4S, the supposed cognoscenti pronounced it inadequate for many reasons including the lack of a larger screen and not having the 4G LTE speeds of Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) partners HTC and Samsung. What then happened is that customers fell in love with the brilliant interface of the latest iPhone but most of all they loved Siri. This feature along with the pent up holiday season demand created the single most amazing quarter in terms of NI growth (118%) on such a large scale ($13BB) in the history of stock equities.With this as the backdrop, consider Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN), a preeminent company in the playground of intelligent voice response and transcribing, which supplies the brains of the Siri intelligent voice response. As of this writing, Nuance sells for 26 after a 20% drop, post February 9th earnings. As one reads through the earnings call transcript it becomes clear the reason for the shortfall in meeting expectations was the ""larger, more comprehensive and complex contractual agreements"" per CEO Paul Ricci. This complexity will be favorable long term for Nuance as it typically leads to greater customer stickiness. The near term downside is that these contracts utilize service level agreements (SLAs) with milestones which create revenue and royalty deferrals. The issue is compounded for Nuance; they are not recognizing revenue but are recognizing the associated costs. It is encouraging that even with this accounting anomaly, their YOY Income growth increased from break even to $9MM.A list of the tailwinds expected to drive iPhone 4S sales much higher and by proxy Nuance Revenues and stock price:To be balanced, there are concerns to consider before buying into the Nuance thesis as follows:In conclusion, Nuance stock price movements should be more strongly correlating with that of Apple's stock price movements. They are not correlated recently due to the overreaction to revenue deferrals. This market reaction I suspect will be reversed in future quarters.Disclosure: I am long AAPL, NUAN."

It licenses those patents, and as the interest in software patents has risen, its stock has as well.Nuance (NUAN), meanwhile, has lagged the market's growth. That's because it is seen as a software company. The company is best-known for its text-to-speech technology, called Dragon, which it sells as a software product, and to OEMs.But Nuance is fast becoming as much an intellectual property shop as IDCC.It starts with a text typing system called T9, a predictive sense system that helped fuel the SMS revolution by adapting the typical 10-key phone keypad to words.Now, with the acquisition of Swype, another text-entry technology (created by the man who created T9) Nuance has made another move into being a mobile software license OEM rather than just a products company.The deal ends what could have been a nasty dispute over similarities between Nuance-developed technology called T9 Trace and Swype, but analyst Michael Arrington insists Swype is pretty neato in its own right. But wait, there's more. Nuance is adapting the rest of its product line to this new world where you license to device makers rather than sell to consumers.Nuance had already turned Dragon into an iPhone app and, with the launch of Apple's Siri, a voice search feature, this looks like a real competitor. If, that is, the capability is built directly into hardware.Having Swype in the firm, clear of any legal entanglements with T9 Trace, brings Nuance the experience working with mobile OEMs to make this happen for Dragon. It is now a trusted insider in the mobile technology arena, but like Interdigital it can make money by simply licensing that technology, rather than having to build it into products.With that kind of future, Nuance becomes a lot more interesting as intellectual property.

There's a good chance the software on your cellular phone you use to ""call home"" or ""call Bob"" uses a Nuance product for recognizing you saying ""home"" and ""Bob.""Nuance's stock price has increased significantly over the last year, as shown below:The ride up has been a bumpy one to say the least, as the price of the stock dropped almost to its 52-week low in August.Nuance has been acquiring companies left and right, with recent acquisitions of Equitrac, Webmedx, SVOX and Swype.Equitrac develops software for print management. The acquisition of Equitrac enables Nuance to deliver an integrated solution. Webmedx provides medical transcription services. SVOX develops speech software interfaces for mobile, automotive and consumer electronics. Swype develops software providing predictive gesture input for Android-based smartphones. Swype enables users to input words faster and easier using one continuous stylus or finger motion movement across a device’s display.There are some allegations that Nuance went to extreme measures in an attempt to acquire Vlingo as well. Vlingo is suing Nuance on claims of corporate bribery related to a Nuance’s attempt to acquire Vlingo. In the complaint, Vlingo charges that three top executives of Vlingo were each offered $5 million to convince the board of directors to approve the acquisition by Nuance.In its most recent conference call, the company indicated its organic revenue growth was 13% over last quarter. Nuance also indicated its imaging business is doing well and the demand for its cloud-based business continues to grow. The company expects future greater visibility for its voice services related to mobile devices. Nuance is expanding its technology investments and partnerships related to healthcare, especially as related to clinical language understanding.On a negative note, Nuance indicated it is seeing some softness in the last couple of quarters related to European consumers, and also in Japan. Nuance is also increasing its sales organization, which could either be a good sign or a not-so-good sign depending upon whether the additional sales staff can generate a positive return.The company increased its fourth-quarter revenue projections over previous guidance based upon strong demand for its products. But will the increased revenue be sufficient to cover the increased costs associated with increasing the company’s sales organization? If not, Nuance’s stock price could take a hit in a few months. Some bad news could cause the price of the stock to drop all back to its 52-week low, as was recently observed. If allegations of bribery related to the Vlingo acquisition are true, the company could also see its stock price take a dive.Investors in Nuance’s stock have experienced a nice return over the last year, some as much at 45%. So how is an investor in Nuance stock to protect his investment profits without having to sell the stock and potentially take a tax hit? One method for protecting an investment is via a collar investment. A collar investment involves selling a call option against a purchased or existing stock and using some of the proceeds from selling the call option to purchase a put option to provide insurance against a dramatic drop in the stock’s price.As an example, using PowerOptions search tool, a collar position was found with a potential return of 3.1% and a maximum potential loss of 6.1%. The position involves selling a 2011 Nov 22 call option and purchasing a 2011 Nov 20 put option. The time frame for realizing the potential return is 39 days. As long as the price of Nuance’s stock is greater than or equal to the entry price of $21.94 at expiration in November, the position will return 3.1%. And, if the stock price were to take a dramatic fall, the maximum loss experienced would be 6.1%, even if the stock price drops to zero. A profit/loss graph for the collar position:Nuance is in a nice strategic position: It has either acquired or run off most of its competition. Additionally, the smartphone market segment looks very attractive for Nuance, but another larger company or companies -- Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), for example -- might decide to get into the space, and put a serious dent in Nuance's growth plans.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

On Monday, Nuance said it will hand over $54m in equity for eCopy in a move that bolsters its imaging business unit. (Revolution Partners banked eCopy while Needham & Co advised Nuance, as it did in the company’s purchase of SNAPin Software a year ago.) The pickup of eCopy, however, snaps a string of deals that Nuance has used to build out its mobile and healthcare business lines.If you didn’t realize that Nuance had an imagining unit, you could be forgiven. Although the company has its roots in that technology, it has largely left that market behind. (The current Nuance is actually the product of a mid-2005 marriage of Nuance Communications and ScanSoft, the name of which should give you some idea of its business.) In fact, through the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, the imaging unit represents just 7% of Nuance’s total revenue.And that slice is only getting smaller. So far this fiscal year, sales in the imaging unit shrank a staggering 20%, while the vendor’s other two divisions (mobile and healthcare) both grew and overall revenue rose 12%. Since the imaging business appears to be little more than an afterthought inside Nuance, we’re surprised to see the company double down on the unit with the eCopy acquisition. That’s actually a reversal of the direction of deal flow at the division that we would have suspected. We could certainly see a situation where Nuance divests its imaging business, ditching its past and focusing on mobile and healthcare for future growth."

The exact number was $102.5 million  and, I’ve learned, it was all cash (split between $77.5 million up  front and another $25 million in 18 months—call that a retention bonus  for the Swype team).So what does Nuance,  which is known primarily for its speech recognition software engine,  want with a gesture-based text entry technology like Swype?  (Instead of  tapping in letters on a touch keyboard, you swipe between them without  lifting your finger).  Earlier today, I spoke with Swype CEO Mike McSherry,  who explained the thinking behind the deal. “The broadest vision,” says  McSherry, “is we want to be the input for every single stream. You talk  to your refrigerator and in-car navigation, you want your language  models to follow you around.”When he puts it that way, Swype seems like a much more strategic  acquisition for Nuance than one which simply fills a hole.  Nuance owns  key pieces of technology for entering information onto mobile phones via  both voice and touch (including the T9 text prediction algorithm used  on most feature phones).  In fact, Swype co-founder and CTO Cliff  Kushler was also the inventor of T9.  The T9 offices are five blocks  away from Swype’s in Seattle.  The two code-bases will be merged, but  the Swype brand will grow larger in importance.Nuance is thinking beyond the input technologies people interact with  on their mobile devices to tying them together in the cloud.  So it  doesn’t matter whether you use voice or Swype, Nuance will “share  language models on the backend” and personalize each experience to an  individual’s frequency of use and language patterns.  So if your mobile  phone learns how you spell your friend Sergey’s name and later you use  voice recognition to send Sergey a text message, it will have a better  chance of knowing that you mean Sergey and not Sergei.Yes, Nuance is powering the new Siri Assistant  in Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming iPhone 4S with its voice recognition technology.   So does that mean that Swype could be coming to the iPhone as well?   “I’d love to be able to see that,” says McSherry, adding, “There are  certainly lots of requests to see Swype on the iPhone.”  Maybe Nuance  can help with the negotiations.  As of now, Swype is on 19 million  phones overall, including 9 of the top 11 phone manufacturers.  It is  especially big on Android.  Bringing it to the iPhone would be a very  popular move all around.Here’s a demo video from a couple years ago comparing Swype (on a Windows phone) to tapping on an iPhone keyboard.Original post"

A CFA with more than 20 years of investment management experience, David has spent his career helping individuals and their families with wealth management.Before joining Braver two years ago, David led the Private Investment Management group at Boston's Lee Munder Investments, where he managed roughly $1.5 billion for individuals, families and small institutions.Seeking Alpha recently had the chance to ask David about the highest conviction stock holding in his portfolio.To start, can you tell us about your investing approach?Our concentrated, unconstrained equity portfolio is designed to give clients the best security selection of our team. We are not concerned with the size of the company or whether it is classified as growth or value. We have one primary criterion for our equity selection: Can we make money on the stock given the current valuation and growth prospects? We are focused on creating absolute value and investment returns and less concerned about beating a benchmark return. We employ a fundamental, bottom-up security selection process - again, focused on consistent and positive investment returns. Our portfolio is concentrated in 20-25 holdings as we believe that it is better to know fewer names with conviction and that this concentration allows for better investment returns over time as it highlights stock selection ability. What is your current highest conviction stock position in your fund - long or short? Our highest conviction stock is Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN). Nuance, based in Burlington, Mass., is a leading software company focusing primarily on speech recognition. We have been long the stock for the past 16 months and still remain attracted to the company for its leading software products, its consistent earnings growth potential, and its valuation levels which remain very reasonable in today’s marketplace, especially when factoring in the expected growth opportunity. In fact, we believe that Nuance is underappreciated and is not gaining enough respect in the marketplace. As the story unfolds through industry growth and maturation, we can envision appreciation being driven not just from earnings growth delivery but from multiple expansion. At $17.39 per share, the stock trades at 15 times this year’s fiscal 2010 consensus earnings estimates of $1.15 per share. Looking forward, the stock trades at just 13 times 2011 consensus expectations of $1.29 per share, representing 12% EPS growth. Earnings visibility is good and business momentum appears strong. As such, we like this stock as a core holding for its position in the marketplace as a leading speech recognition software company and its growth prospects. We also like it for its low valuation and we see upside to earnings, with the bonus being potential multiple expansion. Can you tell us a little more about Nuance and where it fits in?Nuance is a leading software provider for businesses and consumers for both speech solutions and document management solutions. We focus more on the speech side of the business and the opportunities present in mobile applications and in healthcare. At the core, Nuance’s software can convert speech into text to save time and costs while creating efficiencies across the enterprise.At the same time, we believe there are safety benefits at the consumer level that are growing in importance within the mobile marketplace and with the proliferation of text and email messaging. In addition to speech recognition and conversion software, they offer a line of software products that assist with document management, editing and conversion. Tell us a bit about Nuance's sector. How much is this an ""industry pick"" as opposed to a pure bottom-up pick? Nuance to us is both a bottom-up pick and a top-down industry selection at the same time. On the bottom-up side of the equation, we are bullish on the mid–teens EPS growth projections that appear to be achievable and we believe can be beat to the upside, as the adoption rates increase across both the mobile marketplace as well as the healthcare sector. We are intrigued with the reasonable valuation metrics of 13 times next year’s earnings estimates.At the industry level, we are very excited about the current adoption and the future potential adoption rates of speech technology - from an efficiency and cost savings standpoint within the healthcare industry, and from a safety and responsiveness standpoint from the wireless side.  Can you elaborate a bit on these two aspects?Our investment thesis for the industry and for the company is simple: As the world continues to adopt wireless as the preferred means of communication both at the consumer level and the enterprise level, speech recognition becomes more important for efficiency reasons and for safety reasons.Texting while driving is a major problem around the country and around the world. Nuance’s leading software allows one to convert speech into text for texting or emailing. This significantly improves safety.At the same time, we all know that the healthcare industry needs to cut costs and become significantly more efficient. Clearly, the ability to dictate and have the speech immediately converted to text for storage, emailing or adding to a database has tremendous opportunities. Speech recognition and conversion as an industry is at the early stage of adoption and we are intrigued at the industry level as well as from the bottom-up fundamental measures. How would you describe Nuance's competitive environment? Nuance is generally recognized as a leader in this space. The competition comes from large providers of software and hardware devices such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) in the mobile and enterprise speech recognition space. Although this competition is clearly formidable, we believe that Nuance’s solutions are superior and the pure-play nature of Nuance and its independence provides advantages.On the healthcare side, a small $250 million firm called MedQuist (MEDQ) competes in the healthcare space and is focused on this business, providing some direct competition to Nuance. [Nuance is competing against stalking-horse bidder MedQuist and Transcend Services (TRCR) in a Tuesday auction for bankrupt medical transcription company Spheris Inc.]On the document management and editing side of the business, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is the major competitor and clear dominant player in the PDF (portable document format) business. Given the brand recognition and strength of Adobe, we have focused on the telecom and healthcare parts of Nuance's business; anything out of the documentation side of the business is just upside to our outlook. We anticipate that Nuance’s strength and positioning in the industry and recent momentum, combined with very reasonable valuation metrics, could lead to one of the larger providers such as Apple, Google or Microsoft viewing Nuance as an acquisition target. We do not own a stock based on a potential takeover, as this can be a very frustrating business. However, this potential viewed as a bonus could lead to significant upside potential to our fundamental case.  What about how valuation compares with competitors? As I mentioned, we believe Nuance is very underappreciated in the marketplace given the valuation levels. On a P/E basis, the stock is at a discount to its peer group and the market as a whole. Thirteen times next year’s EPS is a very reasonable valuation level for a leading software provider. Given the mid-teens expected EPS growth, the stock trades at 1.00 or slightly less on a P/E-to-growth basis. We believe there is upside to the earnings numbers based on the trends within mobile technology and in healthcare.As such, we believe this business is underappreciated in the marketplace. This could lead to appreciation in three ways: 1) EPS growth, 2) P/E multiple expansion as the stock becomes better appreciated in the marketplace and 3) potential takeover candidate as speech becomes more widely adopted. What is the current sentiment on Nuance, and how does your view differ from the consensus? The current sentiment is one of fair valuation. It appears that the marketplace respects Nuance’s software and capabilities as well as the trend towards speech conversion. However, our enthusiasm for this stock does not appear broadly shared and this is reflected in the lack of momentum in the name. The stock has been rangebound and unable to materially break through the $17 upward range in any sustainable manner.We differ from the fair valuation sentiment in a few ways: We believe the current valuation on consensus EPS is too low. A more fair valuation for this stock given the industry positioning and growth trends, management strength and stability, and EPS growth could be in the 16-17 times earnings range. At 17 times earnings, the stock could trade at almost $22 per share or almost 30% higher. In addition to the underappreciation in the multiple, we believe consensus earnings are likely low, as we expect wider distribution deals and higher adoption rates as Nuance further separates their technology from the competition. Does management play a role in your position? Yes. Management plays a key role in our security selection process; in particular, managers that exhibit stability, good vision, and shareholder-friendly and prudent decision making. To this end, CEO Paul Ricci had the vision in the early part of the decade to place a large (and very accurate) bet on focusing on speech technology. Acquisition decisions have been a key to Nuance’s success and Ricci has demonstrated an expertise to this end as well. His leadership, vision, and sound decision-making has served shareholders well over the years and we expect this to continue into the future. He remains focused on the long-term growth of the franchise. What catalysts do you see that could move Nuance's stock? We anticipate there will be a few catalysts for this stock over the near term. First and foremost are earnings. We anticipate a solid fiscal second quarter ending March 31 and this should provide further confidence around adoption rates and continued management execution.Second, we believe product announcements will solidify our belief that Nuance is gaining momentum as the leading provider of speech translation software. The company recently announced a deal with Audi to be the provider of speech technology in the Audi A8’s leading MultiMedia Interface (MMI) Touch infotainment system for navigation. This announcement went virtually unnoticed. We believe that this could be the first of many wins to come in the high end automotive space and this could be a strong catalyst for the name. At the same time, Nuance has recently announced that the Dragon Dictation software is available on the iPad as an application. This should create further awareness of Nuance and its capabilities. We anticipate more deals to be announced as the year progresses and this all could lead to multiple expansion. What could go wrong with this pick? The software and technology space in general can change very quickly and render products obsolete. Nuance competes with some very formidable players in technology. As mentioned above, the list is star studded with Adobe, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and IBM. One of these competitors could leapfrog Nuance and their technology. We believe one of these companies should seek to acquire Nuance instead of trying to build their own, and this would be a much cheaper option and better use of capital. However, the risk remains that these are large companies with large cash balances and they could choose to invest heavily in speech technology - and this could potentially derail the Nuance story.Thanks, David, for sharing your thesis.Disclosure: Braver Wealth Management is long NUAN.Read more High Conviction Picks »If you are a fund manager and interested in doing an interview with us on your highest conviction stock holding, please email Rebecca Barnett."

Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) CEO Paul Ricci must have taken copious notes in class because his company's recent purchase of Swype has catapulted it from a voice recognition company to an input organization. I think this is a big move for the company because it expands what it, as an entity, does.Donna Howell, in a recent Investor's Business Daily article, explains:The posting goes on to interview FBR & Company analyst Danial Ives and he reports:That's a lot of smartphones, and let's not forget that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a player in that arena, too. In fact, it recently released its much ballyhooed iPhone 4S with the usual media circus in tow. The technology and investing press have written extensively about the device, and the big selling point of the communicator is its voice-recognition wizardry, more commonly known as Siri. Nothing has been confirmed, but Nuance Communications purportedly has the technical know-how that is the backbone of this game changer.An October 5th, TechCrunch posting by MG Siegler reports:Apple stands for ease of use and quality, and my take is that if it did indeed partner with Nuance, it made the right choice. This is because, according to SmartMoney,With the cognoscenti on board, Nuance appears to have the leading position in providing all forms of input as we know it. A Vulcan mind meld or telepathic texting could be next with the exotic software it produces, especially at the rapid pace technology is evolving. To insure its position, the inner sanctum of the company has reached its tentacles into the acquisition space the last few years and, as a result, is buying smaller firms. Companies like Equitrac, SVOX, Webmedx and Loquendo were obtained not only for their software, but for their patents. In the Q2 conference call, Mr. Ricci explains that the company has about 4,000 patents and patent families, and this was before absorbing the above-mentioned companies.The CEO doesn't specifically cite any one partner and, in fact, seems to keep his cards close to his vest. My guess is that he is talking about Apple, but that's just conjecture.In my last article on Nuance, I gave a lot of detail on its business model and in order not to be redundant, I will opt not to give a breakdown of its overall operation. A 10-K comes out once a year and  I really can't add anything to the conversation that I didn't say in the last posting. However, I would like to emphasize that the company is a major player in electronic medical record transcription products and services and may be a big benefactor of the HITECH Act. The HITECH Act is part of the government's Stimulus Plan where thirty billion dollars has been slotted to modernize medical records through 2020.Besides discussing the move from touch-tone transmissions to audio sensitive devices in the last post, I also talked about the valuation of Nuance. My belief was that it was expensive on a price/cash flow basis and since it hadn't been profitable in ten years, I was going to sit on the sidelines. Well, I'm happy to report that after a decade of being in the red, it has finally moved into the black and it looks like this trend will continue. In addition, in the seven months since the article was written, the stock has gained 33%, rising from $18 to it's current price of just about $24. Heavy-duty profits in a market that has gone nowhere in 2011.Even with the impressive gains, Nuance seems to be running on the cool side as we take its temperature. Some of this can be attributed to the lackluster market. Consensus earnings estimates on Yahoo Finance give it $1.35/share for 2011 and $1.57/share for 2012. That gives us a current P/E ratio of 18 and, going forward, a P/E ratio of 15 - very reasonable valuations for a stock that has a growth rate of 16% for next year and a five year CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 13%. We're talking about PEG ratios at about one, which is a fire-sale price for a growth company.Analysts seem to like the stock as much as I do. Out of the 19 companies that cover Nuance, 15 have a buy or strong buy, three say to hold the stock and only one says to sell. What Nuance probably needs to kick it into high gear is a ""Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) moment"". You may remember back in the dot com bubble when a PaineWebber analyst put a $1,000 price target on the stock. Retail investors would be all over it. As is, Main Street isn't aware of Nuance because its products and services are ubiquitous. If Siri on the new iPhone 4S turns out to be a success, then that would be a marketing and public relations bonanza for the company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

91418,20101,2008-08-15T16:07:00-04:00,,"Just before the market closed Thursday afternoon, Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) offered to buy all outstanding shares of Zi Corp. (ZICA) for 80 cents per share in cash.  Significantly, the offer is not subject to any financing conditions and should require only standard due diligence.  As an alternative, Nuance offered to buy the company for $.65 share without any due diligence.  Nuance has asked for Zi Corp. to indicate whether it is willing to enter into negotiations by 5pm Pacific time today.  The full text of the offer letter from Nuance to Zi is below the fold.“Nuance can offer customers a broader and more fully integrated product and technology portfolio than Zi Corporation can offer independently,” said Steve Chambers, president, Mobility & Consumer Services, of Nuance. “We believe the combination of Nuance and Zi delivers significant benefits to both companies’ shareholders.”Here’s where it gets interesting for traders: ZICA shares currently trade at $.68 (the price at which I built a position late yesterday).  That means that if the deal goes through at the initial offer, ZICA holders will pocket over 17% above current prices.  However, an increase in the offer price could dramatically boost those returns.   A bump to $1 or above is not out of the picture — in fact, ZICA shares traded there only a few months ago.Bottom line: While there is considerable downside risk if Zi Corp. outright rejects either deal proposed by Nuance Communications, I like the prospect of a negotiated deal slightly above the $.80 offer.  I’m in for the arbitrage, but only because of the deal.  Without it, Zi Corp. is an extremely troubled company.DISCLOSURE: Long ZICA.OB.Click to enlargeLetter to Zi Corp.:"

Its outright refusal to deal suggests that management is more concerned with retaining control than serving shareholder interests.Nuance appears undeterred by Zi Corp.’s initial rejection.

40564,20139,2007-07-10T06:07:02-04:00,,"Transcend Services (TRCR) ($23.00) provides medical transcription services to the health care industry. After trading in a sideways pattern between $2.00 and $2.50 per share for most of 2006, the stock price exploded in October and has entered a strong uptrend. Driven by a turnaround in profitability and momentum traders scrambling onboard this thinly-traded stock—insiders beneficially own 32% of the outstanding stock—Transcend has gained more than 1,000 percent in the past ten months! Industry Overview The market for medical transcription services is sizable. The total annual market potential for outsourced medical transcription services is estimated to be approximately $6 billion. While competition is significant, with perhaps 1,500 transcription services companies nationally, and few barriers to entry, Transcend is one of only a handful of companies that operate on a single, Internet-based technology. HIPAA compliance has saddled healthcare providers with increasingly complex documentation requirements, resulting in an increase in the need for dictation and transcription of medical encounters. In addition, demand for medical transcription services is growing as the demand for healthcare services increases. Macro-economic trends such as the aging of the baby boomer generation are projected to have a major impact on the demand for healthcare services in general and should lead to a corresponding increase in the demand for medical transcription services, which analysts forecast to grow 16 percent a year. Services Transcend provides two primary medical transcription options to the healthcare industry: (i) transcription support services for customers with their own transcription systems and (ii) its BeyondTXT Platform, which leverages advances in speech recognition technology, enabling an end-to-end digital voice-to-text transcription solution using the Internet. Business Strategy Transcend is planning to gradually increase the percentage of voice files processed through BeyondTXT, from approximately 20% of its total volume of transcriptions at the end of 2006 to approximately 25% by the end of 2007. Longer term, the percentage of volume that is edited using speech recognition technology will depend on such factors as the mix of volume that is processed on Transcend’s proprietary platform vs. customer platforms, the percentage of dictators for which Transcend is able to build high quality voice profiles, and the Company’s ability to hire, train, and retain talented medical language specialists (MLS) and editors. In our view, management’s success in leveraging demand for BeyondTXT will directly impact gross margins. The rollout of the Company’s speech recognition-enabled BeyondTXT platform will result in additional cost savings as fixed infrastructure costs are spread out among a higher user base. Management is also looking to contain costs by moving business offshore. Indian contractors transcribe approximately 7% of the transcription volume processed by the Company. Transcend expects this number to increase in 2007. However, significant portions of existing and potential customers do require that transcription services be performed domestically. We believe that the Company is well positioned to increase market share by taking advantage of uneven service delivery by some of the smaller medical transcription firms, which also lack the requisite technology and capacity to compete on a ‘value proposition.’ Transcend also intends to increase market share through acquisitions. Financials Transcend reported first-quarter net income of $1.3 million, or 15 cents a share, up from $150,000, or 2 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 30% to $10.4 million from $8.01 million in the comparable period last year. Impressive share-net gains and investors’ share trading, notwithstanding, the 10Q Detective has some concerns about the ‘quality of earnings’ reported for the three-months ended March 31, 2007. Management reported that of the $2.41 million increase in revenue, 79 percent, or $1.90 million consisted of sales from new customers. This is misleading, for a more detailed review by the 10Q Detective uncovered that this growth was not organic, but was purchased through recent acquisitions: Medical Dictation, Inc., a Florida-based medical transcription services company, and OTP Technologies, Inc., a Chicago area medical transcription company. In its 10-Q regulatory filing, management said “no single customer accounted for greater than 10% of total revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2007.” However, revenue attributable to one contract with Providence Health System - Washington (for four hospitals) accounted for 9.2% of total revenue for fiscal 2006. In addition, “the Company provided medical transcription services for the three months ended March 31, 2007, to individual customers that are members of a group of hospitals. Revenue attributable to members of this group comprised 22% of the Company’s total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2007.” These ‘individual customers’ number approximately 40 customers who are members of Health Management Associates, Inc., a single healthcare enterprise. At March 31, 2007, the Company had net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $16.4 million, which is being used to reduce income taxes. As a result, the Company paid no current federal income taxes due for the first quarter. Growth Opportunities The clinical documentation outsourcing industry is highly fragmented, with less than ten firms in the industry accounting for less than 10% of the total outsourcing market. There are currently two large national transcription competitors, one of which is Spheris and the other of which is MedQuist (MEDQ) ($11.15), several mid-sized service providers with annual revenues between $10.0 million and $40.0 million, including Spi Technologies (a wholly owned subsidiary of Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.), and hundreds of smaller, independent businesses. Ergo, the field is ripe for consolidation. Historically, the Company has financed acquisitions either through debt or equity or a combination thereof. At present, there is only $1.5 million available on a term loan from Healthcare Finance Group, which management believes is insufficient to complete larger transactions [medical transcription firms with more than $5.0 million in annual sales]. The Company has engaged investment banker, Morgan Keegan, to help locate potential acquisition candidates and financing for these. In our view, Transcend’s ability to execute its acquisition strategy is less dependent on its ability to secure financing than in the past (when the share price was less than $3 per share). At $23 per share, and with only 8.15 million shares outstanding, the Company can use its common stock as currency. However, the balance sheet is looking anemic. As of March 31, 2007, Transcend had goodwill and intangible assets at carrying amounts of $4.5 million and $601,000, respectively. The total of $5.1 million represented approximately 41% of total assets, up from 38% of total assets as of December 31, 2006. The Company has contractual obligations--leases for the rental of office space and operating leases related to the purchase of computer and other equipment-- totaling $849,000 due in 2007—more than the cash and cash equivalents of $653,000 on the balance sheet at the close of the first quarter. Other Investment Risks & Considerations Transcend’s reliance on key third party software could affect its ability to operate competitively. MultiModal Technologies, Inc., an enabler and provider of conversational speech solutions, provides integral parts of the BeyondTXT technology under a <strong>non-exclusive, third party vendor agreement, renewable for up to four successive one-year periods. Management’s inability to maintain the relationship with MultiModal, or find a suitable replacement for the technology, would adversely affect the Company’s ability to operate competitively and to meet the workload demands of its existing customer base. We question management’s commitment to sustaining technological leadership and innovation. Transcend invests only about one-percent of its annual sales in R&D to improve its Internet-based platform/ infrastructure to yield faster turnaround times, better workflow management and increased productivity. Insiders collectively own approximately 32% of the outstanding common stock. Consequently, together they continue to be able to exert significant influence over the ‘independence’ of directors and the outcome of most corporate actions requiring shareholder approval and business. Nonetheless, the 10Q Detective is impressed with who sits on the Board, including Joseph P. Clayton, the Chairman and former CEO of Sirius Satellite Radio, and Walter S. Huff, Jr., the founder of HBO & Company (and a personal friend of Transcend’s Chairman and CEO Larry G. Gerdes, who held various executive positions with HBO prior to 1991). Gerdes and Huff beneficially own 13.55% and 12.13%, respectively, of the outstanding stock of Transcend Services. On June 4, 2007, Mr.Gerdes entered into a selling plan pursuant to Rule 10b5-1, pursuant to which he may sell up to 200,000 shares of the Company’s common stock on a periodic basis through June 30, 2008. This is the rare case where a CEO cashing in some stock “to diversify” does not trouble us. In recent years, more than 40% of Gerde’s annual compensation has been in company stock. For example, on December 15, 2006, Gerdes—and other Named Executives—were each granted 50,000 shares at an option price of $3.40 per share! In addition, as of December 31, 2006, Gerdes owns (exercisable) options underlying 100,000 shares at an option price of $4.15 per share.

Peanuts, peanuts! What am I gonna do with peanuts?”  Alice: “Eat 'em, like any other elephant.” ~~ [The Honeymooners, 1955] In our view, bullish sentiment remains intact, and additional momentum buying on the back of a solid second quarter could send the stock price bouncing along to newer highs. In addition, companies which provide services complementary to medical transcription, such as electronic medical records, coding and billing, may expand the services they provide to include medical transcription, and therefore, may consider Transcend—with an enterprise value of only $178.8 million—an attractive purchase. Momentum buying in a bull market—even Ralph Kramden might get lucky owning this stock. “Yessir, this is the time I'm gonna’ get my pot of gold.” ~~ Ralph Kramden.  Disclosure: David J.

23943,20369,2007-01-11T04:35:33-05:00,,"Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN) is one of the leaders in speech recognition software. After decades of development, this market still hasn't fully evolved into a predictable animal yet. Nonetheless, Nuance survived the rough times, pushed into profitability in 2005, and now is on track for strong earnings growth ahead. Deals like the one announced last week with AT&T (NYSE:T) to automate it's 1-800-YellowPages are also helping to raise the profile of Nuance with investors. The stock price has climbed to $11.67 currently from $8.25 when we wrote about it in September and from $3.58 when we featured it in the spotlight two years ago. Voice-driven computing is a very intriguing technology and a market with huge potential. There remains plenty of risk, but it's finally safe to say that speech recognition has grown from awkward novelty to mainstream commercial application. Early applications of speech recognition in the late 80s and early 90s were a well-publicized flop. What's changed in the past 15 years? Plenty. Processor speeds have advanced tremendously, high-capacity memory costs have plunged, and the technology itself has been refined. Now voice driven technology works well at viable cost levels. Just as important is the fact that the market isn't limited to the desktop anymore. There is now an array of markets for speech recognition applications, not to mention text-to-speech applications. Internet usage is just one driver, others include cell phones, in-vehicle applications such as navigation and communication, consumer electronics, and a host of other non-PC computing devices. Another long-term market driver is miniaturization. At some point it gets ridiculous to try and put a numeric keypad--much less a keyboard--on all the portable electronic devices we'll be using a few years down the road. Speech is the obvious answer for human interaction with these machines. Instead of asking humans to act more like computers, the computers will act more like humans by ""listening"" and ""talking"" to the user. While there are certainly desktop applications for speech recognition, the grand prize is enabling access to information through non-PC devices over the Internet and other networks, including wireless. Just for starters, think of everything that is driven by touch-tone menus. Those will be voice-driven someday soon. Many companies have made web-based content such as stock quotes and entertainment information available via speech. Booking airline tickets and tracking packages are just a few more examples of applications already in place. Drivers in many metro areas can access information to help them through the commute by dialing 511 and talking their way through voice-driven real-time reports on traffic conditions and public transit. One opportunity that is especially intriguing is customer relationship management [CRM]. This area is already a major focus for improved efficiency among businesses these days, and the cost savings of voice-driven computing solutions over call centers is massive. The key is to make it work well and leave customers with a positive result. Nuance's software advances the natural language performance and reduces the reliance on lists of predefined words, enabling more free-style speech by users. Nuance is the result of several mergers that brought together many former competitors including ScanSoft, SpeechWorks, and Dictaphone. There are still plenty of rivals like Microsoft and Philips, along with specialist Intervoice, but Nuance is holding its own and Wall Street is quite fond of it. Of the eight analysts covering the stock, five rate it a Strong Buy and two call it a Buy. In the fiscal year 2006 ended in September, Nuance posted a profit of $0.37 per share, up from $0.22 a year earlier, on revenues of $389 million. In FY2007, the consensus for EPS is at $0.47 and sales are expected to surge to $559 million. The earnings growth rate is expected to average 22% over the next five years. It may be a few more years before speech-recognition becomes a mainstay in our lives, but the businesses built around this technology are making progress and it's hard to deny this will eventually be a huge market. As a leader in commercializing speech recognition technology, Nuance is a company worth knowing, especially with profits on the books now and a market that is finally maturing.

The company has lost money two of the last four quarters, and three of the last four years. So what's behind its amazing PE multiple of 214? Patents. And takeover talk.When I first looked at the company two months ago  (when it was selling around $22/share, compared with the current $25.30) I noted that it had both a text-to-speech opportunity in Dragon and a keyboarding interface in Swype. (You may hve seen ads for Dragon on TV lately.) Now it has gotten something better in the first instance, buying Vlingo.Nuance is now considered the leader in scanning software and has a secure niche in the rapidly-growing medical market. There is some there, there.So who might buy? Here is a short list, in order of likeliness from very likely to much less likely:Rising markets and rising legal challenges both make M&A based solely on patent rights a solid trend to buy in 2012. This is an easy way, although, if no one comes calling, it is very hard to justify even NUAN's current price.Disclosure: I am long GOOG, IBM."

But value is never just a DCF calculation: there is value in undiscovered markets and new technologies, and that makes small cap companies in emerging areas interesting. Information on these is often hard to find and sometimes they stay undiscovered until it's too late. Note also that they are quite volatile. With that, here's my pick:
Speech recognition is a technology that has always overpromised and underdelivered, the technology spawned several start-ups but failure to deliver has resulted in consolidation. Nuance Communications, Inc. (NUAN) ($11.20) seems to have emerged the winner. (Although I have been following this area, and Nuance out of my interest in linguistics - the company was recommended I believe in Jan 2005 by Motley Fool in one of their newsletters). 
Scansoft was a spin-off from Xerox (XRX). It was an optical character recognition (NYSE:OCR) company to convert paper documents to electronic formats. In 2001 however the company decided to add speech technology to its OCR business by buying Lernout & Hauspie's assets out of bankruptcy for $59.5 million. L&H was the wunderkid of the go-go 90's tech bull market, it once had a valuation of $10B, the company imploded in accounting scandals and management malfeasense. Since then, ScanSoft has shrewdly made a dozen other acquisitions in the speech arena. In 2002 it added telecommunications capabilities by buying a once hot MIT startup Speechworks. In addition, it purchased MedRemote, a medical dictation specialist,

and, of course, Nuance, which was the leader in speech recognition technology. After the merger the Scansoft took on the name Nuance Communications.
The company is now made up of four segments: imaging, network speech, embedded speech, and dictation.
Imaging, a slow growing but highly profitable business, will account for about $70 million of an anticipated revenue range of $315 million to $325 million in 2006. While this business is unexciting, the Nuance solutions for OCR are essentially the standard in the industry. This is a steady cash cow that's expected to keep growing at about 8% a year. Network speech includes speech recognition for call center applications for clients such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Wal-Mart (WMT), as well as telecommunications network providers including Verizon Wireless (VZ). Embedded speech has two rapidly growing markets: wireless handsets and automotive. Nuance has deals with Nokia (NOK), Kyocera (KYO), and others to provide voice-activated dialing and other operations for mobile handsets. Meanwhile, automotive speech control is a rapidly growing segment.
Finally, dictation and transcription is a $10 billion business in the U.S. health-care segment alone.  Nuance predicts massive growth there, up 70% in the most recent quarter.



The Good

- Carries no debt

-According to a former linguistics professor from MIT, the company has far superior technology and IP assets than anyone in the industry.

-Revenues rose 35% year over year

- Embedded speech and dictation are expected to deliver 50% growth (source: Morgan Stanley - seems high to me!!)

- Imaging and Network speech are steady cash cows
The Bad

- Because it has been so acquisitive, Nuance possesses a massive goodwill account,

which currently exceeds $459 million.

- The company is losing money $7M in the last quarter.

- The company boasts a high forward P/E of 22 (BTW I do not believe in P/E ratios and even more so in forward P/E ratios)
The Ugly

- Talent is key in this business, Yahoo recently poached some folks from them.

- New start-ups like Tell-Me, Be Vocal, Nice Systems are nipping at their heels
Having said all of the above, the speculator in me sees value in this company, they are shrewd when it comes to acquisitions and as voice-recognition gets more into the main stream - cars, cellphones etc this company can deliver the goods. On a personal note I would love not to type this blog but speak out my thoughts and let Nuance do the rest!!!
(Disclaimer : I have a small position in this stock, thinking of adding more next week)"

Although migration of software infrastructure to the cloud environment has been a trend for the past few years, the pandemic associated shelter-at-home restrictions and the need to work-from-home have definitely accelerated the corporate digital transformation process.With shares already up by 110% YTD (year-to-date), IAM (Identity and access management) software player Okta has already benefitted significantly from what has already become a secular growth trend. This company with over 9,000 customers is expected to grow revenues YoY by 35%, close to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2021 ending January 2021. The company has also reported dollar-based net retention of 121% for the 12 months ending July 2020.However, this stock is not cheap. Okta is currently trading at a P/S (price to last twelve-month sales) multiple of 44.6x, which is not cheap.Hence, despite being a high-growth stock, I believe that it is fully priced as of now. Nevertheless, I believe that this is a fundamentally strong company, and investors should consider starting a small position in this stock on a pullback.The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way businesses function and this has been a major growth driver for Okta in 2020. As more and more companies have shifted to hybrid cloud and public cloud infrastructure and are now relying on connected devices and distributed workforce, the concept of securing the company's premises with firewalls is becoming more and more redundant. Then again, while the pandemic has made digital transformation a necessity for many businesses, it has also compelled many others to start thinking proactively about their digital transformation strategies. Finally, security consultants are increasingly pushing forward the concept of Zero Trust security. It is estimated that the global Zero Trust Security market is growing at a CAGR (compounded average growth rate) of 19.9% and will be worth $38.6 billion by 2024.Identity is fast becoming ""the new perimeter"", and businesses are increasingly opting for identity-based permission to network resources. Okta has already emerged as a leading player in the enterprise IAM market, thanks to solid penetration in the workforce identity and customer identity-based SaaS (software-as-a-service) segments. The company estimates its TAM (total addressable market) to be worth $55.0 billion, of which workforce identity accounts for $30 billion market potential and customer identity for the remaining $25.0 billion opportunities.Clients deploy Okta's workforce identity solutions to ensure immediate and secure access to applications and data to their employees, contractors, and partners. Workforce offerings include products and services such as Universal Directory, Single Sign-On (or SSO), Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication, Lifecycle Management, API Access Management, Advanced Server Access, and Access Gateway. Although many of these products are considered commoditized, Okta's broad workforce identity portfolio offers multiple cross-selling opportunities for more higher-margin products. Okta currently prices workforce identity solutions on per user per month basis. While there are multiple players in the workforce identity business, not many are able to offer a seamlessly integrated experience to employees as well as contractors and partners like that offered by Okta.As the world increasingly goes digital, businesses also need mechanisms to validate the identity of their customers and provide an integrated experience across multiple applications. With Okta handling the customer identity part of the equation, businesses can focus exclusively on the user experience of their digital offerings. Here, the company deploys a tiered pricing model, where rates are decided based on the number of customers of the client corporation. This is a less saturated and rapidly increasing market opportunity, owing to the rapid increase in security requirements of on-premise infrastructure as well as those of hybrid or public cloud infrastructures. Here again, while there are few competitors, Okta stands out owing to its superior integration experience.Network effect and vendor neutrality are the key differentiators for Okta. OIN (Okta Integration Network) has played a key role in building these advantages. OIN contains ""over 6,500 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications, IoT devices and IT infrastructure providers, including Amazon Web Services, Atlassian, Cisco, F5 Networks, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Office 365, NetSuite, Oracle, Palo Alto Networks, Proofpoint, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, Slack, Splunk, VMware, Workday and Zoom.""Clients use these integrations to build seamless identity access across these applications in accordance with their specific use cases. To further increase the scope of use cases that can be enabled by OIN, Okta has added products like Workflows, Hooks, and Identity Engine.As more and more customers use Okta's offerings for a range of use cases, the company gets insights about application usage trends and security threats. Hence, developers can expect further improvement in security offerings. Also, the network effects are a solid entry barrier for new players even if the latter price the products below Okta's pricing levels. This is because businesses are well aware of the importance of security solutions and prefer to choose more experienced players even at a higher price.Vendor Neutrality is also another advantage related to Okta. Although Microsoft already has a presence in the identity market, many customers prefer security providers to be different from their cloud service providers. Also, solutions that can work across multiple clouds are more preferred. Okta stands to benefit from both of these preferences.Okta Access gateway can prove to be another major growth driver as the company increases its focus on the hybrid cloud market.Okta has demonstrated over 90% growth in total customer count from 4,700 at end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to 8,950 at end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021.Here, while customers grew YoY by 28%, the customers with >100k ACV (annual contract value) grew at 38% YoY in the second quarter. At end of the second quarter of fiscal 2021, there are 1,685 customers with ACV exceeding 100k, almost double of 747 customers at end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019.The solid increase in customer count is well-reflected in Okta's revenue growth trajectory. A solid increase in subscription revenues also highlights increased topline visibility.Okta's dollar-based net retention rate has also recovered from the slight dip seen in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Although this dollar-based net retention rate is nothing out of normal for high growth SaaS stock, it is nevertheless impressive considering Okta's increased focus on large enterprise deals with big deal size. This implies that the potential for cross-selling in future time frames becomes limited.Okta's revenue growth is expected to be close to 30% in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, which may be a stark departure from its performance in the past few years. However, analysts also expect the company to become EPS positive in fiscal 2022.Okta is trading at pretty high valuation multiples. Lofty valuations expose share prices to significant downside risk even in the event of single unfavorable news or earnings miss even if it is due to seasonality.Lengthening of sales cycles can result from an increasing focus on large enterprise deals. This can affect key SaaS metrics such as billings growth and RPO (remaining performance obligations). This again can have an untoward impact on share prices.Competition from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), and other private players may also affect the company's future growth rates.Finally, although the pandemic has been a net positive for Okta, it has definitely posed some challenges for the company. SMB (small and medium business) sector has been badly affected, with a high percentage of bankruptcies and closures seen in sectors such as hospitality, tourism, and even energy sectors. This can prove to be a challenge for attracting new business in the coming quarters.With the prolonged nature of the pandemic bringing about durable changes in consumer behavior, digitization is very much here to stay. This means more demand for security solutions, and leading IAM player Okta is set to benefit from this trend.However, at current valuation levels, I believe that the stock is a tad bit expensive. RBC Capital Markets' target price of $230 is a fair estimate of the 12-month consensus target price of this stock, considering its risk-reward prospects.Hence, I believe that retail investors should start building a small position in this stock in case a pullback gets this stock to $190-$200 levels."

Okta has changed the way people log in to applications and websites, as it utilizes the cloud to create an efficient, single access point login experience through which users can access their most important applications.Essentially, when a person logs in to Okta, they log in to an array of all their apps contained in a convenient and organized dashboard.The cybersecurity company enables people to securely access their most important applications and networks from anywhere, as Okta's solution deploys from the cloud. Moreover, Okta has integrated new technology such as facial recognition and touch ID as methods for users to log in.Today, I am going to explore Okta's enterprise customer base to illustrate how it is providing massive value to its customers by evolving the way that companies provide secure logins. I will conclude the note by assessing what we should pay for the stock while simultaneously implementing a margin of safety.Source: Okta | The Identity StandardOkta represents a long-term need for companies that are transitioning to digitized workplaces, especially since the SaaS market only accounts for about 20% of enterprise software spending. That is, the number of applications into which employees and companies will need to log in is set only to expand from here. Commensurately, the need for Okta will only continue to expand.For example. Adobe (ADBE) uses Okta to enable 20,500 employees to have a single login to access all their applications. This process is more efficient than Adobe's previous login solution where people had to log in repeatedly to different applications. Okta solved this confounding problem, as employees can now access all of their accounts simply by logging in once. The video below specifically highlights how Okta is making a difference for Adobe.Check out this video, which summarizes Okta's value to Adobe:Source: Okta | The Identity StandardThe MLB (Major League Baseball) is another strong customer that demonstrates Okta's ability to understand a business and smoothly integrate its software into MLB's different platforms. The MLB wanted to engage with fans by encouraging them to stream and follow their favorite baseball teams, and the access to this MLB platform is made possible by Okta's solution.Additionally, the SaaS company has already worked with the MLB to implement secure workforce identity solutions for its employees across the league.Click the following link to watch a video about the MLB's subscription to Okta: Major League Baseball improves the omnichannel fan experience with Okta.Albertsons (NYSE:ACI) is a grocery store with over 2,300 stores, which uses Okta to improve its customers' experience.

With over 8,400 customers, Okta has a strong enterprise customer presence, as can be seen below.Link: (SEC401) Encryption Key Storage with AWS KMS at OktaWhat's more, Okta is steadily growing its customer base.Source: Okta: Strong Growth And Abundant PotentialOkta increased its customer base by 30% this past year. As of 2019, Okta had 100 million users, but CEO Todd McKinnon is preparing to expand this customer base to 50 billion. The CEO (who was a senior VP of engineering at Salesforce (CRM) before founding Okta) is focused on being extremely customer centric similar to Salesforce.Okta is one of those unicorns in Silicon Valley these days that is free cash flow positive while growing at 30%+ on an annualized basis. Notwithstanding its profitability, it's still aggressively reinvesting into its business.Okta is consistently reinvesting through SG&A, research, and development. This contributes to Okta's growth in its customer base, and I expect the company will continue to reinvest to continue to expand subscription-based customers.Source: YChartsOkta continues to develop its services, which is reflected in its spending on research and development, as illustrated above. The company has a solid gross profit margin of 73% and generated positive free cash flow for the first time in 2019, as illustrated below.Source: YChartsOkta is in a strong financial position as it is generating free cash flow and will continue to reinvest to improve its core business.Source: Okta | The Identity StandardAs seen above, Okta is steadily increasing revenues and anticipates a 32% increase in 2021.Now, let's find out what Okta is worth today.To determine a fair value for OKTA, we will employ our proprietary valuation model. Here's what it entails:Now, let's check out the results!Assumptions:Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelAccording to the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model, Okta is currently overvalued trading at $180, but we need to calculate an expected return to normalize future growth.Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelIf one were to invest at $207 per share, they could expect an ~9% return, which does not clear our hurdle rate of 9.8%, or the average annualized return of the S&P 500 Index Fund over the last 90 years.For the calculation, I used conservative estimates such that we can be wrong about potential growth and still achieve our predicted returns. That is, Okta is currently priced in such a way that it will have to grow at 30% annually for the next 10 years. While this is possible, between the company's guidance and consensus analyst estimates, it only expects to grow at 29% over the next two years.For estimating Okta's free cash flow margin, I used 35% to reflect Okta's strong gross profit margin while accounting for its reinvestments in SG&A, research, and development.As I mentioned above, consensus analyst estimates anticipate revenue growth at 29% growth over the next two years. Therefore, a 25% growth in free cash flow per share is bordering on ""too optimistic"", and when an assumption is ""too optimistic"", our margin of safety is eliminated.So even with optimistic assumptions about Okta's growth, the company will likely not generate market-beating returns from a share price of ~$210.Okta's identity system is unique because its platform is impartial and serves a wide variety of software applications. Microsoft (MSFT) is one of Okta's main competitors, and it differs from Okta because Microsoft is biased towards its software (Azure, Office 360) and may exclude other applications. Okta is separating itself by focusing on allowing customers to connect everything within their ecosystem.Source: Okta | The Identity StandardAs can be seen above, Okta is leading the field in access management, with Microsoft coming in second.Okta offers a disruptive, and almost as importantly, impartial access identity platform. As the trend to cloud-based software continues to pick up, Okta has positioned itself to help its customers securely manage all of their accounts simply in one integrated ecosystem.I am neutral on Okta at ~$210, but purchased it at $86 last April (which I sold after it doubled for personal reasons and not related to the company).I would gladly re-enter my position should it come back to earth a little over the next year or so, which I believe will happen once the fervor around the virus dies down a bit."
4373188,69905,2020-09-09T05:13:55-04:00,"Okta's guidance is not looking strong, with Q3 2021 pointing towards 33% y/y growth, a dramatic deceleration from rates seen in Q2 2021.Q2 2021 billings were up 27% y/y. Management argues seasonality, but for the rest of the year, qualitative commentary doesn't come out particularly reassuring we'll see a meaningful pick-up.Overall, it's difficult to argue that the stock is not in bubble territory.","Okta (OKTA) is a crowd favorite with a lot of momentum behind it.Meanwhile, looking ahead, the stock is already priced at 25x its next year's revenues. With revenue guidance pointing towards a 1,000-basis point deceleration into Q3 2021 (calendar 2020) and billings not painting a compelling picture, it's difficult for new shareholders to be attracted to this stock.Even if its dollar-based net retention is strong at 121%, the company is not leading its peer SaaS group. The stock could be considered at a lower price point.Source: Company websiteOkta is a cloud-native identity management company that uses single sign-on for users to connect up to their required platforms. The company has been a beneficiary of the rapid acceleration and proliferation of the Zero Trust cloud environment.Indeed, Okta is by far the leader in its sector. However, I question just how much of this positive sentiment is already priced into the stock.Source: Author's calculations, ** high-end company guidanceSurprisingly, given the rapid push towards cloud acceleration that we have seen from all companies, Okta's guidance is pointing towards meaningful deceleration. That is, Q3 2021, at the high end, is expecting to see 33% y/y growth rates, after going through Q2 2021 growing at 43% y/y.If we take a step back, common sense should at least temper shareholders' excitement and question whether this level of deceleration is truly aligned with the narrative that the world is rapidly modernizing their identity systems, or whether that side of the story has already been amply reflected into Okta's valuation (more on this later).The company's billings were up 42% y/y in Q1 2021, while in Q2 2021, it decelerated to 27% y/y.During the earnings call, Okta's CFO, Bill Losch, went to great lengths to highlight to analysts that while billings this quarter were unusually low, H2 2021 should see a pick-up.Losch pointed analysts and investors to keep in mind Okta's strong current remaining performance obligations (""RPO""), which ended Q2 2021 up 48% y/y.Source: Q2 2021 Investor PresentationLosch declared during the call that billings should narrow the gap with Okta's subscription in the second half of fiscal 2021. Indeed, while billings lagged Okta's subscription revenues by 11% in H1 2021, that it should only lag subscription revenues by 5% to 6% in H2 2021.Consequently, for now, given that revenues are being guided towards low to mid-30% for H2 2021, this implies that billings are going to stay around the high 20s or, in the best case, reaching 30% growth in billings.Okta is a SaaS business. Consequently, the company's biggest efforts are in landing a new customer. However, its ability to later upsell its platform is something that investors are positively allured towards.As we can see below Okta's dollar-based net retention rate (DBNNR) is incredibly stable, reaching 121% over its trailing twelve months.Source: Q2 2021 Investor PresentationHowever, we should bear in mind that amongst SaaS peers, that 121% DBNNR is pretty standard. For example, among other high-flying tech names, Datadog (DDOG) is carrying a net retention rate of over 130%, Twilio (TWLO) is above 132%, and Zoom (ZM) is reaching 130%.Separately, Okta performs well on the crucial Rule of 40% for now, reaching 53%. But given the 1,000-basis point deceleration expected into Q3 2021, I suspect that together with next quarter's results, the company may start to look less enticing.On the other hand, Okta's CEO, Todd McKinnon, and his team may decide that now is the right time to start to cut back on investing as aggressively, that the company is no longer eyeing up such strong return on investment performance metrics, and that it makes more sense to maximize profitability.In that vein, Okta sees opportunities to expand its free cash flow margin into calendar 2024:Source: Q2 2021 Investor PresentationGiven that Q2 2021 saw its free cash flow margin reach 3%, but this was during a quarter with substantially fewer costs, primarily due to continued reductions in travel and office-related expenses, I question just how easy it would be for the company to expand its free cash flow margin to 20% over the coming 4 years.Okta is a growth story. It needs to guide for strong revenue growth rates and have very rosy outlooks to support its 32x forward sales for this year and 25 forward sales into next year. This means Okta, a crowd favorite, as trading more expensively than Twilio, which trades for just 17x next year sales.Remember, Okta's valuation leaves it trading at such a large premium to forwards sales, not even forward non-GAAP earnings.Okta has gone very far, very fast. And looking in the rear-view mirror, there's ample to justify its valuation.However, looking ahead, the stock has little to further entice new investors. Even though the stock has had a lot of momentum since March-April lows, there's not enough here to justify its valuation and attract new shareholders to the stock. I make the argument that Okta's valuation of 25x next year's revenues is simply too high not to argue that the stock is in bubble territory.In sum, awesome company, but the valuation leaves investors with no further upside."
4353911,104952,2020-06-15T14:05:40-04:00,"Okta is one of the best SaaS opportunities in the market, which investors should buy and hold for the long term.Long-term outlook is solid, driven by the unique integration network effect, which increases the value of its technology asset and drives growth at the same time.The ~33% full-year growth guidance is impressive, considering the uncertainties. Reacceleration to +45% is likely beyond 2020.","We believe that Okta (OKTA) presents one of the best tech and growth investment opportunities in the market today, despite the high valuation. As a market leader in the SaaS IAM (Identity Access Management) space, it will continue to play a critical role in the digital transformation of all sizes. We believe that its IAM technology assets and overall growth will also continue to benefit from the network effect as a result of Okta's expansive partnerships with over 6,500 cloud applications and IT providers.Even during the period of uncertainty in the near term, we should expect Okta to achieve a +33% growth for the full year, with a possible reacceleration longer term. Net expansion remains solid, while the reduced operating expenses should lift margins. We think that investors should hold Okta for the long term.Okta has plenty of juice left in the tank, as its offering should continue to benefit from the network effect, deepening its moat over time. In Q1, Okta continued to surprise us as it beat the guidance by ~6% margin. The $182.9 million of revenue in Q1 represents a ~46% growth, which is pretty much the same level as its TTM growth last quarter. As a comprehensive SaaS IAM provider, there are many go-to-market approaches Okta can leverage to maintain this level of growth.For starters, Okta has a very diverse set of offerings, which ranges from $0 per user/month (the developer edition identity offering) to +$21,000 annually (the directory integration). Furthermore, its core SSO (Single Sign-On) and MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) offerings also range from $2 to $6 per user/month. Consequently, as Okta drives adoptions for these offerings through a mix of low-touch and high-touch sales processes, it should be well-positioned to onboard customers of all sizes to maintain its growth longer term.The partner integration network is also one of the key go-to-market strategies, which also enhances Okta's offerings. Its SSO offering, for instance, enables a single credential to log in to multiple cloud platforms, and it is easy to imagine how the value of that asset rises as Okta integrates with more applications. It now has over 6,500 cloud applications and IT providers such as Microsoft (MSFT), Google Cloud (GOOGL), and, more recently, AWS (AMZN) in its partner ecosystem network. Overall, we conclude that Okta still has a solid long-term outlook. Moreover, with the management's ~33% guidance for the full year and Q2 with the potential slowdown baked into the assumption, we believe that reacceleration to 40-45% growth beyond 2020 is likely.Marketing and T&E savings, along with the lower interest rates environment, will lift margins and ease access to capital, while growth can also still exceed expectations, considering the strong expansion rate and enterprise client base. Okta continues to benefit from the lower interest rate environment, as it recently priced $1 billion convertible senior notes at 0.375%. Furthermore, as the company will guide conservatively due to a potential slowdown in Q3 and Q4, the strategic savings across T&E and marketing should strengthen profit margins.(source: company's earnings call slide)With that in mind, we expect operating loss margin to bottom in Q1 2021, with a potential expansion to approximately -2% to -3%, considering the $4 million operating loss expectation in Q2. In Q1 alone, operating expenses growth of 29% was already lower than expected.(source: company's earnings call slide)On the other hand, we also remain confident in the company's ability to maintain a 121% net retention, which can potentially expand next quarter FCF margin to 17-18%, considering the deep AWS integration and steady increase in high ACV-deals. In Q1, customers with >$100,000 ACV up by 38% YoY.We cannot identify too many risk factors in Okta, aside from the relatively high valuation. At ~34x P/S, Okta is indeed one of the most expensive SaaS stocks we have covered. The splitting opinion primarily has to do with the perception of Okta's ability to maintain its growth as well as the intrinsic value of its offering, which we have already addressed.In our view, Okta stands out as a category leader in SaaS IAM due to its strong partner integration ecosystem and differentiated technology offerings, which deliver a powerful network-effect driven growth. As Venture Capitalists, we conclude that its integration technology is highly innovative, disruptive, yet challenging to scale, while it may look straightforward from the high-level perspective.(CRM vs. NOW vs. TEAM vs. TWLO vs. OKTA vs. AYX. Source: stockrow)In its category leader peer group, Okta is the most expensive stock, though it does not necessarily have the best-in-class metrics. It is, however, the second-smallest company in the group by market cap, which means there is still a lot of upside potential going forward. With its RPO of over $1.2 billion and revenue of ~$586 million as of last year, growing consistently at +40-45%, it is only a matter of time before Okta reaches a $1 billion in revenue. Furthermore, Okta is also a resilient business, having guided a +33% revenue guidance with full-year visibility. We give the stock an overweight rating with a price target of $215."
4356686,69905,2020-07-02T04:53:44-04:00,"Okta's leadership as the secure identity platform is being priced in many times over.
        Auditors raise critical concerns with Okta about its revenue recognition policy.
        There's too much speculation here and not enough upside potential left.","Okta (OKTA) is a stock market darling with a huge disconnect between its valuation and its fundamentals. It's a case of rhetoric over reality. I argue that is unreasonable to expect that the next two years will be anywhere near as rewarding as the previous two years.The evidence points to a steadily decelerating revenue growth rate combined with a steadily accelarating multiple to sales. At close to 40 times sales, this SaaS stock is incredibly hot, and with a negative risk-reward profile. It's best to side-step this investment rather than ride the momentum.Source: author's calculations, ***high-end fiscal 2021 guidanceOkta's revenue growth rate is steadily and consistently declining. If for fiscal 2020 it was growing at very close to 50% year-over-year, right now, for fiscal 2021 it is looking to grow at 33% year-over-year.Even if investors are banking on the fact that Okta is low-balling their guidance in an attempt to impress the Street, I do question what fiscal 2022 will look like? Indeed, considering that Okta's billings are also 42% as of Q1 2021, I would surmise that the days when Okta was growing at close to 50% are for now gone into the rearview.Having said that, Okta's CEO Todd McKinnon was quick to preempt this line of thinking amongst analysts and investors noting that Okta had some contracts getting pushed out slightly due to COVID. Hence reinforcing for clarity that these meaningful contracts have not been cancel, but simply pushed out. Mckinnon declares that work-from-home has played a meaningful role in ramping up the demand for a seamless secure identification platform, with enterprises, government agencies, and SMBs demanding both on-prem and cloud-hosted servers requiring Okta's suite of products.One standout win during the recent quarter was FedEx (FDX) where it required more than 85,000 employees to have a secure sign up within a very short period of time. Indeed, the demand for Okta's Single Sign-On ('SSO') product is only going to increase given the requirements for companies and agencies to connect from anywhere in a zero-trust environment. Arguably, Okta's 121% dollar-based net retention rate is extremely attractive. Not only does this point towards a very low customer churn rate (practically non-existent), but it also demonstrates Okta's ability to expand customer relations with added revenue streams, with T-Mobile (TMUS) as an example. Thus, all considered, it's easy to see why this revenue growth story is so appealing, right? Well, not so fast.On page 71 of the 10-K, the auditors question Okta's revenue recognition policy. Here's an excerptIn layman's terms, the auditors have some doubts over Okta's revenues. Please see below:In the red box, we can see accounts receivables are negative for all three years. In other words, revenue is getting booked in, but the cash is not following through. For now, cash is unlikely to be a big problem for the bull thesis. Okta's balance sheet is strong and flexible with a net cash position of approximately $500 million.Given that Okta's biggest cost is its stock-based compensation which amounted to $127 million for fiscal 2020, its cash flows from operations are relatively reasonable at an annualized run-rate of approximately $150 million. In other words, management is unlikely to have any problems in diluting its shareholders, given that the investors' appetite for its shares remain so high. And this leads me to question the upside potential?Having discussed the fact that Okta's revenue growth rates are decelerating, I fail to understand how investors can possibly argue that paying an increasing large multiple to sales leaves investors with any further upside potential.Source: author's calculationsWhile acknowledging that Okta is by far a leader in identity management platforms, I nevertheless question what upside potential could arguably be now left here? Furthermore, investors still have no real understanding of what its profit profile could turn out to be. Even while pushing aside its real and high stock-based compensation, even on a non-GAAP metric, Okta is likely to remain unprofitable for some time.While I understand that Okta is investing for growth, and that it has no intention to turn a profit anytime soon, it's nevertheless interesting that despite the expectation of adding approximately $200 million in revenues to its top line for the year ahead, its non-GAAP operating profits is not benefiting from much, if any operating leverage, as its non-GAAP operating losses are expected to be around $30 million compared with $49 million for fiscal 2020.Okta's share price trades at an all-time high, consequently, all shareholders will be holding gains, and have warm fuzzy feelings towards the company (read stock) and will be unwilling to ask difficult questions from their investment. Specifically, investors will not be asking whether there's any further upside potential ahead. For now, shareholders are highly likely to remain buy-and-hold forever shareholders of Okta even though the rational argument as to whether it's a reasonably priced investment opportunity has long ago departed from the thesis here."

        Investors have banked on Okta's single sign-on tools as critical to enabling the work-from-home environment.
        While it's true that Okta's criticality has spiked this year, its valuation has gotten ahead of the fundamentals. Okta trades at nearly 30x forward revenues.
        Okta's billings growth has consistently clocked in below revenue growth, signaling future revenue deceleration.
        GAAP net losses still continue to be high.","Okta (OKTA) has been one of the biggest winners all year, and as an investor who dabbled in and out of the stock over the years, I'm obviously disappointed to have missed out on Okta's big breakout. That does not mean, however, that winners can keep winning forever. Investors' enthusiasm on Okta has vaulted it to among one of the largest enterprise software companies in the market (at a ~$25 billion market cap, Okta can no longer rightfully be considered a ""mid cap"" tech stock). Just for kicks, note that Okta's market value now is about the same as the Big Three U.S. airlines combined (Delta (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), and American Airlines (AAL), in descending order of size). Investors' enthusiasm on Okta only kicked into higher gear when the company released bullish results in the tail end of May.Providing contrarian opinions is always difficult, but I continue to be bearish on Okta. Okta's recent rally is driven more by a momentum trade that has rotated out of travel/retail/bank stocks and into the biggest-winning tech stocks of the year. Yet at some point, reality will come catching back up to Okta. This is a stock trading at >30x forward revenues (about double where the broader market is trading as a multiple of GAAP earnings) that has still yet to generate positive GAAP profits or pay a dividend. Right now investors don't mind because they're excited about the remote work-fueled growth, but eventually investors will start chasing income, yield, and cash flow again.There's no doubt that Okta has a solid long-term future. Single sign on (NYSEARCA:SSO) is a space that Okta completely owns. Outside a few small startup competitors, no other company really stands a Okta when it comes to securely managing login and permissions across a corporate stack - something that has become evidently critical in a time when we're all logging into work applications from home. That being said, expectations have vaulted far beyond reality. At Okta's current share prices near $205, the stock has a market cap of $25.36 billion, and after netting off the $1.45 billion of cash and $948.1 million of debt on Okta's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $24.86 billion. To Okta's credit, its mix of recurring revenues and overall revenue visibility is so solid that the company has actually continued to provide full-year guidance, which many rival software companies have backed away from. Okta is expecting 31-33% y/y growth for the full year FY21 to $770-$780 million in revenues:Figure 1. Okta guidance updateSource: Okta 1Q21 earnings deckFully knowing that Okta tends to undercall its guidance, Wall Street consensus is on the higher end of that range at $777.5 million. Against this consensus estimate, Okta trades at a valuation multiple of 32.0x EV/FY21 revenues.Even the most growth-oriented of investors should take pause at that figure. I'll lean on one of my core investment principles here: great companies don't always make for good investments, at least not when they're trading at absurd prices. It's easy to point to Okta's self-estimated ~$55 billion TAM and say that Okta will keep growing at a rapid clip forever, but at some point investors will rotate back to value - and you don't want to be caught holding the hot potato. There are plenty of other software companies, previously Wall Street favorites that could seemingly do no wrong, that have been shot down due to a combination of excessive valuation and performance missteps (Zendesk (ZEN) and New Relic (NEWR) come to mind over the past year).Keep your distance for now and invest elsewhere.With this all being said, it would be remiss not to acknowledge Okta's latest strong results. The key thing to note here is that while Okta's numbers were very strong, its high multiple essentially prices it for perfection - and so these results should be more or less expected.The summary chart below does a good job of illustrating Okta's strength in the quarter:Figure 2. Okta Q1 key metricsSource: Okta 1Q21 earnings deckAs usual, Okta's revenue growth soared past expectations; with actuals of $182.9 million growing 46% y/y and besting Wall Street's expectations of $171.6 million (+37% y/y) by a nine point margin (by now, Wall Street analysts should be used to the fact that Okta guides substantially below where it actually ends up). This growth rate kept pace with Q4's 45% y/y revenue growth rate.Unsurprisingly, Okta saw some accelerated demand from companies wanting to quickly transition into a remote work environment. Per CEO Todd McKinnon's prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:It's still unclear, however, what the net impact of the coronavirus on Okta is. Despite accelerated demand from some customers as described above, Okta also noted that some companies pushed out/delayed their implementations of Okta, particularly customers in the industries most heavily impacted by the coronavirus. Small and mid-sized businesses, too, lagged behind on implementations. Okta's commentary here, however, is consistent with the sales trends seen elsewhere across the software industry.For multiple sequential quarters, however, Okta's billings growth rate, at 42% y/y, has fallen behind revenue growth. This is one of the key leading indicators that Okta's revenue growth will also fall to the low 40s in the near future. We note as well that Okta's GAAP net losses have also been growing. Though the company has been able to improve pro forma net margins to near-breakeven, this has been masked by Okta's stock-based comp - which grew at a 66% y/y pace in Q1.Figure 3. Okta loss trendsSource: Okta 1Q21 earnings releaseThough stripped out from pro forma figures, stock-based comp isn't free. And especially in a rising share price environment, investors are paying a lot in the form of dilution for stock pay in options and share grants that were assigned at much lower share prices. Okta is a great company, but at a >$25 billion market cap and >30x forward revenues, it's difficult to believe that Okta makes for a good investment - especially given the fact that the company has so far still been unable to close its GAAP net losses. Stay on the sidelines here."
4372108,103480,2020-09-02T10:36:17-04:00,"Shares of Okta have flatlined since July even as the majority of tech stocks continued to rise.
        Okta's latest quarterly results showed billings growth slowing down even further to 27% y/y, fifteen points softer than 42% y/y growth in Q1.
        Okta's huge valuation and share prices are a legacy of its hyper-growth past, but it's very difficult to justify a >25x forward revenue multiple if Okta's growth sinks below 30%.
        Okta remains a great business that is also positioned for profitability, but its current share prices already price in plenty of optimism.","Okta (OKTA), the the leading single sign-on (NYSEARCA:SSO) company that essentially helps companies control end-user access to internal systems and applications, has long been one of the most dominant growth stocks in the enterprise software sector. At one time, Okta's growth rates seemed untouchable - even as Okta continued to climb in scale, the company's >60% y/y growth seemed to be incapable of slowing down.Now, however, Okta seems to be entering slowdown mode - and whether a portion of that is pandemic-driven or due to sheer saturation, it's difficult to defend Okta's sky-high valuations when the business is no longer exploding as it was in the past. Since July, Okta's share prices have more or less flatlined even as most of its enterprise software peers (led by Salesforce.com (CRM)) climbed to new highs in August - signaling that investors may be tiring of paying top dollar for Okta.Here's the thing with Okta: the company says that usage of Okta products has never been higher than during the pandemic, and that the current work-from-home environment is driving a digital transformation unlike any seen before in the past. The thing, however, is that Okta is not a direct beneficiary of higher usage levels, because Okta prices per seat. Its customer are billed based on the number of employees that use its SSO tools (core SSO, for example, starts at $2/user/month, though it's very likely that large enterprise users would get customized volume-based pricing discounts). The software companies that are tremendously benefiting from ramped-up usage, meanwhile, are those that price based on usage - such as Twilio (TWLO), which prices per API connection, or Splunk (SPLK), which prices based on data volumes. Meanwhile, however, Okta's valuation is essentially pricing in a very optimistic scenario. At current share prices near $225, Okta has a market cap of $28.90 billion. After we net off the $2.51 billion of cash and $1.73 billion of debt on Okta's most recent balance sheet, its enterprise value is $28.11 billion. Wall Street, meanwhile, is expecting $1.04 billion in revenue for the next fiscal year (data from Yahoo Finance), representing 30% y/y growth (this may already be quite optimistic if Q2 billings clocked in at just 27% y/y, and essentially banks on a second-half FY20 recovery in billings to refill the deferred revenue balances for next year). Against this revenue outlook, Okta is trading at a massive 27.0x EV/FY22 revenue. There are very few software stocks trading in this echelon of valuations, and I find it difficult to believe that this rich valuation is supported by fundamentals. Be careful of Okta at these levels. The entire tech sector is long overdue for a correction, but with Okta's elevated multiples, Okta especially could be in for a bruising correction is investors' priorities shift from growth into value.Let's now dive into Okta's latest results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Okta Q2 resultsSource: Okta Q2 earnings releaseAgain, the argument here is not that Okta's performance is weak - but rather, that its current valuation already overcompensates for strong performance. Okta's revenue grew 43% y/y to $200.4 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $186.4 million (+33% y/y) by a ten-point margin. Okta's revenue also barely decelerated relative to 46% y/y growth in Q1.Revenue, however, only tells a small part of the story. For a recurring subscription software company like Okta, it's really billings that gives investors the clearer picture of underlying sales momentum. When Okta signs a deal, only a portion of that deal will be recognized as current-quarter revenues, but it will be recognized as billings that builds up deferred revenue to be recognized in future quarters. From this standpoint, Okta's execution has been relatively weaker. Q2 billings only grew at 27% y/y to $198.1 million. The fact that the nominal dollar value between revenue and billings this quarter is a small gap indicates that Okta is barely building up deferred revenue this quarter (whereas in Q1, Okta had revenue of $183 million versus Billings of $210 million). All this points to future deceleration.Figure 2. Okta billings trendsSource: Okta Q2 earnings releaseThere is a partial explanation for some of this billings weakness, however. Here's some context from CFO Bill Losch's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:While these comments seem to suggest that Q3 billings may pick up from here, the company didn't exactly explain what a normalized billings growth rate would look like in Q2 in the absence of the invoice pull-in to Q1. Ultimately, even whether Okta's baseline growth rate is in the high 20s or the mid 30s, a ~27x forward revenue ratio is still unthinkable.On the profitability side, Okta did manage to hit pro forma profitability this quarter. Pro forma operating income hit positive $6.5 million this quarter, representing a 3% pro forma operation margin - up ten points from the year-ago quarter. Okta, like many other SaaS companies, has benefited from the stoppage of sales travel as well as the cancellation of customer events. Figure 3. Okta margin trendsSource: Okta Q2 earnings releaseHowever, it is important to note that not all of these gains can be sustained. CFO Losch noted that: ""We do not expect to maintain consistent profitability in the near term, particularly when the business environment begins to normalize and the employees resume traveling again. We also look to increase our investments in fueling our business globally, which includes increasing headcount within sales and marketing as well as R&D."" We note as well that GAAP profitability remains a distant ambition for Okta, thanks to being weighed down by heavy stock-based comp, which rose 55% y/y this quarter and 60% y/y in the year-to-date, both heavier than revenue growth.Okta has had a strong run this year, up an unthinkable 90% year to date. But as we've seen with other investor favorites like Alteryx (AYX), this ""winners keep winning"" mentality can sometimes lead to painful corrections. With a nosebleed valuation at >27x forward revenues despite decelerating growth, Okta is long overdue for a healthy pullback. Stay on the sidelines here ."
4344441,35181,2020-05-07T22:34:40-04:00,"Okta indicated in its latest earnings report in early March that it had not experienced any business slowdown due to the pandemic.The company has strong revenue growth, strong free cash flow margin and easily meets the Rule of 40.The stock price appears to be extremely overvalued, but we are in the middle of a historic reset with digital transformation stocks rising to the top.Breakout to an all-time high signifies that it is time to buy.","Back in January, I wrote the article ""Okta Still Too Frothy For My Liking."" It turns out that my neutral call for Okta, Inc. (OKTA) was way off, as the stock is now up 35% since publication, a stark contrast to the S&P 500, which is down 13%.(Source: Seeking Alpha)The funny thing about high-growth stocks is that they don't respect the traditional valuation metrics that analysts, myself included, wave in front of readers' noses screaming ""overvalued!"" While it might be true that Okta is indeed quite overvalued, we are experiencing a historic seismic shift to a work-from-home environment, where the rules of the game are changing fast. And if there is one thing that I have learned from 40 years of observing the stock market, you listen to what the markets are saying and you act accordingly. There are many overvalued work-from-home stocks out there, and almost all of them are breaking out to all-time highs. For example, just yesterday, I wrote about Atlassian (TEAM), another high-flyer. Today, Twilio Inc. (TWLO) stock jumped 40% to reach a new high.Okta had been range-bound for almost a year, but in the last week, has made a move to a new all-time high.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)It is clear from my analysis (below) that Okta is one of the most valued digital transformation stocks that I track, and this makes me hesitate to give this stock two thumbs up. But I believe that we are witnessing a historic repricing in the stock market. Unlike most stocks that are languishing in the current market conditions, digital transformation stocks are being strongly endorsed by the market players. When we look back 20 years from now, it will be obvious that 2020 marked the seismic shift to the cloud, the fourth leg of the industrial revolution, and the pandemic dramatically accelerated the shift. We won't be going back to the way things were.So, valuation be damned! Listen to what the market is telling you and buy digital transformation stocks. And oh, yeah... buy Okta.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The metric sidesteps the valuation dilemma for high-growth companies that generally don't show profits. The Rule of 40 allows for both revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) in combination such that they must add up to at least 40%. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can turn a blind eye to negative free cash flow to some extent. On the other hand, if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth.This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. Young companies tend to have high revenue growth but are burning cash. Mature companies have lower revenue growth, but they make up in terms of free cash flow. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In Okta's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 47% + 7% = 54%Its score is much higher than the necessary 40% needed to fulfill the rule of thumb, suggesting that this company has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how Okta stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward sales multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, Okta is situated significantly above the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is extremely overvalued on a relative basis. Its valuation is right up there with other companies such as Atlassian, Veeva Systems Inc. (VEEV), and Coupa Software Incorporated (COUP). I should mention that, despite the extreme valuations, all of these stocks are expected to be strong players in the current work-from-home market conditions, and all of them are breaking out to new highs. As I said earlier, when the market speaks, you must listen. There is little point in waiting for a better entry point, as you are likely to miss this paradigm shift.There are several risks that investors should consider before investing in Okta. First of all, valuations for Okta and other work-from-home plays such as Zoom (ZM) are exceptionally high, very reminiscent of the 2000 dot.com era. Being an older investor, I remember a time at the turn of the century when technology stocks were breaking out much like today's more focused work-at-home plays. It was like fish jumping into my boat - profits were effortless. In three months, I quadrupled my money. But alas, the opportunities dried up and the market eventually crashed. It is quite possible, if not likely, that the current work-from-home craze dies out to a certain extent. And when that happens, you want to get out as fast as possible.Okta has some issues that investors should be aware of. First of all, its SG&A expense margin is quite high. The company is currently spending 104% on SG&A plus R&D, more than its revenue intake. (Note that SG&A expenses include non-cash stock-based compensation.)(Source: Portfolio123)While this high level of expense is manageable given the company's strong cash reserve, an extended recession could prove troublesome.Another issue is that Okta has a history of share dilution, as shown below.(Source: Portfolio123)Currently, the company has diluted shares by 9.4% YoY. In 2018, share dilution was close to 15% YoY. At present, I don't take share dilution into account when calculating revenue growth or the Rule of 40, but perhaps I should.Okta has recently broken out to an all-time high. When a breakout occurs, it usually signifies more bullishness to come. Okta is a strong company with annual revenue growth of 47% and a positive free cash flow margin of 7%, giving it a score of 54% on the Rule of 40. The company indicated in its latest quarterly earnings report that it had not experienced any business slowdown to the pandemic, but keep in mind that this was in early March. While the stock movement is strong and the company's fundamentals are strong, there is one tiny detail that gives me hesitation, and that is its very high valuation. In this case, I am going to overlook valuation and point to the historic shift towards work-from-home. I expect that Okta will benefit from the new economics with its dominant position in identity management solutions and Zero Trust."
4355864,102101,2020-06-26T12:56:29-04:00,"Okta's growth story is one of the most compelling and sustainable in the cloud software space.The numerous solutions and use cases offered by Okta will continue to drive engagement and new interests across enterprises.Okta's financials are improving because it is able to sell more use cases for its products at a cheaper cost of capital.Valuation has baked in near-term growth options. Regardless, Okta is a long-term buy and hold play due to its solid growth factor.","Okta (OKTA) is a sustainable way to bet on the future of work. Its products are intuitive while addressing a broad swath of technical problems. Its platform offers solutions to avoid vendor lock-in worries in the identity management space. Its financials point to a solid growth factor and a convincing path to profitability. Profitability and free cash flow benefit from Okta's solid competitive positioning and its ability to upsell its installed base. While valuation appears frothy, long-term investors will find Okta's story attractive.Global Reach-Identity Management-Cloud-ARR-DBNRR-RPOSource: OktaOkta offers identity and access management (IAM) solutions with a global reach. It plays in the IAM space alongside other top players like Ping Identity (PING) and Microsoft (MSFT). IAM is a blend of cloud digital transformation and security transformation solutions. As a result, there are multiple C-level execs making a case for its products. The CIO deploys Okta's products for employee access control and identity management. The CTO deploys Okta's solutions for customer access control and identity management. This is done when shipping new products or redesigning existing products alongside the Chief Product Officer. The CISO adopts Okta's access security products as a part of his/her network security toolkit.When you have multiple C-level execs adopting your products to push change within an organization, the sales motion is simple because Okta's solutions simplify technical problems while cutting across multiple facets of the organization. Therefore, when Okta reported attractive growth metrics last quarter, the results weren't farfetched. Revenue growth (guiding for 33% growth in Q2'21) will outperform due to the cloud-centric nature of its solutions. ARR (annual recurring revenue) and DBNRR (120%+) will grow due to ease of upselling as Okta's product solve multiple problems for large organizations. Billings and RPO (remaining performance obligation) will also grow due to huge product stickiness driving long-term commitments.Going forward, Okta's growth factor will remain strong due to the favorable near-term tailwinds driven by the migration of more cloud workloads to cloud platforms. For a player recording huge growth in a fast-growing market, major growth worries mostly come from an indefensible moat. In rare cases, talent management costs can also pose a challenge.Platform-Margins-FCF-LiquidityOkta's identity cloud has helped it integrate and partner with other cloud platforms to accelerate the market penetration of its products. This is a function of the great usability of its products. Okta is just getting started with its product roadmap. Okta is growing the capabilities of its platform services. Platform services include new features to make Okta's platform programmable. This includes Okta Workflows for enterprises to automate complex processes without code. Okta has also introduced FastPass for passwordless logins to improve the usability of enterprise apps.Okta also announced partnerships with security players including VMware (VMW), Carbon Black (NASDAQ:CBLK), CrowdStrike (CRWD), and Tanium. For access management platforms, partnerships and integrations will be easy because cloud platforms don't want to lose prospects due to their lack of support for a popular IAM provider. Essentially, Okta is like the Chrome of logins. Its integration network, currently, supports over 6,500 cloud, on-prem, and mobile apps.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Okta's financials are supported by the huge billings and RPO commitment from its customers. This improves operating cash flow (OCF) which is driven by deferred revenue. OCF is partly supported by non-cash expenses (SBC, D&A). As margins expand due to more upsell/cross-sell, Okta will attain its long-term cash flow guidance. As the chart above indicates, opex % of revenue has declined y/y. Okta will realize cost savings due to minimal physical business activities due to COVID-19. This will be mildly offset by lower interest revenue due to low-interest rates. Okta is tapping the debt market to shore up its cash reserve due to the low-interest-rate environment. This is a brilliant financing strategy to manage earnings volatility from future equity dilution.Partnerships-Integrations-International ExpansionIt's tough for any formidable competitor to accumulate the resources to compete with Okta on fine details like usability and platform evolution. Access and identity management is Okta's bread and butter and it has acquired both the talent and technical capabilities to pull away from competitors. As long as it retains its talents while pushing for more go-to-market efficiency, Okta will be untouchable.On the macro front, investors should expect more volatility from businesses impacted by COVID-19. This mostly impacts billings. They should normalize towards the back half of the year.Growth-Moat-Analysts-MomentumOkta enjoys a combination of growth and valuation factors that are above its peers. This is a function of strong momentum and solid product adoption. The recent debt issuance indicates the market's confidence in its growth story. The debt was issued at an annual interest rate of 0.375%. The conversion price was pegged at $232 (32.5% premium to the last reported share price). Given its attractive liquidity and strong competitive posture, mispricing will largely result from a weak macro environment forcing a sector correction. Given its elevated valuation ratios, investors with a short-term investment outlook should be careful in initiating new positions.Source: AuthorDemand-side risk factors aren't much of a concern due to the fast adoption of its products. Execution risk isn't a worry as long as Okta drives sales efficiency without losing its top sales managers. Financial risk factors are also less of a concern due to its ample cash reserve and growing FCF. Though this could be weakened during quarters with lower than expected billings growth.Competitive worries are also minimal. The biggest risk factor will come from occasional sector corrections and momentum weaknesses.Demand-side tailwinds remain strong. Okta's financials point to a convincing path to GAAP profitability due to its strong competitive positioning and ability to drive growth at a reduced margin by upselling its installed base. Investors should maintain a long-term strategy to fully profit from future multiple expansion. Short-term bets should be hedged due to the volatility inherent in cloud stocks.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

This is a leading sign of strong usage growth.Source: SimilarWebIn the worst-case scenario in which SMBs struggle to pay their IT bills this quarter, Okta's cash flow and revenue growth might be impacted. Getting SMBs to make commitments this period will be tough. Regardless, Okta can leverage the current trend being adopted by most IT platforms by offering some of its services for free for a short period to build its sales pipeline and improve its CSR posture. Given the importance and sticky nature of its revenue, there is a strong possibility that it will convert most of its new leads to paying customers by 2021.Source: OktaOkta has enough cash on its balance sheet to weather a short-lived recession. Assuming sales are impacted, a decline in the growth factor will lead to a steady EPS factor as SG&A spend tracks growth. There is also the impact on capex as Okta is still in the growth phase, which means adding cloud capacity to expand its strength, and global reach might be slowed.Source: OktaOkta is a fairly balanced player. It doesn't have huge exposure to weak EMEA economies that most companies suffer. The Fed is doing a lot of work to stimulate the economy; regardless, there will be minor impacts due to slow business activities. I'm not worried about the competition. As stated earlier, Okta leads a lot of competition by a wide margin in the latest Gartner IAM quadrant. Its strong momentum this period will only widen the gap between Okta and its competitors.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Okta has held steady since the beginning of the pandemic suggesting investors have a long-term exit strategy. It's trading above the average analysts' price target of $142, which means the Street doesn't expect much expansion from here. Regardless, it is still vulnerable to downgrades of its growth factor if it doesn't beat its next earnings guide. Also, its value factor will be impacted if COVID-19 isn't contained, and the lockdown is extended across top cities. This makes it risky holding onto shares at the lofty valuation.Source: AuthorA few risk factors keep me up at night when it comes to Okta. Firstly, EPS dilution risk is a development I constantly track. However, given Okta's strong growth momentum, I believe the SBC bets will continue to drive positive FCF in the near term.I occasionally worry about globalization risk, though, globalization is why Okta is as popular as it is; therefore, the focus should be on a post-COVID-19 era, assuming we overlook revenue recognition issues ex-North America in the near term.Next is the tech sector risk.Okta's valuation is oversubscribed for the right reasons as it is entrenched in the midst of a lot of positive near term trends that will continue to uphold its growth. As a risk-averse investor, I will interpret this as a sign to only buy on further dips or broad market sell-offs.Source: AuthorOkta is tapping the nerves of a lot of positive trends swinging in its favor. These include remote work adoption, digital transformation acceleration, adoption of privacy and access security solutions, product integration with a lot of fast-growing apps, and superior value proposition of its product. This has made valuation resilient amidst the COVID-19 induced market meltdown.Valuation remains in the frothy territory due to the strong forward growth guide laid out by management.

This correction is smaller than most other companies. Despite the drop in share price, I believe that Okta has a strong track record with a strong brand and growing switching costs. At $128, however, it is overvalued by roughly 36% based on my base-case assumptions.(Source: Google)Okta has grown revenue from $41M in 2014 to $586M in 2019, compounding at 70% year on year. Throughout the same period, gross margins have expanded from 54% to 72%.Okta also estimates its total addressable market to be $55B. With sales of $586M, this puts Okta's market penetration at roughly 1%. This gives Okta a long runway for growth to capture market share. Okta has options to take market share such as new customer acquisitions, expanding its existing user base, and international expansion.(Source: Okta Investor Day)Okta has grown customers that contribute more than $100K from 1,043 to 1,467, representing a 41% increase. It has also grown >$500K customers from 153 to 243, a 59% increase. This increase in customers helps Okta reinforce its network effects:(Source: Okta Latest Annual Report)Once Okta gets enough large customers, it also benefits from the inertia of large enterprises from switching platforms. Companies generally do not want to risk lost data and productivity, which leads to business disruption. An imperfect data migration could lead to huge amounts of frustration and business risk that would cause any company to think twice about switching from Okta once it achieves scale. Okta also attempts to increase these switching costs with their integrations:(Source: Okta Latest Annual Report)Since Okta is a fairly high growth company with negative operating margins, we have to examine its balance sheet to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to fund its growth.Looking at its latest balance sheet, Okta has $520M of cash, $882M of short-term investments of cash with $937M of convertible notes. Out of the $937M of convertible notes, only $100M is short term. At a positive free cash flow of $36.3M, this puts Okta in a great cash position to fund future growth and handle any operating difficulties. It is unlikely that Okta would have to raise funds to meet its operational needs.(Source: Okta latest annual report)In an economic downturn, businesses may only retain software that is crucial to their operational survival, which could lead to stronger churn rates for Okta. Okta has to ensure that it continues to improve their customer value proposition so that enterprises view Okta's platform as indispensable.Okta also faces intense competition in this space that may lead to slower customer adoption on its platform. According to Gartner's magic quadrant for access management, Okta is currently a leader in this space. However, some of these competitors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have large existing enterprise customers and resources to obtain market share from Okta. Okta has to ensure that its platform continues to delight customers to gain market share and keep them from switching over to competitors.(Source: Gartner)1) Revenue growth at 35% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Okta's track record of high sales growth and its ability to penetrate its total addressable market. However, intense competition might put a lid on high sales growth in the future as Okta continues to expand its offering.2) Operating margin of 30% from 2027 onwards. Software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Okta's gross margins have remained above 65% since 2017. Once Okta scales further and profitability becomes a priority, the company should experience a high level of operating margin expansion through operating leverage. However, if Okta has to incur higher customer acquisition costs due to strong competition, there could be some downward pressure on its margins in the near term.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Okta will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Okta has an initial weighted cost of capital of 9%, which drops to 8% in the terminal year. The higher cost of capital reflects the higher risk of Okta having negative operating income and losing money. However, once the company achieves profitability and higher free cash flows, the risk should be reduced as reflected in the lower cost of capital.(Source: Author creation using Okta financials) (Figures are in $millions except per share data and percentages)The value I derived for Okta is roughly $9.5B for the entire company. This represents a 36% downside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high-growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $81 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against other software companies.(Source: Author creation using data from Seeking Alpha)Compared to other high-growth peers, Okta looks expensive in terms of price/sales and EV/sales ratios. Okta has a similar growth rate and worse operating margin compared to Zscaler, yet is priced more expensively. Okta is also more expensive than Twilio and MongoDB, which have higher growth rates than Okta and similar operating margin profiles.Potential investors have to decide if they believe Okta will be able to execute according to my base-case assumptions in the long run. If competition turns out to be weaker than expected, and future sales growth is stronger than my estimates, the recent pullback might make Okta a great buy."
4333881,103480,2020-03-24T10:40:12-04:00,"Single sign-on company Okta has been among the least-affected stocks in the broad market selldown, with shares approximately flat year-to-date.
        Okta's revenue growth, currently clinging around ~45% y/y, has been decelerating for multiple straight quarters.
        With billings growth stubbornly in the low 40s, Okta's deceleration curve should continue into FY21.
        At a time when many high-profile stocks like Alteryx have plunged into single-digit valuation multiples, Okta looks richly valued at ~18x forward revenues.","The coronavirus selloff has dramatically cleaved the performance of growth stocks in the technology sector into winners and losers. One of the biggest winners this year has been Okta (OKTA), the extremely popular software company whose single-sign on software allows its customers' employees and partners to securely log into internal sites.Okta's good fortunes stem from a combination of strong results (Okta solidly beat expectations in its recently-released fourth-quarter earnings, as well as guiding up for the current year) as well as widespread sentiment that the current work-at-home situation that has taken hold across most major companies in the United States will drive further adoption of secure login tools like Okta. And while neither of these theses are wrong, we have to ask ourselves if Okta's price has gotten out of reach - especially when we consider that many other high-growth stocks have fallen into the bargain bin.To me, Okta's valuation is its biggest risk. With shares having barely lost any value since the start of the year (versus an S&P 500 that's locked into a bear market and down more than 30%), Okta is essentially priced for perfection - and while its fundamental results are certainly good, we can't say that they're perfect. Okta's premium valuation versus other growth stock peers has dramatically extended in this selloff, and I believe Okta investors won't be able to enjoy the same bounceback that beaten-down stocks might when the markets finally rally again.A quick check on where Okta is currently trading: at current share prices around $120, Okta has a market cap of $14.63 billion. After we net off the $1.40 billion of cash and $937.7 million of convertible debt on Okta's balance sheet (the bulk of that debt becomes due in 2025, so we're not entirely concerned about Okta's liquidity or repayment timeline), the company has an enterprise value of $14.17 billion.Here's how that stacks up against Okta's recently-released guidance plan for FY21:Figure 1. Okta FY21 outlookSource: Okta Q4 earnings releaseNote that Okta's guidance plan for FY21 calls for a massive deceleration in growth to just 31-33% y/y, versus 45% y/y growth exiting Q4. Okta's billings growth rates have sagged below revenue growth for several quarters now, hinting at deceleration in the future. While Okta's 42% y/y billings growth rate in each of the past three quarters suggests that Okta's FY21 revenue plan may be a little conservative, investors should be prepared to see Okta's growth rates come down regardless - more likely into the mid-30s for the full year.Regardless, against the midpoint of Okta's guidance range, Okta's valuation currently stands at 18.3x EV/FY21 revenues. In contrast, look at the various other SaaS software companies that are each growing at or above Okta's growth rates that are now trading near or below a 10x forward revenue multiple:The bottom line here: better opportunities exist in the market. Lock in gains on Okta and reinvest elsewhere. I particularly like Alteryx (AYX) and Elastic (ESTC) at current prices - their subscription revenue bases and high degree of contribution from renewal/expansion deals should protect their business from too much coronavirus-induced impact, though valuations have fallen heavily from peaks.Let's now dive into Okta's most recent quarterly results in more detail. Recall that the key thesis here is not that Okta's fundamentals are in any immediate danger, but rather that its incredibly rich valuation multiple during a bear market essentially prices it for perfection. As we'll see here, Okta's results fall short of perfect.Figure 2. Okta 4Q20 resultsSource: Okta Q4 earnings releaseRevenues grew 45% y/y to $167.3 million, beating Wall Street's consensus expectations of $115.5 million (+35% y/y) by a solid ten-point margin. At this point, however, we're more than familiar with the fact that Okta routinely under-guides to Wall Street and sets a low bar for itself to achieve. To me, a more salient point is the fact that Okta's billings growth, stuck at 42% y/y for each of the past two quarters, has consistently logged growth below revenue growth rates - which is a harbinger for the deceleration that Okta is forecasting to in FY21.One positive highlight to add here though: Okta's net revenue retention rate, which slowed down last quarter, has increased to 119% in Q4 - a two-point increase from Q3. Given that upsell/expansion deals will be key to sustaining growth at a time when getting new business is difficult, this will be an increasingly important metric to watch in the near term.It's important to note that Bill Losch, Okta's CFO, has noted (as of the early March earnings call) that the coronavirus has done little damage to Okta's end-customer demand, and that the company's current guidance bakes in no macro slowdown. Per his remarks on the Q4 earnings call:Though the ""base case"" scenario for Okta assumes that its SSO products are fairly impervious to any coronavirus impact, there's a lot of uncertainty (especially overseas) with the virus especially around how long global economies are expected to be in shutdown mode, and the fact that Okta essentially forecasted a ""business as usual"" scenario for 2021 may pose some risk.Another weakness to call out is Okta's margin profile. Amid decelerating revenue growth rates, the company has done little to improve its operating margins. In Q4, Okta only improved its pro forma operating margin by one point to -3%; for the full fiscal year, two points to -8% - showcasing the fact that Okta has prioritized growth over improving profitability, which may not jive well with investors in a cautious bear marketFigure 3. Okta margin trendsSource: Okta Q4 earnings releaseWhen we look at these margins on a GAAP basis, the story is worse: Okta's GAAP operating margins sank three points in Q4 to -27%, and two points in FY20 to -32%. The only reason Okta is able to slightly improve pro forma operating margins is due to its heavy usage of non-cash stock comp, which is up 63% y/y in FY20 - far faster than revenue growth. Stock comp, however, isn't free - investors are paying for it with dilution of their shares. All in all, with revenue growth tipped to decelerate and GAAP operating margins actually deteriorating, I'd be careful of investing in Okta at peak valuations, especially when many peer SaaS companies have fallen so dramatically from their all-time highs. In my view, it's a good time to rotate out of Okta into more beaten-down names like Alteryx and Elastic."
4347281,105197,2020-05-13T16:15:15-04:00,"Okta’s valuation has been a key point of debate.
        The maker of access and identity control software has been witnessing strong sales momentum, with expectations of continued growth.
        While the Okta management wants to anchor us to the rule of 40, we think the latent growth potential is much stronger.
        Looking out through to the management guidance timeline, we find the acceleration in FCF could far outpace revenue growth, translating into triple-digit stock price returns.","Okta (OKTA) is a play on the increasing need for access control in multi and hybrid cloud environments. The rally in SaaS companies has elevated Okta to expensive valuations, making one question as to the underlying strength in a company that expects to continue making losses. While on the surface, the stock price does look overvalued, digging deeper we find the stock also has the potential for triple-digit returns. The biggest risk with Okta is on execution, which has been spotless thus far. We analyze management expectations and then try to understand if a 30% growth company can be valued at a 30x P/S.Okta is a leader in the cloud-based online identity management, a set of tools used to allow access. The company has seen strong growth over the years, driven by technology, strong customer growth and retention, account growth and investment in sales. Okta’s technology is rated among the best, as analyzed by Gartner.Source: OktaOkta has seen strong demand due to the increase in remote access requirements, necessitating an additional layer of security. The further use cases that arise from the near ban of travel could lead to a rise in the customer lifetime value of Okta customers.Another interesting metric is the sustained high retention rates. Per the 10K,Dollar based net retention rateSource: Okta Analyst Day 2020The durability of the retention rates bolsters Okta’s claim of growth in revenue per account.Source: Okta filings, Author calculationsWhile the growth rate of average revenue per customer (""ARPC"") had shown some recovery in 2020, the volume growth had fallen to 30% vs the average growth rate of 40% in the three years before 2020.Source: Okta filings, Author calculationsOkta’s re-iteration of its fiscal 2021 guidance on its analyst day points towards further momentum in pricing, albeit at a slower rate given the law of large numbers and some demand having been pulled forward due to the current focus on remote working.Source: Okta Analyst Day 2020The notable point here is the management expectation of a 31-33% y/y revenue growth vs the 47% seen for 2020. The decline in growth is likely to be a function of a decrease in customer growth rates and possible moderation in ARPC growth rates. Even from a longer-term perspective, growth is expected to remain around that 30% mark.Source: Okta Analyst Day 2020That brings into question the elephant in the room: Okta’s stratospheric valuationOkta trades at a P/S of 30x, which while makes the PSG at one (assuming a revenue growth expectation of 30%) also leaves little room for any errors in execution. Thus far, the management has given limited reasons for doubting them. Therefore, the management’s forecast warrants further analysis to see where the company stands when it comes to execution and valuation.As the first analysis, we consider the long-term targets laid out by the management across three scenarios. We then use the FCF estimates across all the scenarios to create a DCF and arrive at the following return expectations for the stock:Source: Author model (management expectations)The bull case refers to faster growth, base case refers to the current outlook and the bear case to the moderate growth scenarios, as outlined by the management.Given that the market expects the best from the company, the bull case is what will satisfy the need for stock price growth. Since the management expects the incremental demand for Okta’s software due to the newer use cases and product launches to sustain profitability and dollar growth in accounts to drive operating leverage, we further dig in the financials to understand the business better.The FCF per customer has been improving; however, at an FCF of $5k per customer, an enterprise value of $2.8 million per customer is quite a stretch.Source: Okta filings, Author calculationsThe ARPC of 75K versus the FCF per customer of 5k translates into an FCF margin of 6% (versus -2% last year).Source: Okta filings, Author calculationsAt this rate, Okta’s valuation from a P/FCF basis comes out to some 700x+.A typical argument in favor of Okta (and similar companies) is the growth potential and thus the appropriate multiple as P/S and not P/FCF. Given that the management is focused on outperforming the rule of 40 (sum of revenue growth and free cash flow margin should be 40 or more for growth companies) and the expectations of continued revenue growth, it becomes imperative to understand the operating leverage in the business.Source: Okta filings, Author calculationsSince the operating profit even on a non-GAAP level has been negative, and the management expects to continue investing in the business, the traditional definition of operating leverage may not apply to Okta.“Yeah, you know, when we set the longer-term model back in October of 2018, the model you know, always assumed that our move to profitability would be more back-end loaded. And the reason for that is, you know, we do focus on growth and profitability, but we’re optimizing for growth.”Source: Q4 2020 Results - Earnings Call TranscriptConsidering the management fascination with FCF and the fact that FCF is the only positive profit metric that the company has below the gross profit line, we define a metric: change in FCF/change in the number of customers (DFDC).Source: Okta filings, Author calculationsInterestingly the DFDC appears to be moving faster than FCF per customer, implying that the operating leverage in the business does exist and the growth in DFDC shows that the earning per customer has also been growing, which has been flowing down to the FCF.Source: Okta filings, Author calculationsNot only has the DFDC turned positive since 2018 but also has DFDC been mirroring the trend in ARPC.Source: Okta filings, Author calculationsDuring its analyst day, the company showcased two specific examples of how newer use cases have led to incremental revenues.Source: Okta Analyst Day 2020Per the company, in addition to deepening its relationship with the customers, new use cases can lead to incremental revenues of anywhere between 3-5x of the use case. The growth in DFDC points towards incremental revenues entirely flowing down to the FCF level.We thus change the focus of our analysis from the headline revenue growth and FCF margin to ARPC and DFDC. We explore a range of scenarios from strong volume and pricing growth to more moderate expectations.Source: Author model (HWI expectations)We have only considered the bull case, since here the upside versus what the management expectations of the bull case appear to be much higher.Our estimates are more aggressive than that of the management’s, as evident in the revenue numbers.Source: Author modelHowever, we do feel that at the claimed level of operating leverage, the management is possibly lowballing FCF expectations.Source: Author modelAs shown with the growth in DFDC, the stated management expectations of back-end loaded growth in profitability and the management’s land-and-expand strategy; we feel confident that our FCF margin outlook is not aggressive.Okta is a play on increasing focus on security and access. The company has done well to grow its business over the years. This earnings call is likely to cement Okta’s position as a non-discretionary application technology company and thus lead to multiple expansion. The only major risk that we see is from execution issues. While competition from Ping has been highlighted at times, we note that Okta’s only enemy could be Okta’s failure to capitalizing the momentum the company has."
4318471,35181,2020-01-22T22:17:54-05:00,"Revenue growth is 45+%, and FCF has turned positive.Okta has a very lofty valuation when measured by forward sales multiple.The share price hasn't participated in the recent market bullishness for software companies.Based on expensive valuation and lack of price action, I remain neutral.","The last time that I checked in on Okta, Inc. (OKTA) was back in June of last year. In the article ""Okta: If You Have To Ask, You Can't Afford It,"" I concluded that although the company appears to have a very bright future, the stock was extremely overvalued. Thus, I gave the company a Neutral rating. Okta stock has appreciated 3% since the article was published, whereas the S&P 500 is up almost 14%.Today, I am back to check up on this high-growth SaaS company and it appears that not much has changed, although I am softening my position on valuation somewhat by considering forward earnings estimates instead of forward sales estimate. Doing so eases my concerns regarding valuation, but a high level of SG&A expenses and lack of stock movement while other software stocks are breaking out keep me on the sidelines. I am retaining my Neutral rating on this stock.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)As can be seen from the above stock chart, Okta is trading within a horizontal channel. In order for me to get on board the bull train, I would want to see the stock price penetrate the upper resistance at ~$132 in convincing fashion. Until then, I suggest staying out of this stock in spite of the company fundamentals which are reasonably good.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple and estimated sales growth.Okta's annual sales growth rate is 48%, down from the 3-year growth rate of 67%, a rate that would be very hard to sustain.(Source: Portfolio123)One reason why the growth rate is decelerating is that the company market is shifting towards large enterprises, which is a good thing. Contract values are larger, but they take longer to land. A second reason is that international YoY growth, at 37%, appears to be slowing. In Q2, international YoY growth was 45%, and in Q1, it was 60%. The question of slowing international growth came up during the Q&A on the Q3 2020 earnings call. Management didn't really address this phenomenon, at least not to my liking.Okta's free cash flow margin TTM turned positive in 2019 and stands at 4.7%. The fact that the free cash flow margin has been steadily increasing since 2017 is a good sign.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40 - some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the software company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In Okta's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 48% + 5% = 53%Okta easily beats the Rule of 40, indicating that it has a healthy balance between growth and profits.Despite the high score on the Rule of 40, I am still a bit concerned because of the high cash burn. To determine cash burn, I examine the SG&A expense margin.(Source: Portfolio123)Note that the above chart includes R&D expenses as part of SG&A expenses. The SG&A expense margin is 104%, which means that more money is spent on SG&A plus R&D than the company brings in via revenue.Normally, I would turn a blind eye to such a high expense margin, but I am concerned due to the very lofty valuation when using the forward sales multiple.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to those of the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Okta is significantly above the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is much higher than that of its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Okta is significantly overvalued relative to the typical stock in my digital transformation universe based on Sales/EV multiple.The Sales/EV multiple tells me that the stock is quite overvalued, but my value assessment changes when I substitute next year's earnings estimates for forward sales.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The results shown on this second scatter plot suggest that Okta is fairly valued based on next year's earnings estimates. Therefore, I have to conclude that the company is fairly valued so long as it maintains the earnings estimated for next year.I believe that Okta is a strong company and will grow by leaps and bounds in the future. Revenue growth is ~48% YoY and free cash flow has turned positive in 2019, after a steady rise for the last few years. These are the positive points for investment in Okta.On the flip side, I find that Okta is burning cash, with an SG&A expense higher than its revenues. This unto itself isn't a major concern, except for the fact that the company's valuation based on forward sales is extremely high - one of the highest in my database, as a matter of fact. My valuation is tempered by future earnings estimates, which make it more palatable. But any shortfall in future earnings would cause the stock to fall in price pretty substantially.Based on the lofty forward sales multiple, large cash burn and lethargic stock price action, I am retaining my Neutral rating on Okta."

Okta, on the other hand, is already generating positive free cash flows, and management has ambitious targets over the middle term.Okta intends to deliver revenue growth rates in the range of 30% to 35% over the next five years and a free cash flow margin of 20-25% in fiscal 2024. These targets are not easy to achieve, but they are not unrealistic either when considering the company's track record and future opportunities.Total revenue was last quarter reached $167.3 million, an increase of 45% year over year.

This is indicating that management tends to provide modest guidance and to overdeliver over time, which is encouraging in terms of assessing Okta's ability to meet its targets going forward.Source: Seeking AlphaOkta is a market leader in an area with plenty of opportunities for growth in the years ahead. The company is firing on all cylinders and generating positive free cash flow, and there is a good chance that revenue growth will continue being strong while profit margins expand in the next 5 years. Vigorous top-line growth, in combination with expanding profit margins, will provide a double boost to earnings and cash flows.Competition is always an important risk factor to watch, especially from large players with deep pockets such as IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). These companies have a wide reach among large corporations all over the world, and they also have solid reputations for reliability.However, Okta is a specialized player with the first-mover advantage in top quality identity services, and it benefits from remarkably high customer switching costs. Companies that are relying on Okta for their identity services would be very reluctant to change to another provider due to the risks and difficulties that this transition would potentially carry.Besides, having a large customer base also means more usage data for Okta, and this data is enormously valuable when it comes to permanently improving the quality of the company's services. Considering the company's competitive strength and world-class technologies, it is not unreasonable to say that a big technology company such as Microsoft could be more interested in buying Okta than trying to compete aggressively in Okta's main areas of strength.The biggest drawback is arguably valuation, since Okta is trading at a price to sales ratio above 30. The company is one of the most promising businesses in the industry, but this quality is also acknowledged by the market and incorporated into the stock price.Okta can grow into its valuation over time, and there is a good chance that the stock will deliver double-digit returns over the long term from current price levels. But, still, the stock is fairly priced as opposed to undervalued at around $150 per share.I am not against buying Okta at these prices, because the company has enough strength to outperform expectations in the future. After all, the best growth opportunities are seldom available at cheap valuations, and these kinds of companies can many times sustain rapid growth for longer periods than what the market is giving them credit for. The bar is set quite high for Okta, but the company does not lack the capability to overdeliver.However, it is a more conservative assumption to estimate that revenue growth will be around 30% per year in the next five years, which would mean that the stock is fairly valued right now.For those looking to start building a position in Okta at current prices, it makes sense to start doing it slowly. Perhaps buying one-third of your intended position at these prices and waiting for a better entry price over the middle term with the other two-thirds of the position.One thing looks quite clear, though, Okta is a high-quality growth stock, and any pullback down the road could represent a remarkably attractive buying opportunity."

In particular, we note that many of 2018 and early 2019's biggest winners are no longer leading the pack, and that some of the highest-flying stocks in the sector have stalled in the face of widespread caution against loss-leading growth stocks.Sitting firmly in this camp is Okta (OKTA), the enterprise software company best known for its single-sign on product. Though one of the fastest-growing companies in the sector, routinely putting up growth in the ~50% range over the past several quarters, even Okta is no stranger to the laws of gravity - and its growth rate has been decelerating, perhaps a bit more than investors would have liked. Okta's high valuation multiple has always depended on its premium growth rates, so it stands to reason that lower growth would signal the beginning of multiples contraction. For two quarters in a row now, investors have been disappointed with Okta's results (despite beating estimates both times), and post-Q3 earnings the stock remains ~20% below its year-to-date highs:Data by YChartsAt this juncture, investors may be tempted to buy the dip in Okta. After all, this is a premium growth stock that is rarely ever on sale. In my view, however, investors should continue holding off on this name - Okta has plenty further to fall.To be fair, there's plenty to like about Okta. Its SSO product has become the default, ""best-of-breed"" category leader in the sign-on space, used by some of the largest companies in the world and without any significant competition. It's a true ""horizontal"" software product, with a use case in just about any industry. And Okta is one of the best examples of a ""land and expand"" business model, where a smaller deployment within a larger customer can eventually spread to multiple departments and perhaps the whole firm, bringing in plenty of expansion billings. But despite this, Okta has failed to drive meaningful operating leverage. We'll discuss the company's most recent quarterly results shortly, but GAAP operating margins fell this quarter while pro forma margins stayed flat. The company has continued to spend aggressively on sales in order to chase growth, even despite decelerating revenue growth rates. R&D costs also rose 52% y/y this quarter, seven points faster than revenue growth. Especially amid all-time market highs, investors have grown to value profits as much as (or perhaps even more than) growth - and without a proven track record of delivering on the bottom line, Okta's bloated valuation multiple makes little sense.Despite having been knocked down from all-time highs, Okta shares still remain prohibitively expensive. At present share prices near $115 (~10% lower than last quarter), Okta trades at a market cap of $14.05 billion. After we net off the $1.37 billion of cash and $0.92 billion of convertible debt on Okta's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $13.60 billion. For next fiscal year FY21, Wall Street analysts are expecting consensus revenues of $753.7 million for Okta, representing 31% y/y growth over the midpoint of Okta's latest FY20 revenue guidance range of $574-575 million. This implies that Okta is trading at an absurdly high valuation multiple of 18.0x EV/FY21 revenues, squarely putting it among the highest-valued stocks in the software sector (shown in the chart below)Data by YChartsIn my view, we should be cognizant of Okta's high GAAP loss margins and its decelerating growth, and how they can impact a multiples contraction in 2020 as enthusiasm for Okta continues to dwindle. There's little upside left in this stock, as each quarter the company is defending an ultra-high valuation with only decent results. Steer clear here and wait for Okta to dip further before dipping in.Let's now look at Okta's third-quarter results in greater detail. The company's earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Okta 3Q20 resultsSource: Okta 3Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 45% y/y to $153.0 million. While beating Wall Street's estimates of $143.9 million (+36% y/y) by a wide mile, investors weighed more heavily on the fact that revenues decelerated four points from last quarter's 49% y/y growth rate, perhaps marking the beginning of a steeper deceleration curve. Recall as well that one of the red flags emerging out of Okta's previous quarter was the fact that billings growth had decelerated eleven points from 53% y/y in Q1 to 42% y/y in Q2. In Q3, Okta has proven that Q2 results were not just a fluke, as the company was unable to raise its billings profile from the dreaded 42% y/y. In addition, Okta's CFO noted that the company's dollar-based net retention rate - the best gauge of its ""land and expand"" business model, and a closely-watched metric across the SaaS sector - slipped one point to 117%, versus 118% last quarter.Perhaps the only silver lining on the business demand side was the fact that contract durations are trending upward. Per CFO Bill Losch's prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call:Profitability metrics were also murky this quarter. All of Okta's major expense categories saw major jumps in GAAP spending: R&D costs rose 52% y/y, sales and marketing costs rose 53% y/y, and general and administrative spend rose 46% y/y - all at a faster clip than revenue growth. GAAP operating losses, meanwhile, widened from -$28.5 million last quarter to -$45.7 million this quarter, representing a worsening in GAAP operating margins from -27% last quartet to -30% this quarter. Pro forma operating margins remained flat at -5%, however - representing how large of a gap Okta's stock-based comp drives.With the market continuing to teeter at all-time highs, investors will be mindful of both GAAP and non-GAAP profits. To Okta's credit on the non-GAAP side, stock comp doesn't cost anything in cash, and to illustrate that, Okta's free cash flow is up sharply - year-to-date, the company has generated a 4% FCF margin and $18.1 million in FCF, versus a -4% margin and -$11.5 million in FCF in the prior-year period. But pro forma operating margins and FCF mask the fact that Okta's total expenses and compensation have risen sharply, in a mix of cash and stock, in order to support its growth - and at the end of the day, whether paid out in cash or in stock dilution, investors are bearing the brunt of the expense. And for the time being, Okta's GAAP operating margins seem nowhere near to hitting breakeven.With Okta's stock trading at an elevated ~18x forward revenue multiple, the stock is essentially priced for perfection. Its most recent results, however, show that Okta is anything but perfect. The company's revenue growth is beginning to decelerate sharply, driven by a lower billings growth rate that has now persisted for two quarters. At the same time, expenses have continued to race higher, driving down the company's GAAP operating margins. In a wider market meltdown, there's little chance of Okta keeping its high-teens valuation multiple. Investors are better off investing elsewhere, specifically in names that offer good growth at a reasonable value - names I particularly like at the moment are Workday (WDAY), Yext (YEXT), and Elastic (ESTC)."

I remain bullish on the near term demand for Okta's products, given its leadership in the access management niche.In Q3, opex grew by 47% (non-GAAP), largely explaining the massive revenue growth as headcount ramped 44%.

Okta's ability to attract top talents is impressive, and its success amongst large enterprises is a testament to its improved sales strategy and product strength. Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Going forward, management is guiding for sustained positive free cash flow. While operating cash flow is mostly a function of stock-based compensation as earnings are yet to contribute positively to free cash flow, improved operating capital as Okta scales its SaaS offering will drive deferred revenue and accounts receivable, a key component of working capital.In the near term, management doesn't seem to worry about operating margins, though it will be nice to have more color around improvement in sales efficiency. Regardless, I'm satisfied with Okta's sustained success in the access security space.Its recent debt issue raised its cash position to $1.37 billion. Part of this went into share buyback, and that partly explains the strong share price momentum in the past couple of months. I see the rest of the cash going into sales initiatives to drive revenue as the company expands its business beyond the United States. I expect the company to expand its capabilities beyond access security. Therefore, I'm anticipating an acquisition in the near term. Its lack of product diversification beyond access security remains one of my near term concerns.Source: GartnerManagement reiterated its product differentiation when quizzed about its competitive positioning during the last conference call. The Gartner quadrant above highlights the level of competition in the access management space, which has small players and big names like Microsoft (MSFT).

4291867,102101,2019-09-16T14:18:38-04:00,"Okta's valuation has experienced a revision of reality.While the company's growth narrative and competitive positioning are strong, I expect the stock to be valued with a new scale going forward.The new debt issuance might also cast an ugly shadow on Okta's valuation.I will be reiterating a BUY rating at a sub $100/share price point.","Okta's (OKTA) valuation has significantly corrected since the last earnings call. While I maintain a buy recommendation due to my strong conviction in management's ability to execute coupled with the company's unique positioning in its niche space, I believe it's important to shed some light on the signs that were missed building up to the recent correction. This will also give investors some perspective to avoid getting caught in a similar bubble in the future.To clarify, I'm not calling to abandon ship. I believe strongly in what management is doing. If you followed my previous thesis, I recommended that investors should wait for a sell-off building up to the earnings report before acquiring a position. I feel that recommendation was weak as it failed to provide guidance for risk-averse investors with a large position on how to manage their risk appetite.Okta is one of those names where you simply can't make a buy or sell recommendation. This is because management has a strong grasp on the company's growth narrative, and there are catalysts to drive near term revenue growth. This reality tends to swing valuation back and forth between the overvaluation and the oversold territory.However, after the recent sell-off, which was deeper than I anticipated, I ran my numbers again, and I found some insights that I feel think I should have shared with investors.When performing investment research, better value is added when you provide a recommendation for both risk-averse and risk-loving investors. For risk-loving investors, buying a SaaS company with expected annual revenue of $560 million at a market cap of $12 billion sounds fair given that revenue is growing at the rate of 41% and you have little competition picking at your heels. However, for risk-averse investors, it's a no-no. The volatility that will ensue will be too much to stomach, and risk-averse investors often can be guilt-tripped into panic selling after an overdrawn correction like we recently witnessed.Investment is as much about the narratives as the numbers. Merely telling investors a stock is pricey doesn't drive much conviction for them, and that was the mistake I made in my last thesis. I think I let my love of the stock get a little ahead of my need to drive home a strong conviction about the volatility inherent in buying a niche cybersecurity play whose valuation was clearly overstretched.After the last earnings call, my takeaway is that Okta sold off because it was priced to perfection worsened by the recent news of the $1 billion senior note offering. In retrospect, it was glaring that risk-averse investors had to be careful buying at the lofty valuation we had in August. I don't fault those who sold to lock in profits.The company continues to target large enterprises which means revenue will benefit from increasing average deal size. Its products continue to rank highly on Gartner's and Forrester's quadrant for Identity as a service solution. That underscores Okta's go-to-market strength and the strong demand for its products. Going forward, Okta will continue to sustain its momentum though the recent sell-off might have recalibrated the minds of investors who will now be more careful not to overstretch valuation multiples.The first red flag I noticed was from CyberArk's (NASDAQ:CYBR) valuation. Like Okta, CyberArk is a niche cyber play with a market cap of $3.8 billion, FY'19 expected revenue of 419 million and revenue growth rate of 23%. CyberArk trades at an EV/Sales of 8.4 and EV/EBITDA of 44 while Okta trades at an EV/Sales of 24 with a negative EV/EBITDA.It's clear that as Okta matures, it's going to correct to a valuation akin to CyberArk. The reason I'm sure of this is that Okta is a niche player with a well defined TAM. Unlike network security players such as Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) whose growth rate can maintain the double-digit momentum for several years, niche players like Okta approach the 20s to the mid-teens growth rate in less than three years. The recent correction just gave us a taste of what to expect in the future. It's becoming clear to equity investors that Okta might not need that much equity investment to preserve and grow its market share in its niche position. Therefore, the sell-off we just witnessed is equity investors saying they will be more than willing to swap their Okta shares for shares of a stock trading at a lower valuation multiple. It's also possible that they are selling to lock in profits. Regardless, it's clear that valuation multiples will continue to cool off from here. This might be the reason management is raising debt to fund its future growth initiatives. The unreliability of equity investors to keep its valuation stable amidst its rapid double-digit growth rate shouldn't be overlooked. We are in a low-interest environment; therefore, the debt issuance is largely justifiable. However, given Okta's lack of profitability, the debt is going to look ugly on Okta's balance sheet. It might also be an Achilles heel that equity investors will continue to point to in future. I've seen it happen to a competitor (FireEye (FEYE)) in the past.Investors have experienced an unprecedented shift in reality. Like the thanksgiving turkey, Okta's recent price action has proven to investors that every day isn't Christmas. As a result, I expect investors to be more cautious with their pricing going forward. This reality will drive a lower valuation multiple in the near term. The correction might continue. However, I see the current price point and further corrections as decent entry points.I will be reiterating my BUY rating with a sub $100/share price target."

Management has executed well in recent quarters, and there are ample catalysts to propel the stock in the long term. However, recent macro developments have made the stock more sensitive to another correction. Given the earnings performance of most SaaS stocks, it's safe to conclude that the market is expecting nothing less than a beat and guidance raise for a SaaS stock to preserve or enjoy multiple expansion. Anything short of that and the stock gets punished. That's how brutal it has gotten.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)The P/S graph above details the ranking and median TTM P/S ratio of 17 SaaS stocks. Nearly all of them are unprofitable. Okta has the second-highest TTM P/S ratio in this ranking. From a peer-average valuation, it's safe to assume Okta is overvalued. However, the P/S ratio is a function of future revenue growth. The P/S ratio is easily diluted if the forward revenue growth rate is high. For example, given that the P/S ratio has a direct correlation with the market cap, a 100% forward revenue growth has a 100% dilution impact on the price to sales ratio. A company with a P/S ratio of 10x projected to grow at 100% will have a forward P/S of 5x. Therefore, we can't say such a company is overvalued, given its huge growth rate.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)To quickly identify stocks trading at a premium to their forward revenue growth estimate, we only need to find stocks below the red line on the forward revenue growth chart and check to see if their P/S ratio is above the red line in the TTM P/S chart.Okta and Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM) are the only stocks that satisfy this condition. If all other conditions remain constant, Okta will be trading at a P/S ratio of 16x if it delivers on its 2018 revenue promise. That's still above the average TTM P/S ratio of its peers.The Street has an average price target of $146 on 41% revenue growth in FY2020 and 31% revenue growth in FY2021. Within that period, EPS is expected to remain negative.I have a PT range of $88-100. This is driven by my belief in management's ability to drive the growth narrative, coupled with Okta's strong positioning in the cloud security space. However, given the recent spate of volatility amongst SaaS stocks, coupled with Okta's vulnerability to more correction, given its bloated valuation compared to its peers, investors should not overrule their exposure to more market correction. Some investors have also shared similar concerns. I will be highlighting Puche's comment as it echoes my current sentiments about the current state of the SaaS space:At the current price, Okta is tough to hold, and it's not clear if algos wouldn't react to the slightest softness from the next earnings call.Source: NasdaqUsing data from Nasdaq, short interest is now near an all-time high. This has been fueled by macro uncertainty with regards to the US-China trade war driving a sector rotation into safe havens, and also by the aftermath of the WeWork (WE) IPO, which has birthed a new generation of short-sellers who are suddenly more confident to go after overvalued SaaS plays.Here are the charts fueling confidence.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)As you can see, Okta is far from profitability.

Customer confidence has fueled Okta's product development. Last quarter, it released DynamicScale, a leading customer identity solution that supports over 500,000 authentications per minute. The high capacity customer identity offering enables organizations to support the highly-trafficked apps and traffic bursts such as those experienced during a new product release, a viral marketing campaign, or a major shopping weekend.Okta greatly benefits from the app diversity that exists within an organization. According to Okta's reports, within its customer base, the average number of apps used by an organization grew 6% over the year to 88 this year compared with 83 apps a year ago, and 72 apps three years ago. Okta's solutions are helping simplify and secure the access to these multiple apps by employees, customers, or partners. There is competition from big vendors like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), but Okta is not worried. Okta realizes that Microsoft's IAM capability through Azure focuses on Microsoft's technology instead of building an IAM that can cater to this wide range of apps.The market was pleased with its performance. Its stock gained 5% in the after-hours trading session. However, the current Coronavirus-driven market fear has hurt the stock as well. Its stock is currently trading at $119.21 and a market cap of $14.64 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $142.98 in July last year. The stock was trading at a 52-week low of $78.45 nearly a year ago.Original postEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), a leading player in the industry, recently announced its second quarter results that continued to outpace market expectations. But the recent volatility in the stock market sent the stock tumbling this week.Revenues for the second quarter increased 49% to $140.5 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $131.2 million. Net loss was $43 million, compared to $39.2 million a year ago. Adjusted net loss was $5.5 million, or $0.05 cents a share, compared with previous year's loss of $16.4 million and the Street's forecast of a loss of $0.11 per share.By segment, subscription services revenues increased 51% to $132.5 million. Professional services and the others segment revenues grew 19% to $8 million. Total calculated billings grew 42% to $155.8 million.Among key metrics, Okta added 450 new customers in the quarter to end with 7,000 net customers, an increase of 36% over the year. Customers with more than $100,000 annual contract value (ACV) increased 46% to 1222, driven by new enterprise customers.For the third quarter, Okta forecast revenues of $143-$144 million with a net loss of $0.13-$0.12 per share. It expects to end the year with $560-$563 million in revenues and non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.44-$0.42. The market was looking for revenues of $140.21 million for the quarter with a loss of $0.09 per share and revenues of $547.57 million for the year with a net loss of $0.46 per share.Okta is driving revenue growth through product innovation and by focusing on a platform-driven approach. Earlier this year, it had introduced Okta Hooks, a new functionality of the Okta Identity Cloud that allows developers to create custom integrations for the Okta Integration Network. Developers can include identity proofing and verification into consumer registration decisions and automate IT Service Management actions.Okta also opened up its platform into customizable blocks to allow developers to build unlimited use cases with the Okta Identity Engine. The platform features were launched earlier this year and Okta claims to be witnessing strong traction through the change.Earlier this year, it also launched Okta Advanced Server Access, a new way to secure access to critical infrastructure, and Okta Access Gateway to extend the Okta Identity Cloud to on-premise apps. Okta Advanced Server Access centralizes access controls for organizations leveraging on-premises, hybrid, and cloud infrastructure to mitigate the risk of credential theft, reuse, sprawl, and abandoned administrative account. The Access Gateway was another security feature that allowed organizations to secure access to on-premise applications and protect their hybrid cloud without changing how their apps worked.Recently, Okta was ranked the leader, for the third consecutive quarter, in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Access Management.The market was pleased with Okta's result announcement last month and the stock gained 3% in the after-hours session. The stock has fallen since then, primarily due to market turbulence. Overall cloud computing stocks have taken a beating, and Okta is no exception. There's no clear reasoning on why the stocks declined, but there's speculation that large investors are shifting their portfolio.Okta's stock is currently trading at $107.22 with a market capitalization of $12.5 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $141.85 in July this year. The stock was trading at a 52-week low of $41.88 nearly a year ago."
4291676,73185,2019-09-16T05:33:31-04:00,"OKTA stock is in the midst of its second worst correction ever.The fundamentals remain healthy and robust.The stock is now undervalued relative to the company's long-term earnings growth potential - a rarity for a momentum growth stock.Optics will improve into the end of the year, and the technical picture implies that the worst of this sell-off is over.This is a compelling opportunity to buy the dip.","Shares of cloud identity and access management giant Okta (OKTA) have been on fire for most of 2019 - up until recently. Year-to-date, through the end of July, OKTA stock was up an impressive 120%. But, the stock has dropped more than 20% since then - marking its second biggest correction ever (the first was in late 2018, when all stocks were in sell-off mode).We believe recent weakness in OKTA stock is a great buying opportunity into a secular winner. Our ""buy the dip"" thesis here is predicated on three ideas. First, OKTA stock is a long-term winner with great secular growth fundamentals, and those fundamentals are presently being undervalued by the market - which is super rare for a momentum growth stock. Second, the optics surrounding OKTA stock should meaningfully improve into the end of the year, providing healthy support for a rebound bid. Third, the technical picture seems to imply that OKTA stock should find its footing around $100, before resuming its secular march higher.Big picture - the recent significant correction in OKTA stock is a medium to long-term buying opportunity, and nothing more.Data by YChartsFirst, let's understand why OKTA stock has sold off sharply. Long story short, there has been a massive rotation out of richly valued momentum stocks, and into beaten up value stocks - illustrated by the sharp and unusual divergence between the iShares Momentum Factor ETF (MTUM) and the iShares Value Factor ETF (VLUE) in September. This is nothing to be alarmed about. Instead, it may actually be a bullish sign. Over the past twenty years, huge momentum to value shifts have tended to follow choppy markets, and precede big market rallies.Why? The logic is pretty simple. During choppy and economically uncertain times, investors ditch economically-sensitive value stocks that require a good economy to go higher, and pile into momentum growth stocks that don't require a good economy to go higher (since they have secular tailwinds). But, as the global economic picture improves, investors unwind that trade, and start booking profits on those momentum stocks and buying the dip in those beaten-up value stocks (since they should move higher now that the economy is getting better).Consequently, huge momentum to value shifts in the market should be interpreted positively. It's a vote of confidence from the equity markets that the global economic picture is improving. As such, we think the momentum to value shift is a temporary phenomena which will kick-start a broad market rally - the likes of which should lift all stocks, both momentum and value. See late 2016 and early 2017 - which is the last time a big shift like this happened. Both VLUE and MTUM rallied after a brief period wherein MTUM fell flat.Data by YChartsData by YChartsSecond, let's dive into the fundamentals underlying OKTA stock. In order to understand those fundamentals, investors need to understand the space in which Okta operates - identity and access management, or IAM.Broadly, IAM is the process by which companies make sure the right people and the right devices are securely connected to the right software systems. In other words, it is an identity-based approached to information and data security wherein, as opposed to outfitting the whole ecosystem with a ""castle"" of defense, each individual is outfitted with an ""armor"" of defense, so that each individual can safely and securely navigate around the ecosystem with the utmost flexibility.This is a huge growth industry in the global IT market. We point investors to this abstract from Grand View Research to understand the secular tailwinds underpinning double-digit growth across the IAM market for the foreseeable future. In short, enterprise software ecosystems are becoming increasingly complex and decentralized, so much so that traditional security solutions aren't the best answer. It's very hard to create a castle of security in enterprise environments that have remote work-forces, or have multiple IoT devices, or employ a bring-your-own-device policy, or any combination of those things. As such, enterprises are increasingly looking towards IAM solutions as a way to employ cloud security while simultaneously optimizing flexibility.Here's the attractive part for investors. According to Grand View Research, the global IAM market measured about $10 billion in 2018. According to Gartner, global IT spend measured north of $3.6 trillion in 2018. Thus, as a percent of global IT spend, the global IAM market accounts for a tiny ~0.3% share. But, that share has risen consistently from ~0.2% in 2015, and projects to keep rising for the foreseeable future, as enterprises shift more and more IT spend into the IAM space to optimize flexibility in an increasingly dynamic, mobile, and decentralized digital economy.According to numbers from Grand View Research and Gartner, the IAM market should measure around $24 billion by 2025, or about 0.5% of global IT spend. We think secular trends will keep the IAM market in growth mode well after that, and are projecting for the IAM market to grow to just under $40 billion by 2030 - equal to about 0.75% of global IT spend.(Data Sources: Internal Estimates, Grand View Research, and Gartner)Within the secular growth IAM market, there are many players, including big name players like Microsoft (MSFT), IBM (IBM), SAP (SAP), and Oracle (ORCL). But, Okta has differentiated itself as the leader of the pack, mostly because the company specializes exclusively on IAM, whereas for many of its bigger competitors, IAM is just one vertical among many in their ecosystems. Consequently, Okta has transformed into the hyper-growth leader - indeed, both Gartner and Forrester have named Okta as the leader in this space, while the company has fired off 50%-plus revenue growth year after 50%-plus revenue growth year.Yet, Okta is still a relatively small player in the space. Combining company data with Grand View Research market data, we believe that Okta owns just 4% of the IAM market, which roughly lines up with third party estimates. That is up from 1% share in 2015, 2% share in 2016, and 3% share in 2017. Further, combining Wall Street consensus revenue forecasts and Grand View Research market data, Okta reasonably projects to control about 5% of the market in 2019, 6% in 2020, and 7% in 2021.In other words, Okta has been, still is, and will continue to expand market share in the IAM market at a cadence of roughly 1% per year. We believe this cadence of roughly 1% IAM market share expansion per year should persist in the long run, given Okta's healthy momentum and the fact that the company remains a relatively small player. Consequently, by 2030, we project Okta as a 15% player in the global IAM market - which nets out to about $6 billion in revenues by 2030, for a compounded annual revenue growth rate from 2015 to 2030 of over 30%.(Data Sources: Grand View Research, SEC Filings, and Internal Estimates)More than being a big revenue growth company, Okta also operates at sky-high 70%-plus gross margins, which appear well on their way to 80% at scale. This huge gross margin profile creates visibility for Okta to produce sizable profits in the long run.Consider this. Okta's adjusted operating expense rate in 2015 was almost 140%. It has since dropped to 100% in 2016, 95% in 2017, and 85% in 2018. In other words, revenue scale is doing what it's supposed to be doing - driving positive operating leverage. How low can the opex rate go? The competitors named above - Oracle, Microsoft, and IBM - operate at around 30% to 45% opex rates. It's unlikely that Okta can drop its opex rate down to 30%, given that it will have a much smaller revenue base than Microsoft. But, a 40% opex rate at scale on nearly $6 billion in revenue seems entirely doable.Net-net, then, Okta at scale projects as a company with 80% gross margins and a 40% opex rate. That combination implies 40% operating profit margins in the long run. That's big. On nearly $6 billion in revenue by 2030, we think 40% operating profit margins could reasonably produce nearly $11 in EPS.(Data Sources: SEC Filings and Internal Estimates)MSFT and SAP trade around 22x to 26x forward earnings today. Okta has bigger gross margins than both of those companies, and will likely be growing more quickly in 2030 than they are growing today. Thus, we think OKTA stock in 2030 will reasonably trade around 25x to 30x forward earnings.Taking the midpoint (27.5x) and applying that to $11 in 2030 projected EPS, we arrive at a 2029 price target for OKTA stock of over $300. Discounting that price target back by 10% per year, we arrive at a 2019 price target of about $116 - above today's price tag. Thus, from a fundamental perspective, we conclude that the recent sell-off has plunged OKTA stock into undervalued territory, which is exceptionally rare for a secular growth stock of OKTA's caliber.Data by YChartsOn the optics side of things, we have largely already discussed this. Momentum stocks have fallen out of favor over the past few weeks. This won't last long. Investors won't sell Okta and buy Rite Aid (RAD) into perpetuity. Instead, this is just a temporary shift that represents a reversion to the norm - momentum stocks got way overextended relative to value stocks in the summer of 2019, and investors are now re-balancing their portfolios to be, well, more balanced.History says this re-balancing won't last long. The last time a major re-balancing like this happened was in mid-to-late 2016. Value's out-performance of momentum was very short lived. It lasted a few months, before momentum bounced back in a big way.The same dynamic should repeat this time around. As such, while momentum may under-perform in the near term, such under-performance will turn into over-performance within the next few months, and most momentum stocks - OKTA stock included - should rally into the end of year.Data by YChartsWhen it comes to the technical picture, we can see that it looks like the worst is over for OKTA stock. During the summer of 2019, OKTA stock was forming a bearish head-and-shoulders pattern. That pattern has almost fully played out. OKTA stock has retraced its way back to the starting point of that head-and-shoulders pattern, and technicals say the stock should find support here. Further, the stock's 200-day moving average - which provided support for this stock during the late 2018 sell-off - is just a few points below where the stock trades today.Big picture, the technicals imply that the worst of the OTKA stock sell-off is over, and that the stock should find support around $100.Overall, we are fans of OKTA stock on recent weakness. We think that: 1) the long-term growth fundamentals remain robust and healthy, 2) those healthy fundamental growth prospects are being undervalued by the market, 3) momentum stocks, including OKTA, should bounce back into the end of the year, and 4) the technicals imply that this storm has mostly passed.As such, we are buyers of OKTA stock here and lower, all else equal."
4290229,105235,2019-09-06T16:08:07-04:00,"Okta reported earnings for fiscal Q2 2020 in August 28, beating revenue and Non-GAAP EPS estimates.The stock has been delivering high returns for investors since its IPO date, but the valuation has been ballooning along.The revenue growth and the overall fundamentals remain strong.At this valuation, and with a head-and-shoulders pattern forming in the daily chart, the stock is a sell.","Okta (OKTA) has been delivering high returns for investors since its IPO two years ago, and it has beaten Wall Street estimates for every reported quarter so far, and don’t get it wrong, it’s done it again this time.OKTA reported revenues for the second quarter of its fiscal year 2020, or the one ending July 31, 2019. The results are compelling; $140.5 million in revenues (7% more than the estimated $131.19 million), and Non-GAAP EPS of -$0.05 (half the loss expected by analysts) are proof of this.The actual figure for GAAP EPS was -$0.37, which missed by $0.03, but this is highly influenced by share-based expenses, which in turn are difficult to estimate. So, let’s give the company some credit for this one. Let’s say this is another double beat!The stock sank on the news. Investors seem to be worried about declining top-line growth, profitability, and an intriguing full-year guidance. Not to mention a lofty valuation that is enough to consider this name a sell.(Wikipedia)OKTA is a top player in the identity and access management business. It provides cloud-based software (SaaS) that secures the authentication of users into applications, and helps developers manage user identity for devices and applications.The firm is widely recognized as the leader of its market. In August, the company was named a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrat for Access Management. Also Forrester Research has recently recognized OKTA as a leader in its Identity-As-A-Service for Enterprise Support. This industry-wide recognition is paving the way for further market penetration.OKTA was founded in 2009, has its main offices in San Francisco, and is run by the CEO and chairman Todd McKinnon, who co-founded the company with the COO J. Frederic Kerrest.Since going public, the stock has beaten revenue and EPS estimates, but this time it was a little different (at least on the surface). Wall Street expected $131.2 million as revenue, and -$0.34 and -$0.10 as EPS on a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis, respectively.The company beat on revenues ($140.5 million, beat by 7%), but miss/beat on EPS (-$0.37 GAAP and -$0.05 Non-GAAP). Not that bad at all. Have in mind that it is hard to estimate share-based expenses on young software companies, and the Non-GAAP figure here is of great significance since annual run-rate share-based expenses for the past quarter ($125 million) represented less than 1% of the total market cap of OKTA, when the stock has been a multi-bagger since the IPO date.For me, the reported earnings were a total beat. So, why did the stock fall on the news?On the earnings release, the company updated its fiscal Q3 and full-year guidance. I didn’t like the sequential growth implied by the revenue figure for fiscal Q3 ($143-$144 million). With $140.5 million of revenues for Q2 and a maximum of $144 million for Q3, the growth Q/Q would be as small as 2.5%, or 10% on an annual basis.I wouldn’t be so worried about the management guidance for revenues; it has been outpaced by actual results by a margin of 7-8%. With this in mind, it is not outrageous to expect around $155 million in revenues for Q3, and another raise in the full-year outlook.But also, the management could be expecting an unusually-low growth quarter because of some already-witnessed affection on its operations. Notice that an estimate of a maximum of $563 million in revenues assumes a bad quarter (Q3 with $144 million or 2.5% of growth Q/Q), and then a recovery quarter of $153.5 million (7% of growth Q/Q). Still this guidance signifies weaker fundamentals and a lower revenue growth, which the market has not cared about in previous quarters.On the other side, operational metrics from the same report are telling another story about future growth. Some could say that the growth in billings is decreasing as total and current calculated billings increased by 42% and 44% vs. Q1’s 52% and 54%, respectively, but total and current backlog (Remaining Performance Obligations) increased by 68% and 52%, respectively.As the company uses these two metrics and their readings are so different, I think it is better to rely on customers’ growth and the retention rate to assess future revenue growth.During the past quarter, the number of customers increased by 7% Q/Q, which represents an annual run-rate growth of 30%+. The dollar-based net retention rate was 118%, implying that current customers are generating 18% more revenue on an annual basis.With these two figures in mind, the revenue is properly suited to grow at a maximum of 50% Y/Y, but as the retention rate is decreasing, and so the growth in the number of customers, this 50% growth is poised to decelerate over the coming years, but not as management is suggesting. If the stock price decreases any further from now on, don’t blame the fundamentals; it’s all about the sky-high valuation (more on this later).Summarizing the quarter. The company continues to focus on adding large enterprise customers to drive growth, and brought 450 new customers (it is intriguing to see the same figure as on fiscal Q1). The number of customers generating $100,000+ in revenue per year grew 46% Y/Y to 1,200. The average contract size among the top 25 contracts booked in Q2 by contract value doubled Y/Y, and deal sizes were larger while contract term lengths were longer.OKTA saw its revenues grow 49% Y/Y and a healthy 12.4% Q/Q, with subscription revenues growing 51% Y/Y, and international revenues growing 45% Y/Y, representing 16% of the total amount of revenues.Subscription gross margin was 79%, and total gross margin was 72.4%. Gross profit grew by 53.3% Y/Y and 12.8% Q/Q. I expect professional services revenues to lag the growth in subscription revenues, so the total gross margin should head higher in the coming periods, and continue its uptrend.Operating expenses were higher 34% Y/Y, driven by a 40% growth in total headcount to support sales and marketing activities.Non-GAAP Operating loss was $10 million, a margin of -7% vs -20% Y/Y, while Non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.05 vs $0.15 Y/Y (based on 115 million shares outstanding vs 107 million Y/Y)The cash flow from operations was -$1 million (maybe one of the things that investors didn’t like, comparing with more than +$20 million in the previous quarter), a margin of -1% vs -6% Y/Y, with free cash flow being -$4.3 million or a margin of -3% vs -12% Y/Y.The company remains highly liquid with $557 million of cash and equivalents at the end of Q2. It also has a current debt of $280 million in the form of convertible senior notes, which would be paid-off with a new issue of $1 billion in similar notes due 2025. After this transaction is completed, the company will be left with a lot of cash in hand, thus it would not be irrational to expect some M&A activity or, at least, increased international efforts and S&M expenses.From an SaaS investor view, the company is characterized by a revenue growth of 49% and decreasing, a market opportunity of nearly $18 billion, a retention rate of 118% and decreasing, a gross margin of 72.4% and increasing, and an Added Revenue/S&M Expenses of $0.58. These are some of the critical factors that influence the valuation of SaaS stocks.With an enterprise value of $14.74 billion and estimated FY2020 revenues of $600 million (author’s bullish forecast), the stock is trading at 24.6 times forward revenues.Comparing with other SaaS stocks with similar features as those presented above, OKTA is overvalued.And the technical picture agrees!(Finviz.com)This daily chart suggests that a head-and-shoulders pattern is forming. Most of the times, this pattern marks the beginning of a bearish market, so the stock is probable to head south from this point.You should also look at the blue support line, which has already been crossed after a failed attempt in mid-August. If the price fails to break out, consider this stock a strong sell.Investors should understand that the growth story and the overall fundamentals of OKTA remain strong. Revenue growth is decelerating but keeping a solid pace, while the added customers and the retention rate seen during the quarter add strength to the current trend of financials.The stock may fall further because of the high valuation and the head-and-shoulders pattern on the daily chart.Some would say that this is a buy because of the YTD momentum and the fact that it tends to sink on quarterly reports, just to rebound higher in a few days.I’m bearish on OKTA!"
4289421,103480,2019-09-04T10:15:00-04:00,"Shares of Okta are trading approximately 10% lower after the company's recent release of its Q2 earnings report.
        Though Okta beat Wall Street's top and bottom line expectations in Q2, its Q3 guidance implies deceleration ahead. Decelerating billings growth is also a signal for upcoming revenue headwinds.
        Despite the fact that Okta is one of the fastest-growing companies in the software sector, its perennially heady valuation is in need of a correction.
        With many high-flying software companies stumbling sharply due to sales execution issues, it's best to avoid stocks like Okta until market turbulence subsides.","Okta (OKTA) has been humbled. Typically, the single-sign on software vendor's stock knows only one direction: up. But in the week after reporting its second-quarter earnings results, shares of Okta have taken a rare tumble down, cutting ~10% off the stock's recent year-to-date highs. Make no mistake - Okta is still a big winner this year, having still risen more than 2x from its January levels in the low $60s. But with sentiment broadly weaker after the Q2 earnings report, it seems that Okta's rally is finally petering out.There is no doubt that Okta is one of the strongest companies among recent software IPOs. The company has been able to maintain ~50% y/y revenue growth for many quarters, even as it hit a $500-600 million annualized revenue run rate. Few software companies ever make it to that scale without experiencing a more meaningful deceleration curve.In addition, the Okta Single Sign-On product itself is quite unique and unchallenged in the software market. Yes, there's auth0 and there's Duo - but when you think of single-sign on, you're mostly thinking about Okta. Okta's customer base encompasses a wide swatch of blue-chip customers, including JetBlue Airways (JBLU), Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA), and Tesla (TSLA). It also doesn't hurt that Okta has been recognized as a Leader by Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Access Management for several years in a row. Okta is also a great example of the ""land and expand"" model that has generated so much success among software startups. Initially Okta may land a small deployment within a single department or organization of its customer, but gradually it builds within that customer to encompass larger parts of the company. Because Okta is priced per seat (SSO base pricing is $2/user per month), it generates relatively passive revenue growth as its customers upsize their usage. But all this growth has already been priced into Okta's stock, and investors are beginning to show hesitation at paying such steep multiples for a company that may be headed for a slowdown (similar to other former high-flyers like Zendesk (ZEN) and New Relic (NEWR); investors are wary of Okta running into sales execution issues). At Okta's present share price around $128, the company has a market cap of $14.96 billion. After netting off the company's $512.5 million of cash and $279.7 million of convertible debt, we are left with a net cash position of $232.8 million and a resulting enterprise value of $14.73 billion.Here's how that stacks up to Okta's latest guidance ranges:Figure 1. Okta guidance updateSource: Okta 2Q19 earnings releaseVersus the midpoint of Okta's FY20 revenue range of $560-$563 million (+40-41% y/y), Okta trades at a heady multiple of 26.2x EV/FY20 revenues. Even the company's recent dip does little to change the fact that it remains one of the most expensive stocks in the software sector, alongside other recent IPOs like Coupa (COUP) and Anaplan (PLAN). Even if we look ahead of FY21, where Wall Street analysts have a consensus revenue target of $736.2 million for Okta (per Yahoo Finance), Okta still trades at a bloated valuation of 20.0x EV/FY21 revenues.A correction is long overdue for Okta, especially as red flags emerge on the company's growth trajectory. Steer clear here and lock in any gains.Let's now dive deeper into Okta's second-quarter results:Figure 2. Okta 2Q19 resultsSource: Okta 2Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 49% y/y to $140.5 million, far surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $131.2 million (+39% y/y) by a wide ten-point margin. Note as well that Okta showed barely any deceleration from its revenue growth rate of 50% y/y in Q1.Here's some further color on this quarter's performance from CEO Todd McKinnon's remarks on the Q2 earnings call:So top-line growth was fine - but underlying billings growth, however, flashed a cautionary signal. As seen in the chart below, Okta's billings growth decelerated eleven points sequentially to an all-time low of 42% y/y. Note as well that Okta's billings growth this quarter came sharply beneath revenue growth - whereas last quarter, billings growth outpaced revenue growth by three points.Figure 3. Okta billings trendsSource: Okta 2Q19 earnings releaseFor Okta, and for any other software company that bills its customers on a subscription basis, billings actually represents a clearer picture of the company's long-term growth trajectory, as it captures deals that were signed this quarter but will be recognized as revenues in the future. The gap between Okta's billings growth and revenue growth essentially indicates that Okta isn't building sufficient deferred revenue balances, and its growth may decelerate in the near future.In fact, that ""near future"" may come as soon as Q3. Okta's third-quarter revenue guidance calls for $143-$144 million in revenues, or just 35-36% y/y growth. Typically, we treat Okta's guidance with a heaping grain of salt - like many other high-growth software companies, Okta has a history of under-calling its guidance in order to set the bar low for Wall Street analysts. But in this case, Okta's decelerating guidance is also accompanied by a sharply lower billings growth rate in the quarter, making it far more believable. Even if Okta's growth doesn't fall into the mid-30s next quarter as its guidance would suggest, it wouldn't be surprising to see Okta decelerate to the low 40s, where its billings growth rate is now.On the bright side, however, Okta's billings deceleration has been accompanied by notable improvements on the profitability front. Greater scale has allowed Okta to push its pro forma gross margins up to 77.2%, an improvement of 390bps year-over-year.In addition, Okta has been able to capture significant sales efficiency as the company grows larger, ratcheting down sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues. As a result, Okta was able to improve pro forma operating margins to -7% this quarter, up thirteen points from -20% in 2Q19 (though the prior-year compare was also a favorable one, due to the timing of Okta's annual customer conference).Okta's pro forma EPS of -$0.05 also beat Wall Street's expectations of -$0.10, while free cash flow burn of -$4.3 million (a -3% FCF margin) was vastly improved over 2Q19's FCF of -$11.3 million and FCF margin of -12%.Okta's present situation can be summed up in a nutshell: the company's billings growth and guidance both suggest that Okta is headed for meaningful deceleration, after several quarters of sticking to a ~50% y/y revenue growth rate. However, the stock is still priced for perfection at a >25x forward revenue multiple, suggesting that it has plenty further to fall once its performance starts deteriorating. Okta remains a strong company with a market-leading product, but when a stock trades at such heady valuation multiples in the face of possible growth headwinds, it's long overdue for a correction."
4285187,102101,2019-08-13T13:54:00-04:00,"Okta's recent growth initiatives will continue to drive momentum in the near term.There is a dearth of serious challengers in its security niche.Though pricey, the stock is a buy as the growth narrative will continue to lead valuation multiples.","Okta Inc. (OKTA) is a fast-growing SaaS business with a pricey valuation. Investors are not sure whether to buy or sit this one out. Given that it has returned over 400% since it IPOed, timing a deceleration or momentum decline will appear ill-guided in the absence of serious structural issues. Investors aren’t sure if the upward valuation cycle will back-pedal or continue. Okta is investing in key growth initiatives. Management has made key acquisitions, and the business is spending heavily on product innovation, geographic expansion, and headcount growth. While these initiatives have led to increased spend, Okta is well-positioned to keep the momentum going in the near term. Competition isn’t much of a concern, and its financials aren’t out of place; as a result, Okta is a buy as the investments will continue to pay off in the near term.Okta is a leading IDaaS (Identity as a Service) business which provides authentication and authorization solutions for small businesses and enterprises connecting to the cloud. The demand for improved security as the traditional network stack transitions from a perimeter-based architecture to a cloud-based model has opened up opportunities for security solution providers. Okta has carved out a niche for itself by providing a cloud-based authentication solution for enterprises and developers. Okta is like a Shopify (SHOP) package for sign-on and authentication.Okta valued its total addressable market at $18 billion in its IPO filing. Since then, the identity security provider has sustained rapid double-digit growth in the pursuit of market share. The company reached the 100 million registered users mark in January. While achieving these, the company has faced little macro or competitive headwinds. The fact that cloud companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (released in 2015) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (released in 2017) have developed their own identity security solutions has had little to no impact on Okta’s momentum. This makes it evident that there is still a lot of low-hanging fruits to be plucked. This means investors have little reason to worry about competitive pressure affecting profitability in the form of a price war. Though OKTA has been around for a while, its recent wins with brands such as Zoom (ZOOM) and MLB indicates that the game is just starting. Ten years ago, when the company was setting out, fewer companies were connecting to the cloud, and there were few cloud-based products. Today, employees interact with hundreds of cloud/web-based applications in any given year. Providing a single pane of glass visibility for their security access and authorization configuration has now become a necessity. If you’ve ever tried to build a web-based technology solution, you’ll recall the countless number of cloud-based connections and authentications required to communicate with all the tools you need. From Adobe (ADBE) Photoshop, Azure, Office 365, to GitHub, the list is endless. That’s where Okta comes in. Going forward, I believe Okta has made a brilliant case for its niche IDaaS strategy in the cybersecurity market. I’m bullish on three growth drivers, namely: geographical expansion, product innovation, and market share pursuit. In addition to these, Okta also benefits from upgraded data protection and privacy regulations in Europe (GDPR) and beyond. Revenue from outside the U.S. currently stands at 16%. This highlights the untapped market in Asia and the EMEA region. The company recently expanded its data centers to the Asia-Pacific region. It also opened a new office in Germany. Management cited the expected growth in headcount to pursue more sales. In the last earnings season, the company recorded a 40% growth in headcount. It's hard to attract and acquire that much talent if the company hasn’t spotted a goldmine. The company is also guiding for sustained recruitment acceleration in 2H’19. In product innovation, OKTA has been expanding its portfolio to address a bigger audience. OKTA recently released Okta Hooks, a solution which makes it easy for developers to integrate authentication into their workflows. This is going to be a big win as developers are known to champion revolutions in the software space. By getting its solution into the hands of a lot of developers, the company is building a future base of customers as these developers turn their projects into marketable companies. This has the potential to be a real game-changer as these developers evolve into advocates and eventual enterprise customers when they launch their startups. It’s just like Shopify simplified the checkout process for e-commerce websites, thereby creating a market for non-IT experts to monetize their online businesses. The recent hiring of Diya Jolly as Chief Product Officer from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) is also a plus. Diya was in charge of YouTube ads for five years before working in the Google smart home division. Her experience is going to give Okta the facelift it needs as it tries to streamline the technical side with the sales side of its business. She reminds me of Marissa Mayer and how she revolutionized product innovation at Google before moving on to become the CEO of Yahoo. It will be interesting to watch how she positions Okta from a pure IDaaS business to highlight its capabilities in new areas such as artificial and threat intelligence. Investors should also watch out for a possible breakout into cloud adjacencies, which might see Okta offering new products such as CASBs (cloud access security brokers) and SWGs (secure web gateways). The growth story isn’t going to decelerate anytime soon. Okta is in the middle of an aggressive market share expansion and it's safer to ride the momentum than to bet against it. SaaS companies are currently in favor, and the high-flying names now command huge premiums to their historical valuation. Okta sits right in the middle of the SaaS growth wave. The company is guiding for a 36% revenue growth in the next quarter while raising full-year revenue guidance to reflect a 37% y/y growth. Recent checks by analysts have been promising with Deutsche Bank citing the positive tone from the CFO. When your CFO is positive, even when profitability isn’t guaranteed in the near term, I take that as a reason to be more confident in the growth story. At a market cap of ~$15 billion with less than a billion in annual revenue, value hunters are going to be wary of any bullish print. However, I believe the growth story is going to cover the valuation gap, which will lead to more multiples compression. Okta is going to come off as pricey to risk-averse investors. At a forward price to sale ratio of 28, only risk-loving investor will be willing to give the name a try. This potentially exposes the stock to a severe correction if management is not simultaneously beating and raising guidance in future quarterly calls. Lastly, Okta's balance sheet isn’t debt-free (debt of $275 million). The company needs to be better leveraged to achieve its high growth forecast. Growth by acquisition will further worsen the balance sheet in the absence of profits in the near term.Heading into the next earnings report, investors should watch out for a correction building up to the earnings release day as the fear of an execution miss will shake off weak hands. This will present a cheaper valuation, and investors can capitalize on that opportunity to acquire some position."

Investors should wait for a better entry point.Stockholders may wish to sell call options against the stock position to generate income as opposed to selling the stock.","[Update 6/28/19]: I updated the article to reflect that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative and R&D, removed the separate mention of R&D expense, and removed the mention of Okta spending 130% of revenues.Powered by three massive tech trends (cloud, digital transformations and security), Okta, Inc. (OKTA) is quickly becoming the dominant player in identity management solutions, a new approach to security based on Zero Trust. The company provides subscription-based services that ensure only the right people and devices have access to specific resources. Identities are becoming the single control point across users, devices, and networks.In general, software companies with recurring revenues, either subscription-based or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), such as Okta have been outperforming the stock market by a significant margin for some time. While Okta is executing very well and has an extremely promising future, the stock valuation is the highest amongst all of the digital transformation stocks that I track. I expect that there will be a general market pullback in the next few months which may lead to a better entry point. This leads me to assign a neutral rating for Okta.Instead of taking profits, stockholders may wish to sell out-of-the-money call options against their Okta position as the call options have pretty lofty valuations as well. Some decent income can be generated from this stock using covered calls.As I explained in my last article on Everbridge (EVBG), high growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, they often confound analysts with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures such as revenue growth, the software company ""rule of 40,"" and my favorite: company performance relative to analyst estimates.Okta had a good year with a YoY revenue growth of 53%. The company's three-year annual growth rate of 67% is extraordinary. Management has guided to an increase in revenues of 36-37% for 2020, but I expect it will overachieve as it has done in the past (more on that later).(Source: Portfolio123.com)Not only is Okta growing at a rate of 50+% per year, but the recurring revenue business model also provides very smooth graduation in revenues from quarter to quarter. Something that you don't generally see with software companies that still sell perpetual licenses.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Okta's free cash flow margin has been steadily increasing since the company went public in 2017, starting from negative 30% FCF margin up to positive 2% for the most recent trailing 12 months.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Another encouraging sign is the company's gross margin which has been slowly climbing and is now close to 74%.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Examining how a company performs versus analysts' estimates gives me a feel for how conservative the management is and how well it communicates with the investment community. This is a good predictor of what to expect in future quarterly results. With that said, Okta has an extremely good record of beating analysts' estimates. The company has exceeded estimates for the last five quarters for both sales and EPS. In fact, it not only exceeded but also trounced estimates. This leads me to believe that the 2020 YoY revenue guidance of 36-37% is conservative and may actually end up in the mid-40s.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Analysts are challenged when it comes to valuing software companies. While these companies tend to generate high revenue growth rates, they also tend to be unprofitable due to large investments in research and development and sales and marketing. Discounting future cash flows requires many assumptions that are typically unreliable and difficult to support.One industry metric that is often used for early- to mid-stage software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as the figure is useful in a later part of my analysis.Some analysts interpret the Rule of 40 as follows: as long as a company's growth rate is at least 40 percentage points higher than its free cash flow margin, a high-growth SaaS company can burn cash in order to drive growth.Okta is definitely burning cash. All one has to do is look at the S&GA expenses as a percentage of revenues. The ratio of S&GA to revenues is approximately 104%, much higher than what would be expected from a more mature software company that would have a figure typically around 50-60%.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.The company is outspending the revenues that are coming in and will likely do so for several years to come. The management has stated as much in the latest quarterly report.According to the Rule of 40, the cash burn is OK so long as revenue growth plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more.Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 53% + 2% = 55%In the case of Okta, the cash burn appears to be ""acceptable.""Revenue growth plus FCF margin is sometimes referred to as the ""Efficiency Score."" It has been determined that a company's Efficiency Score has a greater than 70 percent correlation to a public SaaS company's revenue multiple, which is a company's valuation divided by its revenue.In order to demonstrate this, I have plotted the EV/Sales multiple versus the Efficiency Score in MS Excel for 48 software stocks from my Digital Transformation stock list. A linear trend line is plotted through the scatter plot that represents best-fit valuation multiple for a given Efficiency Score.(Source: Portfolio123.com)As can be seen from the above graph, the Okta valuation (EV/Sales) is the furthest from the best-fit line through the data points.The rest of this analysis is somewhat controversial. For me at least, it seems logical to assume higher valuation for higher growth companies, and I use the best-fit line to gauge a company's valuation relative to the rest of the stocks in the custom universe. This is a relative valuation, not absolute as one would attempt to get using a DCF calculation.Based on the above chart, Okta's stock price is extremely overvalued relative to the rest of the digital transformation stocks in my custom universe.For this reason, I have to give Okta a neutral rating.If you own Okta stock, instead of taking profits, you might consider writing out-of-the-money call options against your stock position. With the lofty prices being quoted for call options, you should be able to generate 10% for one month's work (or less time).For example, a recent price for the Okta stock is $119.72. July 26th call options with a strike price of $120 can be sold for approximately $14, generating more than 10% income. Note, however, that this play does cap future stock gains. That is the downside.Powered by three massive tech trends (cloud, digital transformations, and security), Okta has become a leader in identity management solutions. The company has YoY revenue growth of 53% and is likely to achieve significant growth for several years. Sales & Marketing plus R&D expenses are expected to grow commensurately. The company scores quite well on the Rule of 40, a rule of thumb that estimates a software company's health. But Okta has an extreme valuation, and it is best to wait for a market correction before buying this stock. I, therefore, assign a neutral rating to the company. Stockholders may wish to sell call options against the stock position in order to generate income as opposed to taking profits.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"

(OKTA) recently announced stellar fourth-quarter results. Its record performance for the quarter outpaced market expectations. However, the market wasn’t impressed with its weak earnings outlook, and the stock fell 10% following the results.Revenues for the quarter increased 50% to $115.5 million, ahead of the market’s forecast of $107.9 million. GAAP net loss for the quarter came in at $30.8 million, compared to $23 million reported a year ago. Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.04 was lower than previous year’s loss of $0.08 per share. The market had also forecast a loss of $0.08 a share for the quarter.By segment, subscription services revenues increased 53% over the year to $108.5 million. Professional services and the others segment revenues grew 15% to $7 million.Total calculated billings for the quarter grew 52% to $158.9 million due to strength from new and existing as well as commercial and enterprise customers. Trailing 12-month calculated billings grew 55% to $488.2 million. Okta’s total customer base increased 40% over the year to 6,100, as it added 500 new customers during the quarter.The company ended the year with revenues growing 56% to $399.3 million. GAAP net loss of $125.5 million was higher than previous year’s net loss of $109.8 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.32 was significantly better than the previous year’s loss of $0.71 per share.For the current quarter, Okta forecast revenues of $116-117 million with a net loss of $0.22-0.21 per share. It expects to end the year with $530-535 million in revenues and non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.53-0.48. The market was looking for revenues of $111.7 million with a net loss of $0.22 per share for the quarter and revenues of $518.3 million with a net loss of $0.12 per share for the year. The significantly higher loss forecast for the year sent the stock tumbling post the result announcement.During the quarter, Okta continued to release several new product and platform innovations. Recently, it announced the launch of a new tool called Advanced Server Access that provides identity management capabilities for Windows and Linux Servers. The tool also supports major cloud infrastructures, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.Additionally, it also upgraded its identity management capabilities with the recent announcement of the Identity Engine. The Okta Identity Engine is a set of customizable building blocks for every identity experience that breaks apart pre-defined authentication, authorization, and registration flows. It allows customers to create dynamic, context-based user journeys, thus delivering password-less experiences, progressive profiling, and per-app branding. Okta plans to release the Engine in the second half of 2019.Within its platform offering, Okta enhanced its Cloud platform with the launch of Okta Hooks. Okta Hooks is a new functionality of its Identity Cloud that will allow developers to create custom integrations for the Okta Integration Network. Developers will be able to add identity proofing and verification into consumer registration decisions and also automate IT Service Management actions. They will be able to leverage external context to modify workflows within the Okta platform, while still maintaining control, visibility, and security. It will also be possible to integrate these Okta workflows with third-party services to deliver a more flexible and seamless identity management experience.Recently, Okta announced the acquisition of workflow automation company Azuqua for an estimated $52.5 million. Seattle-based Azuqua was founded in 2013 to provide no-code, cloud-based business application integration and workflow automation solutions. Azuqua had 40 employees based mostly in downtown Seattle at the time of the deal. It had raised $16 million prior to the acquisition from investors including Insight Venture Partners, Ignition Partners, Techstars, and Microsoft Accelerator. Its financial performance is not disclosed. Okta plans to integrate Azuqua’s offering within its cloud offering to provide a no-code capability to its developers. It is focusing on helping non-developers build Hooks integrations using Azuqua’s capabilities to offer unlimited use cases to its customers.Okta has built a robust developer community around its platform. Today, it offers more than 5,550 apps that integrate into the cloud and on-premises systems. It can provision users to more than 130 cloud and on-premise apps and help organizations adopt latest apps, centralize user management, and automate access workflows across cloud, premise, and mobile applications. I would like to know from Okta which of these apps has seen the most traction. What other features should developers focus on?Its stock is currently trading at $85.79 with a market capitalization of $9.6 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $87.72 in February this year.

Being too consequent is often a fool's game. While I invest for the long term and normally don't sell shares, I have trimmed my Okta (OKTA) position by a third. I announced the sell on Twitter:I don't always have the time to post a full article. But I'm working on that, with a market place in the make. It will be called Potential Multibaggers. Stay tuned for that. It will be announced here.This what the shares have done since I sold them:Data by YChartsNot that great, right? While Okta has gone down significantly, Shopify has gone up considerably over the last few months. I don't regret the sell, though. The positions had become a bit too big and I thought both were overvalued. That doesn't mean I don't like Okta anymore.In my portfolio of Potential Multibaggers, I always buy stocks for the long term. While I know that some investors talk about the long term when they talk about a time period of 3 years, for me, the long term means at least a decade. But I have only picked Okta as a Potential Multibagger on December 10, 2018.(Source: Wikipedia)Not exactly a decade yet and I sell a third of my position. The stock has performed extremely well over that period, despite the recent fall:Data by YChartsAs you can see, the stock had more than doubled over the first 9 months since the pick, before pulling back recently. But doubling in itself is never a reason to sell for me.If you look at what Okta has returned since its IPO on April, 7, 2017, that is even more impressive:Data by YChartsMy initial investment was at $38.93, but I have averaged up to about $61.97 along the way. As we all know, SaaS (software-as-a-Service) stocks, and so Okta too, have attracted lots of love from investors over the past 18 months. But that love seems to have withered a bit over the last week. There is a lot of talk about sector rotation. And I think that no investor will argue that SaaS stocks have boomed enormously over the past 9 months.This the evolution of 10 of the hottest SaaS stocks from the beginning of this year to September 1:Data by YChartsThe same stocks have experienced serious drops since September 1 :Data by YChartsSo, I think it is reasonable to say there is a correction going on. Let's assess Okta to see if this sell-off is warranted.Before I will go to explain the fact that what seems negative in Okta is actually positive, I have to give you the negative news. That's what I will do here.As I wrote in my Potential Multibaggers article, I really like Okta. With a visionary management team, a rapidly expanding market, huge revenue growth, a great product line and a consistent gross margin of above 70%, the company has a lot to succeed. But its valuation is still high, even after the drawback of the last few days:Data by YChartsThis how its P/S holds versus some other high-flying SaaS stocks:Data by YChartsAs you can see, Okta still has the highest P/S ratio of all SaaS stocks, except for Shopify (SHOP) and together with Alteryx (AYX). It is not a coincidence that I have sold about 60% of my Shopify shares too. But Shopify will be for the second installment of Assessing SaaS.While Okta's stock has seen a general market decline with the other SaaS stocks, its pullback has already started after its Q2 2020 earnings report (Okta is already in FY 2020), with a mixed Q3 2020 outlook:Data by YChartsThe reason might be that investors see that Okta's free cash flow, while still positive, doesn't really take off versus the other SaaS companies. Only MongoDB (MDB) and Twilio (TWLO) do worse.Data by YChartsIf you look at the net income, you see that Okta is a lagger too:Data by YChartsJust to make sure what we are talking about, a short explanation of the difference between the two. Free cash flow is the cash that is generated. It is a way to assess if a company has enough capital to sustain itself and it could theoretically be distributed to the owners (shareholders).To know the net income, you can deduct total expenses from the revenue a company generates.For growing companies, like Okta, it is not uncommon to have FCF and operating income quite far apart. The main reason? Stock-based compensation. Since stock-based compensation is a non-cash item, it increases the free cash flow versus the net income. This Okta's evolution of stock-based compensation:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Now, I don't want to represent this as too negative. A lot of companies use this to attract or retain highly talented people. But you have to know that it plays a role for FCF, but not for net income, where it is deducted as a non-cash expense.The rest of the difference between the two is that net income doesn't include revenue that cannot be taken into account yet because (e.g. parts of subscriptions).In the next graph, you can see Okta's SG&A (first row), R&D (second row), total operating expenses (third row) and net income of the last four quarters:(Source: Seeking Alpha)As you can see, the net income has actually deteriorated in the last two quarters. It means that Okta has to spend a lot on sales to keep the growth coming. I'll come back to that.As to EPS, Okta hasn't made that much progress over the years too, in contrast to the revenue growth:Data by YChartsBesides the general drop in SaaS stocks, there might be another reason why Okta is down so much since the beginning of September. On September 3, the company announced that it would issue 5-year convertible notes. The notes give 0.125% interest per year and are worth $188.71 per share, or a premium of 77% to the closing price of Thursday evening.A typical strategy for a lot of hedge funds when convertible notes are is issued is to, well, hedge. This done in a so-called convertible bond arbitrage.Essentially it comes down to the fact that a hedge fund (or other big players) will buy convertible bonds and at the same time short the underlying stocks via options. If the stock goes up, the convertible bonds become worth a lot more, if it goes down the options will make the bondholder a winner.This what Okta's stock price has done since the announcement:Data by YChartsThe notes will carry an interest rate of 0.125% per year and be convertible into 5.2991 shares starting in 2025, representing a conversion price of $188.71 per share, or about 48% higher than yesterday's closing price.Okta coupled another issue of convertible notes with the issue of the new one. In February 2018, the company had already issued convertible notes for a total of $345M. It could convince a lot of those holders, representing 65% of the value of the notes, to switch to the 2025 notes. The reason is that those notes had a conversion price of $48.23, 55% under Okta's Thursday closing price. While they only matured in 2023, a much higher stock price is one of the reasons convertible notes can be changed for shares earlier. This presented a big dilution risk to Okta's current shareholders. But the remaining holders of the 2023 notes also form a positive catalyst for the stock price. The company announced:So, these holders will converse their notes and buy shares to cover their short (hedge) positions. But this catalyst is much smaller than the selling pressure: $120M worth of 2023 notes (whose holders will buy shares) versus $1B of 2025 notes (whose holders will short shares).Once these positions are established, though, this will calm down. In the meantime, I expect that most hedge funds might already have established their short position, which means that the selling pressure will decline over the next few days.Now, I wouldn't have kept 2/3 of my Okta shares if that was all there was to the story. There are lots of positive elements too.The revenue has grown substantially since Okta made its IPO, growing from $52.3M in April 2017 (the time of the IPO) to $140.5M in the last quarter. That's a growth of about 170%. If you take the quarter before the IPO into account, it is even 251.1%. So it is not illogical that the stock price has appreciated a lot too. But as you can see on this graph, a lot of future growth has already been built into the stock price:Data by YChartsThe company guided for about 36% YoY growth for Q3 2020 (the next quarter) to about $143M-144M. I think it will easily beat its guidance and grow more than that. After all, a 2% QoQ growth is not what you would want to see. But Okta has beaten the expectations each quarter that it has been a public company:(Source: streetinsider.com)The average revenue beat was around 7%. If you take 7% extra, the revenue would come in at around $154M, which would be a 9.6% QoQ growth, or 38.5% annualized. That seems more realistic to me.The reason that Okta grows so much is its superior product. Don't forget that the big boys, such as Amazon's (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure or Google's (GOOG) (GOOGL) Cloud also have identity solutions. And Salesforce (CRM) is also in the neighborhood with its Identity. But Okta is the clear leader in the Gartner (IT) Magic Quadrant for Access Management:(Source)Forrester also named Okta as the leader, both in 'current offering' as in 'strategy' in its Identity-As-A-Service (IDaaS) Forrester Wave:(Source)These outside praises prove that Okta has a superior product. It's not unthinkable that one of the big players would even want to buy Okta, although the valuation is still probably too high now. The most likely buyers are Amazon and Salesforce, I think. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud have offerings that are already too good to still consider an acquisition.But that doesn't mean that you should hope that Okta would be acquired. It has a lot of runway on itself. It is at the intersection of two huge trends that are only starting to get traction: cloud computing and security. Identity theft, hacking and digital theft that can cause a lot of harm and Okta can help you to reduce that risk considerably.Internationally, Okta is only starting out as well. This is Okta's CFO Bill Losch on the Q2 2020 earnings call:If you want to explain the higher expenses in SG&A, here you have your reason: investment in international expansion. At just 16% of the total revenue, there is a lot of growth left.As most SaaS investors will know, the dollar-based net retention rate is a very important metric to watch in SaaS companies. It looks at how much more (or less) the existing customers of the year before have paid in the last 12 months. Ideally you want the dollar-based retention rate to be above 100%. You want to upsell or cross-sell your existing customers. Okta's dollar-based net retention rate in Q2 2020 came in at 118%, versus 121% last year. Don't worry about this decline. It's still very healthy and the moderate slowdown is a consequence of larger deals, in which mostly there is already more included.There is a reason for the slowdown in the guidance of 36% YoY growth in Q3 2020, which I expect Okta to beat and see around 40% YoY growth. And that reason is also responsible for the seemingly worse last two quarters I hinted at in the negative part of this article.Maybe you have heard about the new accounting principles called Accounting Standards Codification number 606, or ASC 606. This the new GAAP accounting standard for revenue from contracts. The basic reasoning is that in contracts, as in the subscription model Okta works with, certain performance obligations can be pinpointed. Therefore the price of the subscription should be divided between these obligations. That introduced a new acronym (as if there are not enough yet in finance): RPO, or remaining performance obligations, also called backlog.While the revenue and subscriptions of Okta slow down, its RPO has actually grown by 68%, representing a backlog of $914M. The reason why the revenue and subscription slow down, especially in the guidance for Q3 2020 is that Okta starts working more and more with bigger companies.These bigger companies have a different approach. They want stable partners and therefore the length of the contracts are much longer. Okta's CEO Todd McKinnon said on the Q2 2020 earnings call that some of the contracts are signed for up to five years. These contracts have a much higher value in dollars. That is important for the stability of Okta's revenue. But the longer contracts are only recognized over those periods that they were signed for. The current RPO, which is the revenue that will be booked over the next four quarters, grew 52%, to a total of $461M.So investors should be watching RPO extremely carefully, because with the shift to bigger and bigger businesses. Okta's CFO Bill Losch on the Q2 2020 earnings call:There is no discussion that Okta is highly valued. But the recent decline doesn't have to do with fundamentals. An important element is that hedge funds take short positions to hedge against their convertible bonds, although market sentiment and a rising risk aversion will probably play a role as well.If you look at the fundamentals, and especially at backlog or RPO, you can see that the growth in Okta has actually not declined. Because of the higher-value contracts that are brought in and that have a longer duration, the new accounting rules, the ASC 606, only recognize the higher revenue from big clients over the duration of the subscription.While I have sold a third of my position, I remain confidently long with my remaining shares, to do what I always believe is the best thing to do: invest for the very long term. If Okta might fall significantly, the position in my portfolio will decline too, which will allow me to add to my existing position.

4247414,99986,2019-03-08T15:39:25-05:00,"Okta is down after its earnings report Thursday for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018.The company continues to see strong revenue growth with increased traction in their subscription revenue.While the drop towards the $75 level may not be welcome by investors, it has done little damage thus far to the current uptrend.","Okta (OKTA) is a newer name in the security software space (HACK) that began trading just two years ago, with an IPO date of April 2017. While the company has not yet managed to put up a year of positive earnings per share (EPS), revenues continue to climb at a brisk pace. The most recent report showed revenues of $115.5 M for Q4 2018, up 50% year over year and up 10% on a sequential basis. There seems to be frustration among investors about the drop after-hours on a revenue beat, but this looks to be a classic 'sell the news' event. We've seen this during this earnings season already on a few software names, and so far the better names have managed to shake it off pretty quickly. The over-10% drop soon after Friday's open, and the more recent intraday pullback of some 5.5%, may look painful on the short-term charts. But in the bigger picture, the stock is simply retesting its former base. As long as the stock can remain above $70.00 on a weekly close, Okta's uptrend will remain intact. However, a drop back inside this base on a weekly close would be a negative development technically. This is because a stock reentering its base by more than a few percent, and not finding support at the top of a previous base, can be a bearish sign in many cases.(Source: TC2000.com)Okta's plunge has certainly unnerved some investors looking at a few different stock boards, but it's important to zoom out and take a look at the bigger picture. Okta is not the first stock to report strong earnings and find itself down substantially in short order, and most stocks have suffered a similar fate have managed to shrug it off. Twilio (TWLO) and Atlassian (TEAM) are just a couple of examples, and both are now trading higher than their pre-earnings prices. There is no guarantee that Okta will be a repeat of these two scenarios, but a stock selling off after rallying into a report is rarely a surprise. Typically, when a stock runs up into the report by 100% like Okta did, that company needs to not only beat but blow the estimates out of the water in order to avoid a sell-on-news event. The key, however, is if the stock can see buyers come in within a week or so of the reaction to soak up shares and buy into the weakness. This is what Okta investors should be looking for over the next week, and ultimately the $70.00 level is an important one to defend on a weekly closing basis. (See Twilio's and Atlassian's post-earnings reactions below.)(Source: TC2000.com)(Source: TC2000.com)As we can see from the current earnings trend for Okta, displayed below, the loss in earnings per share each year continues to narrow. Based on guidance, the company expects an FY 2019 non-GAAP loss of $0.36-$0.37 per share, and analysts currently have this pegged at $0.32 based on their early estimates. This is a much narrower net loss than the $0.62 loss reported for FY 2018, and the trend is certainly heading towards profitability per the estimates going forward. As we can see from the table below, FY 2020 estimates for EPS are for a loss of $0.22, and 2021 is expected to see a loss of $0.02. This is a good sign, as we now finally have a clear path towards profitability for the company. While revenue growth is excellent, it's always nice to see the light at the end of the tunnel in terms of potential earnings on the horizon.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Table)Moving over to revenues shown below, we continue to see strong growth year over year. While revenue growth has decelerated slightly to the mid-50% range - previously, the average was closer to 60% - this deceleration is not all that alarming, as these are still stupendous growth rates. As mentioned in the conference call, the company now has over 6,100 total customers, with over 100 customers spending $100,000 or more per year on Okta. The company had a record net 500 new customer adds in the quarter as well.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Table)Another encouraging sign discussed during the earnings call is that subscription revenue continues to increase, which gives us a little more revenue stability. Subscription revenue moved up to 94% from 92% in Q4 of last year, and subscription gross margin also increased in Q4 to 82.4%, up 160 basis points from last year. International revenue also grew 47% year over year and was 15% of Q4 revenue. Management has stated that they continue to see international as a long-term growth driver.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Table)On a sequential basis, sales growth is decelerating a little, coming in at a low-double-digit pace (~10%) from a trend of closer to 15% throughout FY 2017. This isn't a huge deal, but many of the best-performing stocks over the past 50 years maintain sequential revenue growth of 25% or higher during their early growth phases. Ideally, I would like to see Okta's sequential revenues accelerate going forward into Q1 2019. Based on the guidance of $530-$535 million in revenues for FY 2019, I would say this is unlikely, but an upside surprise would undoubtedly be a very bullish development for the company.Based on the current fundamentals for Okta, the company is firing on all cylinders. Margins are expanding slightly, sales continue to come in at 50%-plus year-over-year, and guidance for 2019 represents nearly 40% year-over-year for FY 2019, so only a minor deceleration. It's worth noting that on Thursday Okta discussed an acquisition of Azuqua, a workflow automation startup, for just over $52 million.So how does the technical picture currently look for Okta?Taking a look at the weekly chart for Okta below, we can see that the stock broke out of a base near the $72.00 area earlier this year. The stock initially saw strong follow-through above this breakout, but it looks like this earnings drop will see the stock return to the top of this base. This is not a big deal at all, but the key is that the bulls play defense near the top of this base. If Okta were to reenter its base and trade below $70.00 intra-week, this would be perfectly fine, but a weekly close below $70.00 would not be ideal. A weekly close below $70.00 going forward would represent not only a close below the 40-week moving average (pink line shown below), but also a close back inside the base by more than a few percent. These would both be bearish developments medium-term and would suggest the stock may need more of a correction before resuming its uptrend.(Source: TC2000.com)A look at the 40-week moving average is shown below. After a new breakout through a key weekly level, a weekly close below the 40-week moving average (pink line) is never a positive sign and suggests we've seen a failed breakout. As long as the bulls can play defense where they need to on a weekly closing basis and defend the $70.00 area, this is just a normal backtest of the previous base and not a huge deal. A Friday close below $70.00 would not be a welcome sign. This doesn't mean that investors should rush out and sell positions, but it would certainly be a red flag medium-term (three to six months). (Source: TC2000.com)Despite the drop today, little damage has been done to the technical picture and I see no reason to panic. The company's fundamentals remain robust with a nice runway for growth, and the company remains a key leader in its industry. As long as the bulls can defend the $70.00 level on a weekly close, this pullback is nothing to be concerned about, as even the best companies can see sharp reactions on earnings.If you liked this article, please consider following me for future updates!"
4240369,104099,2019-02-12T19:09:56-05:00,"It's obvious that, for the moment at least, the market is willing to look past the negative relationship between revenue and net income here.The company has just turned free cash flow positive, suggesting that valuation may not be excessive.Given my ambiguity about this name, I recommend shareholders switch to calls at least for the time being. They capture most of the upside at far less risk.","Over the past year, the shares of Okta Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) have increased by about 170%. In my view, this is an extraordinary return for a company that seems to grow losses as it grows sales. My recommendation is twofold in this case. I think shareholders would be wise to take profits ahead of next month's full year earnings release and replace their shares with the call options that I outline below. My reasons for suggesting this relate to the fact that the company has a history of growing losses as they grow sales. In my view, the company is on a treadmill of sorts, where they must spend on R&D, SG&A etc. in order to keep revenue alive, so suggestions that they can reduce these expenses with no ill effects to revenue is a stretch, in my view. That said, they have managed to turn cash flow positive during the most recent quarter, and as a result, the shares are not excessively priced, in my view. So, I think there are reasons to be optimistic and reasons to be pessimistic. It's therefore prudent in my estimation to switch from shares to calls. If the market likes what it hears next month and the shares rally, call holders will capture much of that upside. If the market sours on this high flyer, calls will suffer along with shares, but much less so.I have to confess that I liked looking at the financial history here because there's so little of it. This fits nicely with my innate laziness. The first thing that pops off the page when looking at the financial history here is the fact that demand for Okta's services is quite robust. This is evidenced by the fact that over the past few years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 44%. In my view, that's what investors seem to be fixated on, because there's little else that's positive about the financial history here. In spite of the fact that sales have grown so dramatically, the company has so far failed to turn a profit. In fact, the more the company sells, the more it loses. I decided to quantify this relationship, so I ran a correlation between revenue and net income. There is a very strong (r=-.96) relationship between revenue and net income. This prompts the very obvious question: if growing sales won't lead to profits, what will?! Also, if rising sales actually lead to rising losses, something may be fundamentally flawed here. Whatever the answer to that question, theme of ""revenue and losses ballooning in tandem"" seems to be persisting, given that the first nine months of FY 2019 saw revenue up 58% and net loss up 9%. On the ""bright"" side, loss per share has actually declined on the back of fairly sizeable dilution of 39% from the last period to the most recent.Part of the reason for the increased losses relates to the fact that R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A expenses are also up dramatically. They're up at a CAGR of 35%, 30%, and 39%, respectively. Bulls obviously believe that something will happen in future to allow the firm to continue to grow sales while reducing these expenses. In my view, increased R&D and sales expenses are a necessary part of this sort of business. They are the glue that ties clients to the firm. If Okta eases off on these, revenue will likely fall. Thus, we're in a situation where the company is on a kind of treadmill: they must spend ever larger sums to attract and keep customers, which leads to losses. If they don't, it's very likely that someone else will. In my view, that sums up the existential threat associated with this business.Source: Company filingsThe interesting thing about investing is that we're not only looking for businesses that will make money, but we're looking to pay a reasonable price for that. Such an idea may sound revolutionary to ""investors"" who are willing to bid companies to extraordinary valuations because of (hushed tones) ""the cloud"", and ""security"" and ""SaaS"" I'd say that we've seen this story before, and it didn't end well. That said, I think it's possible that even a company that has such a poor financial track record as this may be an excellent investment if the price is right. For that reason, I must keep an open mind and spend some time looking at the stock as a thing distinct from the underlying business.I employ a host of methods to determine whether a stock is expensive, but in this piece, I'll talk about only one of them as I see no need to belabor the point. During the most recent quarter, Okta generated its first ever positive free cash flow in the amount of $1.4 million, or 1.3% of revenue. That means that the shares are currently trading at a price to free cash flow of approximately 75 times. If we assume that the free cash flow can be annualized over the next four quarters, the shares are trading at a forward price to free cash flow of ~20 times, which is not extraordinarily expensive, in my view.The risk obviously comes down to whether this free cash is sustainable. Given that I'm fairly risk-averse, I'll wait for more confirmation, but I understand that more adventurous people would be willing to buy with a belief that free cash flow is about to explode.The company is about to report, and, given the mood of the market, it's likely that investors will focus entirely on the positives, which will cause the stock price to inflate even further. Although I'm not yet convinced that this is a reasonable investment at these prices, I want to hedge my bets. For that reason, I'm recommending a call option strategy as a means to capture much of the upside from this stock with far less risk. Given that the company is about to report, the shares are entering a period of maximum risk, and I would want to buy calls that expire after earnings are announced. The reason for this is that the risk-reward is quite favorable. For very little capital, investors can access much of the upside the company may enjoy. If the market isn't impressed by the upcoming earnings, far less capital is imperiled.At the time of writing, the May call with a strike of $85 is being asked at $8.70. Thus, for 10% of the capital at risk, an investor will gain exposure to most of the mania-driven upside from here. If the shares drop, call holders lose much of their capital, but they are better off on a risk-adjusted basis, in my view. This is especially the case in light of the fact that this company doesn't (and likely won't for some time) pay a dividend.There is much to like about this stock, obviously, and it could be argued that it's not extraordinarily expensive on a price to free cash flow basis. That said, I have some doubts. Given that there's no opportunity cost from a lost dividend, I strongly suggest that investors sell their shares and buy the calls mentioned. Doing so presents investors with a risk-return relationship that is positively skewed. If the shares continue to rise, they will capture most of that upside. If the market is disappointed by earnings, the options will tank, but in that case, the investor will be relatively less badly off than a shareholder."

The growth is expected to be driven by the rising adoption of cloud services and mobile devices and the continued need to drive compliance to manage insider threat. Billion-Dollar Unicorn Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) reported its third-quarter results last month that surpassed market expectations.Revenues for the quarter increased 58% to $105.7 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $97 million. It ended the quarter with a non-GAAP net loss of $0.04 per share, compared with the Street's forecast of a loss of $0.11 per share. This also was the first ever quarter that Okta reported a free cash flow-positive quarter with free cash flow of $1.4 million.By segment, subscription services revenues increased 58% over the year to $97.7 million. Professional services and the others segment revenues grew 56% to $7.9 million.During the quarter, Okta reported a 58% growth in calculated billings to $124 million. Trailing 12 months' calculated billings grew 59% to $434 million. Its customer base increased 42% to 5,600 mainly across its enterprise customer base.For the current quarter, Okta forecast revenues of $106-107 million with a net loss of $0.08-0.09 per share. The Street was looking for revenues of $99.9 million and a loss of $0.11 for the quarter. The company expects to end the year with $391-392 million in revenues and non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.36-0.37. The Street was looking for revenues of $356.5 million and a net loss of $0.56 per share for the year.Today, more and more organizations are shifting their business to the cloud and are trying to launch applications and services that can better engage with customers online - all while maintaining their high security level. To cater to this demand, Okta is focused on three key offerings - Identity Cloud, Integration Network, and its security standard. Okta's Identity Cloud service is offered as an independent platform. It's an integrated IAM service that offers its customers the flexibility to accommodate every type of user. Above all, the Identity Cloud can adapt to whatever technological investments the customer makes in the future, making it future-proof.The company's second area of focus is the Okta Integration Network that offers more than 5,500 pre-built integrations to cloud and on-premise applications to network security providers like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), to security analytics providers like Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), and to IT operations providers like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW). Its integrations are helping new customers deploy Okta in an accelerated manner.Finally, Okta is able to serve as the identity standard for its customers because it offers a single identity platform for every type of user in an organization's ecosystem. Organizations can offer a platform best suited for its employees, contractors, partners, and even their customers. The ability to manage and secure all identities in a consistent way from a single platform is a big attraction to its customers.As a result of these focus areas, Okta was recently ranked by Forrester Research as a strong performer for its people, workforce security, vision and strategy, and market approach. The company has grown recently through its product upgrades and acquisitions. Earlier this year, it had announced the acquisition of zero trust security firm ScaleFT. ScaleFT was founded in 2015 by Jason Luce and Paul Querna, and provided an access management platform that enables secure remote access without a VPN. Prior to the acquisition, ScaleFT had only raised $2.8 million in a seed round funding. The IAM acquisition market was hot last year, when KPMG acquired the largest independent IAM provider, Cyberinc, for an undisclosed sum. Last summer, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) also announced the acquisition of privately held Duo Security for $2.35 billion as it continued to expand its security assets.I don't believe Okta would be looking at acquisitions of such value for its next round of growth. Instead, the company should probably evaluate some capital-efficient, bootstrapped niche startups that could offer it more value for money.

The growth will be driven by the continuing adoption of Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD) in the workplace. The Americas were the biggest market for the industry and accounted for 41% of the share. However, as growth picks up in EMEA and the rest of the world, America's market share is estimated to reduce 4% during the forecast period. Here's an interesting infographic from the report.Okta's FinancialsBillion-Dollar Unicorn Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) recently reported its second quarter results that surpassed market expectations. Revenues for the quarter increased 57% to $94.6 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $84.7 million. It ended the quarter with a non GAAP net loss of $0.15 per share, compared with the Street's forecast of a loss of $0.20 per share.By segment, revenues from Subscription Services increased 59% over the year to $87.9 million and Professional Services grew 36% to $6.7 million.For the current quarter, Okta forecast revenues of $96-$97 million with a net loss of $0.12-$0.11 per share. It expects to end the year with $372-$375 million in revenues and non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.48-$0.46. The Street was looking for revenues of $356.5 million and a net loss of $0.56 per share for the year.Earlier last quarter, Okta announced the acquisition of zero trust security firm ScaleFT for an undisclosed sum. ScaleFT was founded in 2015 by Jason Luce and Paul Querna. It provides an access management platform that enables secure remote access without a VPN. Its product was inspired by Google's security system BeyondCorp. While traditional security products focus on protecting the network, ScaleFT's product focuses on protecting devices and context. It essentially doesn't trust anyone - not even those within the firewall.Okta plans to integrate ScaleFT's platform with its Identity Cloud to improve its contextual access management offering. Okta's Identity Cloud already allows organizations to authenticate users without relying on passwords. ScaleFT's addition will help strengthen that feature. ScaleFT has been privately held and its financials are not known. According to Crunchbase, the company had raised $2.8 million in seed round funding prior to the acquisition.Besides acquisitions, Okta also is expanding through strategic tie-ups. This summer, it entered into an agreement with VMware (NYSE:VMW). Through the tie-up, VMware Workspace ONE and Okta Identity Cloud solutions will be integrated to deliver secure enterprise cloud migration solutions and streamline IT management. Together, the two will enable validation of users, devices, applications, and network behaviors to drive secure cloud environments.Interest in Okta has soared in recent months given acquisitions in the industry. Last quarter, Cisco announced the acquisition of privately held Duo Security for $2.35 billion. Cisco has really stirred the pot in the industry. Over the past few years, it has been slowly adding to its security portfolio. It bought intrusion detection tech firm Sourcefire in 2013, malware analyzing firm Threatgrid in 2014, domain name service provider OpenDNS and network monitor Lancope in 2015. Its latest buy, Ann Arbor, Michigan,-based Duo Security, was known for its unified access security and authentication products that were delivered to its customers over the cloud. Its products verify the identity of computer network users and check devices for malware before granting them access to applications. Prior to the acquisition, Duo Security had raised $121.5 million in funding and was valued at $1.8 billion. The acquisition will help Cisco deliver a more secure service and drive competition with Okta.Do you think Okta will manage to stand its own ground despite Cisco's rising importance in the sector, or do you think Okta will be on a shopping list itself?Its stock is currently trading at $68.10 with a market capitalization of $7.4 billion. It had touched a 52-week high of $75.49 earlier last month. It has been climbing from the 52-week low of $24.71 that it was trading at in December last year. Okta went public last year at a valuation of $1.54 billion. Prior to the listing, it had raised $228 million from investors including Altimeter Capital, Janus Capital Group, Khosla Ventures, Greylock Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, FLOODGATE, SV Angel, Maynard Webb, Dharmesh Shah, Stephen Marcus, Avid Larizadeh, Ed Roberts, Tom Berson, and Jacques & Sandra Kerrest. Prior to the listing, the company was valued at $1.2 billion."

The net dollar retention rate of 120% suggests that this is working very well.And of course all these log-ons produce tons of data which is useful in itself as a source of creating insights into threats with the help of analytics. From Q3CC:The company keeps on developing new and improved functionality and hinted at a major update in multi-factor authentication in the near future at their customer conference.From the 10-Q:Revenue was growing at 58% in Q3 and even professional services grew that fast (56%) although these are 7% of revenues. Overseas sales grew 58% and constitute 16% of revenues; there is an even bigger opportunity there.Revenue growth is going to slow down quite a bit, from 52%-53% for fiscal 2019 as a whole to 39% for Q4 2019 to 30%-33% in fiscal 2020.Non-GAAP EPS is guided at a loss of $0.08-$0.09 in Q4 to a loss of $0.36-$0.37 for the whole of fiscal 2019.OKTA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe subscription gross margins are 82.2% and they're up again 180 basis points y/y.

4229630,103480,2018-12-21T10:08:16-05:00,"Despite the sharp correction in stocks over the past year, Okta remains up nearly 150% since the start of the year.The stock has also lost barely any value from its 52-week high of $75.There is good reason to be bullish: revenue growth is holding in the high 50s, and the company has also hit FCF breakeven.However, Okta looks prohibitively expensive at 17x forward revenues, and the stock will underperform the markets should volatility continue.","Last Friday, all three main U.S. indices officially entered into correction territory, as all are now down more than 10% from previous peaks. As most investors know, alongside bank shares, tech stocks have been among the hardest-hit in the fallout. Despite this, shares of single sign-on company Okta (OKTA) have remained remarkably resilient amid the downturn, having lost only about 10% of its value from peak while many of its SaaS peers are down 30-40% or worse.The question for investors now is: will the outperformance in Okta continue, and is it worth holding onto for 2019?OKTA data by YChartsIn my view, Okta has become an incredibly expensive stock at ~18x forward revenues, and its upside is capped in 2019. At best, the stock is a hold.There are plenty of fundamental bullish drivers underpinning Okta's massive rally this year (it's up approximately 150% for the year, which is incredible when we take into account the fact that most high-growth stocks are now down). From a business perspective, Okta's single sign-on product still has virtually no equals in the market, and it's a very greenfield install opportunity. Unlike crowded markets in software like CRM or HCM, SSO has relatively few vendors, and Okta is the undisputed best-in-breed provider.This relatively clear runway for growth has made itself evident in Okta's quarterly earnings. The company recently released Q3 results a few weeks back, and the company stunned yet again with its pace of growth. Its top line has continued to rise by about ~60% every quarter in an uninterrupted fashion, suggesting that Okta is hardly short of opportunities for new business.Okta is also a great example of a true ""land-and-expand"" business model. Most of Okta's products are priced on a per-seat basis. For example, here is a sample pricing chart for Okta's core SSO product below:Figure 1. Okta SSO pricingSource: Okta.comAs Okta's customers extend usage into other departments (thereby adding more users) or by adding new modules such as Lifecycle Management or Universal Directory, Okta's subscription billings expand dramatically relative to the initial install.That being said, however, we have to realize that much of this bullish theory has already been priced into the stock. At 18x forward revenues, Okta is one of the most expensive stocks in the SaaS sector.We combine this fact with the knowledge that markets are incredibly shaky at the moment, and appetite for risk has cooled off. Despite Okta's high revenue growth and achievement of positive FCF status, the company's GAAP losses remain relatively steep. Year to date, Okta has generated negative GAAP EPS of -$0.89 and a net margin of -33%.Investors are more willing to look past heavy stock-based comp and lean on pro forma metrics when bull markets are favoring growth names, but amid declining favor for tech shares, Okta look heavily at risk.Stock-based comp is also up heavily year to date, and as stock comp is an important compensation piece for Okta's all-important sales teams, this elevated dilution is likely to continue if Okta wants to maintain its high pace of growth. For the third quarter, stock-based comp of $21.5 million is up 49% y/y.Figure 2. Okta stock-based compSource: Okta Q3 earnings releaseIn my view, the more prudent move is to invest in either more stable and GAAP profitable tech heavyweights, or cheaper growth stocks that have been hit hard in the recent correction. At such an expensive valuation, Okta looks primed for a pullback.Let's take a deeper dive into Okta's third-quarter results, which is undoubtedly one of the factors keeping the stock at an elevated level:Figure 3. Okta 3Q19 resultsSource: Okta Q3 earnings releaseRevenues grew 58% y/y to $105.6 million, absolutely decimating Wall Street's expectations of $96.9 million (+45% y/y) by a thirteen-point beat margin. To add even more context to this growth rate, last quarter, Okta had grown at 57% y/y, so this quarter actually represents done point of acceleration. Many observers had been expecting Okta to begin slowing down, but this hasn't happened yet.Revenue growth has been disappointing for many tech companies this quarter, so Okta's huge beat is a large source of relief for investors. We note also that Billings in the quarter of $124.0 million matched revenue growth at a 58% y/y growth pace, while the dollar volume of billings exceeded the top revenues. This indicates that Okta has signed on a sufficient amount of deals into its pipeline to keep its revenue flowing throughout the next several quarters, which undoubtedly provides a secondary source of relief for investors.Figure 4. Okta billings Source: Okta Q3 earnings releaseHere's some more qualitative growth commentary from Okta's CFO Bill Losch on the Q3 earnings call:We acknowledge as well that Okta showed strength on the bottom line. Gross margins expanded 350bps to 71.9% on a GAAP basis, up from 68.4% in the prior-year quarter. In addition, Okta mad huge improvements in its operating margin due to increased sales leverage. As a percentage of revenues, Okta trimmed down its sales and marketing costs to ""just"" 53.9% in Q3, down from 71.0% in the year-ago quarter.This is a prime illustration of Okta's land-and-expand model at work. It doesn't cost much in incremental sales dollars to add more seats or more modules to a pre-existing customer, so over time as Okta's customer base begins to mature and grow its relationship with Okta, the company can naturally achieve sales leverage from higher average tickets among its customers.As a result of much-improved sales leverage, Okta's GAAP operating margin improved to -27.0%, leagues better than -51.6% in the year-ago quarter. We note also that Okta's pro forma EPS of -$0.04 smashed Wall Street's expectations of -$0.11. In addition, the company hit FCF breakeven with free cash flows of $1.4 million in the quarter, up from an FCF loss of -$11.2 million in the year-ago quarter:Figure 5. Okta FCFSource: Okta Q3 earnings releaseThere's no doubt that Okta has one of the strongest financial profiles in the SaaS sector. The company's ability to maintain growth in the ~60% range while at the same time improving operating margins by more than twenty points and hitting cash flow breakeven is a position to envy.It's difficult to make a bearish call on a company that is performing so robustly, but in my view, an 18x forward revenue multiple virtually prices in all of that upside. As investors continue to be jittery on growth names, GAAP earnings and dilution risks may come to dominate Okta's narrative. In addition, the slightest hint of deceleration in either billings growth or revenue growth could knock Okta off course.At best, Okta is currently a hold - there's no doubt that this company's long-term future is secure, but I believe there will be an opportunity in 2019 to snag shares at a lower price. The company's strong financial performance prevents me from being overly bearish, but neither is it possible to be gung-ho on a stock that is trading so richly amid a sea of shattered peers."
4194211,104662,2018-08-02T23:20:01-04:00,"Okta operates in a small niche in the cloud industry.As data privacy spending increases, Okta provides a flexible solution for their customers.Okta's focus is solely on authentication, which allows them to offer services that enterprise cloud providers will not.Data privacy spending, an effective business model, and a developing moat provide a bullish future for Okta to continue their run.","Okta's (OKTA) share price has seen a 100% growth since the beginning of the year. Yet when investors see Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) as competitors, sentiment shifts, as belief that a small company can compete and succeed in the enterprise software industry diminishes. However, by understanding the specific niche that Okta covers, investors should see the cloud war among Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft and Oracle serve as a positive growth factor for Okta. As long as the enterprise software industry remains competitive, companies will look to remain flexible and avoid vendor lock-in, which frees Okta to continue growth in the long run. Okta provides companies with a “single sign-on” solution, offering a user authentication software that will help companies mitigate cyber threats, and comply with data privacy regulations.Before understanding how Okta can succeed in the long run, we should first look at how the data privacy industry is growing. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been implemented. IT departments now have a major requirement that needs to be added to almost any project. The failure to do so? Companies will be forced to pay an incredibly high fee. GDPR is also not the end of the data privacy regulations, as multiple countries, including India and America, are looking to fortify their own countries' data privacy needs.To counteract this, spending in data privacy is growing quickly. Data privacy and cybersecurity are expected to become a $1 trillion industry in the next few years. But the damages of cyber threats? Expected to be about $6 trillion annually by 2021.Where does Okta fit in this? One of the main types of cybersecurity attacks comes from spoofing, which is where a hacker attempts to enter a system pretending to be a client or user, allowing the hacker to successfully infiltrate it. User authentication is how companies mitigate this, and Okta provides a vendor flexible authentication solution. (For investors interested in learning how multi-factor authentication is used to meet GDPR rules, I recommend this post).Source: Akins ITThe Okta Identity Cloud is the main offering of Okta. It integrates with already existing company software, and allows users to log in through Okta, then access their enterprise software. Effectively, it becomes the gateway to the company’s system. From Okta’s 10-K, “We designed the Okta Identity Cloud to provide organizations an integrated approach to managing and securing all of their identities. Our platform allows our customers to easily provision their customers, employees, contractors, and partners, enabling any user to connect to any device, cloud or application, all with a simple, intuitive and consumer-like user experience. Developers leverage the Okta Identity Cloud to secure and manage the identities of their own customers accessing their cloud and mobile applications.”Okta is providing companies an easy way to comply with GDPR provisions regarding user identity and spoofing. Within the Okta product, companies can add two-factor authentication and/or multi-factor authentication to their own ecosystem. This allows companies to choose their security parameters (image below), and provide a simple platform for allowing employees to go through authentication, then proceed to whichever application they need to access, regardless of who the vendor is.Source: OktaThe advantages of Okta over similar offerings from Microsoft and Oracle is that it is a focused platform, with one purpose. This is important because their competitors offer a similar platform, but it can only be used with that vendor's software. Meaning Microsoft MFA can only be used with Microsoft products.Okta recognizes this, and have focused their R&D to provide a solution that is designed to be easily integrated with other cloud and enterprise software platforms their customers already use. This ease of integration is crucial for remaining flexible and meeting a growing and changing list of data privacy regulations, as GDPR has shut down products that do not comply with their standards.A vendor flexible solution is the key to building Okta’s moat. Microsoft offers Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, and Oracle and AWS (Amazon Web Services) also offer their own MFA add-ons. The companies will choose Okta’s solution over their current vendor for two reasons: Companies want to remain flexible in their IT department, and avoid vendor lock-in.Vendor lock-in is where a customer uses one company as their main cloud provider, and the cloud infrastructure becomes so ingrained into the customer’s business that a customer is “locked in” with this software. This gives the vendor pricing power, and leads to an overall shift of power as the customer is a victim to whatever terms the vendor gives.Okta’s main differentiation from Amazon and others is their ability to provide a platform that allows companies to switch cloud providers without having to reconfigure their authentication software (avoiding vendor lock-in is a key factor for future growth for Okta, and I recommend this article if you want more information).To summarize the above, Okta provides a single platform solution that serves companies that have more than one cloud provider, or companies that want the flexibility to change to a better or cheaper cloud provider in the future. Their competitors do not, and do not have an incentive to provide this, as they want customers to use all of their own products.However, there is the risk of customers that don’t want the flexibility. If customers are aware of the risk of vendor lock-in, but still believe in the end that this will provide cost savings, then Okta becomes severely disadvantaged. This can come from a company deciding that retraining their employees to use a new cloud service, or the costs of switching providers, outweigh the savings of switching to a cloud provider with better costs or services. Also, companies that have only one cloud provider will likely just use the authentication software product associated with it (such as Microsoft’s Azure MFA for clients using Microsoft Azure). Also, if competition decreases in the cloud industry, Okta will likely see their growth prospects diminish, as Okta relies on a competitive cloud industry that encourages customers to remain flexible.The other risk often cited, which I view as highly unlikely, is that one of the big cloud providers will offer a product similar to Okta. But this doesn’t make sense in terms of overall profitability. Cloud providers want to develop an entire ecosystem. Using vendor flexible software doesn’t help them; they want you to use their cloud offering, then expand and use their supporting products. Creating a product that allows a customer to easily switch to a competitor will be counterintuitive, and ruin the high-switching cost aspect of the enterprise cloud industry.Okta is a great investment for those seeking exposure to the growing data privacy industry. However, Okta's shares have also seen a nearly 100% increase so far this year. With the stock falling within the last week, along with other tech stocks, it's important to see if Okta still has room to grow.In the last earnings call (transcript here) and earnings release, Okta reported a revenue increase of 60% YoY, totaling $83.6 million. Most of this is attributed to a rise in subscriptions, their main source of revenue. Okta sells their products through multi-year subscriptions, which ensure both steady sales and high switching costs. On the margin side, we see a GAAP gross margin of 71%, ensuring a clear path to future profitability.Source: Okta Investor RelationsOkta won’t be seeing positive earnings for a while, and they warned investors of this in their 10-Q. R&D and sales and marketing expenses are also growing sharply YoY, so Okta will be trading in earnings for growth for the foreseeable future.But despite the lack of earnings, investors still want to see positive cash flow. In the last quarter, Okta has lowered their FCF margin loss from -26% to -2%, and is on pace to become free cash flow positive by end of the year, if not next quarter. This should ease concerns for a company that is giving up earnings for growth.Also, another positive trend is the operating cash flow. Okta started the year being operating cash flow positive for the first time, and saw this increase significantly last quarter, from $0.16 million to $3.97 million. Again we want to check cash flows to see any warning signs, not necessarily to provide a valuation, as we understand Okta’s growth model, and the importance of spending heavily in growing the business.Okta also released revenue guidance, expecting 2019 revenue to be between $353 million and $357 million, although it should be noted Okta has continuously beat their guidance with ease. For these high growth companies, I like to use P/S to determine if the stock is overvalued. As of this writing, Okta’s market cap is at $5.45 billion, giving us a P/S ratio slightly above 15. When we use the 2020 revenue expectations, $470 million, we now see Okta’s future P/S ratio sit at 11.6.However, these P/S ratios are likely on the high end. Okta’s ability to easily outpace guidance has caused analysts to become skeptical. In the earnings call, Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) asked, “... if I look at your sequential revenue guidance given how well you guys did in Q1, it looks like you’re implying flat up 2% kind of sequential guide. I am just wondering under what circumstances would like what would have to happen to you guys to see kind of flat sequential revenue growth kind of what things would be factored into that just given all the great momentum in your business?”CEO Todd McKinnon replied that there were big deals in Q4 2018 that ended up being deployed in Q1 2019. He also stated, “The second thing is that during the course of the Q1 quarter, we had a lot more linearity in the business than we had anticipated.” Either investors should take this as leadership seeing some difficult situations in the near future, or that they’re looking to make headlines by greatly exceeding expectations. I think it’s the latter.Without any noticeable warning signs in the financials for a company in this situation, investors should focus on two metrics: revenue growth and operating margin. How fast is this company growing? And is there a path to profitability? With revenue growth forecast to be 40% YoY next quarter (and I view this as a low conservative guidance) and current operating margin at 71%, I believe the financials solidify the case that Okta’s business model is growing, and has a solid path to profitability.Okta is providing investors a solid risk/reward investment for those seeking high growth investments. Data privacy spending is growing and will continue to grow, Okta is effectively creating a moat against mega-cap competitors, and they are doing this without risking financial stability. The two most important metrics investors need to consider (revenue growth and operating margin) both provide a clear picture that Okta’s business is sustainable, and their business model is effective.Okta serves as a good risk/reward investment for the growing industry’s need. Okta’s recent sell-off looks like a good time to start a position. However, investors may want to wait to see if the tech sell-off continues, but interested investors will likely want to begin entering a position before their next earnings call, where Okta will look to easily exceed their questionably low guidance.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

4205154,103130,2018-09-09T21:29:27-04:00,"Okta shares rose 16% after-hours yesterday after earnings were released.The company witnessed record customer growth this quarter.Despite acceleration in customer growth, management is expecting weak revenue growth for Q3 2019.","On Thursday, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) released earnings results for Q2 2019.OKTA data by YChartsNeedless to say, investors were impressed by the results, which sent shares up 16% after-hours.As a very brief background, Okta focuses on authentication through the Okta Identity Cloud, which comprises the company's three services shown in the image below.(Source: Okta website)In the beginning of the Q2 2019 earnings call, management had this to say about customer success:The CEO went on to talk about various customers, but I want to focus on two instances. The first instance is Twenty First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOX), which is an existing customer. The media giant has 30,000 employees using Okta's cloud, and Okta was able to cross-sell the company an API security solution, which added significant revenue to an already solid relationship. The other instance was a new customer, Meraki, which is part of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and signed up for three solutions from Okta's offerings, which shows that Okta's products are compelling and large businesses are interested.A huge component in the success with customers is the market tailwind of companies migrating their data and applications to the cloud.(Source: Forbes)According to the graph above, the CAGR of public cloud spending is projected to be 19%, which estimated spending rising from $117 billion in 2018 to $162 billion in 2020.(Source: Forbes)The elements of Okta's strong market positioning do not end there. According to a Forbes poll, security is by far the largest concern for corporations, with 30% of respondents citing data security as one of their primary concerns when taking their data offsite and storing it in a centralized system. The second highest concern, migration/integration, is also a service that Okta provides, which means the cloud company is capitalizing on the two largest issues corporations are having when considering a shift to the cloud.Another important point management mentioned during the call was the neutrality of Okta's service:Most companies rarely trust a single cloud provider to store all of their data. Instead, they have multiple cloud providers store certain chunks of data, and/or balance data between the cloud and on-site storage. In either case, logging into systems becomes tedious for employees and accountability is tougher to maintain with multiple access points. Thus, Okta's true value-add is in being a cloud authentication pure play, in which it can provide a single log-in that allows all employees to access data/applications and maintains data integrity. Meanwhile, not all companies can trust other large cloud players, such as AWS or Azure, to perform the same services as Okta, because a competing cloud provider would not help a customer integrate their cloud services with another company's cloud services.Now, let's dive into the numbers.Revenue this quarter was $94.6 million, which is an impressive revenue growth of 57% year over year. Subscription revenue of $87.9 million, 59% growth year over year, represented 93% of total revenue. Although it seems inconsequential that subscription revenue as a portion of total revenue went up from 92% to 93% between those periods, I have witnessed SaaS businesses have trouble maintaining percentages of subscription revenue above 80%. But then again, Okta is different, since it started out with the SaaS model instead of transitioning to it.(Source: Created by author)To give a better understanding of how revenue has been growing between quarters, I used data from the Q2 2019 Supplemental Financial Data to find trends in revenue growth. I found that quarterly subscription revenue has been growing steadily in the mid-teens (except for Q1 2019), while professional services revenue has fluctuated significantly between quarters, which is to be expected from a non-subscription revenue source. The orange-shaded column represents revenue projections for Q3 2019 based on the CAGRs of both types of revenue. However, projections based on past figures are not intrinsically meaningful, so I inputted the guidance figures to see what growth rates are expected for next quarter.(Source: Created by author)For total revenue, management guided between $96 million to $97 million for next quarter, so I plugged it in and realized that they are only expecting 2% from now to next quarter. An analyst happened to ask about this directly during the Q&A:To provide you with a visual for the ""uptick"" in customers that Rob Owens is referring to, I pulled the numbers of customers reported by management in previous quarters.(Source: Created by author)As management said, Okta added 450 new customers in the quarter, which is a record based on past figures. So, I agree with Rob Owens about this being strange, because customer growth has correlated with revenue growth, and with management expecting minimal top line growth next quarter, this leads me to assume that the company is struggling to generate leads in the beginning of the third quarter. In response to Rob's question, the CFO had this to say:I am not sure if I am satisfied with Losch's rationale, because his implication is that a lot of business has come from SMEs in past quarters, and suddenly investors are expected to see a majority of business come from large enterprises. More information about why this is happening should have been given, because we cannot tell if management is strategically shifting the sales team's efforts on securing larger customers or if they are expecting a slowdown in SME customers. A strategic shift would allay many investors, because dealing with large enterprises allows for greater economies of scale and higher margins. But a sudden drop in SMEs would be a serious concern.Let's take a look at the company's balance sheet.The significant increase in cash & cash equivalents and short-term investments was due to the issuance of senior convertible notes last quarter. Choosing to issue convertible debt instead of going directly to the market to issue common stock signals that management believes the company is in good financial health, and that they are comfortable making the capital structure decision of paying less interest on debt rather than playing it safe by giving up equity that could be worth much more in the future. There is nothing noteworthy on the liabilities side, so I will end with a look at the company's cash flow statements.(Source: Q2 2019 Supplemental Financial Data)Okta has returned to negative operating cash flow, but upon closer inspection, this is mainly due to the increase in accounts receivable. Looking at the trends in changes to accounts receivable, Q1 usually sees A/R decrease, which I assume is due to customers who pay annually at the beginning of the year. I think management expected negative operating cash flow for Q3 and Q4, and as a result, issued enough debt to acquire ScaleFT and pad themselves with cash for the next couple of quarters.(Source: Q2 2019 Supplemental Financial Data)The two significant figures I see here are from Q1 and Q2 of 2019. The first one, in the investing cash flows statement, is -$252.9 million for Purchases of securities available for sale. This is simply the purchase of short-term investments. The other figure is $335.1 million from the financing cash flows statement, and that is just the proceeds from the debt issuance. Overall, the cash flows are looking healthy for a SaaS company at this stage, and I do not see any issues with how management is spending money.The second quarter of 2019 was good for Okta. The company experienced record customer growth, with total customers surpassing 5,150 and customers with over 100,000 in ARR growing at the largest rate in recent history. Okta has also found itself in a strong market position, in which its neutrality makes it the ideal service to help clients integrate various clouds and hybrid cloud models together to increase productivity. The only hiccup from the Q2 report involved the acceleration of customer growth and very modest guidance for Q3 revenue. Although management blamed longer sales cycles from large clients for the conservative revenue estimate next quarter, it would have been nice to know if this is because management is diverting sales resources from SMEs to large enterprises in order to increase margins or if they expect business from SMEs to decrease, which would be strange based on the acceleration in total customers.Despite the discrepancy with customer growth and Q3 guidance, Okta looks well-positioned to succeed in the long run based on its market positioning and financials. Thus, I would buy shares in Okta."

There are much better and more value-oriented names to invest in.Okta's revenue growth may be vulnerable as well. Growth decelerated by three points sequentially this quarter, and further deceleration might cause investors to dial back their enthusiasm.","Okta (OKTA), the popular single-sign on software company that went public last year, continues to defy gravity. Its stock has been rising all year amid a tense and choppy tech sector, but the company's recent Q2 earnings report resulted in one of the company's best one-day performances since its IPO. Shares of Okta vaulted up 20% in a single day, catapulting the stock to a near-$8 billion market cap and to its new all-time high:OKTA data by YChartsI was an enthusiastic investor in Okta early on in its IPO. I liked that, among software companies, Okta was truly unique. It's not just another application software company that peddles common products such as CRM or ERP, which are software categories with dozens of clones. Okta instead tackled a truly wide and critical area of software, managing internal access and networks, and it has achieved vast success.Yes, I sold too early and regret having done so. But I'll stand by my conviction that Okta's rally has a near-term ceiling and its valuation will severely cap future gains. When I think of the biggest long-term winners in the SaaS space, what come to mind are names like Adobe (ADBE) and Workday (WDAY) - companies that, for the most part, have been able to maintain double-digit revenue multiples and continue pushing their stock higher as they grew. Even so, however, these titanic companies (they are among the largest pure-play cloud companies in the market, together with Salesforce.com (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW)) were only able to maintain revenue multiples in the low teens.The law of gravity dictates that, at some point, Okta's valuation multiple will compress as well. So will its growth - last quarter, Okta grew revenues at 60% y/y; this quarter, that growth rate decelerated three points to 57% y/y. Okta's guidance for the full year (shown in the snapshot below) implies just 44% y/y growth in FY19, though Okta has been a perennially conservative guidance giver and this range is probably understated by $15 million (4%) or more:Figure 1. Okta guidance updateSource: Okta investor relationsOf course, we can't expect Okta's revenue growth to keep maintaining its current pace forever. At some point its growth rates will come down, but in my view, investors may be blindsided by the pace of deceleration (sort of how they reacted to Facebook's (FB) announcement of sequential ""high single-digit"" deceleration in the back half of this year) and exit the stock. Okta's high growth has been the mainstay behind its humongous valuation - and with shares so richly valued, Okta is at risk. At its current share price of $72, Okta carries a market cap of $7.64 billion. After netting out $542 million of cash and $264 million of debt, Okta is left with an enterprise value of $7.36 billion. That's a valuation of 19.7x EV/FY19 revenues - the steepest valuation even among high-growth SaaS stocks and recent IPOs. At some point, Okta will settle into a more normalized valuation in the mid-teens. Investors would be wise to lock in their tremendous gains at this juncture.Here's a look at Okta's Q2 results that sent shares skyward:Figure 2. Okta Q2 2019 earnings resultsSource: Okta investor relationsRevenues continued to balloon at 57% y/y growth to $94.6 million. To Okta's credit, apart from being one of the most highly valued companies in the SaaS space, it also is one of the fastest-growing - so to some degree, its premium valuation is deserved. The main question is how much of a premium is appropriate.That is especially true as Okta is expected to continue seeing decelerating revenue growth over the next few quarters; as previously mentioned, this quarter's growth rate lagged behind Q1 by three points. Still, Okta grew by far more than Wall Street was expecting: consensus expectations pinned this quarter's revenues at $84.8 million, or 41% y/y growth. The sixteen-point beat margin to Wall Street expectations is also one of the best performances in the SaaS space this quarter.Okta added a couple of big-ticket clients in the quarter. Among them are 21st Century Fox (FOXA), the media giant, as well as BOK Financial (NASDAQ:BOKF) and Vox Media (VOXM). In total, the company ended the quarter with 5,150 customers. Among the existing customer base, net retention remained high at 121% - the same as last quarter.The billings picture, however, may pose a potential problem. Bill Losch, Okta's CFO, reported that billings grew just 53% y/y. When Billings growth lags behind revenue growth, it's usually a forward-looking indicator that revenue growth might tip over and decelerate.Save for billings, Okta reported a strong quarter on the top line. However, profits remain far in the distance. Despite small margin improvements this quarter, Okta remains far from being able to generate a GAAP operating profit. This may prove to be the company's Achilles' heel - investors are able to tolerate losses as long as growth outperforms, but eventually Okta has to turn its losses around.Gross margin in the quarter improved 300 bps year over year, helped both by a stronger mix of subscription revenues and a ~10 point improvement in professional services margins to -17.9%, up from -26.5% in the year-ago quarter. Like many other companies, Okta performs professional services below cost to attract new clients, but luckily, its mix of subscription to services revenue is higher (at 93%) than most SaaS companies.Operating expense items, however, remained high. The company's sales and marketing costs exploded by 56% y/y to $59.0 million, continuing to be Okta's largest expense category and only improving by one point as a percentage of revenues. This indicates that, while Okta's growth is expensive, it is also costly to produce. Okta also nearly doubled its general and administrative expenses. GAAP operating losses, as a result, widened to -$38.4 million, which represents a staggering loss margin of -40.6%, only 280 bps better than -43.4% in the year-ago quarter. The beat to analysts' EPS expectations (-$0.15 versus consensus of -$0.19) was also a bit lighter than the revenue beat.Free cash flow losses also widened somewhat to -$11.3 million, up from -$10.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Of course, Okta still has plenty of liquidity to sponge up its current losses, but it's fairly evident that Okta has a lot more to prove on the bottom line front. A company that's trading so richly should be able to perform well on both growth and profitability.There's no doubt that Okta had a fantastic second quarter as well as an upbeat outlook for the remainder of the year, but a valuation multiple near 20x this year's revenues should make many investors skittish. Very few companies are able to preserve such a premium valuation for an extended period of time. If you're thinking of cashing in big gains on Okta's stock, you're probably not the only one. Okta's high multiple, in my view, makes it extremely susceptible to profit-taking."

Recently reported results of the Billion-Dollar Unicorn Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) corroborate this rapid growth.Okta's identity management solution simplifies the identity access management services for organizations by removing duplicative credentials and disparate authentication policies. Its fourth quarter revenues grew 59% over the year to $77.8 million, driven by a 64% growth in subscription revenues to $72 million. For the quarter, GAAP net loss was $24.7 million, compared with $18.2 million a year ago. Non-GAAP net loss was $10.1 million, or $0.10 per share, compared with $12.9 million, or $0.66 per share a year ago. The market was looking for revenues of $74.4 million and an adjusted net loss of $0.14 per share.It ended the year with revenues growing 62% to $260 million driven by a 67% increase in subscription revenues.For the current quarter, Okta forecast revenues of $78-$79 million and a net loss of $0.15-$0.16 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $75.2 million and net loss of $0.21 per share. The company expects to end the year with $343-$348 million in revenues and non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.62-$0.67. The forecast was better than the Street's estimated revenues of $343.9 million and a net loss of $0.75 per share.Okta continued to expand its market share through several tie-ups and product upgrades. It recently announced a partnership with SailPoint to provide end-to-end identity for organizations. The partnership will help provide a solution that could offer security requirements that are both simple and secure while ensuring that they meet complex compliance and security requirements. Together, their solutions will allow the ability to manage a user's access throughout the lifecycle, including initial onboarding, secure single sign-on, multi-factor authentication for application access, and automated off-boarding as users change roles or leave an organization. This is not the first partnership that Okta has signed. It has a similar arrangement with Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) as well.Okta needs tie-ups like these to help battle the growing competition from bigger names like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Last year end, Amazon announced the availability of its single sign on (NYSEARCA:SSO) product as well. The AWS SSO is being offered for free to AWS customers. Okta's biggest advantage lies in the fact that it has the capability to integrate with more than 5,000 corporate applications and that it works across multiple cloud vendors.Okta realizes the importance of partnering with other players like SailPoint and Palo Alto Networks to keep the bigger players at bay. It also suggests opportunities for consolidation in the market. I would like to know what Okta has lined up for inorganic growth? What companies, if any, does it have on its radar to help it grow? And what is the narrative or the organizing principle for acquisitions?Okta was venture funded till last year, when it went public at a valuation of $1.54 billion. Prior to the listing, it had raised $228 million from investors including Altimeter Capital, Janus Capital Group, Khosla Ventures, Greylock Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, FLOODGATE, SV Angel, Maynard Webb, Dharmesh Shah, Stephen Marcus, Avid Larizadeh, Ed Roberts, Tom Berson, and Jacques & Sandra Kerrest. Its last round of funding had valued the company at $1.2 billion. Its stock is currently trading at $41.54 with a market capitalization of $4.3 billion. By all standards, a very successful post-IPO stock performance."
4181352,104556,2018-06-13T11:22:00-04:00,"Okta is benefitting from strong network effects and innovation.The business and the financials are definitely trending in the right direction.The company is overvalued in the short run but in the long run, it could do very well.","Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), a leading provider of IDaaS (identity-as-a-service), has been on fire since IPO’ing in April of 2017. Some analysts say the company is absurdly overvalued, but they are underestimating the network effect and innovation.Essentially, Okta simplifies how businesses, and now consumers, protect their online identities. Okta’s main value-add is its Identity Cloud. For example, IT professionals may have hundreds of log-ins for cloud-based applications these days. Even a normal, non-IT employee, will have a ton of log-ins for various applications ranging from email to a collaboration tool to an online forum.This limits productivity and managing a huge organization’s employee identity can be expensive if maintained on a private server.Okta is the solution for identity management in a cloud-based IT environment. It saves businesses money and improves productivity. Okta’s subscriptions start at around $2 per employee per month for the simplest features and then there are a bunch of upsell opportunities.What’s more is that the company is structured to benefit from strong network effects. Currently, Okta boasts 5,500 network integrations available for users. And the more users and developers that join Okta’s community, the more integrations there will be which strengthens the community. So it is a virtuous cycle that Okta benefits from.Moreover, Okta benefits from being platform agnostic. For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers a single-sign on (SSO) product but developers are flocking to Okta’s platform because there is no threat of vendor lock-in. Think about it this way. If you are a CTO and all your developers use AWS (Amazon Web Services) and AWS’s SSO, you will be locked in if a technology better than AWS comes along or if Amazon ever tries to raise its prices because it knows it can. Then it will be such a headache to migrate your active directory and everything over to another platform.In summary, Okta benefits from not being tied to a huge computing platform like AWS or Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure. And Okta is right in the sweet spot. No vendor lock-in but also the scale to facilitate the network effect that allows them to beat out smaller players.But the company is not settling. At its recent conference, Oktane18, it announced “Sign on with Okta,” a way for companies to embed OKTA’s sign-on technology for consumers. For instance, if you wanted to sign onto your eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) account and Craigslist, you could use Okta’s simple interface to navigate both accounts. So this opens up the addressable market considerably as it becomes more consumer-facing and not just enterprise-facing. Imagine if Okta became the standard for how we signed onto applications.The company is also making strides on the security front. Identity and security go hand in hand and so it is a natural progression but on the last conference call, CEO Todd McKinnon said that Okta is “best positioned to responsibly offer password-less access because of the power of our networks.” The concept is called Okta ThreatInsight and it uses the identity of the user and the location and device context to enable password-less access for users. It’s pretty cool stuff.This is all to say that Okta is innovating rapidly and it is resonating with customers. In the last quarter, the number of customers spending over $100,000 grew by 52% year over year to 747. Mr. McKinnon also noted that half of those customers were “new logos,” meaning those enterprises started with over $100,000 of spend. But the older customers are becoming revenue boosters as well. The dollar-based expansion rate has consistently been over 120%, meaning the upsell opportunities have been strong.The financials definitely back-up the business strength. In total, revenue grew 59% in Q1 2019 and subscription revenue a tick higher at 60%. That subscription revenue came with an 81% gross margin, up from the mid-70%'s just a year ago. Okta is one of the faster growing software companies out there but the company is taking big strides towards profitability. On a non-GAAP basis, operating losses slimmed from 38% to just 13% in the past quarter, a 25% year-over-year improvement. Similarly, free cash flow went from -25% in Q1 2018 to -2% this past quarter.The company also expects to be free cash flow positive within the next couple of quarters and notably, this quarter was the first time it broke operating cash flow positive.So the financials are definitely trending in the right direction. The forward guidance for 2019, at the midpoint, is $355 million. As of writing this, at $50/share, the company trades for around a $5 billion enterprise value. This makes for a 14x forward EV/sales ratio, quite frankly a nosebleed valuation. However, a couple of quarters of 40-50% growth would shrink this forward multiple considerably. It’s hard to put a value on Okta’s network effect and the value the company adds to customers. Incredible growth and demand for the product also strengthen the thesis. 14x sales is not cheap. But you have to ask yourself, how big can Okta get?If the company becomes the standard log-in application for businesses and consumers, I have a hard time believing it will be smaller than $5 billion. I don’t like to recommend “buying on a dip” because who knows where the bottom will be and what if the price never gets to your self-proclaimed buy price and goes onto achieve multi-bagger returns? It’s just tough. So I’d rather think big picture and then weigh the odds against other opportunities.Disclaimer: I was an Okta shareholder for a while but I sold when the market cap reached $6 billion. I thought a near 20x forward EV/sales multiple was too much based on risk-reward opportunities elsewhere. It's hard to put a black and white multiple I'd be buyer at since it depends on other opportunities but I'd say a 14-16x sales multiple would be more tolerable. I don’t like to sell based on valuation much but I just didn’t feel comfortable with that.So now all we can do is focus on the future. Okta’s guidance for next quarter, at the high point, calls for 2% sequential growth in what has, thus far, been the seasonally strongest quarter for sequential growth. In 2017, Q2 sequential growth was 18% and in 2018, it was 15%. Plus, the year-over-year estimate is 39% growth, down from 63%. An analyst on the call even asked management point-blank about the conservativeness of this guidance. The CFO kind of evaded the question but the CEO came back with something about the unexpected growth in services and that it is indeed “prudent” guidance.So management seems to be expert sandbaggers. The guidance for this past quarter was just 39% YoY growth and Okta did nearly 60%. The forward guidance for the full year is $355 million which could also prove conservative. If growth rates stayed fairly steady, $400 million 2019 sales isn’t out of the picture. If the company performed this highly, I would be extremely surprised to see the stock trade for anything below $60. Management has pretty high stock ownership also, as the CEO holds about 8% of shares outstanding. So the incentives are certainly aligned.To $60, from today's levels, is 20% upside in the next 8 or so months. Not bad but still requires very solid growth. Okta is certainly not one of those companies with a great margin of safety but if you look down the road a couple of years, think about just how big this company can get.I have chosen to sit on the sidelines for the time being but this company is first on my focused watch list. I think the business is performing superbly, but for now, I am just a little wary of the valuation.All in all, a strong network effect, rapid innovation and solid growth could make for a great investment in the long run. Keep this one in mind."
4180657,103480,2018-06-11T02:48:51-04:00,"Okta suffered a rare pullback last week after posting Q1 results, despite beating analyst expectations on the top and bottom line.This is likely to be the first in a series of gradual pullbacks that will bring Okta's valuation back to normal levels.Okta is currently trading at 14.5x forward revenues, one of the most expensive valuations in the SaaS sector.There's no doubt that Okta is one of the most impressive growth stories among recent IPOs, but with such a rich valuation the company has little upside.","It's incredible to think that just a little over a year ago, Okta (OKTA) went public at just $17 per share - and that today, it's worth three times as much. The single sign-on company wasn't exactly unheard of at the time of its IPO, but it was still an unknown quantity - and at times early on in its life as a public company, the company stumbled due to competitive fears from Amazon AWS (AMZN). Now, however, Okta is the beneficiary of one of the most robust IPO rallies of the past two years and a testament to how important asset selection is when building a growth portfolio. Okta had the right combination of strong financials and hypergrowth, a fantastic customer story and a niche specialty that few could replicate. But the question for investors now is - does Okta have any upside left?I owned Okta early on after its IPO and have since let go of the shares. While I missed out on most of 2018's extraordinary gains, I stand firm in my view that a correction is incoming for this company's shares. Okta's post-Q1 slide, in my opinion, is a strong signal that shares are long overdue for a pullback. Despite beats to the top and bottom line, investors sold off Okta on the Q1 news.Okta's stock price graph, as shown above, is almost a near vertical line, and its pace of growth can't keep up forever. Along the way, investors kept inflating Okta's valuation to the point where it now trades at 14.5x forward revenues. That's a breathtaking revenue multiple for a SaaS company - no matter how strong the financial profile. While Okta's 60% growth is a marvel, it has just hit the point of cash flow breakeven and it is still far from turning a GAAP profit. Its current hypergrowth mode may warrant it a double-digit revenue multiple, but at some point, Okta's growth must necessarily decelerate as it becomes a victim to its own scale. With the stock currently priced for perfection, any hint of deceleration may send investors in for a shock - especially as Okta has gone several quarters hovering around ~60% growth with barely a scratch.Okta's current >$5 billion market cap now puts it in the upper echelon of public SaaS companies, and among valuations, it's king of the hill. Here's how Okta's valuation multiple compares to the other perennial favorites of the software sector like Adobe (ADBE) and Workday (WDAY), who have sustained low double-digit multiples for years. Okta's valuation is only second to Atlassian (TEAM), the enterprise collaboration company that is growing in the ~40% range but is producing giant free cash flow margins:In my view, with Okta's valuation as stretched as it is, the company is a hold at best. Investors are scrambling to lock in their gains now, and there will probably be a better entry point down the road in the mid-$40s. One other note on this point - Okta has benefited to date from the fact that most of its competitors, like OneLogin and Auth0, are still small startups. But should Okta receive a competitor in the form of a large company like Microsoft (MSFT) or Oracle (ORCL), which have accelerated their startup-buying in recent years to push into the niche categories of software, the stock could be in for a rude awakening.The potential catalysts to the downside - from deceleration to unwanted competition - are far more numerous than those to the upside. At Okta's currently bloated valuation, its risk-reward profile is entirely unappealing. My price target is $41, representing 11x EV/FY19 revenues.That being said, it's difficult to ignore the fact that Okta is still growing at a monstrous rate and is an incredibly consistent performer in quarterly earnings. Despite the Q1 pullback, Okta actually produced stellar results. Here's a look at Okta's first quarter earnings:Figure 1. Okta Q1 earnings resultsSource: Okta investor relationsOkta grew total revenues by 60% y/y to $83.6 million. surpassing analyst expectations of $78.9 million (+51% y/y) by a stunning nine points. Wall Street had baked in a likely deceleration into their models, but Okta continues to defy the traditional decelerating trend. In fact, last quarter, Okta had only produced 59% y/y growth - the fact that Okta managed to accelerate its growth rate, even by just one point, is truly impressive.Okta's guidance range of $353-$357 million for FY19 implies a midpoint growth range of just 37% y/y over last year's FY18 revenues of $260.0 million. Given the strength that Okta pulled off in the first quarter, it has a huge opportunity to surpass this guidance range. On the flipside, however, if its guidance range does come true, it implies strong deceleration in the back half of the year - which could send investors running for the hills. At any rate, there are few companies at the ~$300 million revenue run rate that are growing at 60%. Some examples of similarly sized peers within the SaaS sector include Mimecast (MIME), which is growing at ~40%; 2U (TWOU), which is growing at ~30%, and tax compliance software company Avalara (AVLR), which just filed for its IPO and is growing at ~25%. Okta's growth rate despite its enlarged scale is a testament to its current dominance in the single sign-on space and its popularity among large enterprise clients. The company ended the quarter with 4,700 customers, and its count of large clients with >$100k in ARR grew 52% y/y to 747.Okta also showed considerable strength on the profit side. Gross margins expanded on both the subscription and professional services side, which CFO Bill Losch attributed to ""higher-than-expected utilization from our professional services team year-over-year."" Overall gross margins improved by a stellar 520bps y/y to 74.1% in the first quarter.Okta also showed an incredible trimming of its operating loss margins. Operating losses this quarter of -$25.0 million were smaller year-over-year, despite the massively enlarged revenue base, and represented a GAAP operating margin of just -29.9%. In the first quarter of last year, operating loss margin had been -52.5%.As a result, Okta's pro forma EPS of -$0.09 represented a robust beat over analyst expectations of -$0.16. The company also turned operating cash flow positive for the quarter, generated $4.0 million in OCF (4.8% margin) versus a loss of -$9.7 million in the year-ago quarter.It's tempting to buy Okta when the stock has dipped 10% from its recent highs in just one week, especially on the back of another incredibly strong quarter from the company.However, the stock still has plenty further to fall. Okta is still one of the strongest companies to go public in the last two years, as evidenced by its massive growth rate and huge margin improvements. But the stock has risen too far, too fast this year, and a corrective pullback is a healthy move to set the stock back on track for a longer-term rally. Value-conscious investors would be wise to wait for a more appropriate revenue multiple to buy into Okta."

Despite turbulence in the broader markets, Okta has seen only one direction: up.A lot of this rise is justified. I've been a long investor in Okta for most of the time since the company went public, and the outlook for Okta's product and market is incredible. Businesses are now using such a wide smorgasbord of applications that managing passwords and sign-ons, without an interface like Okta, has become a nightmare. And without much competition in the SSO space, Okta has been left to grow unchecked - case in point, the ~60% growth rate Okta saw this quarter basically defying gravity for a company at its ~$300 million run rate.Additionally, note that Gartner named Okta a leader in its first-ever Magic Quadrant for Access Management (other leaders include Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)), not only validating its space but essentially putting it at the top of the pack. And while I do kick myself for having sold Okta too early, I don't regret making a sell decision grounded on overvaluation. It's pretty safe to say that's the territory Okta finds itself in now.After the company's earnings rally, at a share price of $39.25, the company has a market cap of $4.04 billion; netting out its $229.7 million of balance sheet cash and no debt, Okta has an enterprise value of $3.81 billion. Against the company's revenue guidance of $343-$348 million for FY19, this represents an EV/FY19 revenue multiple of 11.0x. Okta has reached the absolute highest rung of software valuations in the double-digits, on par with the perennial high-value stocks like Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE).Yet these latter two companies are much more mature and generate plenty of free cash flow, which is something Okta is just now beginning to do. Yes, it's growing at a much faster clip and deserves a premium revenue multiple - but with the stock sitting at 11x, it's hard to envision how much higher Okta can go. With deceleration baked into Okta's guidance for FY19 (49-50% growth for Q1 guidance against just 33-35% growth for the full year), as well as whiffs of possible competition from AWS, Okta's opportunities to soar substantially further are quite limited.While the long term thesis for Okta and its business potential are still very much intact, now is a good point to take profits on the trade. With such a nosebleed valuation, Okta is much more likely to disappoint than to succeed in 2018.That being said, however, there is good reason for long investors to cheer after Okta posted its Q4 results. See the summary below:Figure 1. Okta Q4 resultsSource: Okta investor relationsRevenues in the quarter climbed 59% y/y to $77.8 million, eclipsing analyst estimates calling for $43.9 million (+51% y/y) by a healthy eight-point margin. Note also that this quarter's revenue growth represents barely any deceleration from the 61% growth Okta saw in Q3. With the company putting up these ~60% growth figures quarter after quarter since going public, it has established itself as one of the true ""super-growers"" in the software industry and a model for startups in Silicon Valley.Equally as important - Okta also saw huge billings growth. Given that a subscription company signs multi-year deals that drive revenues far beyond the current quarter, a look at billings (revenue in the quarter plus change in sequential deferred revenues) is probably the better indicator of Okta's longer-term growth pipeline. As shown in the chart below, Okta saw its billings grow 67% y/y in the quarter to $104.8 million, setting the company up nicely for revenue beats in FY19:Figure 2. Okta billingsSource: Okta investor relationsNote also that Okta's already-high gross margin climbed a further three points in the quarter to 71%, up from 68% in the prior year's Q4. With a high margin such as this, Okta's huge growth feeds the bottom line quite well.As such, Okta also saw a huge improvement in its operating loss margins - driven not only by the advances in gross margin, but in efficiencies made in sales and marketing as well. GAAP operating loss in the quarter was -$25.3 million, translating to a -32% GAAP operating margin - versus -37% in the prior year's Q4.On a pro forma earnings basis, which adds back stock comp and other non cash items to GAAP earnings figures and is the primary way analysts stack up Okta's performance against expectations, the company delivered pro forma EPS of -$0.10 against expectations of -$0.15, a fairly significant beat.Perhaps even more important for investors to notice, however, is the fact that Okta broke even in its operating cash flows for the first time, hitting a tiny OCF of $0.2 million (but still better than the OCF loss of -$6.7 million in 4Q17). Given the robust trends seen this quarter, it's possible to see Okta enter breakeven cash flows in the current fiscal year.Despite all the buzz surrounding Okta's earnings, I'd argue that the stock's rally since its soft earnings release (as well as the 50% rise year to date) squarely put Okta in a position where it's fairly valued. Buying a growth stock at 11x forward revenues is a purely speculative play - there's no other way to put it. There are, of course, positive catalysts for Okta going forward. Chief among them is the company's ability to turn a positive cash flow - if the company performs ahead of schedule on this front, investors could trigger a fresh wave of buying. However, the risks to the downside in my view are more plentiful. To date, Okta's growth has remained very stable in the untouchable ~60% range, starting into the first quarter of next year, Okta's guidance shows the beginnings of a growth decline. Decay in growth rates is normal in fast-growing companies, and Okta is indeed usually conservative with its guidance, but investors can't ignore the fact that at a nosebleed valuation of 11x revenues, holders of the stock might react negatively to any whiff of deceleration, even if it's expected. And with no other basis for valuation (with cash flows still nascent and net income still deeply negative), Okta's stock could see risk in the near term.Traders are likely to use this jump as an opportunity to take profits. If you're lucky enough to be holding Okta shares, I would do the same."
4227366,100666,2018-12-10T05:47:24-05:00,"The six previous Potential Multibaggers have outperformed the S&P 500, despite the fact that five out of the six were Chinese stocks.Despite the outperformance, only two out of six stocks pull the trick. That is typical for Potential Multibaggers: these growth stocks are quite volatile.In this article we look at the first American Potential Multibagger: Okta.The company has all the features of a Potential Multibagger.The valuation of the stock is high, though, so investors better scale in over time.","In my article about why you should have growth stocks in your portfolio, I wrote about how my growth stock strategy works. The principles are more qualitative than quantitative. That article was somewhat a theoretical cornerstone for my series of Potential Multibaggers. In these articles, I pick stocks that I believe have the potential to become multibaggers over the course of years. These are no short-term plays, but stocks to hold in your portfolio for decades.First, let's check the results of the previous stocks from this series so far. The first pick in my series of Potential Multibaggers, made on May 2 of 2017, was Shopify (SHOP). The stock is up 77%, beating the S&P 500 (SPY) by 66.6%.SHOP data by YChartsThe second stock in our multibagger portfolio was Baozun. As you can see, Baozun (BZUN) is up 90%, despite the big volatility along the way, beating the S&P by 80%.BZUN data by YChartsBaozun is off 50.24% from its 52-week high, trading at $33.54 at the moment of writing, with a 52-week high of $67.41. This already indicates the volatility of these Potential Multibaggers, which I come back to. But let me tell you already that you should be prepared for very extreme swings.The third pick, Momo (MOMO), is probably even the best example for this pinball machine behavior. It has been all over the place since the article came out.MOMO data by YChartsIt dropped almost 15% on December 6th, after announcing great results Q3 2018 and a somewhat lower guidance. The company announced a revenue growth of 50% but it is only trading at a forward P/E of 8.7. I will come back to Momo for more analysis in a next article. Still, it is a big underperformer versus the S&P 500, after a short period of surpassing the index's return, before the worries of a trade war brought down the stock again. It underperforms the index by 48.7%.The fourth stock I picked was another Chinese ADR: Ctrip (CTRP) and it is down deep in the hole too:CTRP data by YChartsCtrip has acted poorly over the last few months, just like a lot of other Chinese stocks. As most know, the Chinese market is down quite a lot versus the American market over the last six months. It is already in bear territory.MCHI data by YChartsBut the worst of my Potential Multibaggers' performances is yet to come: JD.com (JD). Its performance since I have recommended it as a Potential Multibagger can be summarized in one word: disastrous.JD data by YChartsA fall of 57.5% and -51% versus the S&P 500, that is hard to stand for a lot of investors. But despite the bad performance of JD's stock, I still believe in the company, as you can read in my latest article about JD.The last pick so far was the most recent. Weibo (WB) Potential Multibagger #6, has performed poorly too:WB data by YChartsThe SPY has come down considerably too in the last few months, but Weibo doubles that fall with an underperformance of 10%.Even though this looks bad, the overall picture is actually a lot better. If you would have invested in all six Potential Multibaggers, your portfolio would be up 7% versus 5.23% for the S&P 500 over the same periods. That is an outperformance of 1.67%. I don't think that is bad, considering that five of the six Potential Multibaggers are Chinese stocks. But it can go fast. I started this article on Thursday and then the Potential Multibaggers still outperformed by 25% versus the S&P500. With most S&P 500 trackers you will also get a dividend, which would maybe give the tracker a small advantage over the Potential Multibaggers. It doesn't matter all too much.The reason I show this is not because I want to brag, but to show you how my growth stock philosophy works. Even this small selection of stocks points to what I have written in the article about why you should have growth stocks in your portfolio: it doesn't matter if you have big losers (like Ctrip, Weibo, Momo and especially JD.com here) because the winners are so much bigger than the losers that they make you outperform over the long term anyway. You can only lose 100% (which is very exceptional), but you can win 100s or 1,000s of percentages.There may be short periods in which the S&P500 will lead. Those periods will be in down markets, mostly. But I am pretty sure that over the longer term the Potential Multibaggers will outperform.Just to assure my readers, I don't think that the outlook for any of the stocks has changed for the long-term, and there is no reason to sell any of the stocks as of now. I still have them in my portfolio as well. I have averaged up in Baozun and Shopify when big drops occurred along the way, and averaged down in Momo and JD.com several times.I have not added to Ctrip, because its growth has stalled somewhat and I in my article I pointed at three problems, but I may look at it again in the near future because of the substantial drop that could make it interesting again. I would still recommend all five others for new investors who have a long-term investing horizon of more than a decade.The reason why I write this long introduction before I present my seventh Potential Multibagger is that I want to show you that Potential Multibaggers can be very volatile, going up and down rapidly. Baozun and Momo have had drops and jumps of 20%+ on a single day several times. As an investor in these stocks, you should be prepared for these kinds of extreme movements.JD is down by 57.5%. But I don't see anything in the company itself which justifies this huge drop. It is a matter of momentum and sentiment. I don't mind and I think it is a good time to start a position here. I have averaged down and will continue to do so. JD is simply taking too many steps in the good direction not to be huge in a decade's time. Over time the market will realize this, but it may take a few years.But the second thing that I want to make clear is that you should never stick to one stock. I'm not all-in on JD. Because, I can only deduct my logic from known facts. There could always be a black swan. So I take a portfolio that is diversified: some mega caps like Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), but also enough small companies that can spice up your portfolio. Buy yourself a basket of potential multibaggers, not just one or two. The big gains in a few (in this case Shopify and especially Baozun) can still make you outperform substantially, even though you have some substantial losers as well (Momo, Weibo, JD and Ctrip).This seventh installment is (finally!) about the first American stock in the Potential Multibaggers series: Okta.(Source)Okta made its IPO on the Nasdaq on April 7, 2017. This is what the stock has done since:OKTA data by YChartsAs you can see, the stock has done very well in general (up 165.3%), but it has seen quite some volatility too. It was up more than 10% on December 6th because of the excellent Q3 2018 results it had announced. The very next day, December 7th, it was down almost 7% again. So that behavior already suits a Potential Multibagger, but of course that is not enough.In my series of Potential Multibaggers, I choose stocks that have a smaller market cap. I have to be able to see a tenbagger in the future. Okta's market cap is about $7B at the moment of writing and yes, I could see the possibility that the company would have a valuation around $70B somewhere in the distant future.Okta is in a sweet spot of the growing internet and connected nets business: identity safety. It provides its services to companies, but also to non-profits and government services.The company's main product is Okta Identity Cloud, a platform that offers a suite of products to manage and secure identities. Okta provides safe single entry systems. It also allows its customers to manage a user's identity over time. Okta also provides customer support and training for its products.There is of course much more to know about all the operations of this great company, but that would lead us too far in this article. I have written multiple articles about my other Potential Multibaggers as follow-up articles and I intend to do that for Okta too. In those articles I will dive deeper into the business. You could see this article as some sort of networking: receiving a business card and having a first glance at someone to see how you get along, but not really doing business yet.For my Potential Multibaggers, I have a fixed set of qualities that I look for. Let's look if Okta has got the qualities of a Potential Multibagger.Now this may seem petty, but companies that have ideas that they can articulate well and make investors enthusiastic about will probably have the same conviction in trying to win their customers. It is always great if you can summarize what the company does in one sentence that everybody understands. For Okta, this is simple, because I don't have to make it up. The company has done that for me:(Source: Okta website)Now, that is a convincing and concise tagline if I ever saw one. It captures the strength of the company in one simple sentence that everybody understands.One of the most valuable aspects of growth stocks is having a visionary leader, someone with exceptional qualities who knows where he or she has to steer his or her company to surf the wave to the future. I especially, but not exclusively, like founder CEOs, since they have had the drive and the capacities to start something and to make their baby big.Okta's CEO is a part of that select group of CEOs: Todd McKinnon has founded Okta (as Saasure) in 2009. He was senior VP at Salesforce (CRM). Okta's COO Freddy Kerrest was co-founder and also came from Salesforce with McKinnon.( Todd McKinnon, source)Todd McKinnon is a special case. The man is probably fitter than any CEO around, even though it has become more and more a status symbol to be very athletic among executives. But McKinnon became the 14th fittest man on earth last year in the 45-to-49 age group. He earned that in the annual CrossFit Games, an event of in total four days. Elite athletes from around the world participate in this prestigious event, which reserves $300,000 for the winner. Participants have to run, bike, swim, lift weights, do individual tug of war, push-ups and many more challenging and hard sports. This is Todd McKinnon in action:(Source)The man is a beast and I like CEOs that go the extra mile, proverbially. I don't think quitting is in McKinnon's dictionary even if the road is tough.This might sound strange to some, but I also like to look a CEO into the eye before I buy a stock. Before you think that I have a whole network of top executives as my closest friends (I wished!): on a screen is good enough for me. If I see how CEOs communicate to the press, I often get a better idea of how they are as a leader of the company I invest in.For Todd McKinnon, you can find several interviews on the web. I think this short interview with Jim Cramer is a good one to start, because McKinnon explains why Okta has a competitive advantage over Microsoft (MSFT). McKinnon comes across as competent, energetic and as someone who knows the ins and outs of his business and industry.A growth stock must be innovating. If the company doesn't innovate, it won't have growth. The Austrian-American economist Joseph Schumpeter, one of the most influential economists ever, coined the term ""creative destruction"" in 1942. In ""Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy,"" he defined it as the:In a 2013 Goldman Sachs survey, the strong correlation between R&D and sales growth and stock price performance was shown:(Source: Businessinsider.com)We take a quote here from Okta's Q3 2019 8K-filing. (Yes, 2019, not a mistake)That is the evolution I want to see: 52% growth YoY, but keeping the percentage of the revenue more or less stable. That means two opposite things: that Okta thinks R&D is indeed important and not a post where cuts should be made, to the contrary, but also that the cost of R&D is kept under control as a percentage of the revenue. I like both of the implications.Whether I pick dividend stocks or growth stocks, I don't change my strategy: I buy stocks for the long road. Mostly I'm a buy-and-hold investor. In my bio here on SA, there is the sentence that I think qualifies me very well: I don't think in years but rather in decades.As a consequence, I pick stocks of companies that have a vision for the future and that I believe will thrive over the next decade (in as far as that is foreseeable, of course).Okta is certainly such a stock. It invests in all the technology that will matter in the cloud market. It is ahead of its competitors, taking a multi-platform approach that gives clients the opportunity to connect several systems to each other through the identity management system of Okta. Identity management is not going to become even more important in the next few decades, in my opinion.Okta has a long-term vision, even though it has to watch every single evolution in its market, from minute to minute. And the company is not afraid to express that long-term vision. Here is a quote from the Okta website, from Mike Paiko, Okta's Director of Product Marketing:Isn't that a great quote? I leave out a few words so you don't miss it: 'Okta's long-term vision is to build a single source of truth.' It is almost poetry, but it also shows that the company is ambitious and wants to become a long-term industry standard.I also like this quote from the same text:I want double digit growth over the next year, because otherwise it is impossible to evolve from a Potential Multibagger to a multibagger. Because Okta is only on the stock market since last year and the company is still in its infant years, growing its revenue at 50% and more, it is difficult to look far into the future. This is the expectation that simplywall.st gives:As you can see on the graph, Okta's revenue is expected to grow exponentially over the next few years - from $325M now to $660M in 2021. This would mean more than 32% growth per year, but Okta mostly outperforms, so this may actually be much higher. Okta was free cash flow positive for the first time in the last quarter.Okta gives a forecast of $510M to $520M of revenue for next year, which would indeed be somewhere around 32% growth.This is the last point on the checklist for potential multibaggers. Stocks that want to be picked as a potential multibagger should have as much as possible of what I call the three Os: overachieving, owning, and overdelivering.OverachievingOkta's tagline itself is already a proof of overachieving: 'Okta connects any person with any application on any device.' This shows that is has a goal, something to strive for. I have already mentioned that the company also wants to build 'a single source of truth'. That is overachieving.OwningI like executives that have skin in the game. If the stock does well, they will do well financially too. Their interests and that of the stockholder are aligned. This is the ownership status of Okta, taken from simplywall.st again:The management owns 11% of the outstanding shares, so yes, there is substantial ownership by the executives.OverdeliveringIf you look at the growth in the stock price of Okta, I surely would say that this is over-delivering already. Here is again the graph of Okta since its IPO in April 2017, compared to the S&P 500:OKTA data by YChartsI have stated several times, though, that the stock price doesn't tell anything on its own. It is just a barometer of the stock market's sentiment, but doesn't always tell you that much about the company behind the stock. You can read more about this in my previous article, 7 Suggestions For When Your Stocks Fall.Another domain on which Otka is a serial over-deliverer is earnings. It has only reported 6 quarters since its IPO but was able to beat the expectations every single time. And not by a small margin. These are the beats for the last 4 quarters:(Source: SeekingAlpha)You see the same for revenue growth:(Source: SeekingAlpha)And just a quote from the Q3 earnings call, to give you a more detailed view into the over deliverance. I think the numbers are impressive.I am most impressed with the retention rate of 120%. There is no split-up, but it could mean that all customers stayed and added 20% to their products dollars or there was some churn, but existing customers even paid more than 20% extra. No matter how you look at it, this is an impressive achievement.Okta is certainly the most highly valued Potential Multibagger so far. The company is still earnings negative and that is not going away anytime soon. Okta looks expensive, no matter how you look at it. The strong stock performance has not made that any better, of course.The stock trades at a P/S of 20 ttm. But Bill Losch, Okta's CFO, gave a forecast of $510M to $520M for next year. That means that the P/S would come down to 14 already. Not that 14 times sales is low, of course, but if the company keeps growing, over time the valuation matters less. Okta is a leader in its market and that market is growing, so it is no coincidence that the stock is highly valued. The long term story for OKTA is excellent.What I do in such cases is starting with a small position and building it out over time. That gives you the opportunity to limit the risk. If the company keeps delivering, the price will keep rising and you have your cheap shares to lower your average price. If the markets fall, you can average down. In any case, if you invest in stocks like Okta, you really should have a long-term vision.I think Okta might be Potential Multibagger over the next years. I have had it in my portfolio since March of this year. My initial cost base was $38.93, but I have averaged up to $46.77 over time. My position is still relatively small and I want to build it out over the next years, patiently and critically.I want to stress for a last time that with these high-growth companies, you should always be prepared for volatility, as Momo's, JD's and Baozun's stock prices have already demonstrated multiple times now. The same could happen to Okta.But as long as you keep your eyes on the road, mostly they are greatly rewarding and as a group I expect them to outperform the S&P index, potentially by a wide margin. As long as you hold them for the long term, they might become life-altering stocks in your portfolio. But keep in mind that it is always better to have several of these potential multibaggers in your portfolio to spread the risk.This was the seventh installment of Potential Multibaggers. More will probably follow.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4186751,20521,2018-07-11T20:16:29-04:00,Okta is a stellar illustration of the growing opportunities available to SaaS companies.But the company continues to report losses as it invests in market expansion and product innovation.Okta could easily correct that by continuing to deliver rapid growth.,"A Grand View Research report published earlier this year estimates the global identity access management market to grow 14% annually over the next few years, reaching $24.6 billion by 2022, driven by the increasing demand for regulatory compliance and the continuing growth of web applications, Bring Your Own Devices (BYOD), and Internet of Things (IoT) markets. Billion-Dollar Unicorn Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) already is benefiting from this growth trend.Okta recently reported record first quarter results. For the quarter, revenues increased 60% to $83.6 million. It ended the quarter with a non GAAP net loss of $0.09 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $78.8 million and a net loss of $0.16 per share for the quarter.By segment, subscription services revenues increased 59% over the year to $76.8 million. Professional services and the others segment contributed the remaining $6.8 billion in revenues compared with $4 million recorded a year ago.Among operating metrics, Okta now has more than 4,700 customers, up 40%. During the quarter, it added 350 new logos and 56 new customers in the $100,000-plus category.For the current quarter, Okta forecast revenues of $84-$85 million with a net loss of $0.21-$0.20 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $84.8 million and net loss of $0.19 per share. The company expects to end the year with $353-$357 million in revenues and non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.58-$0.54. The Street had estimated revenues of $356.5 million and a net loss of $0.56 per share.Okta may not be profitable yet, but it has managed to build a product that has received tremendous market appreciation. For the second consecutive year, Okta's platform was ranked as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Access Management.To keep this pace, Okta continued to announce more product innovations. Last quarter, it released ThreatInsight, a solution that will leverage a new set of contextual access management features that will allow organizations to replace the use of passwords with stronger authentication for employees, partners and customers. It offered enhanced security for developers with the launch of Sign In with Okta, which is an alternative to Security Assertion Markup Language (OTCPK:SAML) and will simplify single sign-on for IT admins. Okta continued to expand through tie-ups and recently announced partnerships with VMware, Workplace by Facebook, and the Onramp initiative. The tie-ups will allow IT admins to manage access to data in apps and services with one click from the Okta Integration Network.Okta is a stellar illustration of the growing opportunities available to SaaS companies. By being agnostic about the OS and platforms it supports, Okta has managed to get a ""leg up on tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)."" But the company continues to report losses as it invests in market expansion and product innovation. For a company in hyper growth, losses are understandable. Recently though, Jim Cramer commented that at 16 times its sales, Okta was a fairly expensive stock for the identity management services it offers. Okta could easily correct that perception by continuing to deliver rapid growth. I would like to know how does Okta plan to continue its current hyper growth trajectory? Is it looking at acquisitions of other players and other capabilities to drive this growth? What additional capabilities is it looking to add as part of this growth map?Okta went public last year at a valuation of $1.54 billion. Prior to the listing, it had raised $228 million from investors including Altimeter Capital, Janus Capital Group, Khosla Ventures, Greylock Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, FLOODGATE, SV Angel, Maynard Webb, Dharmesh Shah, Stephen Marcus, Avid Larizadeh, Ed Roberts, Tom Berson, and Jacques & Sandra Kerrest. Its stock is currently trading at $51.86 with a market capitalization of $5.5 billion. It had reached a 52-week high of $61 in May this year. It has been climbing from the 52-week low of $21.52 that it was trading at nearly a year ago."
4130596,103480,2017-12-08T04:11:39-05:00,"Okta reported yet another massive beat in Q3, with revenue growth of 61% y/y essentially defying gravity.At Okta's revenue scale (nearly $300 million run-rate), the fact that revenue growth barely decelerated over Q2 and held above 60% is truly impressive.Okta is also launching a one-year free service called Okta for Startups for companies under 25 employees, with the hope to converting them to paid customers as they grow.Despite fundamental wins, Okta is an expensive stock trading at 8x forward revenues. Perhaps as evidence that the stock is reaching its upper valuation bound, the stock had a mild reaction to earnings.","By now, we've learned to expect nothing less than greatness out of Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), the identity management software company that went public earlier this year and is known for its flagship Single-Sign On (SSO) product. Yet again, the company has proven itself to be an absolute beast in growth, growing revenues above 60% in Q3 and smashing through analyst expectations. CEO Todd McKinnon has positioned the company as a share-grabber in the legacy market for login and access products currently dominated by the likes of IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).Yet, despite another fantastic earnings quarter, Okta has barely moved an inch from where the stock traded last quarter. As I wrote in a prior article, Okta's incredible year-to-date rally has left the stock ready for profit-taking - and given the sideways trading in the name as of late, it seems that some investors are, indeed, taking profits bit by bit. Here's a look at the price movements since the last quarter release:OKTA data by YChartsI remain a steadfast bull on Okta, as the company has fantastic technology that is truly well-positioned to grab share from legacy providers. Its new overtures to the SMB space, driven by its launch of Okta for Startups, also position the company to win greenfield business as well. My concern, which has only firmed over the past few months, is only on valuation.The market seems to have tilted toward cashflowing tech names; within the recent IPO realm, the strongest performers have been names like Alteryx (NYSE:AYX), which is posting nice cash flow margins despite its small scale. Okta does have premium growth, but not the cash flow or margins yet. Thus I'm inclined to believe that Okta's high revenue growth has already been priced into its high multiple, and its stock price is unlikely to appreciate much further without a corresponding improvement in margins - at least in this market environment when tech stocks are high and investors are wanting to rotate into value.Longer term, Okta is a fantastic hold. In the shorter term, I see challenges. The fact that Okta's stock popped ~4% after its earnings release but fizzled down to nearly flat movement over the course of the day is a telling sign that investors are turning cautious on its valuation despite the good performance in the quarter.Okta had a huge showing on the top line in Q3, generating revenues of $68.2 million (+61% y/y) versus analyst expectations for just $62.8 million (+49% y/y). Okta itself had only guided to revenue of $62-63 million in the quarter, internally expecting deceleration that didn't end up happening. Revenues barely decelerated from Q2's 63% y/y growth rate. And note that this 12-point beat is one of the biggest upsides we've seen in the quarter among software stocks, so the muted reaction to Okta's performance is a surprise - perhaps an indicator that this magnitude of a beat was already priced into the richly-valued stock and more or less expected.Figure 1. Okta Q3 revenue resultsSource: Okta earnings press releaseThe company also put out a separate press release post-earnings highlighting its major wins in the quarter, driving its revenue results over the top in Q3. Key wins in the quarter included Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), CBRE (CBG), and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN).As most know, however, growth is costly, and Okta did trade margin for its premium growth.Figure 2. Okta margin trendsSource: Author-created chart; data from public filingsAs shown in the chart above, Okta's operating margins at -52% are flat year over year. Sequentially, however, Okta spent a great deal more on sales and marketing in Q3 than in Q2, driving down its operating margin by seven points after a record-high margin of -45% in Q2.Okta is doing the right thing by investing in growth. It's still attacking a greenfield market and expanding its install base - as a SaaS software company, these long-term customers will pay off in a big way over time. Investors, unfortunately, are more short-sighted and don't give credit to revenues and profits that are three, four years down the line. Even tech investors - who focus more on the top line and less so on earnings - are showing more sensitivity to earnings results recently. Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), for example, got pummeled despite a 12-point beat (the same magnitude of Okta's beat) because it was in line with earnings expectations and showed a small contraction in margins.On a pro forma basis, Okta generated a -$0.19 per share loss, and that's still better than the -$0.24 that analysts were expecting.On a cash flow basis, Okta still lags behind peers like Alteryx that are generating positive cash flows, but at the very least its cash flow margins are improving. The company generated -$9.5 million in OCF loss this quarter (-14% margin) and -$11.2 million in FCF, a -16% margin versus -28% in the prior-year Q3. Okta still has plenty of liquidity on its balance sheet ($223.6 million) from its IPO to fund its losses for the foreseeable future, so it still has ample time to beef up its margins as it heads toward profitability.Concurrently with earnings, Okta also raised its full-year revenue target to $252-253 million, implying $70-71 million in Q4 revenue and 57% y/y growth for the full year. Note that this is a significant bump ($8.5 million at the midpoint) from Okta's prior guidance of $243-245 million.Despite a bit of a disappointment on margins due to sales spending (though with Okta's growth rate, we can forgive this bit), the company delivered a near-perfect quarter. The stock's post-earnings reaction, however, suggests that perfection was already priced in. The stock trades at a healthy 8x forward revenues - a steep multiple for a company at any growth rate.Investors of late have been cautious on the money-burning tech IPOs; this includes companies like Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) and MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB), whose operating margins, like Okta's, also exceed a -50% loss. Cloudera and MongoDB have been plunging consistently, session after session, in the past few months. Okta's only saving grace has been its fantastic growth rate and its high-retention, recurring subscription model.With its valuation approaching 2x Cloudera's, however (Cloudera trades at only 4x forward revenues), even Okta's growth premium does little to justify its valuation. I sold out of Okta shares a few months back, and I'd be careful going forward as the company seems to be reaching its upper valuation limits."

These revenues were up 12% sequentially and 61% YTY compared to up 63% YTY in FQ2.Recall, Okta provides Identity-as-a-Service (IaaS) via a range of six cloud-based services (affordably priced at $1-4 per user monthly) on a single platform to improve communications among enterprises, their customers, partners and suppliers. It is integrated with a wide range of other technologies, applications and services but is fully independent, neutral and secure. Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Cisco (CSCO) and IBM (IBM) are important partners, especially Palo Alto Networks with links that allow its cyber security to be well integrated with Okta.The company’s six product offerings are:FQ3 operating metrics:For their January FQ4, Okta management forecast $70-71 million and ($0.18)-($0.17), better than prior expectations for $68.9 million and ($0.20). For FY 2018 this brings their guidance to $252-253 million and ($0.87)-($0.86), better than expectations for $245 million and ($0.96).Okta shares have performed well since the company’s early April IPO at $17, helped by two strong earnings reports that have both provided 9%-plus revenue upside to expectations. And now this FQ3 report represents another quarter of revenues being nearly 9% above expectations. This was what we were anticipating with our $68-69 million revenue projection.The company is executing so well, the valuation could trade up to 10x revenues that we think will comfortably reach $350 million in FY 2019 that begins in just weeks. That would represent a $37 share price, up 27% from the $29.10 area where Okta shares are trading this morning, already up 2%-plus from yesterday’s closing price.A more optimistic (and perhaps more realistic) view would have revenues reaching $260 million for FY 2016 and then increasing 50% in FY 2019 to $390 million. A 10x multiple would represent a $41 share price, a 40%-plus gain from this morning’s $29.10. A couple more upside reports with 50-60%-plus sales growth driven by accelerating large deal growth and meaningful progress towards breakeven earnings would warrant this in our opinion.With this third strong report and outlook, we are raising our rating from Strong Buy to Focus Strong Buy."
4131403,103480,2017-12-12T14:59:07-05:00,"Last week, Amazon AWS launched a single-sign on (SSO) product that would directly compete against Okta. AWS SSO is being offered for free to AWS customers.While Okta’s leadership in the market ensures that it won’t be completely derailed by Amazon, it would be foolish to brush off competition from AWS as a non-issue.With Okta's sky-high valuation at 7.0x EV/FTM revenues, competitive worries may indicate that the stock is overvalued and due for a pullback.Even if AWS steals just 1-2 deals from Okta, it could cause Okta to miss a quarter, something it's never done before.","Retail isn't the only industry that's victim to the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) bogeyman. Jeff Bezos is out to conquer every industry there is - including the application software sector itself. Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA), the provider of single-sign on software, is next on the target list. Since the announcement from AWS, share of Okta are down more than 10%.OKTA Price data by YChartsThere's precedent for Amazon coming in and causing wreckage in the software sector. A few months prior, AWS announced a service called AWS Pinpoint, which would be a direct competitor to Twilio (NASDAQ: TWLO). Twilio stock plunged 10% in the space of an hour after the announcement. Though the stock soon recovered due to tweets from the CEO that alluded Twilio was involved in a partnership behind the AWS launch, Twilio is still down heavy in the back half of this year - one of the primary bearish concerns being competition from AWS.News about AWS SSO has caused a polarizing response for Okta in the markets. Okta bulls brush it off and say the announcement barely matters; Okta bears say AWS SSO will be the death of Okta. My position is that it's neither of the extremes - yes, Okta might lose a deal here and there, but its long-term superiority in the space will still make it a structural winner. My view for investors, however, is that Okta's market-leading valuation is bound for a correction, and that competitive chatter from AWS will cap Okta's performance in the short term. Ay 7.0x EV/FTM revenues, Okta doesn't really have much room to run unless its execution is absolutely flawless - and this flawless scenario is one marred by competition from AWS.I'd be careful on Okta going into 2018, as I think AWS jitters (no matter how overblown) will cast an overhang on the stock for quite some time. Okta looks poised to trade sideways in 2018, and though traders can make gains from timing the peaks and valleys, it's no longer a steady long-term hold. I think Okta will oscillate around a fair value at 6x EV/FTM revenues, implying a price target of $23.Let's parse into the details of the new AWS offering. On December 7, Amazon introduced AWS SSO in a blog post, a week after its annual AWS re: Invent conference in Las Vegas.IT administrators can use the new AWS SSO offering to give users access to certain applications by placing them in directory groups. Once access is granted, AWS SSO will track access statistics and characteristics, including IP address, time of access, etc. This gives AWS essentially the same feature set as Okta's SSO product. The screenshot below, taken from the launch blog post, shows an example of the user interface:Like Okta, AWS SSO also allows for single-sign on across third-party cloud services as well, such as Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), as long as they are SAML-enabled applications (Security Assertion Markup Language). The screenshot below shows an example of the different services that are compatible with AWS SSO, with the administrator currently granting Dropbox access to a user:SSO portals like Okta's have made tremendous traction in the IT market due to the sheer simplicity it offers. From an administration standpoint, IT admins can use SSO tools to provision access with a single-pane-of-glass view across the entire network. From a user point of view, they only need to know their one, standard corporate credentials to access the entire suite of applications they need for their jobs.And here's the kicker when it comes to AWS SSO: it's free. The below screenshot is taken from AWS SSO's FAQs page:Like every other line of business that Amazon is in, it's prioritizing grabbing market share and squeezing out the competition rather than maximizing revenue.Okta, needless to say, is not free. The below screenshot, taken from Okta's website, shows the pricing for each of its modules:Okta generally does offer volume-based discounts for enterprise clients with 5,000+ users (enterprise pricing is undisclosed), but it can still represent a fairly substantial cost. For a company with 1,000 employees, it could save $24,000 annually by switching to AWS SSO.A note on directory services - AWS doesn't offer its own directory to compete with Universal Directory; rather, it directs its clients to use Microsoft Active Directory, for a small fee.The million-dollar question: does Okta offer enough of a quality premium to justify paying for it? Conclusions on this will differ. For one, Okta is the undisputed, Gartner-designated leader in the SSO space. In its inaugural Magic Quadrant for Access Management, Gartner ranked Okta as the #1 vendor. There's no doubt that Okta's product is ""best-of-breed,"" and AWS, being new to the space, is sure to have some clunky interface issues.Okta's rich extended feature set may also factor in to customers weighing a switch. Okta's Mobility Management suite enables seamless mobile sign-on, and Okta Lifecycle Management helps to deeply automate the access provisioning process with complex rules-based policies (though it comes at a price of $4/user/month). For customers who are used to using Okta and don't want the hassle of learning a new administration tool, and who are relying on Okta's broad feature set (though nothing is stopping AWS from building out its SSO features), they may opt to stick with Okta.It's instructive to note, however, that it wouldn't be very difficult to switch away from Okta. As a top-layer application that manages just the sign-in interface, migration to a different SSO product can likely happen without much business disruption. Software rip-outs involving ERP or data-heavy systems are often extremely painful, but because Okta isn't truly a platform service that supports a bunch of overlaying applications, migrating from Okta is likely a much less painful exercise than for most software.There's also the convenience factor of centering all infrastructure services on AWS. With AWS' dominant market share in IaaS, customers might find it simply easier to centralize their basic backend services under the AWS umbrella. Single Sign On, after all, is a conceptually simple service and doesn't require technical complexity from a best-in-breed vendor. With the simplicity and convenience of migrating to AWS, Okta may lose some customers who might not care about its broader, higher-quality feature set.It's way too early to tell exactly how AWS SSO will impact Okta, given that it's only been out in the market for a week - but it will undoubtedly have some impact.Identity management is a large space, and there's room for a lot of players. In its S-1, Okta estimated its domestic opportunity at $9 billion. Okta, which grew 61% in its most recent quarter, will still experience hypergrowth for quite some time as it captures more of this $9 billion in spend.But it would be foolish to assume that it won't cede any market share to AWS. While Okta will retain the customers who are too lazy to move or unwilling to give up the features they're used to, it will certainly lose the most cost-conscious of its customers, as well as the customers that want to minimize their count of software vendors and centralize under one roof.My view is that, in light of Okta's rich 7.0x EV/FTM revenues valuation, investors should trim their positions in Okta in anticipation of softer performance induced by AWS. Such high multiples are reserved for software companies with a distinct product moat and unencumbered growth trajectory - and with AWS now offering a free SSO product, these are qualities that Okta can no longer safely claim."
4105447,103480,2017-09-08T16:08:05-04:00,"Okta posted a stellar Q2, growing revenues by 63% y/y and smashing analyst estimates in its second earnings release as a public company.The company also delivered 10% of operating margin improvement over the prior year Q2.Shares responded by rallying 4% in after hours, putting Okta at a breathless valuation of 8.3x EV/FTM revenues.Given the stock's ~30% rise this month alone, the shares are due for some profit taking.","You have to hand it to Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA): it's a growth monster that never fails to disappoint. In my prior bullish article on the company, I had written that the stock had been unfairly punished and would likely snap back to $25 on the back of strong earnings. My price target was perhaps too modest - after Okta's Q2 print, after-hours trading sent the stock to $28.Okta has been on a tear this month, rising nearly 30% after falling harshly in a broad tech selloff at the beginning of August. Okta's Q2 results, which we'll dive into in this article, are likely to add some short-term fuel to the rally, but >8x signals dangerous territory for software stocks. At these levels, expectations are high and execution must be perfect for the valuation simply to hold - and for it to rise, something absolutely terrific must happen. In my opinion, there are few positive catalysts left on the horizon. Now one of the most expensive stocks in software, I believe the stock is long overdue for some profit taking. This month's rapid rally has overcompensated Okta for Q2's good results and enthusiasm will likely fade soon. Okta is still a growth engine and a fantastic company addressing a greenfield use case, but the recent rally has probably reached a plateau. I would pull back for now and wait for shares to decompress before re-entering a long position.Okta posted phenomenal growth in Q2. Revenue grew 63% to $61.0 million, beating analyst consensus of $55.9 million (+49%) by 14 points and its own guidance of $55-$56 million. A 14 percent beat over consensus is probably one of the best performances the software sector has seen this quarter, and represents barely any deceleration over Okta's prior quarter growth of 67%. See below Okta's updated quarterly growth glidepath:Figure 1. OKTA growth by quarterBillings of $71.7 million still outpaced revenue by dollars, but we also note that billings growth of 54% lagged behind revenue growth of 63% this quarter, where the prior quarter saw the reverse. Does this mean Okta's next four quarters will be slower? Not necessarily, as billings can be seasonal and influenced by the timing of deal closures, and Okta does not specifically highlight billings as a metric or guide to it. But certainly the slight billings drag places the company at greater risk of missing its next quarter, even if it does not explicitly guarantee it. Operating leverage was the other major highlight coming out of Q2, with the company delivering 10 points of margin improvement over 2Q17. See Okta's margin history by quarter below:Figure 2. OKTA margins by quarterEach of Okta's three components of operating spend: R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A saw meaningful sequential improvement over 1Q18. This is especially important as the company is still a loss leader and burning plenty of cash (roughly $21 million in cash burn year-to-date). The company's COO, Frederic Kerrest, however, has noted that the company is not locked into a growth-at-all-costs mindset and is committed to delivering margin improvement, which we saw proof of in Q2.Unsurprisingly, Okta also raised its guidance in true beat-and-raise fashion. Full-year guidance went up to $243-$245 million, up $10 million (~4%) from prior quarter's guidance of $233-$236 million. I'll highlight two (unrelated) points on this:Overall, I think guidance could go up another $5-$6 million in Q3, the final time it will issue guidance for FY18.Okta also introduced Q3 revenue guidance of $62-$63 million, implying 48% y/y growth over 3Q17. Again, this guidance is probably overly conservative, as 48% growth would be a significant deceleration over this quarter's 63%. Recall that Okta's deceleration in this quarter was a mere 4%.So does Okta have more room for performance upside? Absolutely. Its targets are set extremely conservatively, it has little competition outside of Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Active Directory, a relative latecomer in the space, and it's spending aggressively on its sales headcount to push deals into the pipeline.But does the stock have room for upside? With shares trading this richly, I think the risk-reward profile does not favor a long position. Relative to its peers in the software IPO class of 2017, Okta is still fairly expensive:Figure 3. Okta trading compsIts 8.3x valuation clues into the fact that the stock is overdue for a pullback. Alteryx (NASDAQ: AYX) is a particularly instructive comp in this regard. After a strong Q2 performance in early August, shares rallied to a ~9x valuation before pulling back recently to 8x, shown above.Okta, more likely than not, will follow a similar pattern, and its run-up has already happened in the weeks leading up to earnings. I'm still bullish on the stock long term for the sheer growth numbers it puts up and its technological advantage in an extremely sticky subscription business, but would prefer to sit on the sidelines until the stock's ebb and flow settles down."

For the full year, Okta forecast revenues of $233-$236 million and a net loss of $1.11-$1.15, compared with the market estimate of revenues of $227 million and a net loss of $1.18 per share.Okta’s Expansion PlansDuring the quarter, Okta was awarded the FedRAMP certification. It is a gold standard in security certification and it will allow Okta to enter into contracts with government agencies for its Identity Cloud offerings. To achieve the certification, Okta had demonstrated compliance with more than 300 controls, including vulnerability management, incident response capability and business continuity. The certification has already helped Okta win a contract with the Department of Justice.Besides expansion into the government sector, Okta is also looking at international expansion. As part of the move, it recently expanded its physical presence in Canada with a new office in downtown Toronto. The expansion will help Okta address the Canadian market more closely.Okta is not alone in the identity management market. It is facing increasing threat from bigger rivals like Microsoft. Analysts believe that Microsoft is currently the biggest player in the Identity Access as a Service market and has been able to maintain its lead by bundling its access offering with the Azure Active Directory Premium solution. Microsoft has also been beating Okta on the pricing. Okta’s average price is about $14 a month per user, compared with Microsoft’s plans of $6-$9 a month per user.Till recently, Okta was venture funded. It had raised $228 million from investors including Altimeter Capital, Janus Capital Group, Khosla Ventures, Greylock Partners, Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital, FLOODGATE, SV Angel, Maynard Webb, Dharmesh Shah, Stephen Marcus, Avid Larizadeh, Ed Roberts, Tom Berson, and Jacques & Sandra Kerrest. Its last round of funding was held in September 2015, when it raised $75 million at a valuation of $1.2 billion. In April this year, the company went public after offering its shares at $17 apiece, pegging its valuation at $1.54 billion. The stock had touched a high of $28.25 earlier last month and is currently trading at $23.66 with a market capitalization of $2.25 billion."
4061538,101924,2017-04-10T15:06:02-04:00,"While still in the red, its revenue growth far outstrips its loss growth.It is the leader in a fast-emerging component of cloud software, but far from the only player.The kind of platform it is favors a smaller, independent firm, rather than a tech giant.","When you are a David in a sea of Goliaths, it helps to be nimble and independent. This independence is founder Todd McKinnon's value proposition for his cloud-based identity management software company, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA).Its public listing on Friday morning netted McKinnon and his co-founder, Freddy Kerrest, tidy nine-figure payouts. Shares of the company closed at around $23.50, 40% higher than expected, giving the Okta a market cap of $2.1 billion.Okta is a fast-growing ""identity cloud"" or a platform helping users make sense of the myriad of apps and technologies they need for their business to function. It does this by integrating and securing them into one entity, like popular reviews, secure and simple. Its platform has integrated 5,000 apps and continues to grow.In an interview with CNBC, McKinnon said, ""the platform securely connects all the people that a company interacts with - customers, partners, suppliers, employees - to the technology they need to work, be it email or a customer portal.""And as with most tech start-ups, Okta is currently operating at a loss. For the year ending on January 31, 2017, losses were $83.5 million on a revenue of $160.3 million. Yet in 2016, the company realized a $76.3 million loss on $85.9 million in revenue and, in 2015, a $59.1 million loss on $41 million in revenue. The clear pattern here is that revenue growth is not only outstripping loss growth, but the ratio between them is increasing.Identity management cloud software is significant in the future of cloud software. As the variety of apps, platforms and technologies grows exponentially, the focus is shifting from the technologies themselves to the way they can be best managed in the interest of those who need them.This is where Okta and its emphasis on 'identity' come in. The idea of having a single, core identity which can unite profiles on countless platforms into one, coherent user portal like popular reviews. McKinnon and Kerrest were praised in a blog post by VC backer Sequoia Capital on understanding the importance of identity in cloud software ""years before the world caught on.""However, some see flaws in the company's long-term viability. In a Forbes feature, the CEO of rival company Sailpoint (private) pointed out that Okta lacks the security and back-office functions offered by giants Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) - as well as his own company - calling it a ""badge reader"" rather than someone who can actually vet the badge carrier.Such words are to be expected from a rival company, and Okta is not making itself out to be leaders in ""identity governance,"" which Sailpoint specializes in. And the irony is that an IPO for Sailpoint might depend on the success of Okta, which would increase the appetite among investors for another public listing of its kind.Gartner Group, a tech research and advisory firm, placed Sailpoint first in a report on leaders in ""Identity Governance and Administration,"" citing its ""vision execution"" along with IBM and Oracle. Sailpoint also claims to be profitable. But if Okta keeps up its revenue and loss trend, this should change soon enough.Then there is the question of how much it can scale up. With giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) probably offering something similar for free in the coming years, McKinnon was grilled by a CNBC panel on how his company would be able to stave off the competition. In an assured voice, he pointed out that this technology is about linking platforms together.Okta currently trades at $23.67 (at the time of writing), and if you are thinking of buying you need to consider two things.First, how long you are willing to wait for the company to become profitable. Current trends indicate profitability within the next few years, making this a long-term investment. Second, the IPOs of other similar companies like Sailpoint will shed more light on Okta as a stock option, seeing as it is the first of its kind.Time will tell whether McKinnon and Kerrest can create a highly profitable company by maintaining their current revenue growth trends, or whether competition from more specialized companies like Sailpoint or tech giants like IBM will come to fruition. For now, Okta leads the way."
4061102,25120,2017-04-07T13:20:45-04:00,"Okta has made a strong debut as investors like the combination of cloud and security.The company delivers on impressive growth and while losses are still sizable, they are coming down.Trading at 9-10 times annualized sales, the stock is only for believers in the long-term viability and competitiveness of Okta´s offerings as it operates in a very competitive field.","Okta (OKTA) has made a splashing debut as investor demand for any cloud-related play continues to be very strong. Shares jumped 35% from the final offering price which already was set at the high end of the preliminary offering range. Following this higher valuation the company has a lot to prove as it is combining impressive growth with narrowing but still sizable losses.As such the stock remains one for believers as it is very hard to judge the true competitive strength of Okta's products in a rapidly moving industry. While I will monitor the revenue ramp-up trajectory and PL impact closely in the coming quarters, I see no compelling reason to chase the stock at this valuation.The BusinessOkta calls itself the ""leading independent provider of identity for the enterprise."" The company has developed a cloud platform which allows workers to connect people to technology, on any advice and anytime.The company was founded in 2009 and immediately focused on the cloud, helping companies and its workers to connect apps which run in the cloud on a secure way. Okta claims that the solution already is used by 2 million people on a daily basis. With corporate awareness being elevated for any cyber-related security, having a safety check outside of the corporate firewall is crucial for customers.The solution is in great demand as many companies recognize the value added of the service. Some 3,100 customers use the service as of January of this year, including big corporate names while cloud vendors have adopted the solution as well.The OfferingOkta sold 11 million shares at the high end of the preliminary offering range of $15-$17 per share. Doing so, it raised $187 million in gross proceeds. Following the offering the company has nearly 91 million shares outstanding which values equity of the business at $1.55 billion.Important to note is that the issued ""A"" shares carry just a tenth of the voting power of the ""B"" shares which are held by insiders, indicating that normal shareholders basically have no control over the company. If we include the pre-IPO cash holdings of $37 million, Okta will operate with roughly $224 million in net cash. As shares have risen toward $23 per share on their opening day, operating assets are now valued at nearly $1.9 billion.For that kind of valuation, Okta is delivering on rapid growth which unfortunately is not profitable. Sales more than doubled from $41 million in 2014 to nearly $86 million in 2015. The growth trajectory remained impressive in 2016, with sales advancing by more than 86% to $160.3 million.The trouble is that while losses are coming down on a relative basis, they keep increasing on an absolute basis, as they are substantial in relation to sales as well. Operating losses amounted to $83.1 million in 2016 which is roughly $7 million more than the year before. As a percentage of sales, losses narrowed by 36 percentage points to a still hefty 52%.Fortunately the fourth quarter results offered some glimpse of hope. Revenue growth remained impressive at 80%, as sales of $48.9 million support a $200 million revenue run rate. That being said, shares still trade at 9.5 times revenues which is rather steep.Another encouraging development is that losses narrowed toward $18 million in the final quarter, declining both on a relative and absolute basis compared to the third quarter of 2016 as well as the fourth quarter of 2015.Based on the quarterly revenue number of $48.9 million and 3,114 customer count, the average customer spends about $60k per year. With over 2 million users, average spending per user comes in around $100 per year, which seems a reasonable amount.Final ThoughtsOkta is a cloud-based play like many. The company offers a nice solution, reports very high growth, but loses money at the same time. Besides the steep valuation, other risks include continued losses, stiff competition and the loss of credibility if the solution gets compromised.A 9-10 times sales multiple sounds fully priced, even as year-on-year growth still come in at 80% at this point in time. The operating leverage in the model is to be applauded as well, although losses remain relatively large in relation to topline sales. The company itself cites many authentication and mobility management providers as key competitors, including Citrix (NASDAQ:CTRX), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Symantec (SYMC), among others. These being multi-billion companies, they have vast resources and capabilities to develop competing solutions.For now I remain cautious despite the increased corporate awareness to have networks and devices better protected. The relative sales multiple in relation to topline revenue growth is encouraging, as the developments in the competitive environment remain my primary concern."

Underwriters tend to release reports as soon as restrictions are lifted and these reports most often are positive. Our firm has studied price movement around IPO quiet period expirations and have found an uptick in the stock price in a short window of time surrounding these days. This is particularly true for companies with a large team of underwriters and which have performed well since the IPO.Okta Inc. fits both of these criteria. We predict an increase in share price in the five days prior to and two days after the conclusion of the quiet period, which is in line with what we have seen in our research.Underwriters for the deal include: Allen & Co., Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Cannacord Genuity, JMP Securities, and Pacific Crest Securities.We first previewed Okta ahead of its IPO and recommended investing.

The company initially filed for its IPO with the SEC on March 13, 2017. If the underwriters price shares at the midpoint of the price range, OKTA will have a market cap value of $1.29B and trade at a price/sales multiple of 8.06x.The company was valued at $1.2B at its most recent round of funding in September 2015 and has raised an aggregate of $230M in VC funding. Notable investors include: Andreessen Horowitz, Greylock Partners, and Sequoia Capital.Underwriters include: Allen & Co., Goldman Sachs, J.P.

On average, stocks are up 10% with technology companies being up an average of 24.1% from IPO price (as of 3/29). This strong performance shows no signs of slowing down. Okta is expected to be the fourth unicorn to make its debut this year, following Snap (NYSE:SNAP), MuleSoft (NYSE:MULE), and Presidio (Pending:PSDO). Each is a deal we covered in detail previously. We expect similarly strong performance from Okta.We previewed the Okta deal on our IPO Insights Platform.Business SummaryOkta Inc. provides cloud-based security services to medium and large enterprises. The company's platform, Okta Identity Cloud, enables businesses to control employee access to various applications, devices, and data in a simple, and easy to use format as well as manage employee identities.The main objective of the platform is to simplify employee access to applications, while maintaining strong security. Its product offerings include: Universal Directory, Single-Sign On, Lifecycle Management, Multi-factor Authentication, and Mobility Management.As of its IPO, Okta had over 3,100 clients and over two million people using its services daily. Its product offerings were rated highly, and Okta was the only company to be named a leader in Identity Access as a Service (IDaaS) by Gartner three years in a row.Notable customers include: Workday, ServiceNow, NetSuite, Microsoft, Google Cloud, Box, Amazon Web Services, 20th Century Fox, Adobe, Engie, Flex, Github, LinkedIn, MassMutual, MGM Resorts, Pitney Bowes and Twilio.Financial HighlightsOkta generates its revenue primarily through subscription fees that have a weighted-average duration of 2.4 years. The fees cover use of the service, technical support, and management of the platform. Invoices are billed annually in advance.The company has grown revenue significantly. Revenue generated was $41.0M, $85.9M, and $160.3M for FY 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. This represents year-over-year growth of 109.5% for 2015 to 2016 and 86.6% for 2016 to 2017. Gross profit increased from 54% in 2015, to 58.06% in 2016 to 65% in 2017.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) offer similar products to Okta's Identity Cloud and Okta also competes against smaller, private players.Assuming Okta prices at the midpoint of its price range, $14, it would command a market cap value of $1.29B and trade at a price/sales multiple of 8.06x. This is above the industry average price/sales ratio of 6.36x, but seems justified given the significantly higher growth rate.(Fidelity)Executive Management HighlightsCo-founder, Director, and CEO Todd McKinnon has served in his positions since the company's inception in 2009. He was previously the Senior Vice President of Engineering at Okta's competitor, Salesforce.

4104328,51452,2017-09-05T23:46:12-04:00,"Since their $17 IPO in April, OKTA shares have been volatile but gained 15%+ from where they could be bought in the open market the first day.Okta has very cost-effective, cloud-based communications and other offerings at just $1-4 monthly per user.Okta reports July FQ2 results this Thursday, September 7, and could be upgraded by us with a second upside report since the IPO.","Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) is scheduled to report July FQ2 results this Thursday afternoon. Expectations are $55.9 million in revenues and ($0.26) loss per share based on $55-56 million and ($0.26)-($0.25) per share guidance that compared well to prior expectations for $54.0 million and ($0.26) per share when provided on last quarter’s earnings call.Okta provides a range of six cloud-based services (affordably priced at $1-4 each per user per-month) on a single platform to improve communications among enterprises and their customers, partners and suppliers. The company works with a wide range of other technologies and services. And the company is winning larger deals from larger customers which we always like to see with young, fast-growing companies.Okta’s $17-IPO was on April 7. On June 7, the company reported April FQ1 results of $53.0 million in revenues and ($0.50) loss per share, better than expectations for $48.5 million and ($0.61) per share in that first quarterly report. Those revenues were up 67%.FQ2 growth rates will be compared to those of FQ1, which included:The company’s six product offerings are:The company has very nice tutorials on its website that visually describe its products and make them look highly compelling.On last quarter’s earnings call, the company also provided guidance for its January 2018 fiscal year. It was $233-236 million in revenues and ($1.15)-($1.11) loss per share. Those revenues were better than $227-million revenue expectations.With that guidance, if FQ2 was only in line with expectations, the FH2 loss per share would decline to ($0.40) or an average of ($0.20) per quarter with hopefully a loss of just ($0.15)-($0.10) per share by FQ4. Continued fast revenue growth combined with declines in the quarterly earnings losses is just what the shares of a new company need to perform well. Continued revenue upside will be important, given the valuation is already 10x revenues. If revenue growth is powerful investors will likely accept continued losses - even if they decline only gradually if it is to fund more new products and global expansion.The FQ1 earnings call with management was impressive and we initiated a Buy rating immediately thereafter. If the FQ2 report and FQ3 and FQ4 outlooks reflect the accelerating momentum the IPO may, in fact, have helped drive, our Buy rating could be upgraded to Strong Buy."

4093205,103480,2017-08-01T13:30:59-04:00,"Okta is the fastest-growing company of the software sector’s IPO class of 2017.A recent sector-wide pullback in software has pushed Okta down to levels worth examining.Overly conservative guidance should lead to a pop when Okta reports 2Q earnings in September.Looking longer term, growth prospects are ripe for Okta as it pursues a greenfield market opportunity as an acknowledged leader in identity and access management.","The Nasdaq has taken a breather in the past week, with software stocks down harder than the broader tech sector. Investors are seemingly selling off growth stocks indiscriminately without separating wheat from chaff, creating valid buying opportunities in stocks once valued too richly and thus too risky for serious consideration.When growth is back in vogue (which, given the market’s erratic swings this year, shouldn’t be long), investors will reward tech’s top growers. Chief among them is OKTA (NASDAQ: OKTA), the cloud identity access pioneer that is also the fastest growing of software’s IPO class of 2017.Growth is a common attribute of tech IPOs; absent growth of at least 25%+, a tech startup typically wouldn’t dare venture into the public markets. But hypergrowth is rare, and Okta is one of the precious few growing at 87%, as of its fiscal year ended January 2017.Okta’s hypergrowth rests on several key pillars. Chief among them is that Okta is operating in a largely greenfield opportunity that is less crowded than other spaces within application software (for example, accounting software or HR software), with so many vendors it’s hard to keep track. While large players have recently entered Okta’s space (Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS)), they largely compete on pricing and Okta is still seen as the pioneer and leading brand.Okta is also aggressive with its sales and marketing spend, which hurts profitability in the near term, but due to long subscription contract durations, actually sets the company up for profitable revenue streams for years in advance of each deal.Many tech IPOs dress up their S-1 filings with big buzzwords and try to drum up the technical complexities of their product. The words “machine learning” and “big data” are common favorites in the S-1 lexicon. Not Okta, however. Okta actually stresses its product’s simplicity of use, while at the same time driving home the universal ubiquity and applicability of its services across the corporate IT stack.The stock’s recent pullback to the $22s creates a buying opportunity in a stock that has traded richly since going public in April 2017. The following sections will give a brief overview of Okta’s product and positioning within the IT landscape, examine the company’s rocketing growth trends as well as operating efficiencies, and discuss valuation ($25, or 8x FTM revenue) for a company that is valuable not only as a short-term earnings flip, but also as a long-term hold in your tech portfolio.The average Okta enterprise customer, according to its S-1, deploys over 50 cloud applications. This is a stark evolution from the IT landscape of a decade ago, where most enterprises ran most applications on-premise in their own data centers. The proliferation of cloud usage has created a need for corporate users to easily sign on and access their company’s suite of applications, and for the company’s IT leaders to easily provision resources and manage access.The Okta Identity Cloud, in the company’s own S-1 words, “is used by organizations in two distinct and powerful ways: to manage and secure their internal users (employees and contractors), and to connect and secure their external users (customers, partners and suppliers) via the powerful APIs we have developed."" Okta first delivered its flagship single-sign on product in 2010 (currently $2/user/month), then added additional (paid) features such as Universal Directory ($1/user/month) and mobility management ($4/user/month) to its growing suite of tools.Gartner, the leading software research firm, dubbed this category “Identity Access Management as a Service” (IDaaS) in 2014, recognizing Okta as a Leader (top-right section of the quadrant) ever since the category's creation. It still retains this crown today, even though tech giants such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft have entered the fray.These larger competitors compete mostly on price - a basic subscription to Microsoft Azure Active Directory costs $1/user/month, compared to $2/user/month for Okta’s core single sign-on product. Regardless, IT leaders (as well as Gartner) still view Okta as the gold standard of SSO. Okta’s 3,000+ customers include such giants as Experian (LON: EXPN), Dish Network (NASDAQ: DISH), Twenty-First Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA), and MGM Resorts (NYSE:MGM). It even counts fellow cloud leaders among its client list, including Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), and Box (NYSE:BOX), validating the technical strength of the product.Okta operates on monthly subscriptions spread across multi-year deals. See standard pricing across Okta’s product lines below, noting that enterprise customers with 5,000+ users receive custom pricing:Source: Okta websiteIDaaS is growing quickly, and Okta continues to grab share. According to IDC, the migration to cloud has affected $116bn in IT spend in 2016; by 2020, this number is expected to balloon to $216bn. Okta is well positioned to benefit from this secular trend toward the cloud by tying the various cloud applications together under a single management pane. Its Identity Cloud has emerged as a true horizontal software platform, fitting in as an underlying component across the IT stack regardless of which applications sit on top.The growth story is reflected in the numbers as well. See below Okta’s revenue and billings metrics since it began reporting:Figure 1. OKTA Revenue/Billings GrowthQ1 earnings, the company’s first public release in June, blew away expectations with $53 million in revenue (+67% y/y) vs. expectations for only $48 million (+51% y/y), sending the stock rallying 10% to $27. And bear in mind, this level of growth for a company expected to post ~$230mm in sales for 2017 is incredible. Billings growth of +75% y/y (which accounts for prepaid contracts in deferred revenue up to a year out) is also showing no signs of stopping, providing a useful periscope into Okta's vaunted growth trajectory.The notion that Okta is a rare growth story, even among tech peers, is validated when comparing Okta with the rest of software’s class of 2017 IPOs. Among these six companies, Okta posted the strongest growth in its last reported fiscal year.Figure 2. OKTA growth vs. 2017 software IPOsNotice Okta has larger revenue scale than Appian (NASDAQ:APPN), Yext (NYSE:YEXT) and Alteryx (NYSE:AYX), yet is growing considerably faster than each of them. Okta's 87% y/y growth at its scale is a premium attribute in the industry. In each year since reporting revenues (see Figure 1), Okta has nearly doubled its revenues.Now turning ahead: where future opportunity lies is the cautious guidance management has issued. Q2 guidance calls for revenue of $55-56 million, which represents only 48% y/y growth and 5% sequential growth. Sequential growth had previously never dipped below 9%. See chart below (note billings are seasonally volatile so sequential growth figures are less meaningful):Figure 3. OKTA quarterly growth, y/y and sequentialManagement's guidance midpoint (in red) points to a growth deceleration that is almost certainly too conservative. Is it likely that Okta will only post $55.5 million in revenues, only $2.5 million (5%) above its Q1 print? Probably not. Sequential growth has never been that weak, and note that Q1's seemingly small 9% sequential growth figure comes off the back of Q4, which is historically the strongest for software deals as IT leaders close out year-end budgets and do last-minute shopping. And with billings growth accelerating to 75% y/y in 1Q17 (and in the high 60s for the three previous quarters), Okta has enough revenue ""stored up"" in backlog to post much better numbers than it is forecasting.This is a company that has managed expectations well and set the bar low, setting the stock up for a nice post-earnings pop.Supporting the company’s growth is its underlying contract structure. According to Okta’s S-1, its average customer signs on for weighted-average contract duration of 2.4 years, which is high even in an environment where multi-year deals have become more and more common within software.And those contracts expand in ACV (annual contract value) by year. In its S-1, Okta discloses the contract growth of its cohort of 2015 customers. While these customers had originally signed on for an aggregate of $24.1 million in spend the first year, that annual spend had increased to $30 million by Year 2 and $34 million by Year 3.Figure 4. OKTA ACV growth chart, 2015 cohortSource: S-1These sticky, multi-year contracts are gifts that keep giving. While they require a lot of sales efforts and dollar resources upfront, the profitability of these contracts improves drastically throughout its lifespan, as shown by the spike in the contribution margin line. Year 1 requires intensive sales, proof-of-concept, and implementation costs; thereafter, the contracts become almost pure profit, supporting Okta’s high gross margin (67% in the most recent quarter).Despite significant investments in technology and sales and marketing, Okta’s operating margins are also making leaps as well. See below a quarterly chart of Okta’s operating costs by its three main components since 2014:Figure 5. OKTA operating metrics by quarterLooking back as far as 1Q16 (April 2015), we can see a meaningful decline across operating expenses, most importantly sales and marketing. And in 1Q18, operating margins improved 17 points y/y, from (71%) to (54%), which is impressive given Q1 is traditionally the seasonal low of most software businesses. Only two years ago, this is a company that was losing 99 cents (on an operating basis) of every dollar it made; now it's only losing half that, and getting better each quarter.While Okta is still in burn mode and investing heavy sales dollars into multi-year contracts, it has proven a path to profitability through its ability to expand these contracts into high contribution margins and reduce operating overhead each quarter.Finally, we turn to valuation. This is the big question surrounding Okta - most investors agree the growth narrative and numbers are both solidly intact, but many think it's too expensive.The best valuation framework for Okta tracks its value against its 2017 software IPO peers. See chart below:Figure 6. OKTA trading comps(Note on methodology: Forward revenues are based on an extrapolation of management guidance; balance sheet figures are taken from the most recent quarter and market cap is based on close of trading on July 31)As evident above, Okta trades roughly in-line to slightly below its IPO peers, while maintaining superior growth rates. Prior to its correction, Okta had traded as high as $27 (roughly 9x forward revenues). Okta's higher growth rates merit a higher multiple to its peers, and while 9x may be a stretch, 8x ($25) is a fair near-term price target.Though 8x still sounds like an elevated multiple, recall the hypergrowth argument that underpins this thesis. Here's how to get comfortable with an 8x multiple in the context of a company growing >50%: in one year, continued or even slightly decelerated revenue growth at that rate will push the EV/FTM revenue multiple down to ~6x, which is a fair multiple for a more mature software company posting growth at more stable rates.And don't forget that only until the recent Nasdaq pullback, investors had reasoned the same and kept Okta in a stable trading pattern above $25 post its Q1 beat, a feat likely to be repeated in its coming Q2 print.Investing in growth, as everyone knows, is not for the faint of heart. The market temperamentally chooses its winners and losers and cycles through them in rapid flashes. This time, however, the tech pullback has seemed to cause investors to forget that Okta is a winner, underpinned by its massive growth rates.Well-managed, low expectations set up Okta for a more-than-likely beat in its September Q2 print. Even looking beyond this quarter, Okta is clearly seen as a best-of-breed software platform in the identity management space and will continue to ride on the tailwinds of cloud migration and increased need for centralized access authorization across a litany of cloud apps.Buying opportunities are rare in the ever-bubbling tech sector, so the recent pullback opens up a nice window to build a well-timed position."
4057237,102933,2017-03-22T16:58:28-04:00,"Okta is a leading independent provider of identity and access management software.The company is both growing faster and burning more cash than any other company I follow.The company scores well on most key indicators I care about, including having a large addressable market, low churn and a strong competitive position.Concerns include competition from established players like Microsoft and pricing pressure should the core product be commoditized over time.It is too early to render a verdict on Okta without a price range, but this looks like another high-quality SaaS IPO with high-multiple potential.","Overview:After the successful MuleSoft (NYSE:MULE) IPO last week, the next high-growth candidate coming public is Okta (Private:OKTA), which styles itself as ""the leading independent provider of identity for the enterprise."" Enterprise software bundling/pricing is often deliberately abstract, but happily the pricing page on Okta's website lists the company's five core product offerings and their pricing in an easy to digest way:I won't go through each product in detail, but to here's what Okta does in a nutshell: it helps companies manage employee identities and it helps employees securely access applications. As SaaS applications proliferate, pain points have emerged for both key constituencies: employees have to repetitively log into various applications in web browsers, and employers have to struggle with the security ramifications of SaaS applications being available anywhere, anytime outside of the corporate network.Okta solves these challenges by enabling companies to offer single sign-on (SSO), which allows employees sign in just once and move seamlessly between SaaS applications. It also offers multi-factor authentication (MFA), which requires proof points of identity beyond just a password to more rigorously verify that an employee's credentials have not been compromised. Okta has extended the product further by providing lifecycle management services for the provisioning and management of software subscriptions to help new employees get what they need quickly and make sure subscriptions are cancelled when the leave. Finally, it offers identity management services for other SaaS companies to incorporate into their own products.This product enables a delightful user experience: Okta-powered employees can sign in just once and access a slew of enterprise apps. Enabling MFA in tandem with this makes software both easier to use and more secure than before, a truly rare feat. Here's a quick snip of the landing page a user sees once they've completed the initial login process to give a sense of what this looks like:Grading the IPO:To think through the factors that will drive the company's IPO success and valuation, I'm going to score it on variables that matter to me as an investor, including the size of the addressable market, competitive positioning today, the long-term competitive moat, the revenue churn dynamic, fundraising to date, growth efficiency and finally valuation in light of all the other factors. Some important factors are missing because I don't have enough information to have a view, most notably an analysis of management strength and the strategy going forward. Each variable will get a score from one to 10, with 10 being most desirable from an investment perspective:Total addressable market (10/10): This is easy to approximate given the pricing information I showed earlier: Okta's pricing today equates to $14/user/month at list prices, or $168/user/year, if a customer buys the full suite of products. Factoring in discounting and the fact that full product penetration is a unlikely in even a rosy scenario, let's go with $100/user/year as an approximation of the addressable market at today's pricing. There are tens of millions of knowledge workers in the US alone who could potentially use Okta's products, and as SaaS applications proliferate the need will become even more pressing. It isn't hard to imagine Okta having 50m global users one day, or $5bn of revenue using the assumptions above. Unless pricing in the category comes down over time (a real risk), it is hard to argue that Okta will run out of growth opportunities anytime soon given that it is at a ~$200m revenue run-rate today.Competitive position (7/10): Though the market is crowded, Okta stands out with a leadership position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Identity and Access Management and is widely recognized as a leading player in this space. There are many pure-play competitors (see the table below), but they generally either are smaller or grow more slowly. There also are significant enterprise competitors, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), of which Microsoft is the most competitive today. All in, Okta is a market leader, but strong alternatives exist and it is not the unchallenged market leader in the way that some other leading SaaS companies are, so the score here is 7/10.Long-term moat (5/10): This is my greatest area of concern for Okta as the core user-facing product functionality today (SSO and MFA) is thinner than would be ideal for driving continued separation between the company and competition. The company will continue to launch innovative new solutions on top of the core product and there is a little network effect thanks to the pre-existing integrations, but a meaningful risk is that either a smaller competitor or a giant like Microsoft, Salesforce or Amazon(NASDAQ:AMZN) successfully attacks the market with a competitive product paired with a bundling approach or a much lower price point. This is something potential investors will have to monitor very closely going forward and is sure to be a topic of conversation on the IPO roadshow. Microsoft, in particular, is a potential bogeyman given it has the ability to leverage its Office365 franchise and deep enterprise partnerships.Churn dynamic (8/10): Churn is a major driver of a SaaS company's ability to sustain rapid growth and show operating leverage. Okta has excellent reported churn metrics highlighted by a 120% dollar-based retention rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2016, meaning upsells are more than offsetting churn by a wide margin. One major factor in Okta's favor is that adoption is high as this is generally a mandatory product for employees to use and part of daily workflows. Another factor it that it is hard to see how end users might start clamoring for a replacement: once a solution like this is in place, it is hard to see what new features a competitor might offer that would make a switch worth the cost. Despite all of this, my score is 8/10 as there are a few reasons for caution:1) Okta is growing so fast that many customers have not even had a natural opportunity to churn yet, so dollar-based revenue retention will likely fall as growth inevitably slows.2) The flip side of such a simple and easy to use product is that end user pain from switching to a competing solution is lower than ideal. As a result, IT departments may be more susceptible to cost savings arguments from lower priced competitors in the long run.Fundraising (10/10): Per Crunchbase, Okta has raised $228m to date from a set of top-tier venture firms: A16Z, Sequoia and Greylock, with the last fundraising round in 2015 at a reported $1.2bn valuation. That may have been a bit aggressive at the time but the company has executed very well and there are no signs that the existing shareholder base is likely to be disappointed by the outcome of the IPO. With elite backers and a reasonable level of capital raised so far for its size there isn't much to dislike here: 10/10.Growth efficiency (8/10): Okta is in a class of its own when it comes to both growth and losses. It grew gross profit almost 110% year over year in 2016 (note: this includes one quarter of my own estimates), while generating the largest negative free cash flow (measured as a percent of revenue) of any company I follow that year. I view Okta's losses as actually lower than I would expect for the ultra-high growth rate it is producing. All else equal, though, it is better when a company is cash flow breakeven and thus doesn't run a risk of raising further dilutive capital. This knocks off a few points: 8/10.Valuation (too early to score): Without a price range or information about the size of the offering, it is too early to score how valuation measures up here. The last funding round (back in 2015) reportedly came at a $1.2bn valuation. We don't know if that is exactly right, but my math suggests that it implies a ~$13/share valuation today, so I'll use that as an initial point of comparison for charting the company against comparables. The two charts below show my preferred valuation multiple (enterprise value / my 2017 gross profit estimate, acronym: EV/GP) against two different measures of growth/profitability:Okta leaps out in the chart on the right because its gross margins increased dramatically in 2016, from 58% of revenue in 2015 to a projected 65%, as the gross margin of its services business improved dramatically and subscription gross margin also improved. These factors led to gross profit growth far ahead of revenue growth. This makes valuing Okta tricky: based on the chart on the left which uses revenue growth on the X axis, it looks like it could reasonably trade to 10x EV/GP. However, based on the chart on the right which uses gross profit growth instead, it could trade similarly to companies like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and MuleSoft with an EV/GP multiple in the low to mid-teens. Given the ultra-high growth rate and current IPO market dynamic I suspect that Okta is set to earn a multiple closer to the latter group of high-flying companies when all is said and done, implying a post-IPO price in the mid-20s per share, but again we need more details about the offering to have a solid view.Summary:There's no way to make a call on Okta as an investment without a price range but, like MuleSoft, it is a strong SaaS story with premium growth that should earn a premium multiple. Competition from players like Microsoft against the core product is my largest concern, while on most other variables it looks attractive. It will be fascinating to see the valuation the market awards it given the combination of unusually high losses and unusually high growth for a public SaaS company."
4055339,101924,2017-03-15T09:29:05-04:00,"Okta Inc., a tech security company which works with cloud technology, has made preliminary filings for an IPO on the NASDAQ.The company is in an important field as cloud technology becomes more commonplace and boasts a strong growth rate, showing its overall potential.There are concerns with Okta’s technology, namely its dependence on Amazon Web Services as well as the fact that it uses open-source software.Okta will have more time to make its case, and investors should listen thoroughly and be optimistic about its prospects.","In a sign of how the tech IPO market is improving, tech company Okta Inc. (NASDAQ:OKTA) has filed for a $100 million IPO with the SEC, joining fellow tech companies Yext Inc. (NYSE:YEXT) as the first tech companies to go public since the massive Snap IPO. The $100 million value is almost certainly a placeholder used to calculate filing fees, and Okta will apparently join the NASDAQ under the label OKTA.Okta will obviously receive nowhere near as much hype as Snap (NYSE:SNAP) did, but there is plenty to like this company's prospects going forward. It has strong connections with men like George Soros, a decently growing balance sheet, and its focus on cloud-based identity management security is crucial as customers and businesses worry about their safety and privacy on the cloud. While it is far too early to make a final decision, investors should keep a positive eye on this company and not totally balk if it chooses to price a bit higher than expected.The Cloud and SecurityOkta is best known for its identity management software and declares in its SEC filing that ""we founded Okta in 2009 to reinvent identity for the cloud era, where identity is the critical foundation in an increasingly dynamic world of devices and applications.""Think about the myriad websites you log onto every day and the security risk that it entails. Using a different password for each website or app is irritating and means that IT departments have to waste time dealing with more password resets, but using the same password for all of them is an unacceptable security risk. Okta provides a single gate for businesses, which lets workers access the multiple apps a large business uses quickly and safely. Some of the companies which use Okta include National Geographic, LinkedIn (LNKD), and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).While Okta may be more popular with large corporations, even small companies are jumping into the general benefits of cloud technology and thus the identity security risks. This means that Okta has good growth potential as it is patently obvious that the cloud will become more important for companies over time.As a result of this growing popularity, Okta has seen its revenue grow appropriately. Its total revenue jumped from $41 million in the year ending January 31, 2015 to nearly $86 million in the same period ending 12 months later. It should be noted that net losses increased in that same time frame from $59 million to $76 million, but that is hardly unusual for many tech companies. The important thing to note is that Okta is a growing tech company in an important field and should be able to look forward to continual growth.The Amazon ProblemBut that is not to say Okta is not without problems. Okta relies on open-source software and is hosted through Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN). This creates two problems. The first is that in the long run, it could limit Okta's growth capabilities as it takes up more space in the cloud.The second problem is more immediate, and was fully demonstrated by when some AWS servers shut down a few weeks ago and caused problems across the Internet. AWS has moved to fix the problems which caused that incident, but an AWS shutdown could in turn mean an Okta shutdown, hurting corporations and thus ruining Okta's reputation as a reliable place to connect apps and websites together. It should also be noted that Okta's reliance on open-source software and plans to keep using said software also opens them up to a potential lawsuit, but many software companies operate under similar legal problems.Not yet time for a decisionAs Okta has not released a formal price yet, it is too soon to say whether to buy this company or not. But the fundamental reality is that there is a lot to like about Okta. As more companies turn towards the cloud and cloud-related apps, they will need a way to bind the apps together for security reasons. Okta will be in a good position to take advantage, as it has demonstrated over the past few years.Okta will certainly release more information about its company, its future prospects, and most importantly its price and valuation soon. Keep an optimistic eye out for its statements and see if it can continue to uphold its good record."

Earlier this month, the company announced that it was pursuing authorization with the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). FedRAMP is a government-wide, standardized approach to security assessment, authorization and continuous auditing for federal agencies. The certification will enable government agencies to adopt Okta's identity, mobility and security solutions. It has already obtained ISO 27001 certification for its information security management system, and is the first and only identity-as-a-service company to achieve the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Security, Trust and Assurance Registry (STAR) Level 2 Attestation. Recently, Okta also added social security to its services. Its platform now allows developers to register, authenticate and manage users from social identity providers like Facebook, Google and LinkedIn.As part of its regional expansion initiatives, Okta announced its presence in the Nordics with the opening of its third office in Europe. The company also opened a new data center in Europe to comply with the EU data privacy laws.Okta hopes that its recent moves will help thwart competition coming from giants like Salesforce.com, which offers Salesforce Identity, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which released the Microsoft Identity Manager in August 2015, and IBM Corp.

Okta is a market leading company in a growing space within the enterprise security market. We don’t yet know the IPO valuation details, but I’m concerned with the company’s high cash burn rate to generate its growth results.CompanyOkta was co-founded in 2009 by CEO Todd McKinnon and COO Frederic Kerrest to provide identity management for enterprises and their partners, customers and suppliers. CEO McKinnon was previously Sr. VP of Development at Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and owns 10.3% of common stock pre-IPO.Okta has raised around $230 million in several rounds of private venture capital investment from top-tier firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Greylock Partners.The company has various partner types including direct app integrations via its Okta Application Network, Technology Partners and Solution Providers consisting of Systems Integrators, Consultants and VARs.TechnologyOkta has created an IDAaaS (Identity Access as a Service) system it calls the Okta Identity Cloud, which enables organizations to more easily and comprehensively manage approved user access to its systems via the wide variety of mobile and other connectivity devices.Below is a brief explainer video relative to why CIOs are interested in Okta’s approach:(Source: Okta)Okta says it has over 2,900 customers using its services connecting more than 2 million users in over 185 countries. As of October 31, 2016, it claimed more than ""5,000 integrations with cloud, mobile and web applications.""Market and CompetitionThe IDAaaS market is considered a subset of the global security market and is a relatively nascent market space, having generated 2013 revenues of only $215 million, according to IPACSO.IDAaaS combined with IGA (Identity Governance and Administration) and UA (User Authentication) make up the three subsets of Identity and Access Management:(Source: IPACSO)According to a research report by Markets and Markets, the Cloud Security market of which IDAaaS is a part is expected to reach $8.71 billion by 2019, representing a CAGR of 15.7% from 2014.It stated that the main drivers for this substantial growth rate include ""accelerated adoption of cloud computing, growing cloud specific attacks, absence of strict regulations on Cloud Service Providers and increase in need of identity and access management.""In 2016, Okta was considered a Market Leader by market research group Gartner via its Magic Quadrant:(Source: Gartner)Other key direct or adjacent competitors include:FinancialsOkta’s recent financial results can be summarized as follows:Below are the company’s operational results for the past two and ¾ years (Audited GAAP for full years):(Source: Okta S-1)RevenueGross MarginCash Flow from OperationsAs of October 31, 2016, Okta had $20 million in cash and total liabilities excluding deferred revenue of $24.8 million (unaudited).IPO DetailsOkta intends to raise $100 million in its IPO, although the amount may be a temporary placeholder. Management did not disclose an expected share price range or a proposed post-IPO market cap.The company is selling Class A shares to the public, which will have one vote per share, but existing investors and management will retain Class B shares, which will have 10 votes per share. This is an increasingly common way for companies to retain voting control when going public.Interestingly, a recent study found that companies with unequal voting rights perform worse than companies with the same voting rights. Specific use of the proceeds from the IPO was not disclosed, other than the usual boilerplate ""for working capital and other general corporate purposes.""Major book runners are listed as Goldman, Sachs & Co., J.P. Morgan and Allen & Company LLC.CommentaryOkta is considered a leading provider in its field of identity access management, which is growing rapidly as a function of the worsening online security environment and the proliferation of devices needing to access the enterprise cloud. Its financial performance is impressive, although not unusual for fast-growing enterprise IT technology startups in a hot space.Top-line revenue growth rates have been very high, but appear to be decreasing as the company surpasses the $100 million revenue mark; again, this is typical of tech startups seeking to IPO.Gross margin is relatively high and increasing, but the company’s high use of cash to fund growth is concerning. An important differentiator between technology companies in my view is not how fast they can grow, but how capital efficiently they can grow reasonably fast.Okta’s founder-led management team has done well to create a market leader, but I wonder when it will begin to show a path to sustainable growth without burning through a boatload of cash.We don’t yet know Okta’s proposed IPO valuation, so I will be looking closely at those figures and will update readers when we know more.I write about IPOs and M&A deals.

And I wish I'd believed them:Source: FinvizOMCL did dip briefly after Q1's headline numbers disappointed against already-lowered expectations, and a 13% YOY decline in revenue might have scared off investors. But a strong Q2 release and management commentary on the Q2 conference call sets the company up for a strong 2018. And while its current valuation looks stretched, growth over the next few years should bring those multiples in. With the new XT series showing strength, this looks like a case of paying for quality. And I do think investors will happily pay more than $50 over the next few quarters.In late 2016, Omnicell launched its XT automated dispensing cabinet, replacing the legacy G4 cabinet. The shift caused a reasonable amount of disruption, both fundamentally and operationally. Potential G4 customers were offered the chance to move to the XT, and many took the opportunity to do so (both before and after the launch). And as a commenter pointed out on my last piece, OMCL recognizes revenue on acceptance, not delivery. The combination pushed sales out of Q1, leading to disappointing guidance and seemingly ugly results.As seen in the chart above, investors for the most part accepted management's explanation, with post-earnings dips after Q4 and Q1 quickly bought. And Q2 results certainly seem to confirm management's optimism. Revenue set a new record. In Automation and Analytics, the 10-Q specifically cites slower revenue recognition as a headwind - but revenue still declined just 0.2% year over year. In the Medication Adherence segment, revenue rose 34%, about two-thirds of which came from the December acquisition of Ateb.The numbers here help confirm that Q1 truly was an anomaly. But it's the Q2 conference call that probably drove the post-earnings optimism. Numbers aside, XT clearly has opened well in the market. Omnicell already has announced the end of the G4 and expects 90% of cabinet revenue to come from XT by Q4. That, in turn, should help costs by moving from three products (including the legacy AcuDose-Rx) to one.There's still plenty of room for international penetration (14% of 1H revenue), and the business beyond XT is performing well. Margins should ramp as the year rolls on, with Omnicell expecting to hit its 15% non-GAAP operating margin target by Q4. Should that be the case - and order and shipment timing suggest pretty strong visibility over the rest of the year - it sets Omnicell up nicely for 2018.The one possible concern coming out of the quarter is that implied second-half guidance actually came down. After Q1, Omnicell projected 2H revenue of $395-415 million and non-GAAP EPS of $0.95-1.05. Implied guidance coming out of the quarter is for revenue of $388-408 million (pulled down less than 2% at the midpoint) and adjusted EPS of $0.86-0.98.Obviously, investors are looking past that change - and with good reason. Full-year guidance was reiterated, which might suggest some help from a timing standpoint - and indeed, per the Q2 call, the shift to XT came in faster than expected. But fundamentally this remains a 2018 story, and that story looks stronger coming out of the quarter.Next year's results should benefit simply from removing integration and acquisition costs this year, estimated at ~$10 million (and not excluded from non-GAAP figures). That alone is a ~$0.17 tailwind after-tax. Margins have been hit in the first half, in particular, by startup costs relative to XT, including $3 million ($0.05-0.06 after-tax) in Q2 alone.Assuming Omnicell can hold that 15% margin next year, EPS should clear $2 even with high-single digit growth (toward the low end of long-term expectations for 8-12% annual increases). A 24-25x forward P/E multiple might seem high. But free cash flow figures should be better (D&A strongly outpaces capex, even backing out amortization costs excluded from non-GAAP figures), and it's not as if growth stalls out in 2019. Regulatory and even legal tailwinds will persist behind both dispensing and medication adherence, gross margins should improve next year (with further help in 2019), and operating leverage should further grow margins.It's a classic ""price vs. value"" argument, but with Omnicell showing clear leadership with the XT, the price still looks good enough. There's a clear case for a high $50s share price, if not $60+, over the next twelve months, as investor expectations turn toward 2018 EPS at $2+ and 2019 figures that could near $2.30-2.50. OMCL could be a takeover target at some point (rumors have swirled on that for years), and growth figures over the next four quarters are going to look quite strong. I wish I'd bought at $40, but coming out of Q2, $50 doesn't look too bad, either."

1857831,41741,2013-11-22T11:36:13-05:00,,"Omnicell (NASDAQ:OMCL) is an industry leader in medication management for hospitals and healthcare facilities. The company has what Warren Buffett calls a strong ""economic moat."" The results speak for themselves as Omnicell received record orders in 3Q, of which 35% came from new customers for its automated dispensing systems. Because of its strong ""economic moat,"" shares are up 56% YTD and we see further gains ahead.Medication management at its bestOmnicell enables healthcare facilities to manage, dispense and administer medications and medical-surgical supplies to enhance patient safety, reduce medication errors, reduce operating costs, and increase operational efficiency. The company serves over 2,700 hospital customers.Of those customers, over 1,800 have automated dispensing machines and Omnicell solutions cover 33% of their hospital beds. Omnicell also serves over 6,000 institutions and retail pharmacy customers. The company operates in two segments - acute care and non-acute care. Acute care is described as products and services sold to hospital customers. Non-acute care would be products and services sold to customers outside of hospitals. The company was founded in 1992 by its Chairman & CEO Randall Lipps.Solving a huge problem, while offering superior serviceOne of the biggest opportunities for Omnicell is that its products and services provide a critical need in healthcare. According to an Institute of Medicine report published in 2006 and cited in the company's 10-K, an estimated 1.5 million medication errors are made each year in the U.S. Omnicell's solutions and services ease the burdens on nurses, solve medication regulatory issues, and improve patient safety. For patients, Omnicell's packaging helps deal with the issue of medication adherence. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services states that 11% of all hospital admissions are related to medical adherence. Medication non-adherence results in an estimated 125,000 deaths each year.The other major opportunity for Omnicell is that its solutions are of critical value to hospital administrators. Omnicell's solutions provide barcode verification at every step of the medication administration process. This starts with entry to the hospital to administration and inventory to the patient. This usage tracking ensures hospital administrators that money is not wasted on excessive supplies and helps optimize reimbursement by improving charge capture.Now, one of the company's biggest strengths is that its products offer unique solutions that are far superior to the offerings of its competitors. These include:A growing addressable market grows salesInternational expansion is wide open for Omnicell. This is a big opportunity for the company, since the same healthcare issues that U.S. facilities face exist in every healthcare facility globally. As the company establishes sales and distribution systems internationally, either directly or through partnerships, these initiatives provide significant growth opportunities for Omnicell. Last year, only 7% of revenues were generated outside the U.S. and Canada.In any case, there is still plenty of room for growth in the U.S. While Omnicell serves a good chunk of the market at 2,700 hospitals, there are still about 3,700 hospitals that do not have Omnicell services or products. With the critical needs that its products meet, Omnicell's sales force should be able to increase its presence in the U.S., and capture even greater market share of the hospital industry. This will happen as more acute care facilities become automated.Top teaching hospitals have been among the earliest adopters of Omnicell's new technologies and its customers include 10 of the 18 2013-2014 Honor Roll Hospitals, as rated by US News and World Report.Source: Company PresentationCompetition and hospital spending remains the biggest question marksThe biggest risk to Omnicell's bull thesis is competition. Its key competitors include CareFusion (NYSE:CFN), AmerisourceBergen (NYSE:ABC), and McKesson (NYSE:MCK). All of which are bigger and have greater resources than Omnicell. In any case, investors shouldn't be overly concerned about the competition. Omnicell's response to competitive headwinds in its 10-K.""We believe our products and services compare favorably with the offerings of our competitors, particularly with respect to proprietary technological advancements, system performance, system reliability, installation, applications training, service response time and service repair quality.""Furthermore, the company continues to win awards against its competitors.Source: Company PresentationThe other major risk for Omnicell is hospital spending, especially, in light of recent government initiatives and legislation. For us, we see this as the biggest unknown for Omnicell going forward, but the overall company strengths should be enough to ensure Omnicell's solutions remain an integral part of acute and non-acute care. This is particularly true as we see healthcare facilities prioritizing expenditures and increasing automation.Strong backlog gives insight to the future, and robust growth drive the investment thesisIn looking at the numbers, the first thing that we see is that Omnicell had a product backlog of $155 million at the end of last year. This is up from $134 million in 2011. The company forecasts its backlog to end this year at $160 million to $165 million. This is a sign of the strong demand for the company's solutions. Omnicell defines its backlog as purchase orders from its customers which will be installed within one year. We also like the fact that 35% of orders are from new customers.Here's how Omnicell stacks up against its competitors.Source: Yahoo! FinanceAs you can see, Omnicell stacks up pretty well with its competition. It has the highest gross margin and cleanest balance sheet. Considering that earnings are forecast to grow the fastest among the four, Omnicell looks to be the best pick in the sector. We could also see Omnicell being a takeover candidate by either CareFusion, AmerisourceBergen or McKesson. The company also has a history of beating earnings, having beat EPS by at least 8% in each of the last three quarters. Based on this and its accelerating level of expansion, EPS could easily come in at $1.25 versus the consensus estimate of $1.17.Part of what helps drives this earnings beat is Omnicell's entry into the non-acute care market. Last year it acquired MedPak Holdings. MedPak utilizes consumable medication punch cards and specialized machines that allow pharmacies to automatically or semi-automatically assemble, fill and seal drugs into medication punch cards representing a weekly or monthly supply of a patient's medication. This is a cost-effective customized package personalized for each patient with their medication and dosage.Bottom lineOn the company's earnings call, CEO Randall Lipp highlighted some of the things we like about Omnicell (emphasis ours):""Our results continue to be driven by our 3-leg strategy. Those 3 legs are market expansion through the delivery of differentiated, innovative solutions; expansion into new markets, primarily outside the U.S.; and expansion through strategic partnerships and acquisition of new technologies. We continue to make investments in all 3 of these areas. We believe these investments are paying off by distinguishing Omnicell with our customers and helped drive the great results we had this quarter.""""International adoption of multi-med adherence packaging, which is more advanced than in the U.S., continues to grow by double digits, with approximately 550,000 patients receiving medication -- medications through our adherence packages every week in Europe. We continue to believe this is an excellent growth market.""""We know that when patients get the right medications and take it at the right time, the outcomes of healthcare improve. Omnicell is aligned with the long-term trends of the healthcare market to manage the health of patients across the continuum of care. Our customers want and need sophisticated solutions to manage medications wherever their patients are, and we have the resources to be the company that provides those solutions. Our solutions help our customers improve clinical outcomes, maintain regulatory compliance, and of course, save money, all critical measures our customers have in the evolving landscape of healthcare reform, which is -- which makes Omnicell uniquely positioned for continued success.""In the Q&A, when CEO Randall Lipp was asked about McKesson exiting the hospital medication management business, his response was:""Well the McKesson business, we believe is about somewhere less than 10% of the installed base. We assume somewhere around 10% of the market revenue, but McKesson has not disclosed the revenue numbers publicly. So we don't have precise information there. Our products compete very well against the AcuDose product, which is McKesson's competing product to our cabinet-based system. And our method of handling medications competes very well against the carousel method with a centralized robot that McKesson uses. We believe our products have been competing well against theirs for quite some time, as well as all the competitors in the marketplace and it really doesn't matter who owns them, they're being sold to Francisco Partners. We still believe that we're going to compete very effectively.""Overall, Omnicell is a great play in a rapid growth industry. We see plenty of growth opportunities ahead for the company and we expect the company to be active on the M&A front. The company just got a $75 million revolver that gives it flexibility to make acquisitions. Investors should also consider Omnicell as a potential takeover target. Either way, shares should be trading higher over the next 12 to 18 months, with a target of $30, or 30% upside from today's prices.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

OMCL operates with a three-leg strategy, which includes: expansion into new markets, clearly differentiated products, and targeted acquisition of new technology. The breadth of products and strategic planning has allowed OMCL to have approximately 44% penetration in the automation market. The company has fared relatively well over the last year, outpacing the S&P by 15% YTD. Starting from $20.79 in August 2013, the company peaked at $30.33 in early 2014. The share price has been turbulent since its peak, but the stock continues to perform well against the market. However, the recent pull back in July, brought upon by management unloading shares, presents an attractive entry point for upcoming earnings on July 31. In the short-term, guidance remains a very attainable goal with a high volume of G4 replacements and a hefty backlog of products. Long-term catalysts revolve around an expanding user base and industry trends, such as an increasing preference for automated technology. With earnings on Thursday (7/31), OMCL is well positioned to beat investor expectations and continue on its rally for the remainder of 2014.1-Year Stock Performance(Source: Stockcharts.com)Company OverviewOmnicell, Inc. is a leading provider of both automation and business information solutions to streamline the administration of medication and management of medical supplies. These healthcare equipment solutions allow facilities to acquire, manage and administer medication and medical supplies to enhance patient safety. They also effectively reduce potential errors, operating costs, while simultaneously improving workflow and operational efficiency. OMCL has modest penetration in the industry with products in over 2,800 hospitals across the United States and 6,000 worldwide. The company's primary focus has been to reduce the risk attributed to human factors, such as erroneous medicinal administration and patient care. An estimated 1.5 million of these errors occur each year, leaving ample room for improvement. OMCL's systems address these very issues, aligning the company's goal with those of the stakeholders.OMCL's business operations consist of two distinct segments: Acute Care and Non-Acute Care.Acute CareAcute care solutions are software-based medication control and tracking algorithms that provide healthcare providers with safety controls. It also improves logistical efficiency within hospitals by providing medication bar codes for medicine to ensure verification at each point of the administration process, from entry to eventual treatment. This streamlined inventory management system reduces inefficiencies in the hospital and decreases tracking time attributed to traditional logistics. These solutions also benefit supply chain management by ensuring ample stocks medical supplies and optimizing reimbursement.Non-Acute CareNon-acute care is comprised of products that are sold outside of hospitals under the brand names of Omnicell and MTS. MTS products consist of medication packaging, which can range from semi-automated packaging systems to fully automatic robotic systems. The manufactured blister cards allow for accurate and convenient access to medicine for patients. Omnicell branded dispensing systems are then used by non-acute care facilities to monitor the use of medications. Both products synergize incredibly well and fill a niche in the market of non-acute care.(Blister Pack Example)Industry Overview and Macroeconomic TrendsThe healthcare and acute care market in the United States has experienced gradual growth over the last few years. The acute care market, specifically, consists of 6,400 hospitals and facilities with a cumulative capacity of 957,000 acute care beds. Paper-based manual tracking systems have been the industry norm until recent years; however, electronic alternatives have gained a foothold due to their affordability and efficiency.Global Pharmacy Automation Market:The global market for pharmacy automation is currently valued at $3 billion with extremely strong growth prospects. BCCResearch, a publisher of technology market research reports, released a recent article estimating this market to expand to over $4.9 billion by 2018, utilizing an 8.8% CAGR over 5 years. Automated medication dispensing systems comprised 48.9% of the market with a value of $2.3 billion. By 2018, it is estimated that automated systems will represent 73% of the global market with a 6.7% CAGR over the 5-year timeframe.The majority of these systems are highly penetrated in hospitals with more than 400 beds, but small and mid-size establishments are beginning to increase investment into automation. Historically high technology prices and low budgets have stymied the adoption of automation. However, decreasing prices in acute care have allowed some headroom for gradual purchases by smaller firms.Geographically, North America possesses the lion's share of the market from stringent domestic regulations in healthcare. Emerging markets are just beginning to move toward automation. While it is true that trend has yet to pick up, we can expect international customers to grow at the fastest rate because of increased awareness and investment in health care infrastructure.Efficiency and Cost-Reduction Driven by Healthcare Reform:(Triple Tree)While less relevant than the pharmaceutical automation industry, general trends in healthcare continue to have an effect on the demand of OMCL's product offerings. Healthcare providers have continued to face major scrutiny about rising prices throughout the market. Prescription drug prices, for example, have risen over the last 7 years, averaging mid-3 figure growth. This trend has been driven by an increasing demand for healthcare coupled with a shortage of professionals, elevated labor costs and healthcare reform. The Affordable Care Act has aimed make healthcare more accessible, but it can also limit the revenue growth within the sector. Hospitals must maintain a high degree of quality care, which can depreciate operating margins unless the firm compensates with bottom line improvement. Thus, OMCL's ""lean teams"" work in conjunction with hospitals to engage management and shareholders in cutting costs. Despite cost pressure, from 2010 until now, the market share of healthcare IT has still enjoyed significant growth. The graph above shows that sector has nearly doubled over the last 5 years. Naturally, the increase in overall healthcare demand and market size benefits OMCL because the companies have more free cash to invest in automation.CatalystsG4 replacement:The G4 Unity platform continues to be an integral factor in OMCL's annual topline growth. OMCL's G3 platform for improving workflow and management has seen prevalent use in the healthcare space since its inception. 3 years ago, the software solution was updated to the G4 platform. The first year of the G4 was relatively slow in regards to both backlogs and realized sales, but the recent trend in healthcare has significantly boosted demand. Since the launch in 2011, over 1,000 clients have ordered G4. In regards to current G3 users, about 41% have made the upgrade to G4. The initial low repurchase rate may be due to the short-term headwind generated by the Affordable Care Act, but institutions have begun to open up toward automation and more efficient business operations. It is estimated that by the end of 2014, almost 60% of old users will have converted to the G4 platform. The optimistic 19% increase would encompass thousands of machines that would require upgrades. Each update is ""installed quite easily"", so turnover and purchases can be expected to be very high. Not only this present a substantial boost in short-term revenue, but it also sets OMCL up for future business. Considering the aforementioned macroeconomic trends, this year may prove to be the most successful year for the unity platform because of an inherent increase in investment and focus on efficiency.Differentiated Product Offerings Balance Revenue Streams:It is true that non-acute products may appear to be driving a large portion of OMCL's growth, but it is not solely propped up by one high-growth offering. OMCL has historically operated with a well-diversified product portfolio that circumvents revenue cannibalization and disperses potential risk. For the past quarter, OMCL's cash cow has been the non-acute segment; however, the performance for the company's other product offerings has also remained consistently strong. Automation and Analytics, as one of OMCL's original core brands, continues to maintain a strong pipeline and growth. The acquisitions of MTS 2 years ago has also broadened OMCL's client base and created yet another product venue to realize revenue. YoY, the segment has enjoyed over 10% growth. Medication adherence products comprise 20% of total revenues and possess a huge user-base. In the UK, OMCL already caters toward 600,000 patients, a number that excludes OMCL's acquisition of SurgiChem.The company's products tend to fill a broad range of functions and are complimentary to one another. Automated non-acute equipment, for example, caters toward all hospitals, regardless of size. Automated machinery can range from fairly inexpensive entry-level machinery to multi-million dollar fully automated facilities. Within hospitals, OMCL's software and hardware solutions synergize especially well. As a result, clients that purchase from OMCL also tend to not be limited to one specific offering, creating a broader demand for all of the company's products. Ample diversification through acquisitions and development has created a well-balanced revenue stream. As a result, OMCL's business segments display strong growth prospects, while simultaneously assuring investors that growth is not highly reliant on a single segment of product.International Growth Potential:OMCL is currently experiencing double-digit growth in their medication adherence usage within Europe. OMCL's CFO, Robin Seim, has alluded to growth between 10% and 20%, but judging by the relative performance throughout the year, I would not be surprised if it was on the higher end. While Europe is already highly penetrated, emerging markets yield a prime opportunity for OMCL to gain market share abroad. China, for example, is still in the works of developing a stronger more efficient health care system. Volumetrically, the country has an enormous consumer-base that has largely been untapped by foreign firms. The general trend has shown a gradual increase in percentage of GDP as healthcare spending. Medical instrument market sales are also expected to double from $20 billion in 2011 to $50 billion by 2015. In the first quarter, OMCL's international business was approximately $34 million across its 2 segments. From the earnings call, it is evident that the company is beginning to place a larger focus on emerging markets. OMCL does not have a hospital that is house-wide yet, but the company has already constructed 20 installations within mainland China. The firm has maintained high levels of investment and even opened a sales and training facility in the region. Since 2011, OMCL has been directly involved with its partnership with China Resources Beijing Pharmaceutical Company (CRPham). CRPharm is a leading wholesaler, distributor, and retail chain owner with sales upwards of 30 billion RMB. As a member of the Chinese Resources Group, the firm has strong logistical connections within China. Not much news has emerged from the partnership as of yet, but it displays how OMCL already has a foot in the door for expansion into Asia. It may be quite some time before local healthcare investment in China allows for purchases of automation technology or software solutions, but decreasing technology costs and a broad array of products allows OMCL to be incredibly well-positioned to utilize China in the future.Strong Financials and Attainable Guidance:The company is currently debt-free with $107.6 mm in cash and short term investments. Even with a share repurchase of 7 million, cash still grew by $3 million against last year. The firm is still eligible to repurchase up to another $25 million stock. Revenues from first quarter were $101.8 million, which beat street estimates by approximately $2 million. Compared to Q1 2013, there was a 17% increase in revenue. Tax rates have not fluctuated and are expected to maintain 38% for FY 2014. Management has also stated that they plan to maintain a 15% operating margin going forward. 2014 product bookings remain between $340 million to $350 million for 2014, 5% higher than that of 2013. Management expects annualized revenue to $415 million and $425 million, an increase of 9% to 12% from 2013. The Q1 2014 performance showed good signs for OMCL in the upcoming year. Unrealized revenue from the SurgiChem acquisition and G4 operations will be integral in beating street estimates. However, positive historical performance in OMCL's business segments and their growth from acquisitions positions them to beat earnings. An 10.0x exit multiple is relatively low compared to the industry, but still provides OMCL with a strong valuation and upside.ValuationMy product revenue assumptions were quite conservative given the amount of unrealized product in backlogs and increased MTS sales abroad. Service and other revenues reflected a 12% increase primarily due to the servicing of new G4 platforms for clients in the upcoming year. The number dwindles off in the years after. However, it should be noted that 2016, 2017 and 2018 estimates may be severely understated given the fact that OMCL is witnessing a large increase in clientele. If new platforms are released, then we can expect more spikes in service revenue. COGs, R&D and Capex remained relatively flat due to historical data and consistent business plan. Tax rates are pegged at 38% with the information given from the last earnings transcript. I used 10.0x EV/EBITDA, which is low compared to other street sources, such as CapIQ (15.6x). Despite a conservative multiple, the price target remains positive at $29.15 with a 7.1% upside.Potential Risks· Competition remains on the largest risks within the industry. Products can be readily replaced and if OMCL does not remain innovative, they will struggle to remain relevant.· Healthcare reform has been a touchy subject within the industry and further changes to legislation can be detrimental for OMCL's clientele and financial performance.· Industry saturation may prove to be problematic because of the cyclical nature of automation products. Once all hospitals equipment is automated, revenue streams will rely on periodic hardware and software updates, requiring lengthy development processes.· Management unloading shares may cause downward pressure on priceFinal RemarksOMCL has performed well over the last few quarters and it remains well-positioned to continue this growth for the remainder of the year. It is true that there are indeed risks attributed to legislation, competition, and product revenues, but they present minor downside risk compared to the significant growth catalysts that are propping up top line growth y-o-y.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

4063444,101421,2017-04-19T13:48:54-04:00,Medication management technology company Omnicell has acquired InPharmics for an undisclosed sum.InPharmics has developed a software system that assists pharmacies in tracking medication usage at the patient level and remaining in compliance with new drug laws.The acquisition is the second one in six months and indicates an aggressive approach to expanding Omnicell's offerings to the medication dispensing supply chain.,"Quick TakeMedication supply automation company Omnicell (OMCL) has completed the acquisition of InPharmics for an undisclosed amount.InPharmics is the second acquisition in the last six months for Omnicell and represents another data point indicating an active acquisition strategy to bolster Omnicell’s medication management offerings.I hope to see positive results from the acquisition showing up in Omnicell’s financial results within the next nine to twelve months.Target CompanyMadison, Mississippi-based InPharmics was founded in 2011 by CEO Bobby Parker to deliver medication usage analytics at the patient level.Over 150 hospital pharmacies use the web-based system, called DSCSATrack, to analyze medication usage across frequently disparate hospital information systems to reduce medication and associated labor costs.Since March 2016, all pharmacies have been required to be in compliance with the DSCSA, or Drug Supply Chain Security Act.The DSCSA requires that medication dispensers, i.e., pharmacies, track the provenance of most medications from the manufacturer throughout the supply chain into their pharmacies.The Act further requires pharmacies to be able to respond to any FDA information request within two days.FDA information requests are referred to as “T3” data:InPharmics’ solution is twofold: It ingests electronic data and also digitizes paper-based forms to create a single online and digitally searchable system for pharmacies to remain in compliance and access analytics to improve their operations.Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryNeither Omnicell nor InPharmics disclosed the acquisition price or terms of the deal. Omnicell management stated that the transaction is not material and won’t change its previously communicated 2017 guidance.Omnicell plans to use the InPharmics solution to ‘expand the capabilities’ of its Performance Center. The Performance Center provides a software and expert services solution to pharmacies to help them improve their medication management operations.As Nhat Ngo, Omnicell’s EVP Strategy and Business Development stated,The three facets of pharmacy medication management are:Omnicell’s acquisition of InPharmics continues to build on another acquisition, that of Ateb, announced in November 2016, for a purchase price of around $40.7 million in cash.In that deal, Ateb was acquired for its medication synchronization software system, called Time My Meds, to enable pharmacies to coordinate multiple prescription refills for a single day pickup for patients.This also facilitates a more efficient, appointment-based model of prescription refill processing as well as increased patient adherence leading to improved outcomes.Since the two acquisitions, Omnicell’s stock has rebounded to equal its 52-week high, reaching $40.35 after dropping as low as $31.20 in November 2016.Clearly, the market likes what it sees from management, even as the company’s 2016 financial performance disappointed with sharply reduced EBITDA on growing sales.Omnicell appears to be making a growth play via an active acquisition strategy to become a bigger player in the medication supply chain market where large companies like McKesson (MCK) play a major role.Since we know Omnicell paid a non-material amount for the InPharmics acquisition, it appears management is smartly taking advantage of opportunities in the market for proven technologies.I hope to see the results of this strategy bear fruit in the next nine to twelve months.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

972961,20568,2012-11-02T11:15:23-04:00,,"Earnings momentum for Omnicell Inc. (OMCL)  has jumped in the past seven days, since this provider of end-to-end  automation solutions released strong third-quarter results last week.  Shares of this Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) are up 10% since the announcement.  The company has now delivered positive earnings surprises for seven  consecutive quarters with an average beat of 61.7%.Strong Third QuarterOn October 25, Omnicell reported third-quarter adjusted earnings per  share of 22 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 13 cents by  69.2% and the year-ago earnings of 9 cents by 144.4%.Revenue (including the May 2012 acquisition of MTS Medication  Technologies) increased a robust 30.9% year over year to $84.3 million.  Product revenue, contributing 79.9% to total revenue, climbed 35.3% to  $67.4 million in the quarter, while the revenue from Services and Others  (contributing the rest) witnessed an upside of 15.8% to $16.9 million.Margin contraction over the last few quarters prompted the company to  implement a number of cost-saving measures. These strategies benefited  Omnicell in the reported quarter in the form of a 114 basis points (bps)  expansion of gross margin to 54.6%. Despite higher research and  development (up 8.5% to $5.5 million) and selling, general and  administrative  expenses (up 24.2% to $29.3 million), operating margin  during the quarter expanded a significant 586 bps to 13.3%.Omnicell has been taking a number of strategic steps to align its assets  while expanding its footprint worldwide. A three-pronged strategy  consists of domestic expansion, selective acquisitions and targeted  international expansion.The recent MTS acquisition marked Omnicell’s entry into the huge and  under-penetrated non-acute care market. In the third quarter, profit  generated from this segment sailed past the company’s projections.Moreover, several new contracts have recently enabled the company to  better compete in acute care settings. Given that the international  market is less than 1% penetrated, Omnicell is currently working on  expanding its international footprint, especially in the growing Chinese  and Middle East markets.Earnings Estimates on the RiseOver the past seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2012 has gained  20.5% to 47 cents per share, aided by upward revisions from all four  estimates. This represents year-over-year growth of about 46.1%.  Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 is up 14.3% to 72 cents  on increased revisions from 2 of 4 estimates. This indicates growth of  about 52.9% year over year.Attractive ValuationValuation of Omnicell looks attractive with respect to most valuation  metrics. The company is trading at a forward P/E of 31.19x, a 15.8%  discount to the peer group average of 36.86x.The price-to-book ratio of 1.6x is also substantially lower than the  peer group average of 3.9x. Similarly, the price-to-sales ratio of 1.7x  is at a 36.5% discount to the peer group average of 2.66x.Omnicell’s return on investment (NYSE:ROI) of 7.1% is at a slight discount to  the peer group average of 7.9%. This implies that the company reinvests  its earnings almost as efficiently as its peer group.Chart Reflects StrengthOmnicell’s price performance has been trending higher following the  release of its third quarter results. The price and consensus chart  shows that estimates for the next two years are on the rise with the  stock price moving right along. Moreover, the stock price remains below  the 2013 and 2014 earnings estimate lines, suggesting that the stock is  still undervalued.Omnicell develops and markets end-to-end automation solutions for the  medication-use process. These automation solutions enable healthcare  facilities to acquire, manage, dispense and deliver pharmaceuticals and  medical supplies, as well as enhance patient safety, reduce medication  errors, improve workflow and increase operational efficiency. The  company provides procurement and inventory management systems to more  than 1,600 hospitals, integrated delivery networks, and specialty  healthcare facilities, including nursing homes, outpatient surgery  centers, catheterization labs and clinics. With the MTS acquisition,  Omnicell currently reports under two operating segments: Acute Care and  Non-Acute Care. Omnicell has a market capitalization of $485.5 million.Read the full analyst report on OMCL (email registration required)"

Omnicell has posted impressive and steady growth over the past few years, both organically and through acquisitions. The company's market share in automation is north of 40%, per the Q3 conference call, and the late 2015 acquisition of Aesynt moved the company further into IV automation and improved its software offering. Long-term tailwinds in both pharmacy and acute care, along with increasing emphasis on medication adherence, should benefit Omnicell. The company itself is targeting 8-12% revenue growth annually, with operating margins increasing to 15-16% by the end of the year.The combination of top-line growth and operating leverage should drive profit gains, and if Omnicell can further entrench itself, it would become a tempting and accretive acquisition target. Even with the stock near all-time highs at $40, there's more upside ahead.The one near-term catch is that Omnicell is guiding for a rather weak (on a relative basis) Q1 report next month. The launch of a new dispensing cabinet in December is leading a shift in backlogged orders away from the legacy G4 cabinet to the new XT, causing near-term disruption that will impact the quarter. Management insists that the company will return to its growth profile beginning in Q2, and so far, the market appears willing to accept that explanation. But if Omnicell is right, it looks like there's more upside ahead.Near-Term ConcernsOmnicell shares have stalled a bit over the past 18 months:OMCL data by YChartsThat seems more a case of the market perhaps getting a bit ahead of itself in 2015 (shares had tripled in barely two years at that year's peak) than a reflection of real weakness in the business. That said, 2016 results were a bit disappointing, as was Q1 guidance.Full-year 2016 revenue did increase 43%, with adjusted EBITDA jumping almost 20% and adjusted EPS rising to $1.51 from $1.33 the year before. But much of the contribution came from the Aesynt acquisition, which closed in late 2015. Comparing to non-GAAP pro forma figures disclosed in an 8-K in March 2016, 2016's performance doesn't look quite as impressive. Pro forma sales grew 4%, below the company's 8-12% target. Gross margin compressed 80 bps; opex deleveraged 40 bps. Non-GAAP operating income actually declined year over year on a pro forma basis, with adjusted EPS down modestly from the $1.55 figure from 2015. Adjusted EBITDA did increase ~5%, with a 22 bps expansion in margins due to a spike in D&A.Omnicell doesn't exclude merger integration costs from its non-GAAP figures, however, and backing those out (~$10 million in 2016, per the Q4 conference call), the margin and profit numbers look a bit better. Pro forma EBIT would have increased about 6%, with a modest increase in operating margin. Adjusted EPS would have come in around $1.67, up 8% year over year.The sales figures still are a bit disappointing, but some of that comes from the XT transition, which, according to CEO Randall Lipps on the Q4 call, impacted revenue starting in December. That transition will impact Q1 as well, as the company broke out in its Q4 release:Source: Omnicell Q4 releaseFor the most part, the market has accepted Omnicell's explanations at fair value. OMCL initially plunged after the Q4 report, between the big revenue miss and what appeared to be hugely disappointing guidance for a 9%+ decline in adjusted EPS at the midpoint. But OMCL closed basically flat (-0.4%) and has since resumed its upward march.The near-term worry is if the market will be as forgiving if the timeline gets pushed out after the Q1 report, given reasonably long sales cycles for the XT to both existing and new customers. The story from Omnicell basically is that all will get back to normal after Q1; that and the combination of completed integration costs and post-merger synergies set the company up to generate $2+ in EPS in 2018. (Current consensus is $2.08.) If that's how the story plays out, OMCL almost certainly rises from current levels. If it doesn't, there may be a near-term buying opportunity, as the long-term case for Omnicell still seems reasonably strong.Long-Term OpportunityAs Omnicell built out its portfolio, it created exposure to a number of areas where hospital spending, in particular, should increase. Medication errors are estimated to cost as much as $21 billion a year [pdf]; Omnicell's dispensing cabinets limit those errors and provide both better care and potential labor cost savings. As noted, Omnicell has 40%+ market share in the U.S. and maintains the largest share in the UK as well, per the Q2 call. The late 2016 acquisition of Ateb gave Omnicell a larger foothold in medication adherence, another potentially growing area: 18 states have passed laws to improve adherence, according to the 10-K. Those adherence solutions, along with the company's software offering, have the opportunity to push Omnicell further into institutional and retail pharmacies. Even the IV automation business, a small part of the Aeysnt acquisition, has a $500 million TAM, according to management on the Q1 conference call.There's a nice combination in terms of OMCL's growth profile. Overall pharmaceutical demand should increase. An improved software offering creates potential multi-million dollar SaaS deals. Omnicell has the opportunity to move away from its legacy acute care base and target more non-acute and pharmaceutical customers. Similarly, a largely US-based company (85% of 2016 revenue) has room to expand internationally. Given a sub-20x multiple to 2018 EPS, it looks like the market isn't quite giving enough credit to the company's long-term profile. Again, the company's own targets imply steady double-digit EBIT growth, and with leverage, EPS growth would be even higher. If growth does accelerate post-Q1, thanks to XT sales, OMCL shares should gain.ValuationIt's not hard to see Omnicell being acquired if it hits or even nears those growth targets. The company long has been considered a takeover target, with McKesson (NYSE:MCK) considered a potential buyer. But Aesynt actually was created by a P-E firm in large part through the acquisition of MCK's automation business, so McKesson no longer is quite as obvious a purchaser. But Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) and other large players could be interested.CareFusion was acquired by Becton, Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) for 14x EBITDA, a multiple that on 2018 figures would imply a $60 takeout price for OMCL. That figure might be too optimistic on both fronts - CareFusion had dominant market share in automation and Omnicell still needs to hit 2018 targets - but a $50-55 target for OMCL seems reasonable should the company decide to sell in the next 12-18 months.Again, there are risks here, even beyond the possibility of Q1 earnings, leading to a short-term sell-off. Aesynt looked reasonably cheap on an EBITDA basis, but Omnicell also paid triple what the P-E owners had paid for the two acquisitions. Short interest in OMCL has spiked of late, a good news/bad news situation heading into Q1 and Q2. Omnicell hasn't really proven itself in some of the newly targeted areas; building out the international business will take time and investment, and the software efforts are relatively new.But for the most part, those are relatively standard growth stock risks, and as far as growth stocks go, OMCL has a quality story. The valuation is not at all oppressive if business re-accelerates as XT sales increase. The growth runway looks like it has years left across different channels and geographies. Omnicell doesn't have to be perfect to drive upside in OMCL stock. If management is right, or close, then OMCL simply is too cheap.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

151768,20568,2009-07-28T06:43:32-04:00,,"Omnicell, Inc. (OMCL) reported poor results for the second quarter of 2009. GAAP-diluted EPS was $0.03, compared to $0.08 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding stock-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP EPS was $0.10, compared to $0.17 in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue for the quarter was $52.6 million, a decline of roughly 17% year over year.  Product revenue declined roughly 21% year over year to approximately $42 million. We believe that the decline can be attributed to the present economic turbulence that has resulted in a lower number of medication and supply automation systems installed. Services and other revenue increased roughly 2% year over year to $10.6 million. Gross margin was roughly flat year over year at approximately 51.2%. Both research and development [R&D] and selling, general and administrative [SG&A] expenses increased as a percentage of total sales due to lower revenue. Higher operating expenses as a percentage of total sales led to a decline in operating and net margins, with both declining 460 basis points and 260 basis points to 2.5% and 1.7%, respectively. At the end of the quarter, the company had a cash balance of roughly $126.4 million with no debt. The working capital of the company stands strong at $176.7 million -- roughly 70% of fiscal 2008 revenue. Omnicell is likely to benefit from the U.S. Government's approval of more than $20 billion in spending on health-information technology. The majority of the spending will be felt between 2011 and 2015. Starting in 2011, physicians who use electronic records will be eligible for more than $40,000 in Medicare incentive payments.  Payments will be made over several years. Omnicell is a leading provider of systems and software solutions that develops end-to-end automation solutions for the medication-use process. Omnicell competes with larger companies, such as Pyxis, a division of Cardinal Health (NYSE:CAH); McKesson Automation, a division of McKesson Corporation (MCK); Cerner (CERN); AmerisourceBergen (ABC); and the Baxter Medical Delivery business of Baxter International (BAX).  In the near-term, we believe purchases of Omnicell products and services will be delayed as hospitals and nursing homes grapple with weak credit markets, rising expenses, higher unemployment and erosion of wealth. However, as the dust settles, we believe that the company will likely benefit in the long-term. As such, we continue to rate Omnicell a Hold.Disclosure: No position"
4065684,103087,2017-04-26T16:19:34-04:00,Only end-to-end medical automation equipment and systems.The company experiences 18.7% historical growth in revenue.Growing industry; expected CAGR around 15% per annum until 2021.,"Omnicell (NASDAQ:OMCL) is currently a very underestimated stock in terms of long-term growth potential. The company is currently not best-in-class in terms of fundamentals, but its expansion strategy is. While fundamentals are meeting industry averages, Omnicell's growth strategy includes horizontal integration to capture more market share. This is a proprietary strategy in medical adherence automation.The healthcare automation industry currently has high competition, but Omnicell has the capability of rising to the top. This is because of recent acquisitions in the 2016 fiscal year. Both Ateb and Aesynt were acquired, giving Omnicell the absolute competitive advantage of providing the only complete medication automation system on the market. By combining all aspects together under a single system, healthcare facilities can reduce costs and improve efficiency. Omnicell offers systems that assist with tasks such as making medications to dispensing them, with different operations that can adapt to meet customers' needs whether it be at a hospital or for in-home care.Part of Omnicell's product structure includes systems for its equipment. This is where Omnicell's competitive advantage really shines. The systems would integrate each working piece of the automation process to allow smooth and accurate transitions between machines, as well as unparalleled inventory management. Other systems on the market need to be integrated into current systems, which requires training and significant implementation costs.Part of the entire system being sold together includes a significant revenue boost from an average of three to four times the cost of machinery to customers, but increased margins. I will touch on this in a minute.Omnicell should become extremely profitable soon, as it focuses on improving operating costs. That is a key reason for all its recent acquisitions. EBITA margins trend upwards on years after acquisitions at a rate around 1-2%. Prior acquisitions were not as large in scale, so a lower-cost model has to be accepted when valuing Omnicell. Estimates suggest a 5% increase in operating profit margin. The margins getting larger will bring OMCL to the top of its competitors in the market as well.In the prior three years, Omnicell's EBITA margin was beating the industry average at 14.33%. Again, this is without reaping the benefits of its most recent acquisitions. EBITA growth last year was roughly 12%, which matches the industry average, even with significantly skewed financials including significant SG&A accounts for expanding the marketing team. That expense will be justified as it enters India, Europe and South America by the end of 2018, and its revenue growth continues at a compounded double-digit rate. When these cognitive functions start fluently working together, OMCL will be the front runner of the competition in the market and in hospitals, leaving others in a race to match it.Estimates suggest 8-12% growth in 2017, but I believe this is low with its product scaling, backlog growth and plans to enter three new markets. This is where I believe investors can capitalize. If we look at past data for future projections guidance, the company historically grows revenue at an annual rate of 18.7%, which will not slow down. Last year alone, Omnicell grew at 47%. Analysts suggest a 15.9% CAGR in the IT healthcare sector until 2021. The corporate guidance is tapering off its growth, but that is too soon, and we can continue to expect double-digit growth for at least four years.On top of the favorable sector outlook, Omnicell has been growing its backlog sales significantly as of last year, 47% in fact, while maintaining a 30% conversion ratio. If it were to maintain the conversion rate alone, Omnicell would beat its 2017 revenue growth projections.Overall, the company offers best-in-class products, followed by a solid business model that will allow it to capture a greater market share. It is also going to be best in class for financial ratios that competitors will not be able to match. Based on its potential to grow individually, as well as the macroeconomic outlook for the sector, it is an absolute must to add Omnicell to your portfolio."

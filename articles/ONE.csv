We were first introduced to OneSmart by a friend who told us the service was very popular in China, and after we did some due diligence, we decided to invest.Our research shows OneSmart has a great business model, a long growth runway, and trades at a very reasonable valuation. We believe recent headwinds like weak margins and lower growth guidance should be resolved within the next few years, allowing OneSmart to grow its valuation substantially.OneSmart is a Chinese tuition center company that provides premium K12 after school tutoring for students in China. It provides 3 main services - OneSmart VIP business, HappyMath (primarily young children mathematics training services) and FasTrack English (young children English training services).Source: OneSmart presentationIts well-known brand and the great results it has helped students to achieve (93% university admission rate) mean that it can charge premium prices for its services. Even with the high and rising prices, students are still flocking to its learning centers - as can be seen by fast-growing enrollment numbers.Source: OneSmart presentationWe believe OneSmart has more potential than investors are giving it credit for. With just 2.4% of the premium education market, OneSmart believes there’s a long growth runway ahead for its business.Source: OneSmart presentationThe market, by the way, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15% over the next few years, from 146bil RMB in 2019 to 196bil RMB in 2022, driven by increasing consumer spending and increasing competitiveness in the education system.Source: OneSmart presentationOver the last two years, it has grown its number of centers at a 49% CAGR. While management does plan to slow down growth in 2020 by opening only 50 centers, this is just a rest break and it anticipates growth of 30-40% will return in 2021 and beyond.The reason for slowing down growth temporarily is to improve OneSmart's product offering and to give OneSmart time to build its online offering. While most investors would like management to pursue growth at all costs, we applaud management for making this difficult but more prudent choice.We believe the constant shift in strategy from growth to profitability is one reason why OneSmart is so undervalued. The company has switched its short-term goals back and forth 2 times over the past 6 years, and in 2019 it expanded quickly, depressing margins.Onesmart’s learning centers have much lower margins the less time they’re operational. In fact, many of these centers are loss-making in their first year of operations, as shown below. This occurs both within and outside the Shanghai market.Source: OneSmart presentationIn Q4 2019, more than half of OneSmart's learning centers were new, which depressed overall margins substantially. However, OneSmart expects margins to recover back into the double-digits as the company slows down the pace of new openings in 2020.In 2019, OneSmart also faced higher costs as it was forced to relocate some of its learning centers, open larger new centers, and lower floors with higher FICO standards. It also had to spend extra time and cost to hire or prepare teachers to be compliant with license requirements.In the long run, as new centers start making up a smaller portion of OneSmart's real estate and as the impact of one-time factors like regulation start to fade, margins should gradually improve. In fact, when the company was in its slow growth phase in 2017, margins were as high as 15%.OneSmart currently has an EV of around $970mil. This may seem like a lot if you look at 2019 OI of around $44mil, but if you ignore regulatory and other factors and apply a 10% margin, the EV/OI multiple would only be around 17x, an incredibly cheap multiple for such a fast-growing company.It is good to see that management, especially the CEO, owns nearly 40% of OneSmart shares, which shows they are heavily incentivized to grow shareholder value in the future (note that 20 shares = 1 ADS).Source: 20FWe should also mention that recently, the CEO donated 1.2% of his shares to employees that contribute to the company's success.Overall, OneSmart is an overlooked but undervalued education IPO. With fast growth and steadily rising margins, we believe OneSmart, like its peers TAL (TAL) and New Oriental (EDU), is on track to be a long-term compounder. Management is invested in creating shareholder value and the company at the moment trades at a very reasonable valuation for such a high growth company."

        The company has a good balance sheet, decent profit margins, and is valued cheaply compared to peers and the market as a whole.
        I rate the company as a BUY based on strong ROE figures and growing free cash flows boosted by ever-increasing unearned revenues.","I never really gave thought to how colleges and universities process their payments and manage their campus finances. It turns out, a lot of them outsource these activities to companies like Higher One Holdings Inc. (NYSE:ONE). The $110M company provides technology and payment services to the higher education industry: its products and services support in excess of 1,900 schools and about 13M current college and university students.Despite the impressive client base, Higher One's stock has lost almost half of its value in the past 52 weeks, a painful experience for its shareholders:(Source: Bloomberg)Note: the stock's price returns are compared to S&P 500 Index's performance and returns of Planet Payment, Inc., Green Dot Corporation, Calpian, Inc., and Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. I chose these companies because they operate in the same market and have similar market capitalizations.Higher One generates all its revenues in the US. The company has grown sales from less than $80M in fiscal 2009 to over $200M in 2014, implying a CAGR of over 10% in the five-year period. However, the diminishing marginal rate of growth is clearly vivid in the chart below:(Source: S&P Capital IQ)Higher One has a rather volatile cost structure compared to its peers: the company really loses a lot on the transition from the EBITDA to the EBIT to the Net Income margins. Readers may see the comps table below:(Source: Capital IQ)Notice how the company's average performance is not by any means reflected in its valuation:(Source: Capital IQ)I think that the company is extremely and unjustifiably undervalued compared to peers and the market as a whole. Nevertheless, in my DCF analysis I have used the current EBITDA multiple of 4.0x.DCF ValuationMy DCF valuation is based on the following three assumptions: (1) revenue CAGR for the next five years of 3.0%, (2) average EBITDA margin of 19.0% in 2015 - 2019, and (3) weighted-average cost of capital of 10.4% (incorporates a 15% cost of equity - my demand). The output of the model is given below:(Source: Capital IQ. Calculations by author)Note: the percentages indicate an upside move in the share price from the Friday's close of $2.32 required for the stock to reach the fair value range.Readers can see that the upside potential is quite substantial and promising. Note that the downside potential is limited given the fact that the current EBITDA multiple of ~4.0x is considerably low relative to the peer group and the market as a whole. Besides, this upside potential figures in the illustration above roughly show (one has to invert the numbers in the bottom chart) the effective margin of safety investors receive when they buy the stock at current price levels.OpinionI issue a BUY recommendation on the shares of Higher One Holdings Inc. with a target price range of $3.93 - $4.32, which implies a 70% - 90% upside opportunity in the next twelve months.There are two key fundamentals about this company that I like. First, I like the double-digit ROE figures the company has been showing for years. Secondly, I like the subscription-based model the company has with its unearned revenues reducing net working capital year-by-year and unlocking cash for shareholders. Basically, as the company grows, its funding requirement of current assets reduces as revenues grow. As a result, free cash flows get another boost from this component."
4327804,105040,2020-02-27T13:51:02-05:00,"OneSmart has adapted to the coronavirus and quickly moved students online, preventing revenue loss substantially.Q1 results were below our expectations but still show good progress, especially considering regulatory headwinds faced.Valuation is incredibly cheap for such a fast growing company.","With the coronavirus on everyone’s mind, OneSmart(ONE), which operates tuition centers in China, has been hit hard, with its stock price dropping 20% since the end of January. While OneSmart has been forced to close many of its centers, we believe the pessimism is overblown. It has been very successful in transitioning many of its students to its OneSmart Online Service and we believe there will overall be very little impact on both revenue and earnings from the coronavirus this year.At first glance, it may seem like OneSmart would be hit hard by the virus. After all, most shops, including OneSmart's tuition centers, would be closed down and what hasn't been closed down would likely have very little traffic.Source: google imagesHowever, OneSmart was actually very fortunate. Over the past quarters, they have been developing their OneSmart Online platform, and by the time the outbreak hit in late January, the platform was fully functional. The only issue was to convert students to the online platform.As it turns out, the conversion was actually very fast to accomplish. As of Feb 15, over 100k enrollments have been moved online, representing around 60% of OneSmart’s average monthly enrollments in Q1 2020. OneSmart expects to generate around $250-300mil in revenue from online courses in February, representing around 70% of its expected 2020 revenues.At the time of the call, management mentioned that they believe conversion should increase further in the next few weeks. Interestingly, management also mentioned that online students tend to take twice as many classes compared to offline students.The only real negative we see for OneSmart is that it will likely have higher rental costs as it will still need to pay rent for its closed tuition centers. However, even this impact will likely be muted due to rent concessions forced by authorities. It is also possible that demand for education could decline if schools remain closed for an extended period of time, but we doubt that the virus situation will remain serious for more than a few months with so many companies working on a cure.Source: Q4 2019 presentationThe quarter played out a bit below expectations. In Q4 of last year, management guided for 25-30% growth, with the slower growth being due to the opening of fewer centers so management can have time to improve operations. In Q1 2020, YOY revenue growth was only around 23.2%, which was below even the low range of management's guidance. Management blamed this on slower growth in the HappyMath segment, which only grew 7% YOY due to changes in Shanghai school admissions. However, growth should recover back to previous levels as students transition towards their newly offered programs. FasTrack English and OneSmart VIP both showed lower growth, which was expected as mentioned earlier.OneSmart further upped its premium game by launching Elite classes, a step above VIP classes. These classes generated cash sales of RMB 40mil within the first 2 months of launch. Its international education programs also did exceedingly well, growing 200% YOY. We believe this will help to cement OneSmart as the leader in Chinese premium education.Margins also took a hit due to a combination of higher rental costs to support regulation, higher staffing costs and R&D expenses to support the OneSmart Online platform, offset by savings in SG&A from lower growth. The combination of all these costs caused OneSmart's Q1 2020 net loss to double.Overall though, we wouldn't judge OneSmart by 1 quarter of results. In the long run, OneSmart still has an enormous growth runway and will generate substantial margins at scale, as demonstrated by the unit economics management discloses. Source: Q4 2019 presentationThe valuation of OneSmart still remains incredibly low, with OneSmart's market cap recently going below $800mil, representing around 11x 2020E earnings. Considering this is a company that is expected to grow 25-30% this year and even faster afterward, this really seems like a bargain at the current price, considering the high margins in the tuition industry.We continue to believe that over the long term, OneSmart shareholders will be rewarded, just like the shareholders of TAL and New Oriental were eventually rewarded. Meanwhile, we'll rest easy knowing that management also owns a large portion of the shares and is incentivized to maximize shareholder value.Overall, OneSmart will likely be able to operate fairly successfully as long as this coronavirus doesn’t occur for more than a couple of months. Chinese students will still want to continue to study, regardless of whether schools are operational. We continue to believe OneSmart is worth far below intrinsic value and should do really well over the coming years."

3052266,28921,2015-04-07T09:01:43-04:00,"Higher One is set to announce Q1 earnings on May 7. I believe that this may be a potential positive catalyst as the company breaks out business segment profitability data.The company enjoys an extremely strong strategic and competitive position, with over 1900 schools. Its client retention rate of 98% proves that the product is in high demand.New CEO Marc Sheinbaum is a compliance professional with top-level experience as the CEO of education finance at JPMorgan. He is the right person for the regulatory turnaround.The non-core payments and data analytics businesses made up 44% of Q4 revenues, up from only 24% in 2012. This shift away from OneAccounts reliance is expected to continue.Higher One's CASHNet competitor, TouchNet, was recently acquired at 6x forward sales. A similar valuation would value the larger CASHNet at 3x Higher One's current market value.","I wrote about Higher One (NYSE:ONE) a year ago, and the stock hasn't done much since. As is often the case with transitionary stories, it can take a few years to play out. At that time, I promised a follow-up article about the opportunity. A year later, following extensive research, which includes regular discussions with the company, I feel I have far more insight into the company's current competitive position. I like to plant my seeds slowly, and am patiently waiting for the opportune time to harvest the bounty. Since my article - which was published when the stock was trading around $3.75 - the stock has moved as high as the mid-$4s and as low as the low $2s. Right now, it sits just above its historical low, and I have tripled down on my once-small speculative position. The company is now a core holding of mine, and I think there is an opportunity here for those who can look beyond the obvious short-term headwinds a few years down the road. A major positive catalyst could be coming as early as May 7, when Higher One releases its Q1 earnings.Just last week, I spoke to Patrick Pearson, who is the Corporate Development and Investor Relations Director at Higher One. I was told that the company will be finally breaking out the numbers of the non-core, but quickly growing payments and analytics businesses in the Q1 report. These business segments comprised 44% of overall revenues in Q4 2014, versus 40% in Q4 2013 and only 24% in Q4 2012. So the contribution is increasingly important, as it is nearly half of the overall business right now on a net revenue basis. Given the decline in the legacy OneAccounts business as a result of regulatory uncertainty, the street will have its eyes focused on this critical data. With expectations so low, any sign of a green shoot can be a powerful positive catalyst towards a shift in investor sentiment. I will be paying meaningful attention to the profitability metrics and margin profile of the non-core businesses. It will be extremely bullish if the data is even remotely comparable, on an apples-to-apples basis, with the lucrative but declining OneAccounts business. The market has already priced the stock with a value that implies that these non-core businesses are virtually worthless.The major story here that attracted me to this stock in the first place is one of cash flow generation. Higher One generates a remarkable amount of cash from its operations. Even in a transitionary year, the company posted $60M in adjusted EBITDA in 2014, along with $30M in operating cash flow. With only $59M outstanding on its credit line after paying it down in February, the company is trading at about 3x EV/EBITDA. Based on the covenants in the revised loan agreement, Higher One must maintain EBITDA of $40M through the back half of this year and $45M through Q1 and Q2 on a TTM basis. According to my discussions with the company, I believe that the estimates are conservative. Furthermore, I see no reason to believe that even in a worst-case scenario, Higher One won't handily beat these numbers for the year. Despite all of the difficulties in an eventful and transitionary FY2014 - EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, revenues and net income all rose YOY.However, 2015 remains a challenging year for Higher One as it resets expectations in its core OneAccounts business to account for a changing regulatory environment. This includes the potential for lower user fee revenue and refund disbursements into OneAccounts. The picture is further clouded by a still pending potential fine from regulators, which I discussed in my previous article on the company. This has yet to be resolved a year later. However, the recent credit agreement amendment provides financing provisions for what would be a worst-case scenario fine of upto $70M. The company itself has already recorded an $8.75M liability reflected as a reduction in revenue for 2014 in relation to the matter. I'm not going to speculate on how much the fine will be, but am comfortable with the amended credit agreement, which has provisions that will cover even a worst-case scenario fine amount. This was a major risk factor with this company when I wrote about it a year ago. With the amendment out of the way, I can sleep well at night knowing that the fine - even in a worst-case scenario - won't lead to any credit agreement covenant breach. The money is there and available for the company to access, and given the strong cash flow, it can be repaid rather easily, even with some expected deterioration in the core business.On the Q4 call, the company indicated that it will consider voluntarily lowering or reducing certain user fees. Certainly, this will impact the financial performance going forward. Higher One is not worth $15-20 per share like it was trading for a few years ago, when it generated $53M in operating cash flow in 2012. But I maintain that the bottom is in. While the core business continues to trend downwards due to less refund dollars rolling into OneAccounts, this is somewhat offset by a 16% Q4 increase in non-refund dollars flowing in. A promising trend - and the company tells me that this can be attributed to the fact that more customers are using OneAccount as their primary account. The reason for this is a result of the solid technological investments that have created user-friendly feature enhancements, along with the overall strategy of offering account types that best suit college students. Simply put, the company has an excellent banking product that focuses on a market that no other financial institution really specializes in. It is the leader in a growing niche driven by ever-expanding student loan amounts.I always like investing in businesses that have a tailwind of a strong secular trend behind them. In this case, while the core business is under extreme regulatory scrutiny, it is not clear if the Department of Education will actually be able to regulate the company. Generally speaking, banking regulators regulate the financial services companies. I think it is naive to assume that the banks will simply roll over and allow themselves to be regulated by the Department of Education. Despite this, Higher One is taking the initiative upon itself to make the OneAccount and refund process more student-friendly by cutting and eliminating certain fees. With this move, expectations have been reset. Revenue guidance for 2015 was brought down well below expectations on the last call. With the new government focus on the Student Bill of Rights that was announced a few weeks ago, it looks like the overall volume of student loans is set to skyrocket. So while perhaps the Department of Education doesn't like some things about Higher One and its past marketing practices, this new mandate will only help grow the company's TAM. Additionally, the universities are being further pressured to continue to cut costs. Simply put, the company helps educational institutions save money through efficient refund administrative service, payments and best-in-class analytics. It has extremely strong and sticky relationships with 1900 schools, and boasts a 98% client retention rate even in the face of extreme negative publicity. It is able to do this because it is the best at what it does - and this will not change. As indicated on the Q4 call - specially trained sales teams are being deployed to leverage these relationships by cross-selling the non-core products. This will be a significant driver of growth going forward that nobody is talking about.A major part of this transitional story is the new CEO, Marc Sheinbaum. Since he came on board from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Sheinbaum has been quickly transforming the company's image. After all, he was the CEO of Auto and Education Finance at JPMorgan for over 6 years before taking on this new assignment. He is an industry expert at the top of the food chain. Prior to his leadership, the company was severely lacking in compliance and risk, and it is now extraordinarily strong in both. There are added costs, of course, and that was reflected in higher G&A in Q4. While some of this is likely front-loaded, it is safe to assume that gross margins in the core OneAccounts business will never be as high as they were a few years ago. But remember, the stock was $20 at that point, and the company was valued at $1B. Right now, it is only worth a little over a tenth of that. This is why the non-core business profitability metrics are so important. If the company can prove that it is quickly replacing lost profit with its payments and analytics businesses, then it will have to be re-rated. Right now, the street is solely focused on the fundamental decline of the refund disbursement business.This data release is highly anticipated. Considering the average exercise price of the outstanding stock options is way out of the money at over $8, the share price needs to increase considerably, and do so quickly before the options expire. It wouldn't make sense for Higher One to voluntarily break out segmented business data unless it projects the company in the best light possible. For this reason, I think that the Q1 report may prove to be a significant positive catalyst. Even as the company works through the significant challenges around reinventing itself, it will be posting a net income of $20M this year and next year, according to analyst estimates. This gives it a forward P/E of about 6, and provides the company with the strong cash flow that it needs to pay off the impending fine and service its modest credit facility while it shifts its strategy towards focusing on the growing payments and data analytics businesses that are in high demand.Finally, given the strong free cash flow being generated by the company, it makes for a sensible acquisition by a larger financial player. Last July, Heartland Payment Systems (HPY) bought TouchNet for $375M. This represented more than a 6x forward multiple on sales. TouchNet is a major competitor to Higher One's robust CASHNet payment processing product. At a 6x sales valuation, CASHNet alone is valued at three times the current market cap of the Higher One parent company. Overall, Higher One's CASHNet is a larger entity than TouchNet, based on net revenues. Again, I am anxious to see what the segmentized profitability of this unit is, once it is revealed in the upcoming Q1 report. Clearly, the extreme negative sentiment driven by the bad publicity surrounding the core OneAccounts business has caused investors to throw the proverbial baby out with the bath water. OneAccounts continues to be a cash-generating machine even in a state of major transition, and the other non-core businesses are growing rapidly and are expected to contribute a greater piece of the overall pie going forward.While there have been increases in G&A associated with strengthened compliance and risk management to appease regulators, Higher One management led by CEO Marc Sheinbaum appears to be making the right moves to right the ship. I am confident that beginning with the Q1 results to be released on May 7, investors will finally get an inside look on how the changes implemented are bearing fruit. Given how depressed the valuation is, it will only take a small green shoot to drive significant share price appreciation from the current historically low levels. For the first time, the company has put all its cards on the table. I like the focus on the product itself, and driving revenues through interchange revenue and less of a reliance on user fees. It seems like the street has forgotten that Higher One is the market leader in its niche and has deep-rooted and sticky relationships with 1900 schools. These institutions relied on it to service over 2M OneAccount holders and over 5M refund customers in 2014. This core business is not disappearing overnight, despite the media hype driven by contentious words from the Department of Education at hearings last year. There are many ways to win with Higher One, despite the market's assumption of a loss. I like the asymmetric risk-reward profile so much here that I have made Higher One a major holding of mine, with a 2-3 year outlook, where I expect it to trade back up to double digits."
4197061,101421,2018-08-09T12:45:04-04:00,"OneSmart has acquired local K-12 after-school education firm Tianjin Huaying Education.Tianjin  has shown significant student enrollment growth in recent periods.ONE continues to acquire local providers as part of its belief that it can create cost and marketing synergies.The financial results to-date haven't borne out that thesis, but more time is needed to make a final judgement.","OneSmart International Education (ONE) has announced it has acquired Tianjin Huaying Education for an undisclosed sum.Tianjin Huaying Education provides K-12 after-school education services in China.ONE continues to execute its roll-up strategy of acquiring local providers. The jury is still out on whether it can acquire and integrate cost-effectively to generate positive returns for investors.The Tianjin, China-based company was founded in 1986 to provide Chinese children with the traditionally taught in primary and secondary schools subjects, such as Chinese, English, and Mathematics, among others.The company operates in approximately 20 learning centers with about 70,000 annually enrolling students.According to a 2017 market research report by DBS Vickers Securities, the overall education spending market in China is projected to reach $474 billion by 2025.This represents a growth by a CAGR 6.7% during the period 2017 - 2015.The main drivers for this expected growth are the end of one-child policy (student number growth), rising family income to support increasing spending and an increasing willingness to pay for education.Major competitive vendors that provide educational services include:OneSmart didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and as a foreign filer didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance.From the firm’s interim financials (Unaudited) as of May 31, 2018, it had cash and equivalents of $236.1 million and total liabilities of $415.6 million.ONE has acquired Tianjin as part of a long-term strategy to roll-up K-12 after-school providers in cities outside of ONE’s primary market of Shanghai.As OneSmart CEO Steve Zhang stated in the deal announcement,Since its IPO in March, 2018 at $11.00 per ADS, ONE’s stock price has risen and fallen to remain virtually at the same level, as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)OneSmart is primarily an offline, after-school provider of K-12 services and management believes the greater China market for such services is fragmented and open for consolidation and service improvement.The firm operates in more than 42 cities in China and says it has ‘experienced extremely strong growth in markets outside Shanghai. Monthly average student enrollments increased by over 50%’ in 14 cities.So, while management continues to acquire local providers such as Tianjin and revenues are growing quickly, selling and marketing expenses are growing commensurately so income attributable to shareholders remains unchanged. Perhaps that explains the stock price currently little changed since the IPO.The task for ONE’s management is to cost-effectively acquire local providers and generate meaningful synergies on the administrative and marketing functions, otherwise, its roll-up strategy may be ineffective.The stock bears watching to see if management can turn these acquisitions into a more profitable company for investors."

Higher One's software facilitates these transfers and the processes associated with them. Roughly 35% of revenue comes from their software.Higher One's second line of business is related to the software they provide for the transmission of financial aid. A student can choose to get their financial aid money in an ACH transfer to their bank account or receive a check. A third option is to open a Higher One account, mainly for students that do not have bank accounts. Higher One partners with banks to provide students with a debit/ATM card so that they could access their financial aid money. Roughly 65% of revenue comes from the Higher One account.There are numerous ways Higher One earns money through their Higher One account. 45% of Higher One account revenue comes from interchange fees, which is the money merchants are charged when somebody uses their Higher One card to buy something. The other 55% of revenue is earned on fees charged to the student. These are typical fees banks charge such as a $2.50 fee for using the ATM of other banks rather than the ATMs provided by Higher One.Higher One's ProfitabilityHigher One has an extremely profitable business. Over the past few years Higher One has generated roughly $40 million a year in free cash flow excluding the construction costs of their headquarters, which is completed, and similar onetime costs. Higher One is on track to produce a similar amount of cash this year excluding a onetime $15 million payment to settle a lawsuit.So why does a company generating $40 million a year in cash trade at a market cap of less than $120 million. Higher One has two major overhangs:The Federal ReserveThe Federal Reserve has told Higher One that they will seek up to $35 million from Higher One for misstatements & omissions related to the marketing of the Higher One account. Higher One believes they will be responsible to pay the FDIC an equal amount so the potential liability is $70 million. Currently the two parties are in negotiations. Higher One has taken a charge of $8.75 million relating to this matter but it will likely cost them more.Higher One has ample free cash flow to cover a $70 million fine over time, even though the ultimate fine is unlikely to be that high. The issue is that Higher One has $16 million in cash and owes $94 million on their credit line. Paying a large fine would put Higher One in breach of one of their debt covenants. Additionally, they may need to borrow more money to cover the fine. Higher One's management says that their lenders want to work with them but want to know the amount of the fine first.I believe the fine by the Federal Reserve is the biggest risk to Higher One as their destiny is not in their own hands. With that said, the most likely outcome is that Higher One's lenders work with them. It does not make any sense for Higher One's lenders to force a default. Higher One is not highly levered and is producing a lot of cash. I believe Higher One will have close to $40 million in cash by year end.The Department of EducationThe Department of Education (DOE) is in the process of making new rules concerning student bank accounts. The earliest these rules will come into effect is July 2016 if they are passed by November 2015. This year's rule making session ended without a vote as banks don't believe the Department of Education has the right to govern them. They believe any rules should come from their regulators. It is possible that this fight ends up in court and it takes years, if ever, for the new rules to come into effect. The good news for Higher One is that for the next 2 years their ability to continue to generate cash is unlikely to be impeded.The original rule changes proposed by the DOE were draconian and would have been a tremendous hit for Higher One. The DOE proposed forcing banks to give students two free ATM withdrawals a month at other bank ATMs and curbing debit card fees. By the time the rule making session was over the DOE was open to allowing Higher One to charge ATM fees as long as they joined a larger ATM network. This would cost some money but ultimately is unlikely to hurt profitability much. Higher One may have to remove debit card fees but is seeking offsets to the debit card fees.The HyperboleThere is a lot of hyperbole directed at Higher One as an evil company that profits at the expense of students. In reality Higher One largely charges fees similar to their competitors. The two fees that critics are loudest about is the ATM fee & the debit card fee. Higher One charges $2.50 for using a competitor's ATM. Bank of America and Wells Fargo both charge $2.50, while Chase charges $2. Why this makes Higher One evil is beyond me.Higher One charges 50 cents when using the debit card. However, the fee can be avoided by simply selecting credit when the cashier asks ""debit or credit"". I used to use a Chase debit card. But once the Fed limited debit card interchange fees Chase started charging me $15 a month to use my debit card. Their intention was to make me switch to credit so they can collect a higher interchange fee from the merchant, so I switched. All the student needs to do is to say credit to avoid the 50 cent fee and Higher One will earn their money from the merchant instead. And 50 cents is a lot better than $15 a month.Cost CuttingHigher One should be able to cut at least $10 million in costs. General & administrative costs as a percent of revenue have risen from 21% a few years ago to 28% today. This is partially due to merger integration costs and partly due to increased professional fees in related to the outstanding regulatory issues. The merger integration should be completed some time in 2015. Eventually the regulatory issues will be settled as well. Higher One management says that all costs are on the table. I suspect there are many costs to cut as Higher One was once a hot ""payments"" company that built themselves a fancy headquarters. I see no reason G&A can't go back down to its historical level which would save over $15 million a year. This would likely more than offset any revenue hit from new rules by the DOE.ConclusionHigher One is not without risk. It is possible their lenders or the government will put them out of business. This outcome is unlikely as it does not make sense for lenders to bankrupt a company that is able to pay. Debt covenant waivers are granted all the time and that is the most likely outcome here as well. The government doesn't generally put real companies providing a real service out of business. Despite the hyperbole Higher One provides a needed service for a similar price to its competitors. If Higher One can get through this mess at their current earnings level the company can one day trade at $10 again and be a multi-bagger."

2523025,61863,2014-09-26T09:24:22-04:00,"The litigation against Higher One Holdings makes this company an easy target for a short attack.
        The company will most likely be in default of its credit facility agreement due the costs of the lawsuits.
        Higher One is not in danger of bankruptcy; in order to stay in business the company will need to amend its credit facility agreement or find a new lender.","As a current student, it is with great shame that I offer a bullish thesis on Higher One Holdings (NYSE:ONE). ONE describes itself as a ""technology-based refund disbursement, payment processing and data analytics services to higher education institutions and their students."" Basically, ONE serves as an electronic middleman for students receiving financial aid. Effectively, ONE's business model is to skim off the top from poor students.As of June 30, 2014, more than 800 campuses serving approximately 5.1 million students purchased our Refund Management service. In total, there are more than 1,900 campuses servicing nearly 13 million students contracted to use at least one of our services. As of June 30, 2014 we also serviced approximately 2.1 million OneAccounts.Lawsuits:ONE has faced several class action lawsuits for its predatory banking practices. Plaintiffs accused ONE of using deceptive marketing strategies and charging unnecessarily costly fees for using their services. As a result, ONE has had to pay hefty settlement fees, while not admitting liability.The most significant legal action against the company is in regards to possible violations of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The company apparently misled students to think that they could not opt out of the OneAccount option for financial aid refund. It was with the OneAccounts that ONE was able to skim a little bit extra for themselves. Total damages could range from $35 million to as high as $70 million. ONE recorded a liability of $8.75 million in June 30th, 2014. ONE believes that $8.75 million is the minimum that they'll have to pay.The underlying issue here is that the company's credit facility requires $50.0 million of EBITDA over the prior twelve month. If the company's EBITDA were under $50 million TTM, they would be in default of their credit agreement and the company would have to pay all amounts due. Also, a settlement with regulatory authorities in an amount exceeding $10.0 million could cause a default. This would cause drastically affect the company's liquidity and, unless they were to obtain additional financing, the company may not be able to maintain operations.So far everything sounds pretty bearish. The good news is that ONE's adjusted EBITDA is $52 million, $2 million higher than required. There's a chance that ONE will be able to squeak by this regulatory fiasco. But this data might be too discouraging for even the most risk-prone investor.Bull caseAfter reviewing the mountain of litigation facing Higher One, it seems almost inevitable that the company will default on its credit facility agreement. Nevertheless, ONE continues to expand.The number of students enrolled in Refund Management has increased from 4.8 million to 5.12 million. The number of OneAccounts has decreased slightly from 2.2 million to 2.1 million.ONE is making changes to its business in order to comply with new restrictions that impact for-profit companies in the education sector. It will have a tougher time maintaining its predatory lending practices. This will seriously hurt its ability to deliver high returns for its investors.But the core issue behind the bear case is that ONE will default on its credit facility. This is not to say that it will default on its loans and declare bankruptcy. The company will simply have to seek new lenders to raise capital to maintain its business operations.The short thesis is contingent upon ONE being unable to find a new creditor. Potential creditors will most likely factor in the issues of litigation into considering whether or not to establish a new credit facility with the company. They will also factor in the changes of its business operations and the growth of its client base. The new or even current lender will take into consideration the risks of the business and perhaps offer less favorable terms.Until ONE settles its litigation and secures a new or abridged credit facility agreement, I predict that the share price will continue to take a beating. For that reason it might be optimal to purchase one year call options or wait until the dust settles before placing bets on the future of ONE. Since the share price has taken another dive recently, there is also the possibility that company may try to shore up confidence by preemptively resolving the issue with its credit facility.I am sitting on the sidelines for now and looking for an opportunity to buy in. This could be a speculative buy at current prices but it might be more advantageous to wait for the price to drop even lower so as to maximize return."
2297995,28921,2014-07-03T03:40:55-04:00,Higher One might be the most hated company on Wall Street.Current share price implies a worst of the worst-case scenario.Cole Taylor Bank order not as bad as expected and provides hope.,"In my ongoing quest to find Wall Street's most hated companies, my research led me to Higher One (NYSE:ONE). It is a financial services and data analytics company that serves over 1900 universities and colleges. Higher One sold shares through an IPO at $12 per share in 2010. It priced below the original $15-$17 expected range, but quickly ran up to over $20 just 5 months later. It now trades in the mid-to-high $3 range which is a historic low. Stocks like these are right in my wheelhouse.So where did the wheels fall off the bus?While the shares have sold off consistently since 2011, the latest trauma to the company came a few days after otherwise well received Q1 earnings were reported. Although regulatory issues are nothing new for Higher One, they announced on May 13 that they face a potential penalty from the Feds that ""could reach levels that would cause an event of default under our Credit Facility."" This is the worst-case scenario, but I'm still not convinced that it will cripple the company as loan terms can be renegotiated and Higher One has strong growth and earnings.On July 1 an order was issued against Higher One partner Cole Taylor Bank. In it, Cole Taylor agreed that the bank will pay fines of just over $4 million relating to allegedly misleading and deceptive marketing practices. Higher One said that any potential action against the company ""remains an open matter."" The company also maintains that sweeping changes have been made to its account offerings in response to the regulatory issues.The opportunityHigher One by all accounts has a fantastic business model. In fact this year they enjoy projected growth of 11.6% off of $235.65M in estimated sales and should realize a net profit of over $30M which increases in FY2015 to over $34M. Not bad for a company that the market says is worth just over a paltry $170M as of July 2. Clearly the big concern is the ability to pay this fine - which may or may not materialize. The company has just over $11M in cash.When the order against Cole Taylor Bank was released on July 1, Higher One stock shot up over 6% under heavy volume, before pulling back in to the close as a result of S&P 600 rebalancing. Higher One was replaced by Veritiv (NYSE:VRTV) in the S&P 600 at the close of July 1 trading. Initial reaction however to the Cole Taylor Bank order by the Federal Reserve was positive and clearly exceeded expectations as being less harsh than previously anticipated. This is good news for Higher One.There is also a strong turnaround story at work here. Higher One has a new CEO named Marc Sheinbaum, who came over from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) where he was CEO of the auto and student loan business for six years. The recent earnings call was well received as the stock traded up immediately. By all accounts it looks like the company has a significant chance of a successful turnaround after underperforming for the past few years. I will dive more in to the numbers, the business model and turnaround potential in future articles but for now simply want to illustrate the compelling opportunity based on an excessive selloff caused by the threat of an arbitrary fine that may or may not happen.ConclusionI believe that the worst-case scenario is priced in to Higher One stock at these levels. The market has virtually priced in imminent default of the credit facility, when this is not a likely scenario. Following the Cole Taylor Bank order release on July 1, which exceeded expectations as being not as harsh as previously thought, I took a speculative long position here.I think that the chance of a quick move at to the high $6 post-earnings range is a real possibility in the short term once the perceived risk fades away. This represents a return of nearly 100%. With steady growth and a PE of about 5, I don't believe that this stock will get much cheaper. Unless you believe that this Fed fine will decimate the company, a long position offers a very compelling opportunity at these levels not considering any other information about the company.Turnaround potential is the wild cardFurthermore, depending on how well you believe the chances of a turnaround are, I think that the stock has a good chance of getting back over the IPO price in the medium term and make new highs in the $20s in the long term. This is a free ride and I'm still modeling the different opportunities. Of course it would be a best case scenario and I will lay out my arguments, including an acquisition theory, in a follow up article as I continue my research in to Higher One.Disclosure: The author is long ONE.

2124913,63813,2014-04-03T15:07:46-04:00,"Higher One has the services to corner the entire university payment processing market.Litigation costs combined with a working capital deficit have backed Higher One into a liquidity corner, severely depressing earnings.With the right company to take this one over, on the other side of litigation lies growth at the bargain price of $6.93 per share.","Higher One Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ONE) is quite the unique gem. They have a broad offering of services, a large number of captive customers (university students), and virtually no directly comparable competition. So what's keeping them down?By nearly all ratio analysis and valuations, Higher One Holdings, Inc. had an abysmal year in 2013.I could go on all day, and it's easy to understand why the stock price for ONE has dropped 22% over the last year. So is this small-cap company worth a look from a big-time company looking for someone to buy? If you have the resources to stomach the blemishes, I believe so.Business ModelUntil recently, universities resorted to highly inefficient payment processing methods involving paper, snail-mail, and lots of manual, human-error-prone work; Higher One offers a 21st century alternative.Payment processing is the industry every big player wants to be in. Amazon, Apple, Starbucks, Intuit -- you name it, they're trying to control the flow of cash. But while everyone else is focusing on becoming the payment processor for the masses, Higher One has found itself a niche in one of the industries that normally fights technological innovations. Everything from FAFSA distributions to tuition refunds, payments, payroll, even alumni donations, event tickets, and school stores have to pass through Higher One who collects fees along the way. And then they charge the university a service fee for the privilege.But it doesn't stop there. Higher One offers financial education for students, analytics to predict which students will drop out or graduate, and even provide advice for advisors on how to help the students at risk reach their goal of graduation. Higher One is more than a payment processor for universities -- they are the complete package.So where are the earnings?In 2013, litigation settlement costs ate up 7% of Higher One's revenue, combined with rising SG&A, which now takes up nearly 28% of revenue, there is little left for the stockholders.What about the cash flow?Cash flow from operations is a healthy $47.5 million, despite coming down 11% from 2012 to 2013 due to a significant payment on deferred income taxes, and a surplus of piling up accounts receivable (receivables turnover dropped by 33%, showing poor collections).Cash flows from investment activities, on the other hand, is a bright-red $59.8 million in 2013, and $50 million in 2012 from the acquisition of companies who have expanded Higher One's services offerings to the broad list above. It remains to be seen as to whether or not these investments will pay off, but so far, it seems clear that the acquisitions aren't paying off as planned.Cash flow from financing activities, while seemingly innocent, paints an even scarier picture: Higher One took out $52 million in loans, paying back nearly 83% of it by the end of the year. A quick glance at the balance sheet shows why.LiquidityCash is only 2.7% of total assets, and working capital is in the red by $17.5 million; the vast majority (83%) of assets are non-current. Accrued expenses shot up 142% making one wonder if they are having some trouble paying off their liabilities. If Higher One doesn't get a handle on its receivables turnover and start getting cash in the door, it may find itself in hot water.What would it take to bring this company back to life?Simply put: cash and control.A cash infusion of at least $18 million would give Higher One the working capital it needs to leave the loans behind, reducing interest expense significantly. In 2013, interest expense jumped from $976,000 to $3,082,000.So what's the point?Higher One has a great business model and numerous acquired companies, which make it a very strategic purchase for a company wanting to take control of the niche university payment processing industry. This is a company with huge potential, which has backed itself into a corner, surrounded by liquidity issues, litigation problems, and out of control expenses.On its own, the outlook for Higher One looks dire, and I would advise individual investors to steer clear of this one. However, if someone with the capital and resources to restore liquidity and rein in operational control were considering it, $6.93 per share makes this company look like it's on clearance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2516905,24929,2014-09-25T05:00:00-04:00,"ONE is a broken business model that is under severe pressure on all sides.ONE’s equity is a zero under a number of scenarios -- several of which are not reflected in the current stock price but will likely play out over the near term.The stock has clearly been under pressure this year, but $160M of equity value still remains.ONE is a terminal short with a very attractive risk/ reward profile.","Business Overview & BackgroundHigher One (NYSE:ONE) provides student banking (61% of revenue), refund disbursement/ SSE (17% of revenue) and processing of tuition payments (22% of revenue). The Company is the largest provider of campus debit cards (operating under the OneAccount brand). ONE is not a bank but partners with financial institutions to offer deposit services. The Company's business is based on the following model: 1) provide colleges with the capability to electronically distribute financial aid money to students, collecting a fee per transmission, then 2) compel those students to sign up for a high fee-bearing debit card account. Thus, disbursement effectively serves as a mechanism to acquire new debit account business. The first could not exist without the second since all earnings likely come from the debit card business and 100% card customers come from disbursement. Junior colleges, community colleges and for-profit schools account for approximately 80% of the Company's business. ONE provides SSE services to 800 campuses and has 1,900 campuses using at least one of its services. The Company is required to have an ATM at every campus where it sells OneAccounts. With a network of 900 ATMs, it is just meeting this requirement. The Company cleverly stashes its one ATM per campus in an inconvenient location (e.g. the basements of a peripheral building) so students generate more out-of-network ATM fees.Investment ThesisONE management has admitted it will not be signing any new colleges up for SSE until there is clarity from the Department of Education regarding industry rules (more below). Two weeks ago it was reported that resolution on this matter was just pushed off until mid-2015, at earliest. Other than the obvious consequence of no SSE growth, the Company's OneAccount student debit cards growth will also be impaired since all new business for it comes from new SSE disbursement segment customers. ONE's problems are compounded by the fact that churn on its OneAccounts is likely over 25% (potentially higher since 65% of card holders are 2-year college students and do not keep the card after graduation). This is a dynamic that is not yet appreciated by the market.Meanwhile the Chicago Federal Reserve and FDIC are seeking restitution penalties of up to $70M from ONE. This would send the Company into bankruptcy. The Fed is probably more willing to take an aggressive approach now since in July, as part of a settlement, Cole Taylor Bank agreed to backstop $30M of ONE's penalty if it becomes insolvent. At the behest of regulators, ONE made a number of changes to its card fees last year but is still way off market relative to other student debit card providers. Over 50% of its fee revenue (outside network ATM fees) is likely getting cut, sending earnings sharply negative. This is very high margin business so it will not be able to offset the declines with cost cuts. In addition to card fees, ONE's whole model is under pressure from regulators that object to colleges getting paid to railroad students into affiliated debit card providers that charge high fees. The CFPB has indicated it is exploring the case as well. The Company is very close to tripping loan covenants ($50M LTM EBITDA test versus $52M of reported LTM EBITDA) and only has $18M of cash with limited availability on its line of credit.Catalysts & Key IssuesThere are a number of ways for shorts to win. Near-term catalysts include:· Insider selling pressure: The largest shareholder, VC group Lightyear Capital, began selling shares last week (287k unloaded). They were an original VC-backer and longtime supporter of the Company. The last time they sold was in early 2013. The likely ongoing unwinding of their position will pressure the stock.· Chicago Fed & FDIC Lawsuit: The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is seeking $35M in restitution payments for inappropriate marketing and fee disclosure practices including telling students they had to open an account with ONE in order to get their financial aid refund. The Fed is holding all the leverage in this case. In July, ONE's issuing bank at the time of the activity, settled with the Fed for a fine of $4.1M but more significantly agreed to assume up to $30M of ONE's settlement it could not pay. This not only reaffirms the amount the Fed is seeking but also enables the Fed to push ONE to insolvency and still get an award. Any settlement with the Fed would be matched by an equivalent penalty by the FDIC, bringing the exposure to $70M. ONE was responsible for the content of the marketing materials and fee disclosure so bears the majority of the culpability and likely associated liability. The Fed/ FDIC case does not include any potential incremental civil charges. Company has only made an $8.8M reserve which is coincidentally the maximum it could reserve without breaching a covenant. Curiously the Company still blatantly maintains these same marketing practices (simply search ""college debit card"" for examples).· Department of Education 2014 Negotiated Rule Making session: The Dept. of Ed. has regulatory authority over Title IV and as a consequent the disbursement practices of the financial aid funds it extends. The proposed new rules address just about every aspect of the Company's business: school-card provider affiliations, card marketing practices and card fees. Colleges are being targeted for steering students to vendors with which that school has a financial relationship. A curtailment of these practices would cut off the Company's customer acquisition spigot since all ONE's card customers come through its disbursement business. The Dept. of Ed. and US Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently delayed rendering a decision until after the November 1 deadline. Clarity on the matter is not anticipated to come until next year. (A complete chronological account of the Department's review and testimonies can be found here.) While the Company acknowledges it will not be adding any new schools due to this uncertainty, it has yet to address the customers that will be terminating or revising service terms as a result of the increased scrutiny. To placate the Dept. of Ed. during committee sessions, ONE claims it has been modifying its marketing practices. This is only lip service. During investor presentations, management somewhat boasts it has not materially changed its marketing practices. The previous college debit card link shows that in many cases ONE is still essentially forcing students to sign up for a debit card by tying them to disbursement and by linking them to campus IDs. A recent study ONE itself commissioned shows that 86% of incoming college students already have a checking or savings account when entering college. This only supports the case that the Company must be using coercive sales tactics or at best providing a service that is not needed.· The debit card fees charged on to its OneAccount card holders are the most significant revenue source in question. While competitors have all cut their fees in response to regulatory guidance, ONE has only made relatively modest concessions and is currently well above market. ONE is the only student debit card provider that still charges a POS PIN fee. Rather than modifying this fee, the Company posted a note on its website reminding users they could avoid the $0.50 per swipe charge by signing rather than select debit when making a POS transaction. This halfhearted attempt to appease critics was not missed by regulators. In August, Consumer Reports' advocacy group released a report providing a detailed evaluation of ONE's card services and stated ""most of the aggressive marketing tactics remain untouched… regulators should step in to protect students from campus banking arrangements that restrict choices and charge unfair fees."" The report went on to advocate that Congress ""should step-in to ban revenue-sharing and deceptive marketing practices and expand CFPB's authority.""· The Company's $0.50 per PIN swipe fee and $2.50 per transaction non-network ATM charge are almost certainly going to be reduced, if not, eliminated. These fees make up the majority of ONE's account segment revenue. This is very high margin business and accounts for 61% of the Company's total revenue. These fees are going to be cut whether by direct mandate next year from regulators or in the near term to avoid further scrutiny. If ONE were able to stem the decline in OneAccounts and cut half its fees (revenue per cardholder from $55 annually to $28), then its total revenue would take a $65M hit and EBITDA would fall to -$10M.· Decline in fundamentals: The disbursement will stagnate with no new business and the OneAccount side will suffer as all its leads come from the disbursement channel. This second order effect is not reflected in the stock price. However, the consequences of this were visible in Q2'14 when the number of accounts dropped 9% sequentially. The Company indicated this drop was a result of ""culling inactive card holders."" If this were the case then revenue per account would have increased. However, it actually dropped 6% Y/Y to a record low of $13.20 in the quarter. The ""organic growth"" the Company claims is actually from customers it converts from its CampusSolutions acquisition last year. The ongoing decline in Federal financial aid outlays and junior college and for-profit enrolment will also negatively impact ONE's volume and revenue. ONE is in a very precarious position given its high fixed cost structure - the erosion of its earnings and cash flow have just begun.· CFPB actions: Earlier this year the CFPB published a report specifically focused on campus banking and the Company's business. Then this August they launched an inquiry into financial products marketed to college and university students to determine ""whether the market is working for students and families."" These are pretty clear signals as to their intentions in the regulatory land grab. It is likely the CFPB has already contacted ONE. In April 2014, the Company noted it was contacted by an undisclosed agency and was ""considering the merits of voluntarily refunding certain fees previously assessed to account holders."" Such an action would obviously have detrimental financial implications for ONE. At the very least, the CFPB and GAO are putting pressure on the Dept. of Ed. to limit student debit card fees.· Revision to Higher Education Act: The chairman of the Senate education committee's current draft of the 2015 Higher Ed Act includes measures that bans revenue-sharing agreements, restricts campus debit card fees and limits how campus financial products can be marketed to students. It is apparent that the comfortable and opaque financial arrangement ONE has with colleges will soon be gone.· Loss of banking partner: Since ONE is not a chartered bank it must partner with banks in order to hold deposits for its OneAccounts. Following Cole Taylor's fine, you would have to think its existing bank providers, WEX Bank and Customers Bank, are seriously questioning the risk of doing business with ONE.Risks· The bull case for ONE is largely backward looking based on the LTM FCF yield. This obviously does not fully take into account the rapidly declining economics of the business.· Proponents believe ONE could sell its disbursement and payment processing segments to competitor Heartland (following Heartland's recent acquisitions in the space). The reality is the Company cannot exit this business since its debit card operations are 100% dependent upon it. If anything, Heartland's expansion is a negative as it shows competition from much larger (and non-conflicted) companies is intensifying."
211175,20145,2010-06-22T03:33:26-04:00,,"Bill Simpson wrote an analysis of Higher One Holdings (NYSE:ONE) to TradingIPOs subscribers on June 11. Higher One had planned to sell 14.25 million shares for $15 to $17 each, but instead sold 9 million shares for $12 each in its initial public offering, Thursday, June 17. The text of Mr. Simpson's original writeup follows:• • •Higher One Holdings plans on offering 16.3 million shares (assuming over-allotments are exercised) at a range of $15-$17. Insiders are selling a lot of stock in this deal, 12.5 million shares. Goldman is leading the deal, UBS, Piper, Raymond James, William Blair and JMP are co-managing. Post-ipo ONE will have 56 million shares outstanding for a market cap of $896 million on a pricing of $16. Ipo proceeds will be utilized to pay down debt and for general corporate purposes. Lightyear Capital will own 23% of ONE post-ipo.From the prospectus:The company deals in financial aid disbursement technology/services as well as student banking. Another technology ipo geared towards shifting a historical paper based process (financial aid checks) into an outsourced streamlined electronic process. In reality though, ONE is an on-campus banking system disguised as a student loan processing operation. Essentially ONE takes over the financial aid disbursement process from higher education institutions. Instead of issuing paper checks, ONE electronically deposits monies into student accounts.In addition, for students ONE offers an FDIC insured banking account complete with debit ATM cards and the usual banking services. This is actually the key to the business model, called OneAccounts.ONE links their disbursement payments electronically to students with their banking service (OneAccount) in an attempt to gain student accounts. This linkage is the key to ONE's revenues. Students receiving disbursements via ONE tend to open OneAccounts as the payments are electronically deposited into these checking accounts. Essentially a captive student 'audience'. ***ONE derives the bulk of their revenues from fees on their student OneAccount checking accounts. Fees generated include interchange fees from use of debit cards; ATM fees; non-sufficient fund fees and other assorted fees. College students as a demographic tend to run up more banking fees per capita than other demographics. ONE also offers payment transaction services allowing higher education institutions to utilize ONE's software themselves. Again, ONE charges fees for transaction over this software payment platform and in turn, again uses these transactions as a selling point for their student OneAccount banking accounts. Student banking revenues accounted for 80% of revenues for the first quarter of 2010, while revenue from the higher education institutions themselves accounted for less than 10% of revenue.**Pretty sneaky business model here. The banks for years continue to spend a lot of time and effort in order to gain college student financial accounts (banking/debit/credit etc). ONE sells their student loan outsourcing service on the cheap to higher education institutions (a loss leader), to gain banking access to students receiving financial aid. Those student accounts end up driving revenues, not the disbursement processing/outsourcing service. ONE is a quasi bank disguised as a student loan processor. This approach has enabled ONE to gain 1.2 million banking customers over the past five or so years. Note that ONE does not hold banking assets, they contract with Bancorp Bank (NASDAQ:TBBK) on that end. They gain the accounts for Bancorp via their processing service and then collect the fees generated from that account. Bancorp's compensation is the investment returns on the deposits. Essentially they serve as deposit assets on Bancorp's balance sheet that they can then lend against. ONE does not originate or manage student loans. They contract with higher education institutions to streamline/outsource the student loan disbursement process at that higher education campus, with the ultimate goal being to utilize this process to gain student banking customers. There were a few student loan originator ipos earlier in the previous decade including First Marblehead (NYSE:FMD)/Nelnet (NYSE:NNI). Each does loan processing, however their core business models have been to originate student loans and/or service or securitize those loans. Two different business models: ONE integrates the student loan process of specific higher education institutions as a driver for their student banking services, FMD/NNI originate and service and/or securitize student loans. As of 3/10 there were 402 campuses serving 2.7 million students that had purchased ONE's 'OneDisburse' outsource service and 293 campuses serving 2.2 million students that had contracted for one of more of ONE's software products. In addition ONE had 1.2 million banking accounts. No single campus accounts for more than 4% of revenues. To date ONE has penetrated 14% of potential higher education campuses, leaving plenty of room for potential growth.97% retention rate since 2003 among higher education clients. This is not surprising as ONE is a nice value proposition for the higher education clients. ONE takes the student loan disbursement process off of the client's hands for a relative pittance as the key for ONE is the banking access to students receiving financial aid. Acquisition - In 2009, ONE acquired higher education payment processing company CashNet for $27 million. Risk - The big risk here is the legislative interest in reducing banking related fees. We recently saw a pretty significant sell-off in MasterCard (NYSE:MA)/Visa (NYSE:V) on pending legislation that would create limits on debit card interchange fees. ONE uses Mastercard to process their OneAccount debit cards.Competition - ONE believes no other competitor offers the full range of services that ONE offers. Others that offer payment software products and services include Sallie Mae, Nelnet, and TouchNet. Financials$.50 per share in cash post-ipo, no debt. Revenues have increased nicely annually as ONE has grown student banking accounts.2nd quarter (6/30) is lowest revenue quarter annually. Fewer student loan disbursements are made in this quarter, resulting in less transaction fees generated from student banking accounts. 2009 - Numbers are pro-forma assuming a full year of Cashnet. Revenues of $92 million. Gross margins of 61%. Again, ONE is a quasi bank without the actual assets. Instead they make money off the transactions involving those assets/accounts without having the actual accounts on their books. Operating expense ratio of 38%, operating margins of 23%. Net margins of 15%. Earnings per share of $0.25.2010 - ONE had a monster first quarter of 2010. They continue to add new accounts as they add more higher ed institutions. Also, they tend to increase banking account penetration among student populations in existing higher ed clients. They've been doing a fantastic job of selling their products and banking accounts. Based on first quarter (and adjusting for 2nd quarter seasonality), total revenues should grow 40% to $155 million. Gross margins look to be about the same, however there should be a slight operating margin improvement in the back half of 2010. At 61% gross margins and 24% operating margins, net margins would be 16%. Earnings per share of $0.45. On a pricing of $15, ONE would trade 33 X's 2010 earnings.Conclusion - The PE looks a tad aggressive here for the current ipo climate. Factor in the potential reining in of interchange fees and on the surface it appears the range here will need to come in on pricing. However, ONE is trending as strongly as any ipo we've seen the past few years. The first quarter was, by far, the best in company history even if you fold out the revenues from their 11/09 acquisition. The key here is ONE's success in turning financial aid disbursements to students into banking accounts from those students. If this trend continues as it has the past two quarters, ONE could be putting up blowout revenue/earnings numbers in the back 1/2 of 2010 and into 2011. My estimates could turn out to be a bit low for 2010. Even if they are on par, it would mean ONE would be on track for another large EPS gain in 2010 as they continue to add banking accounts. This is a very good looking financial services ipo, coming public at a multiple that looks a bit pricey. Hopefully the market will agree and discount this one from $15-$17. As it is, I like this one in range mid-term plus and would be thrilled to be able to get it below range. Definite recommend in range."

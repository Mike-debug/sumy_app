4376974,35181,2020-09-30T07:36:52-04:00,YoY Q2 2020 revenue decreased by 2% due to reduced banking transactions and an acceleration of the company’s business transformation from product sales to SaaS.Recurring contract bookings are up by more than 50%. Some of that appears to be due to the company’s new e-Signature application.Investors dumped the stock in response to guidance withdrawal and admission of an accounting gaffe.The stock price is undervalued on a relative basis. This is a long-term buying opportunity.,"(Source: OneSpan)OneSpan Inc. (OSPN) combats identity fraud, primarily within the banking industry, where 60 of the top 100 global banks are using its products. The company is transforming from a hardware and perpetual licence software-based business model to cloud-delivered software services. But therein lies the problem for the most recent quarter. The pandemic is causing an acceleration of the business transformation which is blurring the financial picture for the company.On the surface, the performance appears to be pretty mediocre, with revenue decreasing by 2% YoY for Q2 2020. This is primarily the result of a faster-than-expected drop in hardware and perpetual license sales due to the pandemic. Of course, some of the lost product sales have migrated over to term license software or services. During the transition to Software-as-a-Service (SAAS), lower revenue is expected, along with margin compression, thus blurring the company’s performance.(Source: OneSpan)One encouraging factor is OneSpan’s diversification into adjacent markets, including electronic signatures, and verticals such as government insurance and digital healthcare. In particular, the company is making inroads with OneSpan Sign, the company’s electronic Signature application. For those readers not familiar with the business potential for electronic signatures, one only needs to have a look at DocuSign (DOCU), which would be a competitor in this area. DocuSign has been extremely successful with product portfolio and experienced 250% stock price appreciation in the last year alone, as opposed to OneSpan, whose share price has (only) grown by 50%. According to the company management, OneSpan Sign achieved a revenue growth of approximately 30% for the most recent quarter.Another encouraging factor is that OneSpan’s recurring contract bookings are up by more than 50% YoY. It should also be noted that the success of recurring contracts comes at the expense of perpetual licences and product sales.On the bearish front, OneSpan management indicated that it experienced a lower transaction volume from auto finance customers using its Secure Agreement Automation application. This is understandable given the economic environment.(Source: OneSpan)I should point out that auto sales have been improving through the summer and it is likely that there will be some financial improvement in the second half due to the recovering auto market. On the flip side, COVID-19 infections are on the rise and there are no new government subsidies in sight. As we head into the winter, there is significant danger to the economy which is already on the ropes.Another negative for OneSpan was the withdrawal of forward guidance for the rest of 2020. It was an action by company management that resulted in the stock price dropping overnight by ~40%.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)In making the announcement, the company management cited poor visibility, expressing concerns regarding its banking customers in the Q2 2020 earnings call:Another black mark against the company, and also a likely contributor to the falling stock price resulting from the announcement that there was an error in previous financial reports:Needless to say, investors were upset with this announcement, and the disappointment was reflected in the earnings call Q&A session, and a lawsuit, actually several lawsuits, popped up as a result of this gaffe. The accounting error, in all likelihood, was partially responsible for the large drop in share price after the earnings call.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 170+ stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward gross profits estimate, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how OneSpan stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward gross profits multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the accepted valuation. In this instance, OneSpan is positioned well below the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is undervalued on a relative basis relative to its peers.There are several risks that investors should consider before investing in OneSpan. First of all, I view the current stock market action to be reminiscent of the dot.com era, immediately prior to the crash starting in 2000. Technology stocks were performing well beyond what many analysts considered acceptable valuations. It wasn't long before the market turned into a disaster, and the same could happen here, although I believe that there is much more substance behind the internet companies than existed 20 years ago.OneSpan’s performance is very much tied to that of the major banks, and they have already come out with warnings of increased loan loss reserves and expectations of further bankruptcies in the quarters ahead. The longer the pandemic persists, the lack of government subsidies, and possibility of a long deep recession or even a depression could severely impact the fortunes of banks and such fortunes will be passed on to OneSpan.OneSpan is an industry leader in identity verification primarily within the global banking industry, with 60 of the top 100 global banks as customers.(Source: OneSpan)OneSpan’s YoY revenue decreased by 2% in the most recent quarter, primarily as a result of pandemic-driven reduction in hardware/perpetual software licence sales and transition to a SaaS business model. The business transformation has blurred the financial situation to some extent. The pandemic did not help as the depression in certain industries, such as the auto industry, led to declining bank transactions and hence declining revenue for OneSpan. The bright side is that the economy is recovering to some extent. Sales within the auto industry have been improving quite nicely as the summer progressed.Currently, OneSpan has a stock price that I consider to be undervalued, primarily due to the perceived mediocre performance in Q2, withdrawal of guidance for the remainder of the year, and the accounting gaffe. I believe that this is a good time to be bullish on this company. The economy is recovering, bank transactions are improving, and OneSpan’s e-Signature business is performing quite well, up 30% YoY. For these reasons, I am giving OneSpan a long-term Buy rating. You may have to be patient with this one."
4318173,103130,2020-01-21T17:37:27-05:00,"A look at OSPN's financial performance from Q3 2019 earnings report .Brief discussion on impact of exchange rates.I no longer recommend shorting OSPN due to general market trajectory, but do not recommend a long position either.","One year ago, I wrote an update article on OneSpan (OSPN) detailing why I believed investors should initiate a short position on the cyber security company. That article was a follow-up on my original thesis that OneSpan was plagued by anemic revenue growth, thanks to a slow shift to a SaaS business model. The update article then provided evidence of falling deferred revenue (an important indicator of demand in the SaaS domain), weak overall revenue growth, eroding license revenue margins, and negative operating cash flows – all of which contributed to my rationale for shorting OneSpan a year ago.Before diving into the analysis of OSPN's financials, we should see how my short position recommendation fared.Data by YChartsBased on price action alone, my short recommendation appears to be dramatically wrong. OneSpan's share price spiked roughly 60% just two months after my previous article, and now sits 55% higher than its share price back when I recommended the short position.I clearly was wrong, but a benchmark comparison to the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) provides better context for how OSPN performed among peers. Data by YChartsOneSpan anomalously outperformed the technology sector benchmark in the first half of 2019, but then balanced out its annual performance by underperforming (relative to XLK) for the last three quarters of 2019.According to this Zacks earnings article from February 2019, OneSpan was ""expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.07 per share in its [then] upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +40%."" The Zacks article also mentioned that revenues were ""expected to be $59.10 million, up 8.4% from the [then] year-ago quarter."" Apparently, OneSpan crushed its Q4 2018 earnings report, but then had earnings misses in subsequent quarters. Let's get into the financials to figure out why OSPN had a tumultuous 2019, and where the stock may be heading in 2020.To kick things off, below is a snapshot of the company's assets.(Source: Q3 2019 10-Q)Cash and equivalents fell nearly $22 million between the beginning of 2019 and end of Q3 2019, but was more than offset by gains in all other current asset categories, excluding contract assets. I searched for the cause of the decrease in cash and equivalents in the Q3 2019 earnings transcript, and found this explanation from the CFO:Since accounts receivable rose (significantly) while cash and equivalents fell, it seems that a chunk of orders arrived too late for OSPN to record the gains to cash, which would have led to decreases in accounts receivable for the Q3 report. With total current assets increasing by $6 million, there is no cause for alarm. The Q4 2019 earnings will show the increase in cash that would have occurred in the prior quarter if not for the late orders. Next is liabilities (I omitted the stockholders' equity section because it is not relevant to my analysis).(Source: Q3 2019 10-Q)For liabilities, the only category I care about is deferred revenue. As I mentioned in my previous OSPN article, deferred revenue is very important for evaluating SaaS companies. Since SaaS companies often receive upfront payments for future time periods, revenue cannot be realized until the time period has passed and the service has been provided. Thus, deferred revenue serves as a proxy for demand of a company's offerings, because an increase to deferred revenue means either new customers are purchasing subscriptions and/or existing customers are augmenting their current subscriptions. In my last article, I said that OSPN recorded $28.34 million in deferred revenue for Q3 2018. Compared to Q3 2018, deferred revenue has only risen 4% in the span of one year. I complained about the lack of deferred revenue growth last time, and once again, deferred revenue has failed to grow enough, only reaffirming my concern that OneSpan is unable to increase subscription revenue fast enough.(Source: Q3 2019 10-Q)Now, here are the revenues. Immediately, the gain in product and license revenue catches the eye. Quarter-over-quarter, license revenue grew a whopping 66%. I dug into the Q3 2019 earnings transcript to find out why the increase was so large, and learned that software revenue grew 95% for the period. After further digging, I found the answer to my question from the CEO in the Q&A section:Fortuitously for OneSpan, the meteoric rise of mobile transactions (i.e., Venmo) has created enormous demand for their mobile security offerings. The increase in revenue is great, but while license revenue grew 66%, services revenue only grew 18.8%, which begs the question: how steady will OneSpan's future revenues be? The issue with license sales is that it can be a feast or famine; OneSpan may be riding the mobile security wave through license sales, but once their customer orders in this niche saturate, then revenue gains will drop off sharply due to the one-time-payment nature of these transactions. OneSpan could offer frequent updates that customers would have to pay for, but that may lead customers to avoid upgrades, whereas the subscription model offers upgrades as part of the recurring fee, which helps justify the subscription in the customer's eyes.Moving onto cost of goods sold, license costs grew 55%. So, the 66% increase in license revenue was terrific, but the margins are not as impressive as the revenues. Speaking of margins, gross margin was 67%, which is a 1% increase from Q3 2018. Thus, gross margin has effectively been stagnant. OSPN's revenue patterns echo the same sentiments of concern I held a year ago in my previous article: the company is not embracing subscription revenue in a world where customers' business is increasingly becoming winner-take-all. To round up this section, here is a snapshot of operating costs.(Source: Q3 2019 10-Q)In my last article, I noted that sales/marketing expenditure increased $2 million in Q3 2018, while gross profit fell $2 million. I was concerned that OneSpan's sales force was ineffective and could not stimulate demand. If you fast forward, Q3 2019 sales/marketing expenditure fell nearly $2 million, while gross profit rose roughly $20 million. The boom in mobile security needs is the primary driver of revenue gains for OneSpan, but the sales force is clearly competent enough to capitalize on those tailwinds. Aside from that, the only other thing that sticks out in the table is positive operating income and net income, which is mostly a result of the large increases to revenue – not so much a result of lower operating costs.Below is a table of the company's operating cash flows.(Source: Q3 2019 10-Q)At first glance, you will notice that net cash used in operating activities is lower than the previous period. However, if you move upwards, accounts receivable tells the story. As the CFO mentioned in the earnings call, the timing of orders created a larger than usual balance in accounts receivable; if you correct for the accounts receivable situation, then OneSpan would have had positive net operating cash flows, which is a good sign for now – even if license revenues is the main cause for this.Let's briefly look at investing cash flows (below) before moving on.(Source: Q3 2019 10-Q)In my previous article, I mentioned how the cash used to purchase Dealflo may come back to haunt OneSpan if the company continued to experience negative net cash flows. That no longer seems to be an issue with the latest earnings results. OSPN did not use much cash beyond operating activities in the given period. For this period, they simply took the cash from the short term investments that matured and plowed it back into short term investments, which is nice because it serves as a liquidity buffer. In my last article, I cited exchange rates as a risk for OSPN, because 35% of its revenue is denominated in a currency other than USD, with much of the foreign currency revenue being in euros. (Source: XE)The Euro has become $0.03 weaker than the Dollar in the past year, but I believe this will merely be a minor inconvenience to OSPN in coming quarters. The Federal Reserve is content with keeping rates steady, while rates across Europe do not show signs of being lowered, meaning that EUR and USD are not likely to deviate far from each other in the near future. If anything, deriving more business from Europe is beneficial since lawmakers on the other side of the Atlantic have become zealous about cyber security and privacy, which is surely offering business opportunities, to companies like OneSpan, that far outweigh any risk posed by currency fluctuations at the moment. In my previous article, OneSpan had continued to struggle. It faced low liquidity following an acquisition that failed to contribute commensurately to revenue, its revenue growth was flat, and operating cash flows were negative. A year later, OneSpan is in a much better place. The company witnessed its software license revenue nearly double, boosting overall revenue by 66%. Assuming the vast majority of the accounts receivable balance is collected, OneSpan would technically have had positive net operating cash flows this period, which is a giant step in the right direction. However, the pink elephant in the room is subscription revenue. Most of the company's revenue gains came from license revenue, and while higher revenue alone is reason to celebrate, it is not as steady as subscription revenue, which means dramatic swings in future earnings results are a real possibility. Therefore, based on the improvements made in the last year and my continuing concern about the slow migration to subscription revenues, I recommend that investors avoid holding OSPN shares, but do not take on a short position due to the general upward trajectory of the markets at the moment."

OneSpan is ideally positioned to capitalize.OneSpan is in the middle of its own transformation from H/W and sales to a SaaS-based business model. The transformation is clouding the company's true financial performance.The company has strong recurring revenue growth, positive free cash flow and sufficient cash to weather the pandemic and emerge from it in good shape.The stock price is undervalued relative to its peers but is breaking out to new 52-week high along with other stocks involved with identity security.","OneSpan Inc. (OSPN) is one of several companies involved in combatting identity fraud within the cybersecurity industry. While other players such as Okta Inc (OKTA), Zscaler Inc (ZS), Ping Identity Holding Corp (PING), and SailPoint Technologies Holdings Inc (SAIL) provide zero trust solutions for the generic cybersecurity industry, OneSpan has both hardware and cloud-based solutions to combat identity fraud.In fact, the company already has a foot in the door with many global financial institutions sporting a pretty impressive list of customers, making it difficult for competitors to make inroads.(Source: OneSpan)Up to now, OneSpan's revenue model has mostly been based on perpetual licenses, but that is changing, albeit slowly. OneSpan is undergoing its own digital transformation, and this is ""clouding"" it's own financial performance. (Sorry for the pun). (Source: OneSpan)The company's dependence on software and hardware-based sales is waning and being replaced by cloud-delivered software services. Recurring revenues will provide better consistency in revenue growth over the long term and in fact more revenue than would be achieved with perpetual licenses.This transformation also aligns with the needs of the financial industry as it combats the emergence of digital banking and strives for improved customer experience.(Source: OneSpan)The major problem with digital transformation is that there is a window in time where revenue is under-reported and margins are compressed. Analysts are almost always confused by this phenomenon, and it results in an excellent investment opportunity for savvy investors.Readers that follow my work will recognize that the Rule of 40 is one of my favorite metrics for high-growth companies. Unfortunately, OneSpan fails on this metric but this is primarily a result of the digital transformation the company is undergoing, not an underlying financial health issue. OneSpan has a unique opportunity to capitalize on the pandemic-driven accelerated shift towards digital banking and associated identity fraud. The company also has a strong balance sheet with more than $100 million in cash and cash equivalents, minimal debt, and positive free cash flow. These factors will keep this company running throughout the pandemic and even a prolonged global recession. To add icing to the cake, I believe that OneSpan's share price is quite undervalued and is in the process of breaking out to a 52-week high. Therefore, I am quite happy to give OneSpan a very bullish rating.OneSpan is Breaking OutOneSpan is a stock on the move with a recent breakout to a 52-week high, doubling in price in a couple of months from a low of less than $11 to a recent price of $21.55.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)But this shouldn't come as a surprise because many of OpenSpan's identity-management peers, including Okta, Zscaler, and Ping, are also breaking out to new highs.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)The only straggler in the group is SailPoint, and I explained some of the issues with the company here.The Rule Of 40One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The rule provides a single metric for evaluating both high-growth companies that aren't profitable and mature companies that have lower growth but are profitable. Revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) must add up to at least 40% in order to fulfill the rule. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can tolerate some level of negative free cash flow. But if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth. This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.The two factors required for calculating the Rule of 40 are revenue growth and free cash flow margin. OneSpan's annual revenue growth is 23% which is quite surprising, given the ongoing company transformation. The company's TTM free cash flow margin, on the other hand, is positive but only 4%. As I discussed earlier, the margin is likely compressed due to the company transformation.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)Therefore, the Rule of 40 calculation for OneSpan is as follows:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 23% + 4% = 27%The score is lower than the necessary 40% needed to fulfill the rule of thumb. However, given the company transformation, I believe that the result is not bad at all. The Rule of 40 is a rule of thumb and not an absolute criterion. When a company fails on this metric, I like to examine the SG&A expenses in order to get a feeling as to whether the company is living beyond its means.NOTE: The SG&A expense margin includes R&D expenses and SBC.(Source: Portfolio123)In the case of OneSpan, the SG&A expense margin is 57% of revenue intake. This level of expense is quite reasonable for a (reasonably) high-growth stock. I believe that OneSpan isn't spending an excessive amount of money or excessively issuing SBC. Stock ValuationThere are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 150+ stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales estimate, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how OneSpan stacks up against other stocks on a relative basis based on forward gross profits multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the accepted valuation. In this instance, OneSpan is positioned well below the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is undervalued on a relative basis relative to other digital transformation stocks.FYI - other lower growth identity management companies such as SailPoint and Ping are also underappreciated by the market, whereas companies carrying high-growth expectations such as Okta and ZS are very much overappreciated by the markets.OneSpan definitely fits in the growth-at-a-reasonable=rpice (GARP) investment category.Investment RisksThere are several risks that investors should consider before investing in OneSpan. First of all, I apologize for sounding like a broken record, but as I have mentioned in previous articles, the current stock market is reminiscent of the Dot.com era, immediately prior to the crash starting in 2000. Back then, it was pretty much impossible not to be making money. Technology stocks were hopping. But it wasn't long before the market turned into a disaster, and the same could happen here.While I consider OneSpan to be undervalued, some of its software peers are extremely overvalued. Companies such as Zoom (ZM), Shopify (SHOP), and Datadog (DDOG) are at 20,000 feet. These high stock valuations could lead to a market crash and OneSpan would likely get swept along with the crowd.While I believe that OneSpan is navigating the current economic environment investors must keep in mind that there is no guidebook for how the future will play out. As time goes on, banks may request to renegotiate the terms of their agreements or attempt to delay payments.Summary and ConclusionsOneSpan is breaking out to a new 52-week high, along with its cybersecurity peers in the identity management niche. This bullish price action confirms the macro trends (digital remote banking and identity fraud) that are accelerating with the pandemic. The breakout suggests that there is more to come.OneSpan is in a strong position to weather the pandemic and global recession, given the strong balance sheet, positive free cash flow and minimal debt. The company is not expending exorbitant amounts on SG&A expenses. This company's stock price is undervalued and the stock breakout has caught my attention. Therefore, OneSpan gets a very bullish rating."
4230882,103130,2018-12-31T14:59:46-05:00,Review of my original analysis of OSPN.A look at OneSpan's financial performance.Why exchange rates will continue to hurt the company.I recommend a short position on OSPN.,"I originally wrote about OneSpan (OSPN) a few months ago and explained why I believe investors who were holding shares in the e-signature company should eliminate their position due to anemic revenue growth. I attributed the weak revenue growth to OneSpan's slow transition to a SaaS business model since it seemed that licensing had the effect of repelling prospective customers who were not keen on spending a lot upfront and leaving existing customers content with older versions of OSPN's software and thus foregoing upgrades for years at a time.Three months later, I am here to update investors on whether OneSpan has made noticeable progress in bolstering revenues and delivering tangible growth for shareholders.OSPN data by YChartsBefore getting into the analysis, I just wanted to show you how OneSpan has performed since I last wrote my critical piece on it; the e-signature company has fallen 30%, while the ETF that I use as a technology sector benchmark fell 18% in the same period.Let's start the analysis with a look at how OSPN is doing in terms of assets.(Source: Q3 2018 10-Q)Cash & equivalents rose $13 million from the beginning of the year to the end of the third quarter. However, you probably also noticed that short-term investments were completely depleted. Earlier this year, OneSpan acquired Dealflo for $53 million. The decrease in current assets amounted to $59 million for the nine-month period. A net decrease of $6 million in current assets is not a red flag. If you look at goodwill, you will notice that it rose by $38 million following the Deaflo acquisition. This means Dealflo only increased OSPN's assets by $15 million. This also means that OneSpan paid a 153% premium to acquire the company. For that much, investors should be hungry to see Dealflo generate serious growth.(Source: Q3 2018 10-Q)There is not much to glean from liabilities; the only figure worth noting is the $5 million decrease in deferred revenue. It is not uncommon for SaaS businesses to collect payment for subscriptions ahead of time and for varying periods (such as three months in advance or one year in advance). Accordingly, when I notice a fledgling SaaS company like OneSpan experience a decline in deferred revenue that tells me it is struggling with its transition to a SaaS model. If the deferred revenue decrease occurred between adjacent quarters, I might give OSPN the benefit of the doubt and shrug it off as a seasonal issue or isolated event, but over a nine-month period, management has no excuse.(Source: Q3 2018 10-Q)Now, for a look at revenues. For the quarter-over-quarter results, there is a continued shift to recurring revenue as services and other increased 25% to $15 million. Meanwhile, licensing revenue fell approximately $1.5 million. Overall, total revenue increased a measly 2.7% in the period. When you factor in costs of revenue, the story looks bleaker: licensing costs rose 19% and services and other costs rose 52%. Paying higher licensing revenue costs on declining licensing revenue is a pressing problem and shows that management's inability to quickly transition to a recurring revenue model is hurting shareholders. On the other hand, I would like to know why services and other costs increased 52% because the whole point of recurring revenue is to increase operating leverage - not erode it. Even over the nine-month period, you see the increase in recurring revenue costs outpace the increase in recurring revenue. I could not find any insight from management that would suggest that those cost increases are mostly fixed and not variable, which leaves me uneasy about OneSpan's e-signature market position.Here are the operating costs and net income figures as well:(Source: Q3 2018 10-Q)I want to point out OneSpan's inefficiency in sales/marketing. Management increased sales/marketing expenditure by $2 million this time, but gross profit fell by roughly $2 million. I am seeing two reasons for why this is happening: either the increase in sales/marketing was focused on attracting more subscription customers or this is symptomatic of the licensing model, in which sales just had a bad quarter. That would be something else that management should clarify for investors. For the reasons above, OneSpan's net income turned into a net loss in the last quarter, which is not a good sign for investors. What makes this especially concerning is that the net loss does not stem from growth initiatives that require heavy capital expenditure upfront, but rather, stems from anemic revenue growth and larger increases in costs.The income statement did not look too good, but the operating cash flows will give us a better look at the financial health of OneSpan.(Source: Q3 2018 10-Q)At the bottom, OSPN was over $9 million in negative operating cash flows. In 2018, however, the company had a deferred tax benefit of $3 million. So the real loss is down to $6 million. Another factor was an inventory increase that also decreased operating cash flows by $3 million. The increase in inventory seems to contradict management's intentions to transfer licensing revenue into subscription revenue. It seems as though OSPN has difficulty forecasting demand because licensing revenue fell relative to last period, and now the company is sitting on inventory that could be outdated by next year if it is not sold. Contract assets also lowered operating cash flows by nearly $3 million, but OSPN will collect on this eventually, so operating cash flows for the latest period are nearer to zero rather than negative $9 million.Moving on, here are the cash flows from investing:(Source: Q3 2018 10-Q)In this table, you can see that OneSpan freed up cash by letting $80 million of short-term investments mature so they could pay for the Dealflo acquisition, which cost them $53 million. It seems that management freed up more cash than required to finance the Dealflo purchase since operating cash flows were negative. With about $92 million left in cash and equivalents, OSPN has a decent liquidity buffer, so the negative operating cash flows are not yet a huge concern. But, if the company continues to see negative operating cash flows, then investors may have to worry about management seeking out debt to keep the company afloat. It is too early to speculate about insolvency, so I will save that for a future article.Lastly, I want to discuss the effect of exchange rates on OSPN's cash flows.(Source: Q3 2018 10-Q)From the latest quarterly filing, 48% of OneSpan's revenue is derived from EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa). I believe that a substantial majority of EMEA revenue comes from Europe alone, so I pulled up a two-year chart of the euro versus the dollar.(Source: XE)The graph shows the value of the euro in terms of dollars from the beginning of 2017 to now. As the chart increases in the beginning, the dollar weakened. Thus, OneSpan's cash flows were buoyed $640,000. Fast forward, and as the dollar strengthened, OneSpan lost $647,000 in the first nine months of fiscal year 2018. Due to political/economic issues within Europe, such as ""Brexit"" and turmoil within France and Germany, the dollar looks poised to gain further ground against the euro as investors migrate to it for higher yielding US bonds (thanks to interest rate hikes) and for its greater safety compared to other currencies around the world. Thus, this could be another disadvantage that OneSpan faces, considering its rivals - DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) - generate greater proportions of their revenue within the United States.OneSpan was struggling when I originally wrote about it, and unfortunately, this e-signature company's woes continue. Its liquidity has decreased as millions were spent on the acquisition of Dealflo. Despite the acquisition, revenue growth was marginal with costs of revenue growing at a faster rate than revenue itself. Operating cash flows turned negative, forcing the company to redeem short-term investments in order to cover expenses for the foreseeable future. Finally, a strengthening dollar has eroded OneSpan's cash flows since nearly half of its revenue comes from EMEA.For the reasons listed above, and the fact that management has been slow and ineffective with transitioning to a recurring revenue model, I recommend a short position on OSPN."

For this article, I will be using my 3-step framework for analyzing OneSpan's growth potential as a hybrid SaaS company:From OneSpan's 2017 10-K, OneSpan is not a pure SaaS company since it still deploys on-premises solutions, but as we will learn from latter sections, they seem to be pivoting to a pure SaaS business model:The first concern I have about OneSpan is that despite being created in 1991, it has had weak revenue growth.(Source: 2017 10-K)(Source: 2013 10-K)The revenue figures from 2008 to 2017 are unstable, which is typical of an on-premises software company. Over the course of 9 years, OneSpan has only grown revenue by 45% total, which indicates serious struggles with their ability to either develop compelling products or market their services and capture sales effectively. The CAGR I calculated for revenue during that 9-year period was only 4.2% as well. I mentioned in my previous article that the e-signature business was estimated to be around $25 billion, yet OneSpan's revenues have declined while DOCU and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) are witnessing revenue growth rates in excess of 30% in the e-signature market.Another concern I had involves the pattern of revenue increases and decreases. After 2008, revenue falls and stays relatively steady, then spikes in 2011. After 2011, revenue dips and stays stagnant for two years again, and then hops up in 2014. Revenue did increase in 2015, but has once again fallen and stalled above $190 million.I believe that this cyclical pattern of revenue jumping and stalling is symptomatic of the on-premises business, in which OneSpan's customers come back every few years to upgrade (combined with new customers), and this leads to a spike in revenue, with a few years of stalling revenue as customers are satisfied with their licensed products. OneSpan is trying to expand their SaaS business model, but the pace may be too slow.(Source: 2017 10-K)Their 2013 10-K shows evidence that Digipass was offered as a cloud-based solution, but fast forward to 2017, and the proportion of SaaS revenue only grew 5% from 2016 to 2017. It seems that the growth in SaaS revenue is primarily from existing customers, because product and license revenue fell by roughly $10 million, while service and other revenue grew by $10 million. Even if that may not be the case, OneSpan is clearly struggling to increase overall revenue.Looking at revenue by geographic region, the concentration of revenue from EMEA immediately caught my attention. As many of you know, the EU implemented GDPR earlier this year, which created significant hassles for companies that store and process data within Europe. Since 48% of total revenue came from EMEA, OneSpan is at a competitive disadvantage relative to DocuSign and Adobe. In DocuSign's latest earnings call, management stated that they obtained approval for binding corporate rule (BCR), which is considered the ""gold standard for cross border data transfer by data processors and data controllers."" DocuSign only derives 17% of their revenue from outside the US, yet claims to be the only company in their market to have BCR approval, while OSPN made no mention about GDPR in their latest earnings call. Adobe, being the behemoth that it is, already cleared GDPR hurdles well in advance. Thus, I believe that DOCU and ADBE will outpace OneSpan when it comes to gaining market share in EU, since they are better equipped to avoid violating GDPR laws.The takeaway from this section is that OneSpan's revenue growth has been historically weak, the combination of its high concentration of EU revenue and weak communication on GDPR compliance puts it at a disadvantage versus competitors, and its transition to a purer SaaS business model is happening too slowly.(Source: 2017 10-K)In this section, I always start with looking at operating expenses. In this category, OneSpan is doing mostly good. Their sales and marketing expense is at the typical level for SaaS businesses. Their sales efforts haven't helped increase revenue, but that was discussed in the prior section. Since OneSpan seems to rely on acquisitions to innovate their services, 18% is a fair proportion to spend on that division. The one thing I would like to see improvement on is general and administrative expense. The acquisition of Dealflo is one of the culprits that led to higher overhead, but I expect management to eliminate redundant positions and decrease excess costs arising from G&A in future quarters.(Source: 2017 10-K)The COGS table above illustrates the adverse effect of product licensing (in lieu of SaaS services) upon gross margin. In just one year, from 2015 to 2016, total gross margin rose 8% to 68%. If you look at 2015, product and license gross margin was at 57% – extremely low compared to competitors. Meanwhile, services and other gross margin was at a fantastic 87%. However, the weight of on-premises revenue meant that gross margin was a meager 60% in 2015. The situation improved overall in 2016, with licensing margin up to 66%, and services revenue at 77%.(Source: 2017 10-K)Comparing 2016 and 2017, it seems that margins have now stabilized for licensing and service revenue, combining for a 70% total gross margin. As for the latest quarter, total gross margin was reported to be 73%, so OneSpan is actually improving steadily in that regard.DocuSign's Q1 2019 10-Q revealed gross margin to be 63% in the latest quarter. However, a $15.8 million one-time expense related to RSUs skewed that figure, so after accounting for that effect, DOCU's true gross margin was 73% in the latest quarter. This means that OneSpan is actually on par with DocuSign when it comes to controlling costs. The key differentiator will be who can increase revenue at a faster rate.(Source: Q2 2018 10-Q)When analyzing balance sheets, I am primarily interested in current assets, because maintaining a liquidity buffer is vital when scaling as a SaaS oriented business. So, I was concerned when I noticed that total current assets fell 22%, down to $176.8 million. Apparently, OneSpan acquired Dealflo for $53 million in the previous quarter, which explains the drop in current assets. If you compare short-term investments between 2018 and 2017, it was cut to zero in the latest quarter. This tells me that management wants higher revenues quickly, and is doing this via acquisition. When pressed by analysts for information on Dealflo's revenue figures, the CEO had this to say:Per year, Dealfo is expected to add around $4.8 million to $6 million. Management mentioned that Dealflo has averaged 25% revenue growth in the last few years, so if gross margin averages 70% per year, it would take 12-13 years to pay off this acquisition. The boost in revenue generated from Dealflo alone would likely be a maximum of 3% for the next annual report. We will not know about revenue/cost synergies until future reports, but from the information I have now, the Dealflo acquisition appears to be a desperate attempt to increase revenue.(Source: 2017 10-K)Moving onto cash flows, the section I focus on is cash flows from operations (CFOs). For SaaS companies, you generally want to see positive CFOs, because that shows self-sustainability in operating the business, which means a lower chance of having to further dilute equity to raise capital, or having to raise debt – especially in a rising interest rate environment. In 2017, net cash from operations was positive despite the downward trend. However, OneSpan only avoided negative net operating cash flows since they had negative net income for the year, meaning that they could defer taxes to future periods. Once their net income becomes positive again, those tax liabilities will kick in and lead to lower net operating cash flows unless net income is high enough to offset the tax liabilities. Thus, this adds further pressure on management to boost revenue and the bottom line ahead of the next earnings report, otherwise OneSpan may have negative net operating cash flows, which is a huge red flag for SaaS companies.OneSpan is experiencing struggles with revenue growth, which may be in part due to the portion of their business still tied up in product licensing aside from their SaaS offerings. A significant portion of their revenue is also tied up in EMEA, which is concerning because their competitors, DocuSign and Adobe, have lower proportions of revenue from Europe, and are also better positioned to avoid GDPR sanctions. However, OSPN is doing well with total gross margin, which hit 73% in the latest quarter (on par with DocuSign), and gross margin looks positioned to increase as a larger percentage of their revenue is derived from the higher margin SaaS offerings. On the balance sheet, the purchase of Dealflo seems to be a desperate attempt to increase revenue, and does not seem justified when comparing the expected revenue and acquisition cost, but we will have to wait until the next earnings report to see if revenue/cost synergies make Dealflo a compelling addition to OneSpan. Finally, analysis of operating cash flows led to doubt about OneSpan's ability to maintain positive net operating cash flows in future periods, which is important for SaaS companies to maintain, since it signals financial discipline during the scaling process.In conclusion, I would not recommend purchasing shares in OSPN, and would eliminate any long positions for the reasons listed above."

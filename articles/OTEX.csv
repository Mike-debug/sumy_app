The firm is still in major digestion mode for its Carbonite acquisition which closed in December 2019.Management appears to be on a significant acquisition track, so it will be difficult to determine organic revenue growth, unless management chooses to break that out in future financial results.I like the XMedius deal, if only for its large customer base and apparently reasonable price tag.My bias on OTEX at its current level is Neutral."

Although this is a well-managed firm whose financial performance is exemplary, its current valuation does not leave much room for growth. Keep an eye on this stock.OpenText operates in various enterprise software industries with is Enterprise Information Management (EIM) suite of products. EIM is an umbrella term for software that enables firms to better control and utilize all forms of information. In OpenText's FY2019 annual report:OpenText's EIM software portfolio spans many sub-industries of the enterprise software industry. Below is an overview of the sub-industries in which OpenText operates and its historical and projected growth:Source: Table by Author using data from IBISWorldGrowth in the enterprise software industries has been strong in the past five years due to increasing complexity of businesses and strong corporate appetite to invest in efficiency-improving products. Large firms have already gained the most sizable benefits of adopting enterprise software, and these high adoption rates will reduce growth moving forward. Industry growth will be driven by new products catering to niche/underserved markets and small- and mid-size business (SMB) adoption as enterprise software becomes more ubiquitous, user friendly and cost effective. Other growth areas include continuing expansion into cloud and mobile platforms, data warehousing, cloud security, automation, predictive analytics and other AI applications.The industry is characterized by high switching costs as enterprise software is complex and highly integrated into a firm's architecture. This combined with low anticipated industry growth means that many firms will experience stagnant organic growth. Consequently, incumbents have been and will continue to pursue aggressive acquisition growth strategies. Companies are in a stronger competitive position and can achieve organic growth through cross-selling a suite of product offerings that are integrated with other enterprise applications and available on multiple platforms.Industry concentration is moderate and likely to remain so. Large firms have been carrying out aggressive acquisition strategies while smaller firms emerge in niche areas as the capital investment required to enter is low. However, incumbents benefit from the barriers provided by their reputation and ubiquity, a talent barrier from the limited pool of skilled software developers, and high switching costs.Although providing a competitive barrier, the limited pool of skilled software developers is expected to put pressure on margins as wages are expected to outpace revenue growth. Additionally, industry consolidation presents a risk for enterprise software platforms like OpenText as mentioned in its latest annual report:The enterprise software industry is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change. Firms spend a significant portion of their revenue on research and development to maintain a competitive edge.The software-as-a-service (SaaS) model dominates the enterprise software space. In SaaS, customers access software by paying a recurring fee to software providers instead of a one-time fee. These stable cash flows, along with high switching costs, means that enterprise software revenues are not cyclical. Firms may reduce their appetite to invest in new software during economic downturns. Some enterprise software has anti-cyclical properties as firms attempt to cut costs and replace human capital with software.In summary, the industry key success factors (KSFs) are:OpenText's various software offerings can be viewed here: products and solutions. OpenText software is offered through traditional on-premise solutions, on the OpenText Cloud or a combination of both. Its revenue is generated through licensing of software products, cloud services and subscriptions, customer support which is generally purchased alongside software products, and professional services such as implementation consulting. Here is its revenue composition in FY2019:Source: Chart by Author using data from OpenText's 2019 annual reportM&A HistoryBelow is the history of all the company's acquisitions made in the past 10 years. The average price/sales paid for acquisitions is 2.5x during the analysis period, which is accretive on a price/sales basis based on OpenText's historical price/sales valuation. This suggests that the company is not overpaying for acquisitions.Source: Table by Author using data from OpenText annual reports and OpenText press releasesCorporate StrategyOpenText pursues a Total Growth strategy, ""Retain. Grow. Acquire,"" through both organic and inorganic growth. Inorganic growth is largely funded internally; in the past five fiscal years, operating cash flows have covered 89% of acquisition costs (3.0b vs. 3.4b). Its inorganic growth has been executed very effectively, with no goodwill write-downs in the past 10 years and tight controls on costs and its operating margin. It is exceptionally rare and difficult for a company pursuing an inorganic growth strategy to show strong cost control. In fact, over a 10-year period, OpenText's margin has improved significantly. If this tells me one thing and one thing only, it is that management shows talent in cost cutting and restructuring after making acquisitions.Source: Chart by Author using data from OpenText annual reportsOrganic growth is a key part of the company's strategy, as it wishes to penetrate more of the Global 10,000 firms. Organic growth includes cross-selling products to newly acquired OpenText customers. Customer retention appears to be strong; management claims that 75.6% of TTM revenues are recurring, and customer support and cloud services renewal rates are in the mid-to-low 90s (01/2020 Investor Presentation).OpenText has achieved a 13.6% CAGR in revenue since 2010, but the company does not report any organic vs. inorganic growth figures. However, management generally discloses the trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenues of its acquisition targets. Using these figures and the date of the acquisition, you can prorate one year's worth of the acquisition targets' revenue to get an estimate of year-over-year organic vs. inorganic growth.Source: Table by Author using data from OpenText annual reports and press releasesGAAP revenue is compared against the following year's M&A adjusted revenue. The average year-over-year organic growth over the analysis period is 0%. This is surprising in the context of the considerable industry growth over the last five years. This may speak to issues regarding customer churn, the obsolescence of certain products, inability to cross-sell newly acquired customers, or the fact that OpenText may not be acquiring targets that are complementary to its existing product portfolio. Management also mentions that a 10% drop in revenue is common upon the first year of acquisition because of the disrupting effects of integration. It is difficult to attribute this issue to any one thing, but I assume that the 0% average year-over-year organic growth is due to a combination of the above factors.An important pillar in the company's growth strategy is its strategic partnerships. OpenText has strategic partnerships with Amazon AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and as of FY 2019, SAP (NYSE:SAP), Google Cloud (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). By making its software available on these ubiquitous platforms, OpenText is effectively marketing its products, delivering them to market, and triumphing on the industry KSF of making its software easily integrated with other enterprise software.Company RisksThe company is currently in the appeals phase of an IRS matter that may lead to a $770m tax charge that arose from the consolidation of intellectual property and internal restructuring between 2010 and 2012. A $770m charge represents a $2.84 destruction of value per OpenText share and may halt dividend payments and hamper acquisition activity. However, the risk of this damaging the long-term financial and strategic strength of the company is low.OpenText shares its direct competitors in the latest annual report:For the peer analysis, OpenText's competitors were selected along with other software companies in similar markets. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Oracle and Microsoft are not comparable as only a small portion of these consolidated firms are comparable to OpenText.Source: Table by Author using data from finbox.comOpenText is conservatively valued among its peers. For some tech and software firms, EV/Sales may be a more powerful metric to pay attention to than earnings-based multiples. Many of these firms are not maximizing their profitability in the pursuit of growth. The company's valuation based on this metric is hovering around its five-year average and many five-year averages of peers. OpenText has lower growth prospect than the majority of its peers, hence why it is trading at a lower multiple.OpenText's 15.7x EV/EBITDA valuation is among the more conservative among these peers also due to relatively low growth expectations. This amounts to a 6.4% EBITDA yield per share, which is much more reasonable than the lofty valuation of many peers. Given OpenText's historical growth trajectory and cost management, this valuation alone may be attractive to many investors. For reference, the S&P 500 has historically averaged 11-14x EV/EBITDA and a value below 10x can be very attractive.Other Peer ComparisonsA company that is paying its executives exorbitant amounts raises a red flag. With OpenText's strong historical growth, cost management, and track record of successful acquisitions, one would expect that the CEO is being paid handsomely. OpenText's CEO's compensation lands modestly in the middle of the peers, which I am comfortable with as a potential investor.Source: Chart by Author using data from Morningstar and company documentsThrough the analysis period, the company has maintained strong operating margins in the context of its total growth, which sits above the peer group. From OpenText's annual report, research and development expenditure is ""an appropriate balance between managing our organic growth and result of operations."" The R&D expenditure is notably less than its peers, yet its operating margin remains strong. The lack of expenditure or effective R&D may explain the stagnant organic growth, but this is a difficult connection to make. Overall, it seems to be striking a good balance.Source: Table by Author using data from finbox.comReturn on total assets, measured as operating income divided by total assets, has seen a decline over the analysis period and sits noticeably below its peers. Goodwill and acquired intangibles represent the majority of OpenText's assets, which indicates to me that it is not realizing the full value of its acquisitions. This may be due to difficulties in cross-selling and revenue synergies, difficulties in achieving cost synergies (which I do not believe is the case), or the fact that OpenText is simply overpaying for acquisitions. Investors should pay close attention to this metric (and other similar metrics such as ROE, ROIC, EVA, ROCE) as this may be an obstacle to generating shareholder value moving forward.Source: Table by Author using data from finbox.comValuation performed at $41.54/shareOpenText was valued using a modified Earnings Power Valuation (EPV), which is a zero-growth model, reflecting the company's negligible organic growth. As the company grows only through acquisitions, the value of this growth will be incorporated qualitatively. Many of the cash flows and expenses are normalized over the analysis period, and 2014 was chosen as the first year due to the significant change in capital structure occurring this year. Share compensation liability and long-term debt were revalued to market values using the most current available data.Source: Chart by Author using data from OpenText annual reportsS&P gives OpenText a BB+ issuer-level credit rating. Using FRED economic data, reproducible BB+ credit rating is equal to 4.16%, which is in line with industry benchmarks and OpenText's average forward-looking interest rate on long-term debt of 4.01%. This is a conservative credit score given its 6.41 OCF interest coverage in FY2019.Source: Table by Author using data from OpenText annual reports, Standard and Poor's, FRED Economic DataI performed two cash flow analysis, an unlevered cash flow analysis (left) and a levered cash flow analysis (right). The levered free cash flow analysis is more relevant to potential common shareholders like you and I, but both valuations should theoretically produce similar valuations.Source: Table by AuthorAssuming zero-growth, the intrinsic value or reproduction value of OpenText's shares is between $29 and $33 per share. This valuation lies below its current share price of $41.54, suggesting that the investor should stay away if no growth assumed. However, there lies some true value in OpenText's proven ability to use internally generated cash flows to acquire and integrate other firms. Here is a sensitivity of this model to understand what the value of growth can be:Source: Table by AuthorAt OpenText's current valuation, investors are pricing in moderate growth expectations. We will summarize the main findings in the company overview to see if we can qualitatively justify the current valuation (hold OTEX), and a margin of safety (buy OTEX). This is done in context of the industry key success factors.OpenText StrengthsOpenText ConcernsOverall, I do not believe there is a significant margin of safety to purchase shares at OpenText's current valuation, and I advise that existing shareholders hold their positions. My main concern is that OpenText is more of a private-equity firm that is acquiring a non-complementary suite of software products. There is value in this, and it seems to be a fantastic acquirer and cost-cutter, but not enough for me to justify its valuation and initiate a position. I feel that OpenText's growth prospects justify a significant margin of safety to enter at $29-33/share. I will keep a look on ROTA, ROIC, and the company's ability to achieve revenue synergies in its latest acquisition of Carbonite before reconsidering the purchase of shares."

Competition may increase in the future due to ongoing software industry consolidation. The company's competitors include IBM (IBM), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Veeva Systems (VEEV), J2 Global (JCOM), Pegasystems (PEGA), SPS Commerce (SPSC), and Box (BOX). The company also competes with systems integrators who configure hardware and software into customized systems. The company competes on the basis of product quality, performance, and price.In recent times, numerous releases of competitive products have occurred. If Open Text's competitors engage in aggressive pricing policies with respect to their products, or if the bargaining power of consumers increases, the company may need to lower the prices of its products and services. As a result, the company's revenue and profit could be adversely affected.Open Text's third quarter fiscal year 2020 revenue came in at $814.7 million, up 13.3% YoY, and non-GAAP diluted EPS came in at $0.61, down 4.7% YoY. The company's cloud services and subscriptions revenue was $339.5 million, up 42.3% YoY. The company's total annual recurring revenue came in at $662.3 million, up 20.6% YoY. The company generated operating cash flow of $329.6 million in the quarter, up 15.2% YoY.The company delivered mixed third quarter fiscal year 2020 results. While top-line and cash flow increased, bottom line decreased. The company's cloud services and subscriptions revenue, the largest business revenue stream of the company, increased substantially. This indicates the company's cloud business is its main growth engine. Gartner said that worldwide public cloud revenue will grow 17% in 2020 to a total of $266.4 billion, up from $227.8 billion in 2019. This is good news for Open Text, as this year will be a good year for the company's cloud business.According to a report:Open Text's cloud revenue will continue to grow in the coming years, and this will boost its overall revenue.Open Text's peer group includes IBM, Microsoft, Veeva Systems, and Box. Open Text's non-GAAP forward PE multiple is 15.78x, compared to IBM's 11.04x, Microsoft's 34.27x, Veeva Systems' 88.99x, and Box's 39.38x. Open Text's trailing 12-month price to sales multiple is 3.81x, compared to IBM's 1.42x, Microsoft's 10.73x, Veeva Systems' 28.13x, and Box's 4.13x. Open Text's trailing 12-month price to cash flow multiple is 12.80x, compared to IBM's 7.51x, Microsoft's 25.47x, Veeva Systems' 70.43x, and Box's 37.43x.Open Text is attractively valued compared to its peers. The company has an indebted balance sheet comprising of $1.45 billion of cash and $4.47 billion of debt. The company's net leverage ratio is 3.37x, which is on the higher side. The company is attractively valued because of its debt load. However, the company has multiple growth drivers, which will drive its long-term revenue growth. Although the company is partially funding its growth through debt, its growth drivers are strong enough to generate meaningful free cash flows so that the company can repay its debt in the coming years. Therefore, despite the debt load, the company's stock is a ""buy"" for the long term.Open Text is a medium-growth company. In the last five years, its revenue has grown at a CAGR of 10.35%. I expect revenue will continue to grow at this rate in the next five years. The company's trailing 12-month revenue is $3030.3 million. If revenue grows at a CAGR of 10% in the next five years, its mid-2025 revenue will be $4,880 million, or $18.02 per share. In the last five years, Open Text's shares have traded between the price to sales multiples of 2.5x and 4.5x. If a price to sales multiple of 4.5x is applied on the company's mid-2025 revenue per share, its mid-2025 share price will be $81.09.For being successful in growing revenue, Open Text should be able to design, develop, and market new software products and enhance existing software products in a timely manner. In addition, the company should be able to integrate its proprietary software products with third party software products to redevelop or improve its products. If the company cannot do this, it may not be able to develop new products or enhance existing products, and as a result, its revenue growth and profitability could be negatively impacted.A significant part of the company's revenue is generated from its installed customer base, and it has significant service contracts with its license customers that offer recurring service revenue to the company. If existing customers don't renew contracts with the company or don't buy additional products or services from the company, then its revenue growth could be negatively impacted, and operating results could be adversely affected.Open Text is a cloud-first company. Its release of Cloud Editions (CE) 20.2 has strengthened its cloud platform. This release offers a stronger information infrastructure, a flexible cloud-deployment option, and developer-centric innovations. The company's cloud business will drive its revenue growth in the long term. Open Text is a solid business to own for the long term."
4294428,104952,2019-10-01T15:10:37-04:00,"Despite being an enterprise software company, more than half of OTEX's revenue comes from the services business. R&D spending has been just ~11% of total revenue in the last two years.As of Q4 2019, customer support and professional services segments alone make up almost 53% of its $2.87 billion revenue.Fees from its B2B managed services also partially drive OTEX's cloud revenue and subscription segment.","Open Text Corp. (OTEX) is one of the few unique companies in the technology space which pursues takeover as its main growth driver. As it stands, the company has been generating over $2 billion of revenue annually since the last three years as a result of the strategy. The company operates in the EIM (Enterprise Information Management) market, where it sells a wide variety of cloud and on-premise software applications ranging from security to customer experience management.We maintain a neutral position on the stock today, though we would review our position at the beginning of FY 2020. As much as we would like to applaud the company’s solid track record to acquire and integrate technology companies, we are quite skeptical about its ability to continually move the needle in the next few years. When scaling its M&A operation, we see a potential challenge with its acquisition thesis, which we will discuss further below. On the other hand, in terms of overall business growth, the fact that the company claims to be a software company while generating most of its revenue through customer support and other services-related fees is a cause for concern.According to its 10-K, the company has deployed almost $6.2 billion on acquisitions in the last ten years. If there is any reason to be bullish on this company, then it would be for its ability to evaluate and consolidate other technology companies:Over the last four years, Open Text has made 13 acquisitions. At the rate of 3 acquisitions per year on average, the company has executed its M&A activities well enough, given it has grown its revenue by 55% since then. Within the same time frame, we have also learned that most of the M&A targets have been small-cap technology companies, where the acquisition value ranges from $20.5 million to $332 million.When we looked at the list of acquisitions it has made, we found that there have been no increasing trends in terms of the acquisition values. We think that is also where one of our main concerns lies in. Open Text is open to acquiring a company with as small as a $20 million valuation while it in itself is an over $10 billion company in terms of market cap.(Source: Open Text 10-K.)A further look into how it generates revenue gives us an insight as to why Open Text’s M&A thesis allows for such flexibility. As a software company, Open Text generates most of its revenue through services instead of software contracts or cloud subscriptions. In the last three years, over 40% of Open Text’s revenue came from customer support fees. Another service revenue stream comes from its “Professional Service and other” segment, which makes up around ~10% of its revenue. Sizable portions of its revenues from “Cloud services and subscriptions” segment are also arguably service-related revenues, as its 10-K stated:The cost to serve its cloud services customers involves labor-related costs due to its managed services B2B program that includes training and outsourcing services to its customers aside from the pure SaaS/PaaS products. As a result, its cloud-only segment’s gross margin of 56% to 58% is relatively modest compared to pure-play cloud software companies like Box (BOX) or Atlassian (TEAM), which boast gross margins of close to 75%-80%. Given its focus on mainly acquiring other companies instead of R&D, in which it typically spends only 11% to 13% of revenues annually, it remains to be seen how scalable growth and margin expansions through introductions of competitive cloud offerings are achievable. For context, a leading cloud software company like Atlassian typically spends close to 50% of its revenue on R&D activities annually.(Source: stockrow)Going back to its growth strategy, we also question its ability to scale its M&A approach when it potentially needs to make larger-cap acquisitions in the future to support faster growth. The fact that TTM revenue growth has dropped drastically from 34.36% to 1.90% in FY 2018 since the last two years should serve as a red flag as to how the strategy may have a limitation. The reality of the situation is that acquiring and consolidating $300 million companies is much different in nature to $2 billion companies and larger.When understanding the valuation of Open Text, we should consider the fact that it is definitely not a 100% software company. Even within its cloud services and subscription revenue stream, for instance, the company generates sizable additional revenues out of B2B managed-services fees.(source: Open Text 10-K)Seeing how margin expansion in Open Text historically has come from services-related revenue streams such as customer support, professional service, and cloud service, we do not see how the opportunity cost is moderate enough to focus and take risk elsewhere to boost growth. Even without the B2B managed service portion of the cloud service revenue taken into account, customer support and professional service revenues already make up over half of all Open Text’s revenue combined.With those in mind, parts of the business operate similarly to CGI (GIB). At a glance, Open Text appears more attractively valued than CGI. Open Text currently trades at a 14.17 EV/EBITDA, trailing CGI closely behind which trades at 14.70. Given the company’s plan to push for more organic growth through increased spending in R&D and cloud investments, Open Text’s growth outlook appears more interesting. (source: seeking alpha.)That being said, it is also worth considering that CGI is almost twice the size of Open Text. On the other hand, we feel that the price is also fair since Open Text’s services-weighted revenue would still dominate its overall revenue. When we look at the EV/Sales for both, however, we learned how Open Text’s premium 4.39 EV/Sales versus CGI’s 2.50 does not represent an interesting opportunity. Based on the company's fundamentals, it would be quite difficult for us to assign any premium to much of Open Text’s top-line sales, which, despite its recurring nature, is not product-driven.In a nutshell, Open Text today is in the business of acquiring other companies, consolidating them, and charging additional managed services and support fees. There is a potential outlook shift given the company’s FY 2020 ambition, which is the reason why we are mostly neutral instead of bearish on the stock just yet."

We think it is a good investment choice for investors with a long-term investment horizon.Data by YChartsOpen Text delivered a solid Q3 F2019 with mid-single digit revenue growth of 4.9% year over year (or 7.7% in constant currency). The company saw its annual recurring revenue increased to $549.4 million in Q3 (or a growth of 5.4% year over year). Its adjusted EBITDA grew by 15% year over year to $261.8 million with a margin of 36.4%.(Source: Q3 F2019 Investor Presentation)Growth in Q4 may be slower than previous yearsLooking forward to its Q4, management indicated that they may not see the same revenue growth strength it had in the past few years (usually in the range of 10-12% year over year) due to better-than-expected results in Q3. Investors should keep in mind that Open Text’s business result may be lumpy (some revenues can be deferred to later quarters due to timing issues), and the best way to evaluate its business is to not focus too much on one single quarter but to look at its annual results (or past 12 months' results).Recurring revenue model has much longer lifetime revenue per customerOpen Text is a Software-as-a-Service company. It generates a stable and predictable recurring revenue from its customers. About 73.2% of its F2018 revenue is recurring. We like the fact that in Q3 F2019, this percentage increased further to 78.2% of its total Q3 revenue. This growth in recurring revenue is helpful, as the lifetime revenue that Open Text can get per customer should be higher than a one-time sell price of the software solution. This is because its renewal rates are over 90% (customer support renewal rate is 91%, cloud service renewal rate is even higher in the mid-90%'s).Strong industry fundamental in cloud servicesThere is a tremendous growth opportunity for Open Text in the cloud services space. In Q3 F2019, the company’s cloud services and subscriptions revenue increased by 16% to $238.6 million (vs. total revenue growth rate of only 5% year over year). As can be seen from the illustration below, less than 20% of the company’s installed base is subscribed to its cloud services. There are many advantages for its customers to switch to cloud-based services, such as receiving new software updates, and easier access to data and information from anywhere. As the customers gradually switch to its cloud services, the company should be able to grow its recurring revenue further.(Source: Q3 F2019 Investor Presentation)Management is targeting 38-40% of EBITDA margin by F2021Earlier in its F2019, Open Text announced its restructuring strategy. The focus is to better utilize its resources, especially in research & developments, services and supports, and cloud operations. Although management did not specifically discuss these items in the latest conference call, its EBITDA margin of 36.4% in Q3 F2019 (up from 33.2% in Q3 F2018) is a sign that this initiative is progressing. Besides its restructuring initiative, management is also actively evaluating its contracts and has already discontinued many low-margin contracts. We believe these efforts should help Open Text to achieve its target of 38-40% EBITDA margin in F2021.Catalyst and Liaison acquisitions help to strengthen its industry-leading positionOpen Text made two acquisitions in its F2019: Liaison and Catalyst. Open Text’s acquisition of Liaison (purchase price of about $311 million) helps it to extend its business network & cloud leadership. This acquisition also helps to provide cloud-based integration and data management solutions. Since Catalyst’s (purchase price of about $71 million) focus is on discovery and legal technology space, Open Text’s acquisition should help it to extend its leadership in this field. We also like the fact that revenues from both companies are predominantly cloud-based subscription revenues.Improving balance sheetThanks to its strong free cash flow generation, Open Text has gradually improved its leverage from 2.5x back in Q3 F2017 to 1.7x in Q3 F2019. The company ended its Q3 F2019 with $1.7 billion of debt. Its leverage of 1.7x is well below management’s sub-3.0x target. We like the current balance sheet, as it will allow the company to pursue acquisitions to grow its business in the future.(Source: Q3 F2019 Investor Presentation)Open Text is currently trading at a forward EV-to-EBITDA ratio of 11.8x. This is towards the high end of its 3-year range of 10x-12x. It is trading below SAP’s (SAP) 15.5x but slightly higher than Oracle’s (ORCL) 10.7x. Therefore, we believe Open Text is fairly valued.Data by YChartsSix consecutive years of dividend growthOpen Text has increased its dividend for 6 consecutive years since it started paying dividends 6 years ago. As can be seen from the chart below, the company has recently increased its quarterly dividend to $0.175 per share. This is equivalent to a dividend yield of 1.5%.Data by YChartsLooking forward, we believe Open Text is in a good position to grow its dividend, as its dividend payout ratio based on free cash flow in the past 12 months is in the low 20s. Given the company’s strong free cash flow generation in the past few years and its growth outlook, we believe it has the ability to grow its dividends by double digits in the next few years.Data by YChartsCompetition riskOpen Text’s business faces competition from other enterprise application software vendors. Some of its competitors may be able to compete at lower prices.Economic downturnDownturns in general economic and market conditions may reduce demand for Open Text’s solutions. This may negatively impact the company's revenue and its cash flow generation.We like Open Text and its business model. We think the company should continue to enjoy strong growth in the upcoming few years. It is poised to continue to increase its dividend by double-digits as well. Although the shares are trading at a valuation towards the high end of their historical range, we think the shares are not expensive given the company's growth outlook and business model. Therefore, we think this is a good stock to own for investors with a long-term investment horizon."

It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Essential. Click here to find out more »For many investors, Open Text (OTEX) has largely flown under the radar, and for good reason. This article will largely discuss why the underlying fundamentals for this company, and its growing presence in the Enterprise Information Management software business, could take it to new heights in the coming years.Open Text’s primary specialization is its Enterprise Information Management (EIM) software. The software enhances supply chain analytics, structures data series, provides cloud services, implements artificial intelligence to analyze underlying business trends, and much more. The company is considered by many to be the leader in the EIM space, due in part to the 29 acquisitions it has completed in the last 18 years, dating back to 2003. All software offered by Open Text falls under the revenue segment of “licenses” and accounted for 15.56% of the company's total revenue in 2018.Open Text provides supplementary services related to its EIM software that includes consultations, learning the program, optimizing assets, and more. These professional services are what help clients integrate and implement the EIM software into their businesses. Once businesses purchase the software, they can then receive further support on maximizing the benefits from it. The professional services segment made up about 11.23% of all revenues in 2018.Another source of revenue is from Open Text’s cloud services. The primary functions of its cloud services are securing data, transferring data between different platforms, and providing security eliminating the need for data storage hardware. The cloud services were 29.44% of total revenue for 2018.Lastly, the most profitable revenue segment is the customer support provided with the products. This is a yearly subscription service and provides insurance if anything goes wrong with any of the products or services, and Open Text will provide all support necessary to ensure operation. This customer support includes various software upgrades, online support, functionality issues, product information, and more. The customer support segment made up 43.77% of the total revenue in 2018.Overall, cloud services and customer support are what drive the revenue growth of the business. The bread and butter for this company has been its ability to provide a unique product to clients and provide exceptional support to ensure the products are integrated properly and efficiently. Revenue has grown by about 16% on average over the past 5 years, and has ramped up to 25.59% in 2017 and 22.88% in 2018.In 2012, Open Text hired a new CEO by the name of Mark Barrenechea. When he was brought on as CEO, he was diagnosed with cancer, but that did not affect the business operations, which speaks volumes on how he handles adversity. Shareholders started seeing instant returns when he took over the company, and this chart from the 2018 annual report illustrates this point.Source 1: Open Text 2018 Annual ReportShareholder returns have more than doubled during his time in office, staying on pace with other major indexes. When Mark Barrenechea joined the company, its enterprise value was $2,128,945. As of 2018, the enterprise value is $11,462,711, increasing more than 5 times over under his watch.The fundamental analysis is what really makes Open Text shine and is why I am bullish in the long term. Over the trailing twelve months (TTM) ended March 31, 2019, it is trading at a multiple of 39.37 times earnings. Looking at the closet comparable public companies, you can see the Open Text stands out among the rest.Source 2: Pitchbook.comThe majority of the companies on this list have no price-to-earnings because they have negative earnings, with some having negative earnings for consecutive years. The closest true competitor to Open Text is Box (BOX) and it too is not a profitable company. According to CSIMarket.com, the industry average P/E ratio for companies in the software industry is 31.29, which puts Open Text at the sweet spot right near the average.Another metric that speaks to Open Text’s profitability is their operating margins. In the TTM ended March 31, 2019, the company has an EBITDA margin of 35.70%, well above the industry average of 27%. This margin has grown every year since 2012, which can be attributed to the consistent acquisitions made by the company as well as its increasing client base. Open Text has a much lower cost of sales because most of its assets can be reused several times and most expenses come from payroll. As with all companies operating in the software industry, operations are not as capital-intensive as those in retail.The net profit margin is, and has been, on the low side, with the most recent number being 9.58% over the TTM. The company's operating expenses have been growing very fast because of the increased number of clients using the software, and this is something to keep an eye on in the future. The majority of the ""selling and marketing"" line item expense is from payroll and commissions to employees. We will need to look for cost cutting in R&D and SG&A in future reports, which will indicate increased profitability in the future.It is always important to analyze companies from several different angles, and one approach I like is using the Uniform Adjusted Financial Reporting Standards (UAFRS). A firm that specializes in using this reporting method is Valens Research. I will not explain how UAFRS is performed, but the concept is that it removes a lot of the GAAP and non-GAAP accounting methods from the numbers on the annual report and represents a more accurate number.Looking at return on assets, there is an incredibly large difference in the reported number in the annual statements and the number after UAFRS.Source 3: Valens ResearchUsing UAFRS to achieve an adjusted ROA number shows a company that is utilizing its assets much more effectively than using as-reported numbers. This signals to us that Open Text is providing quality services that clients keep returning to use. Since 2007, we have seen remarkable consistency in this ability. Open Text has been expanding its products and services over the years, and there is no evidence that this will slow down anytime soon.The overall strength of the company is evident from its operating metrics, profitability metrics, and multiples. Zooming in more on the balance sheet, I want to point out the ""deferred revenue"" line item. This has been the fastest-growing liability on the balance sheet and relates to cloud services and customer support agreements. As a result, this has an increasing effect on the company’s enterprise value, giving it additional cash up-front that allows it to service debt obligations and growth opportunities.The current capital structure is about 60% debt and 40% equity. In 2013, Open Text’s closing debt balance was $565 million, and that has more than quadrupled up to $2.620 billion in 2018. This was a major shift in the capital structure of the company, which was about 44% debt and 56% equity. This shift lowered its weighted average cost of capital and was one of the catalysts that saw the stock price more than double from 2013 to 2018.The continued efforts towards maximizing return on invested capital and lowering its costs of obtaining capital has been fueling the accelerating growth since 2013. We’ve seen the balance sheet grow every single year, and have seen increasing strength in operating metrics. Looking forward, the company has maintained a steady cash balance that should continue to service all debt obligations and fuel expansion. Consistently high margins have been a catalyst towards increasing the cash balance all the way to the bottom line.Looking forward, I think we will see a lot of the same from Open Text. The company will keep adding to its existing software and services by way of acquisitions and getting rid of potential competitors in the process. As it stands now, the Enterprise Management software market is expected to be worth $213.43 billion by 2020 with a compound annual growth rate of 7.4%. With that growth rate, we can estimate the total market size for 2018 was around $183.01 billion. Based on reported revenue for Open Text in 2018, the calculated market share is 1.5% for the entire enterprise application software market.The increasing use of cloud services among businesses has seen Open Text’s cloud revenue grow every year. Looking forward, it is reasonable to assume the company’s cloud services will continue to grow as it adds to this through acquisitions and research & development. Mark Barrenechea has completed two acquisitions in 2019 to go along with the 15 acquisitions completed during his tenure. He states in an interview with Bloomberg that he has been looking for genuine assets from the acquisitions and integrating them to create a “powerhouse cloud platform.”With all this being said, the key drivers are going to be the growing cloud platform and customer support offered to its clients. Aside from announcing more M&A activity, the company has been quiet on plans moving forward. Open Text is very aware of what its strengths are and what it needs to do to continue this growth moving forward. I think these initiatives include expanding its portfolio of large clients, scaling internationally, improving its cloud software, possibly through a large acquisition, and growing its existing service offerings.The major risks to the growth of Open Text is going to be large competitors such as Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) in the cloud space. These two companies, along with others, are established and are growing fast, as well as gaining market share in cloud services. The threat comes in the form of brand names as well, because Open Text is a much less-known name in the technology sector.I believe that Open Text is going to compete with the Microsofts and Amazons of today through its EIM software and customer support. The company’s platform allows for easy integration of its cloud services, and as its business clientele grows, so will its cloud services. If Open Text can continue to effectively leverage its EIM software going forward, then I believe its other services will grow because of the satisfaction of current clients.For a recap, I have presented the products and services Open Text offers, a comparison between similar public companies, and the underlying profitability metrics. I am bullish on Open Text in the long term because of its ability to show consistently high fundamentals. The P/E ratio is in line with industry averages and above that of its peers. Several comparable public companies that operate in the EIM software space have consistently negative net income and are not returning capital to shareholders, and Open Text is one of the few that does.Open Text has been extremely active in acquiring other companies, and there are no signs that suggest this will stop anytime soon. This has allowed the company to quickly expand its product offerings and enhance the capabilities of its existing software. Its asset growth has benefited from this as well, increasing the enterprise value over time. The adjusted ROA number shows us a more accurate representation of how effectively the company is using its assets to generate profits.It is reasonable to see the stock price double over the next 5 years. Open Text is part of a booming industry that is still in its infancy. The strength and growth of the company’s balance sheet should eliminate worries about additional stock offerings, servicing debt, or losing enterprise value. Barring any major recessions, we should see this expansion continue and growing market share for the company.As the Enterprise Information Management software industry grows, Open Text will be at the forefront with a very established business. Cloud services are growing at a torrid pace, and Open Text has the advantage of having an established cloud platform. The CEO has pushed this company to new heights since he came on board in 2012 and is a stalwart on the management team. Open Text will be a major player in the technology sector in the future, and I hope this article sheds some light as to why."
4316432,35181,2020-01-13T06:23:03-05:00,"Open Text is trading near an all-time high.Leader in several markets including content services, business networks.Business model is primarily based on M&A and has anemic sales growth.European headwinds and IRS landmine give me cause for hesitation.","I started out today in a great mood, having discovered another promising break-out stock, Open Text Corporation (OTEX). This stock is trading near all-time highs at ~$46.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)This stock appears to be ready to keep hitting new heights. My initial read via the most recent earnings presentation ramped up my excitement to a new level. On the surface, this company appears to be a champion of digital transformation, a leader in many areas, such as content services, business networks, media management, process automation and so forth.(Source: Open Text 2020 Q1 Earnings Call Presentation)As I continued my research, my initial enthusiasm regarding this company started to wane. For a market leader, I found the company's revenue growth to be unsatisfactory. The company appears to be highly dependent on M&A activity and with substantial revenues generated outside the United States, is apparently at the mercy of global economic conditions. Or at least this is my understanding based on the anemic revenue growth this company is experiencing.In addition, Open Text appears to have several unresolved tax disputes with various governments. Perhaps one dispute I could understand and accept. But there are three disputes ongoing and who knows what other skeletons there might be hiding in the closet. In the case of the IRS, back taxes and penalties could be substantial, close to $800 million.Open Text is modestly overvalued according to my relative valuation technique. If the company was a high-growth dynamo with lots of potential then I wouldn't consider the valuation to be a problem. But for a low growth company, I don't feel compelled to jump on the bandwagon.For all of the above reasons, I am giving Open Text a neutral rating.As I have explained in a recent article, high-growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. Note: Open Text, with revenue growth of 2%, is technically not a high-growth company, but it is operating in a high-growth market segment, therefore I judge it based on high-growth company parameters.In fact, such companies often confound analysts who inevitably attempt to apply their beloved value metrics, with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, free cash flow margin, and the software company ""Rule of 40%.""Open Text had annual revenue growth of 2%, significantly lower than in previous years.(Source: Portfolio123)While I wasn't able to establish the exact cause of the anemic growth from the earnings call transcript, there were indications that US currency strength, as well as various economic conditions outside the United States, contributed to the result:Open Text’s free cash flow margin TTM has been positive for at least the last 10 years and is currently sitting at a very healthy 21% of revenues.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40%. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40% is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin add up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In Open Text’s case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 2% + 21% = 23%The calculation comes out well below 40%. If I were to use the EBITDA margin in place of FCF margin as some analysts do, then the calculation would come out to approximately 40%, and Open Text would pass.(Source: Portfolio123)When a company doesn't meet the Rule of 40%, I like to make sure that the company isn't burning cash excessively. One way to make this determination is to examine the SG&A expense margin. This is shown in the chart below. Note that R&D expenses are included in the SG&A expense on this chart.(Source: Portfolio123)The SG&A expense margin of approximately 36% is quite low. Company management is frugal with regards to spending. And I actually have to be somewhat critical of that. It seems that the company is too cautious with money to the point where it is not getting sufficient returns.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Open Text is above the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is modestly higher than its peers', given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Open Text is valued a little higher than the average stock in my digital transformation universe.One area that I monitor and use to judge company management is that of revenue and earnings beats. When company management gives out conservative guidance, the company generally beats analysts' estimates.(Source: Portfolio123)Open Text has missed analysts' sales estimates 3 out of the last 5 quarters. This is one area that I find a little concerning. Past misses tend to be an indicator of future misses.Open Text's unresolved problems with various government tax liabilities are the tipping point for my assessment of this company. Not considering the tax problems, Open Text is a so-so investment. With the tax problems, I suggest avoiding this company. The following quotes are taken from the latest quarterly report.United States:Canada:India:The US and Canadian tax liabilities are substantial, Indian liabilities not as much but there is a pattern here that investors should be wary of. Typically when one sees multiple occurrences of this sort of activity, it is just the tip of the iceberg (my speculation)Open Text is a significant player in digital transformation and is the market leader in several areas, according to Gartner Magic Quadrant and Forrester Waves, including content services, business networks, media management, and process automation. Given such market leadership in areas that should command a high level of growth, I am somewhat disappointed in Open Text's actual sales growth. The company's earnings are good, but I am looking for substantial revenue growth, and I am not seeing it.To a large extent, Open Text depends on M&A to fuel its growth. Company management makes acquisitions based on value and fit. I believe the value part of the decision-making process is what is holding growth back. While other digital transformation companies are growing by leaps and bounds, Open Text is stagnating and is subject to the mercy of global economic conditions.The open and ongoing tax disputes are what ultimately shifted my opinion on this stock. So despite the nice stock price breakout, I am going to take a pass on Open Text. My rating is neutral."

In addition, it plans to expand its operations within Europe, grow its customer base among the top 200 law firms, and increase its penetration with large enterprise in-house counsel groups.Along with the recent Liaison acquisition, Open Text is making significant and strategic acquisitions to expand its offerings in the managed services space for various verticals.Assuming management doesn't dilute its focus, the deal represents a reasonable price paid to dramatically improve its offerings in the growing legal technology vertical."

With a sound business model, an attractive valuation, and a lot of space for growth in the enterprise information management market, the company is set for continued success.Open Text Corporation is a market leader in the global enterprise information management software market, serving over 120,000 customers all around the world, with no single customer accounting for more than 10 percent of the company’s total revenues. The company has approximately 12,200 full-time employees of which 2,000 work in sales and marketing, 3,300 in product development, 2,800 in cloud services, 1,500 in professional services, 1,100 in customer and support and 1,500 in general administrative roles. Most of the company’s revenues come from cloud service subscriptions and customer support.Source: Open Text 10-KAccording to Mark Barrenechea, Vice Chair and Chief Technology Officer, the company is presented with a $100 billion addressable market opportunity in the enterprise information management software business. Putting this into the context of the latest $3.5 billion revenue figure and $13.6 billion market cap, I believe the company may not be even at the very beginning of its growth phase.During the call, Mr. Barrenechea also emphasized integration, innovation, a commitment to delivering a high return on invested capital, and a growth opportunity in Europe.The last point worth highlighting relates to how the company will execute its plan.Over the last decade, the company has developed a strong free cash flow-generating ability which, in relative terms, belongs to the top of the technology industry. In 2010, OpenText’s preceding twelve months free cash flow fluctuated below the $200M level, whereas today it hovers above $750M. In percentage terms, the company’s free cash flow increased by more than 330 percent, exceeding the growth of Alphabet's (GOOG) free cash flow.Besides outstanding free cash flow expansion, the company has healthy profit margins. Currently, the company’s gross, operating, pretax and net profit margin total 56.6, 18.9, 13.7 and 8.6 percent respectively. As discussed during the quarterly earnings call by the CFO of the company, Madhu Ranganathan, adjusted EBITDA margin in fiscal 2021 is expected between 38 and 40 percent. On the other hand, OpenText’s profitability metrics such as ROA, ROE, and ROIC in the most recent fiscal year have slightly deteriorated, partly due to the company’s stumbling net income.A positive signal with respect to OpenText’s future prospects comes from improving website engagement. At the beginning of this year, the company’s website was visited by a little over one million customers. The company’s website traffic has been on the rise in all regions, with the United States, Canada, India, UK, and Hong Kong among the top visiting countries.Source: SimilarwebPlugging-in OpenText's financial statements' figures into my DCF template, the company’s shares seem to be heavily undervalued. Under a perpetuity growth method with a terminal growth rate of 2 percent, constant 20 percent annual revenue growth over the next five years and 18.9 percent EBIT margin, fair value of the stock comes at $120.7. Under the EBITDA multiple approach of a discounted cash flow model, the intrinsic value per share value of the company stands roughly at $74.0 if we assume that the appropriate exit EV/EBITDA multiple in five years' time is around 10x.Source: Author's own Excel modelWhen studied from a different valuation perspective by working with operating earnings multiples, OpenText's shares also appear hugely undervalued. Using the Fast Graphs forecasting calculator with 12 percent adjusted operating earnings growth rate assumption, the company's intrinsic value by the end of November FY2024 are forecast to reach up to $76. This implies a total annualized rate of return upside potential up to 15 percent.Source: F.A.S.T. GraphsLastly, in light of the revenue variation of Peter Lynch's popular earnings line for the projection of probable per share values of the company, OpenText shares' long-run potential seems to be skewed positively. According to my model, assuming 20 percent annual revenue growth, a 2 percent annual equity dilution factor, a price-to-sales PS ratio of around 3.5x, the company's share price by the end of 2022 could hover above $89.Source: Author's own Excel modelTo sum up, OpenText is an exceptional company empowering enterprises with software that facilitates connecting all parts of organizations. Based on its topline growth, the concept of the business appears to be proven; however, stumbling earnings indicate that business competence has yet to be confirmed. Despite near-term challenges, the company’s business model looks sound and valuation absolutely captivating.Disclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion, and does not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

4207614,102137,2018-09-21T13:59:49-04:00,Open Text is undervalued based on historical and expected growth rates.It's a Canadian Dividend All-Star with double-digit growth.The company has a growth through acquisition strategy.,"Canadians don't have many investment options when it comes to technology companies. The technology industry accounts for only 3.9% of the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). In comparison, tech accounts for about a quarter of the S&P 500. What the TSX lacks in quantity however, it makes up in quality. Some of Canada's best tech companies have outperformed the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Much like their peers south of the border, the recent bull run has stretched valuations, and it can be difficult to find good value in the industry. That being said, if you look hard enough there's always value to be found. Case in point: Open Text Corp (OTEX)[TSX:OTEX].Open Text is an Ontario-based software company. It provides a platform and suite of software products and services that assist organizations in finding, utilizing, and sharing business information from any device. The company has a growth through acquisition strategy and can be considered a serial acquirer. Since 2010, the company has made 28 purchases. Its largest being the recent $1.62 billion acquisition of Dell's ECD division. As a result of the deal, Open Text is now the world's leading provider of enterprise information management (NYSEMKT:EIM) systems.Open Text has consistently outperformed the market and has been one of Canada's top performers. Over the past year, the company has returned 14% while the TSX has dragged along, eeking out a 2% gain. It has a compound annual growth rate of 31% over the past five years. Over the past couple of weeks, the company has begun to show signs of weakness. Its stock price is down approximately 5%. Likewise, it has consolidated for the better part of the past month. Hence, the opportunity.Open Text is one of the best valued plays in the software and programming sector. Don't let the company's trailing twelve month price-to-earnings (P/E) of 42.5 fool you. This is a growth stock and is best compared against its expected growth rates. On a forward 12-month basis, the company is trading at a cheap 14 times earnings. This is significantly cheaper than software peers Constellation Software (OTCPK:CNSWF) and Enghouse Systems (OTCPK:EGHSF) which trade at 33.69 and 29.75 forward earnings. This software leader also is trading at a respectable P/E to growth (PEG) of 1.25. For growth stocks, I look for PEG ratios below 1.5 as ratios below one are almost unheard of. Not convinced? Maybe the F.A.S.T. Graph below can help.As you can see, the company's weighted average P/E ratio of 14.7 is well below its normal P/E average of 17.5. This implies 17% upside from today's share price. Open Text is a rare combination of growth and income. It's one of only four tech companies to have achieved Canadian Dividend All-Star status. These are companies who have raised dividends for five or more consecutive years. It also has one of the highest dividend growth rates among all All-Stars with a five year CAGR around 15%. Its payout ratio as a percentage of earnings is a healthy 50% and dividends account for only 23% of free cash flow. As such, investors can expect continued double-digit dividend growth. There isn't much not to like about Open Text. There is however, some concern over slowing growth. The company is expected to grow earnings by approximately 8% over the next couple of years. I believe this to be low. For fiscal 2019, the company has guided to low single-digit organic growth. This does not take into account M&A activity. The last year Open Text failed to make a purchase was in 2007. It has an impressive track record of making shrewd and complimentary acquisitions, all of which add to the company's bottom line. The company has $683 million in cash and there's no reason to expect the company won't continue to be active. On it's latest conference call, Chief Technology Officer Mark J. Barrenechea reaffirmed that ""(they) have the management bandwidth and financial capacity to pursue (their) M&A strategy and to invest in organic growth.""In 2018, the company generated $2.8 billion in revenues. To put that into perspective, Open Text operates in an industry with an estimated market cap of more than $100 billion. There's plenty of room for growth and industry consolidation.Open Text's recent weakness has provided investors with yet another opportunity to pick up the company's shares on the cheap. Its share price has not kept up with its software peers and as such provides the best value in the sector. Canadians looking for tech exposure would do well to add Open Text to their portfolios. It has a reliable history of execution and has consistently outperformed the broader TSX Index."
4130226,103979,2017-12-06T20:06:46-05:00,"Recent acquisitions of Dell EMC, Guidance, and Covisint. These acquisitions will allow Open Text to leverage their platform into different areas and segments in the industry.Increasing amount of ARR and renewal of contracts with major clients to provide a constant revenue stream.Management’s proven successful business strategy and capital allocation priorities.","Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) is a well-established company with a strong brand name and a large list of reliable partners and clients that has continued to grow over the last couple of years. Open Text has been successful in growing their company year-over-year and has distinct plans to continue this growth moving forward. The company creates value through their strategic acquisition process - by acquiring businesses and implementing their successful business model to improve operations and increase margins. Many investors find this growth strategy unappealing because of the lack of confidence in the ability to continue to grow through this strategy. Due to this uncertainty by investors, the price has remained relatively constant and I believe this represents an opportunity for investors willing to look deeper into the company. Open Text supplements this inorganic growth with organic growth that comes in each one of their segments that are continuously expanding. The company will continue to create value through management’s strategic capital allocation strategy and strong organic growth initiatives and this will continue to drive the stock price.Open Text Corporation has continuously grown over the past 10 years at a CAGR of approximately 14%. The company has established a business strategy that has allowed for consistent revenue growth year-over-year. As stated in their annual report, “We see our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies and assets into our business as a strength and pursuing strategic acquisitions is an important aspect to our growth strategy.” In addition to this, organic growth allows for consistent total growth. Open Text looks at companies that have the potential for high operating margins. They have proven their ability to implement their business model and improve their margins through these acquisitions and continuously creating value. For example, Open Text recently acquired Dell’s (DVMT) EMC operations in which they took operating margins from 13% to 25% in a short period. Open Text also plans to see growth in the upcoming future because of the new products that they will be offering and new services that they can provide due to recent acquisitions. Their new product cycle consists of their new EP2 and EP3 platforms, Magellon (new artificial intelligence software) and services from Covisint (NASDAQ:COVS) such as the Internet of Things. We can expect to see growth in revenues both organically and inorganically. Management is planning to commit 11-13% of revenues to R&D to help produce organic growth and continue to strategically acquire companies that can fit into their business model. During the last twelve months, Open Text has been performing above their last 6-year average and exceeding past their competitors in many aspects as well. For example, EBITDA margins based on a cash basis were increasing from 22.8% to 26.5%, which is beating their competitors by approximately 3%. Net income margins were increasing from 11% to 12.7% as well based on a cash basis. Competitors have a slightly larger net income margin; this is because of the large amortization costs of intangible assets from companies that Open Text has recently acquired. In their most recent earnings call, management mentioned increasing operating margins from around 31% to the range of 34-38% on a Non - GAAP basis. This will be easily feasible based on the increase in margins that they have had in the past and their current strategy. Source: Created by author using ProformaThis will lead to an increase in margins, operating cash flow, and value creation in the future. With this value generation, OTEX will be able to continue to grow by reinvesting their cash flows back into the company or will allow OTEX to pay back some of their senior debt that has been a concern to some investors. Segment BreakdownSource: OTEX Investor PresentationOpen Text's segments consist of Licenses, Cloud Services, Customer Support, and Professional and other services. License revenues consist of fees earned from the licensing of software products to clients. Cloud services and subscription revenues consist of software service offerings, managed service arrangements, and subscriptions revenues relating to on-premise offerings. In simpler terms, services that make day-to-day business easier for companies. Customer Support refers to the support of customers who purchase EIM software products. These services are updated on an annual basis in which customers also renew their licenses. Professional Service and other services refer to consulting and learning services that help customers build solutions that enable them to leverage their investments in Open Text’s technology and in other enterprise systems for the largest possible benefit. As of their most recent annual report, licensing revenues composed about 16% of total revenues, Cloud Services composed about 31%, Customer Support composed about 43%, and Professional composed about 10% of total revenues. Currently, Customer Support is the largest segment, and this is because of all of the renewing and recurring revenues that Open Text receives once they obtain a client. Customer Support has a gross margin of approximately 87%; this is second to the License segment, which has a 96% gross margin. Licensing has little to no costs for their operations since they are simply allowing access to software already created. As reported in their last earnings call, Customer Support is the largest growing segment in the past twelve months. This is a positive sign for Open Text; this shows that currently they are growing the fastest in their largest segments with one of the largest margins. This shows that over time overall margins will increase and therefore generate more operating cash flows that can be used to fuel more growth and create value for the company in the long term.Open Text Corporation is an industry leader in application software and cloud services. The company has established an impressive portfolio of large clients that has allowed them to make a name for themselves. Management has developed a strong growth strategy that has continuously proven to be successful through mergers and acquisitions, and supplemented by organic growth. Open Text also has found a successful capital allocation process in which they continue to reinvest money into the correct areas of the company and fuel growth. Open Text will continue to grow because of these three pillars. One being their increasing EBITDA margins due to successful acquisitions. Second being their extremely low effective tax rate of approximately 15%. Third being their increasing amount of operating cash flows that can be used to grow the business efficiently. Open Text has remained stable over the past year and looking forward into 2018, the company will continue to grow and create value. Open Text right now is a Buy.Finally, I believe it is important to look into recent changes in ownership in Open Text over the past year. Within the year, hedge funds have increased their position by approximately 3%. This increased interest shows that hedge funds believe that Open Text has huge potential and since it has been increasing over the year, it shows that hedge funds have longer-term interest in the company which is a positive sign. Another positive sign in relation to their ownership is their relatively low short interest. As a percent of float, short interest is below 3%. This supplements the fact that hedge funds are taking long positions rather than short positions in OTEX. With this being said, insiders have been increasing their positions and amount of shares owned as well. This shows that employees of the company believe that the stock price will continue to go up in the future. Over the past six months, insider positions have increased by almost 18%. Some investors believe that Open Text is an average company with some sustainability concerns; however, I believe that the company is a diamond in the rough that has the potential to be the next big tech giant."

        OTEX is diversified across 100,000 clients, but also has 41% of its sales coming from outside the Americas.
        Growth-oriented techno companies rarely focus on sharing profits. OTEX paid its first dividend in 2013.","As a Canadian investor, I often feel that our market isn’t diversified enough, especially when it comes down to dividend payers. Once you have reviewed banks, telecoms and the energy sector, you are pretty much done. What if I want a company with strong growth vectors on top of a dividend growth policy? One of my favorite sub-sectors is the “old techs paying dividends.” While I had no difficulties finding 10 solid picks on the U.S. market, doing the same work on the Canadian market was quite a challenge.I was excited when I analyzed Open Text (OTEX) because it shows exactly what I want: fantastic growth prospects combined with dividend growth perspectives. Let me open the door of a great Canadian company today!We often say that “knowledge is power”. Well, for businesses, keeping track of their own knowledge can be quite a challenge. Each day, tons of information is collected about products, sales, employees, expenses, contracts, etc. This information is piling up into mountains of unreadable reports.How can you mange all this data? Several companies use an Enterprise Information Management (EIM) system. EIM helps managers make better decisions by organizing the information, allowing them to access it rapidly, understand it and trust it.OTEX is a leader in the industry and Canada’s largest one. It helps over 100,000 customers to share, store, retrieve and analyze their company’s information.Source: OTEX Q3 2018 presentationThe company’s business model is built around something I love: recurring revenues! OTEX is selling their license (recurring), then offering cloud services through subscriptions (recurring) and customer support (recurring!!!). In other words, as much as OTEX grows, its recurring business grows accordingly.Source: YchartsOTEX counts on three different vectors to grow. Its first source of growth is organic. The world of the Cloud and the Internet of Things is only just beginning. OTEX develops new products to assist businesses making the switch to the Cloud and managing their data in more efficient matters.Second, Open Text is affected by gluttony. It is continuously acquiring new businesses that allow it to integrate additional services to its platform. OTEX has a disciplined approach when it comes down to deploying its capital and has built a strong expertise in integrating their new companies rapidly.Source: OTEX Q3 2018Finally, I’ve already mentioned the recurring revenue with lots of hype in my introduction. OTEX’s services require its clients to pay on a yearly basis to maintain or upgrade their package. Therefore, the company keeps building on a foundation that is growing year after year. OTEX definitely display all the assets it needs to be part of my top Tech dividend list.OTEX is a relatively young dividend payer with only 5 years dividend history. However, management has successfully kept its aggressive growth-by-acquisition strategy on top of doubling its dividend during this period.Source: YchartsDon’t ignore OTEX for its low yield just yet. On top of showing a 103% dividend growth over the past 5 years, the stock surged by 125%. It’s hard to offer a 3%+ yield with this kind of growth!Source: YchartsBecause it is a subscription service, OTEX is a real money-making machine. This is how its cash payout ratio is below 30%, leaving plenty of room to keep both growth and dividend growth policy on the table. Shareholders can expect double-digit dividend growth for a while with this one.Open Text is evolving in a changing environment and is continuously one iteration away from being obsolete. Several competitors are also lurking to grab OTEX clients. Many are larger U.S. companies with more resources. OTEX has built a strong name and there is a switching cost for clients, but it would not be impossible for OTEX to stop being the flavor of the month. Plus, OTEX is condemned to grow by acquisitions. With several transactions under its belt, it doesn’t seem like a problem. However, this could lead to hectic quarters.What can you expect after a stock has surged more than 100% in the past 5 years? Surprisingly enough, OTEX shows a reasonable forward PE of 14. There is not a case of PE expansion, in fact, OTEX price is growing according to its revenue on a consistent basis.Source: YchartsI’ve tried to use the dividend discount model since dividend growth is at the center of my investment strategy. I kept an aggressive dividend growth rate at 12% for the first 10 years and then reduced it to 7%. I used a 10% discount model since tech stocks are more volatile due to their business type.Please read the Dividend Discount Model limitations to fully understand my calculations.As you can see, OTEX is currently trading at a premium. This is often the case when you try to value a growth-oriented company offering a low yield with the Dividend Discount Model. Nonetheless, the premium isn’t too bad.To be honest, the only reason why I haven’t pulled the buy trigger on this one is because I found better (read undervalued) opportunities on the market. OTEX is definitely on my watch list and I can’t wait to see the stock dropping under $30 USD so I can start buying. The fact that it is a small player compared to US tech stocks is also preventing me from adding it to my portfolio.

4145701,98236,2018-02-12T12:51:00-05:00,"OpenText reported results of its fiscal Q2 operations on January 31.The results beat expectations significantly in terms of both margins and revenues.The company achieved significant organic growth for the first time in several quarters, and also over-attained its own margin expectations.The company does not choose to provide specific and granular guidance and did not do so even in the wake of these results that exceeded its own projections.Although the shares initially spiked in the wake of the company's strong operational attainment, they retraced the upside move in the wake of the stinging stock market correction.","In the wake of the extreme volatility and the market correction of the last 10 days, one sometimes is left to wonder at the basis for fundamental research. I have no particular knowledge or insight into how long this market correction cycle might last. I'm not too sure that anyone else does either. I have taken rather pointed exception to articles on this site that compare this correction or this season of market vulnerability to some previous market bubble. Despite the seeming violence of the correction of the last several days, I still would maintain that there's nothing apocalyptic or even approaching apocalyptic in this pullback and there's no analog to the tech bubble at the start of the century. If this earnings season has shown anything, it is that the business environment for enterprise technology has continued its overall improvement, that the trends of the past several years remain solidly in place with regard to cloud, analytics, artificial intelligence, etc., that most industry participants are enjoying rising margins and that tax reform legislation is leading to both repatriation and higher forecasted EPS. Yes, wage inflation, long targeted as a problem for its lack, is rising now, but that places a greater incentive on enterprises to accelerate their capex to improve their productivity. A 3% rise in productivity would produce zero-unit labor cost inflation, although interest rates might rise anyway due to the impact of Fed policies.Am I being overly emollient? I do not write columns about things that I can produce without value add. Valuations look high because business trends appear to be quite strong. Having survived a few major market corrections, I find this one, at least to date, to be nothing more than a garden variety correction. I'm as familiar as anyone with the tech bubble having worked as a tech analyst during the upswing and the collapse. There are simply few analogs to the events of 18 years ago when people were counting clicks and eyeballs and not revenues and cash flow.What the correction has done, in my opinion, is to put a number of equities on sale at valuations that can be seen as presenting investors with better buys. The correction, for the most part, as has been the case for many such prior events, has been relatively indiscriminate. Indeed, it is hard to keep up with all of the companies that have reported strong operational performance but whose shares have reflected investor displeasure with their valuation.Is Open Text (OTEX) the appropriate company on which to focus attention and energy as a strategy for taking advantage of the pullback? There are plenty of companies on which I could write and plan to write over the coming weeks that are quite attractive given the correction. Being laid low by a seasonable malady, rather than enjoying a more active role in the debacle of the past few days, has put my report writing behind what I had planned. Rather than immediately reprising some further paeans of praise for the results of Amazon (AMZN) or Microsoft (MSFT), I will try to look at a few dusty corners that have seen just as much carnage as well as some more controversial names, where earnings are just part of the story. The conventional advice is that the larger, more widely held names will come back first - and that may be so this time around. On the other hand, I like to look at dustier corners, and it would be hard to deny that OTEX is not in a dustier corner. I have written about OTEX and its technologies several times in the past. It is probably the leading competitor in the Enterprise Information Management (EIM) space, a not inconsiderable component of the enterprise IT landscape. The company bought its largest single competitor, Documentum, from Dell/EMC about a year ago and has already integrated that major purchase. I do not propose to try to reprise an analysis of all the different technologies that are offered by this company as I have done so on previous occasions. It has started to execute a cross-selling opportunity that has been a long time in gestation. It probably offers more and deeper functionality in the EIM space than its principal competitors which include Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and IBM (NYSE:IBM). I have linked to the latest Gartner evaluation of the competitors in the space which was made last September. As can be seen, OTEX remains a leader with a very positive set of evaluations.OpenText reported what might reasonably be thought of as a blow-out quarter, the shares initially rallied and are now below where they were before they reported the quarter. Perhaps the shares are higher than they might have been had they not reported the strong quarter. Certainly, all of the analysts covering the name raised their expectations for the balance of the year in terms of both revenues and earnings. It is hard to gainsay the success of operational performance. OpenText is a consolidator, but a consolidator with a product strategy that offers its clients a unified set of solutions that can be integrated in what is called the EIM space. Most of its growth has been and will almost surely be inorganic. As such, the First Call consensus numbers rarely reflect the reality of the company’s ability to grow. The question for some is going to be whether the share price declines on an absolute basis, and the improvement in the company’s relative valuation appropriately reflect the changing environment or if there is still further appreciation potential. Simply put, my answer is that there is. I expect most analysts to increase their price targets. So far, I haven’t seen any analysts raising their target price or their ratings -although 14 of 16 analysts who cover the name already rate it as a buy. I do think that the company will see more and larger estimate revisions than have been published thus far. Given the robust performance of operating cash flow, the company seems likely to increase its dividend and perhaps to reinitiate its share buyback operations. In addition, given these results, I suspect that management will be a bit more aggressive in locating and consummating additional acquisitions as was foreshadowed during the course of the conference call.Although the 13% share price increase in the wake of an earnings announcement might have seemed substantial at the time, it proved to be ephemeral. The shares are lower now than they were before earnings were reported. The shares made a previous high in January 2017, and since that time have languished while the IGV index appreciated by 44% over the same span. So, on a relative basis, OTEX shares have lots of catching up to do. Many investors remain unconvinced that the company’s overall business strategy is capable of producing positive results over any relevant time frame. And even the organic growth achieved this quarter is not going to quell all of those doubts. But I think the combination of organic growth coupled with a new aspirational target for margins just might be adequate to cause some institutions to look at the name with more favor.OpenText has had a credibility problem with investors because of its past inability to produce organic growth. This, in turn, has lead to muted top-line estimates, and some lackluster projections with regard to earnings growth. Obviously, one quarter of over attainment is not dispositive of anything. And OpenText basically refuses to give any hints as to quarterly guidance. The company has raised its longer-term margin targets a bit, and of course the CEO was optimistic on the call - but specifics as to the expectations for the next two quarters were more left to the imagination than laid out in detail.For some, including this writer, the most impressive achievement during the quarter was the information that Documentum or the ECD division of Dell/EMC, which the company acquired just a year ago, had reached 33% operating margins last quarter and was now on the OTEX business model. In addition, two other significant acquisitions, Covisint and Guidance Software, acquired in the course of 2017, became profitable last quarter - a substantial improvement from the performance that both companies had achieved before they were purchased.OpenText is a complex company both because of its many acquisitions and its many consumption options. That can make it more difficult to confirm the trends that the company reports. That said, this was as “clean” a quarter as any that OTEX has reported in quite some time. There are more than a few bits and pieces that need to be reviewed. While the company does not specifically report organic growth, the calculations I have used which add back the reported revenues from Documentum/ECD, as well as from Covisint and Guidance, suggest organic growth in the range of 3%-4%, substantially above the organic growth of about 1% calculated the prior quarter.I think that to some extent the company’s organic growth comparisons are constrained by the process it uses to get its acquired businesses onto its operating model. Overall, anecdotal checks suggest that OTEX is maintaining or perhaps gaining share in most of the many different components of the EIM business, in part because it can offer users more cross technology solutions than its competitors. I think the level of organic growth that the company has achieved would be much more impressive were there some appropriate mechanism for placing it into context. Much of the improvement this past quarter was a factor of stronger license revenues than anticipated probably a function of stronger sales activity in core content management which includes Documentum. But all the other categories for which the company reports revenues showed substantial gains as well.Overall, reported revenue growth was 35%. The company reported 31% year-over-year growth in annual recurring revenue. Annual Contract Value rose by almost 5.5% sequentially, basically an organic number and one that's less influenced by seasonality compared to many of the company’s other reported metrics.Needless to say, the 35% reported growth is mainly in-organic, but quite impressive nonetheless. In developing expectations for this company, it is important to note that both the anniversary of acquisitions, as well as new standards for doing business on the part of those acquisitions, can lead to quarterly ups and downs. At the moment, OTEX does not have any pending acquisitions, but the CEO suggested that the pipeline for acquisitions is strong and the company essentially has a strategy that requires acquisitions. It would be reasonable to anticipate that the company will consummate a couple of noticeable acquisitions before it reports quarterly operations on a purely organic.As mentioned, the company had a particularly strong license revenue quarter. Large license deals more than doubled. Overall, license revenue rose from 12% of revenues in Q1 to 19% of revenues this past quarter. Because of the very strong license revenue performance, the ARR proportion fell to 70% of revenues. The company did see an unusual spike in Public Sector license revenues, but the number in actual dollar terms was not substantial. The company’s gross margins rose from 72% to 74% sequentially. That again is partially a result of the higher license mix as license revenues carry higher gross margins. The company did show noticeable leverage in terms of operating leverage. Operating expenses, as most traditionally presented, rose by about 25% while total revenues rose by 35%. The improvement shown was across all three major operating expense categories. Overall, non-GAAP operating margins reached 36.5% of revenues compared to 34% of revenues in the prior year.The company hasn’t paid taxes at a statutory rate for some years now, and thus the new tax rates are not a major factor in forecasting EPS.As mentioned earlier, the operating leverage has encouraged the company to raise its longer-term margin target to 40% from a prior level of 38%. Management forecast that the company would attain its operating margin goal this year but did not forecast anything more specific than generalities about second half revenue growth. Since the revenue growth metric will be a major determinant in the actual level of operating margins, the odds are that the company has a significant opportunity to beat expectations and guidance.The company had a strong cash flow quarter. Much of growth in cash flow related to a massive growth in depreciation as well as to the improvement in GAAP profitability. In addition, the deferred revenue account declined at a lower rate than might be anticipated because of normal seasonality. Stock based comp has been flat year-over-year and was less than 5% of cash flow from operations. The company did not generate cash flow from changes in other assets and liabilities. OTEX does not forecast cash flow, but based on the levels of GAAP profits and depreciation, it seems probable that the company can generate as much as $600 million in free cash flow this year as its Q3 is historically its high point for margins.One of the more frustrating elements of making specific projections for this company is the lack of specific forward guidance. I do not purport to have some vision as to how all the specific components of this business might perform in a given quarter. There are some investors who are not totally fixated on quarterly performance and OTEX management has suggested on many different occasions that providing specific quarterly guidance can result in incenting dysfunctional corporate behavior Perhaps, but the fact is that most analysts use a company forecast as something of a marker in making their own set of projections. Typically, in the wake of a quarter which was such a significant over-attainment, management would at the least address the issues that were creating a substantial increase in demand. That didn’t happen in this latest quarterly earnings call. Despite numerous queries on the subject, the CEO simply stuck with a mantra of re-affirming prior guidance. About all that was said on the subject of guidance was that Q3 is typically a low point for revenues and a high point for CFFO.In terms of what the company actually reports, that really doesn’t happen all that often because of the cadence of acquisitions. The consensus forecast revenues in the March quarter is around $695 million, which would be $40 million less than the $735 million level reported for Q2. But the real seasonality for this company has been in its license revenue which at this point is running at only a $100 million quarterly rate. The growth in cloud services and subscriptions is not likely to be seasonal and customer support is actually more a function of prior quarter license revenues than anything else. So, even without guidance, I think it is fair to conclude that the most likely scenario for quarterly progression is somewhat above that which is embodied by the First Call consensus.My own belief is that with the very rapid progress in getting Documentum onto the OTEX business model, and with the strong improvement in results from recently acquired Covisint and Guidance in terms of turning these business which had perpetual money-losing sinks, from a loss to a profit, there will be fewer constraints in optimizing growth and market share progress for OTEX. The TAM for EIM is said to be near $40 billion and according to market research analysis, it is growing at double-digit rates. While, to be sure, there are numerous companies who compete in different components of the EIM space, OTEX is one of the leaders and is perceived by many users as the premier vendor in this space. Gartner ranks them a leader in the space as has been the case for a dozen years or more. I think it is reasonable to expect less than historical seasonality for OpenText simply because as recurring revenue rises as a percentage of the total revenue mix and license revenue declines, normal seasonality will be less of an issue than has heretofore been the case. That suggests that the consensus forecast for this current quarter can be readily exceeded, and the same might be readily said with regard to the current operating margin projection. So far this year, the company is exceeding its target operating model and I suspect it will continue to do so during the balance of the year.At this point, the consensus revenue growth forecast for fiscal 2019 calls for revenue growth of just 4% along with a modest level of operating margin enhancement. Again, I wouldn’t take those estimates terribly seriously and so far as it goes analysts really don’t take their own models that seriously given that the current First Call consensus price target is 30% above the current share price.Almost surely, OTEX will continue to acquire businesses and almost surely it will be able to buy businesses that can be molded to achieve its operating model in a year or less. And the company is essentially forecasting annual operating margin growth of 150 basis points and there is every reason to believe that kind of target. I think OTEX shares would achieve a higher valuation if the company provided the level of guidance provided by its peers. Perhaps the advent of the new CFO might lead to such a development, but I certainly would not count on that.OpenText shares have been valued as a roll-up for many years and in some ways that makes sense. Most of the company’s growth has been inorganic and the company plans to maintain a substantial inorganic proportion to its growth. But as it happens, the company has had the ability to maintain a mid-teen’s revenue growth rate for more than a decade at this point. At some juncture investors need to value this company based on what it has actually achieved, even if it has done so in a fashion that's not typical of most standard IT growth companies.It should be self evident that OTEX doesn’t have a traditional technology moat of the kind that would appeal to many tech investors. It does have plenty of competitors that offer a set of comparable features and functionality. But as mentioned, it has remained in the leader’s quadrant of the Gartner MQ report for a dozen years now. With its acquisitions and ability to drive profitability, it has achieved a consistent improvement in earnings and there's no reason to believe that this trend is ephemeral or likely to end at any point in the near term.Further, its valuation is quite reasonable and particularly so in the wake of blow-out earnings that have not been recognized by the share price. The company currently has 267 million shares outstanding and the shares closed Friday at $34.43. That yields a market capitalization of $9.2 billion. The company has net debt of about $2.3 billion and that yields an enterprise value of $11.5 billion. I think a reasonable 12-month forward revenue estimate would be about $3.2 billion-plus which of course includes some allowance for acquisitions that have not yet been announced or consummated. Thus, based on my estimates which diverge to an extent from the First Call consensus, the EV/S is 3.6X.The current consensus forecast for earnings per share on a 12-month forward basis is about $2.70-plus. If the company makes some acquisitions, that may turn out to be a reasonable expectation given the dilution likely from any given acquisition when it is first consummated. The EPS rate, on the other hand, ought to be well above $3.00, 12 months from now, and that yields a prospective P/E of just 11.4X. That's far below levels that seem reasonable for this company’s performance and its market position.The company has seen a dramatic improvement in cash flow generation as I indicated earlier. As mentioned, much of this is because of the increase in depreciation and amortization, and a significant component is because of the increase in profitability. I have no reason to believe that the trends that are driving cash flow will not continue over the coming year. I think that on a forward 12-month basis, a reasonable cash flow estimate might be around $550-$600 million depending on capex. At the midpoint of that range, the company will achieve a free cash flow yield of 5%.I have owned OTEX shares for some time at this point and continue to do so. Despite its perceived status as a roll-up, it is actually a company that has occupied a leadership position in a high growth space and is likely to remain a leader in EIM. Its many alliances, including that with SAP (SAP), provide it with a broad distribution channel. After a year of share price inertia, I believe that this company is likely to produce positive alpha going forward."

(OTEX) is the leader in Enterprise Information Management (“EIM”) software & services and offers a powerful resilient SaaS business model. It has a high share of the well-diversified recurring revenues and significant growth opportunities in IoT, cloud-computing and artificial intelligence markets. There is an ongoing digital evolution, with a rapid amount of complex data and technological innovations, that makes running a business complex these days. To solve this problem, OpenText offers a digitized intelligent and connected cloud solutions that help customers to reduce their cost structure, get more secure and become globally connected enterprises.The company has been recently named as a leader in Gartner magic quadrant for content services platform and consistently maintains a double-digit recurring revenue growth rate combined with EBITDA margin expansion and strong operating cash flow generation over the last several years. It has an opportunity to scale its SaaS business with strong upsell and cross-sell activities of the existing customer base. The future M&A activity offers a great opportunity to gain new best-in-class technologies and customers across different verticals. That can drive further shareholder value-creation by achieving high single-digit revenue growth rate, together with margins expansion and disciplined capital allocation over the next several years.OpenText was founded in 1991 and Mr. Mark J. Barrenechea has been its CEO since January 2012. The company is offering a broad line of EIM software products & solutions that help organizations to get the most out of information to support decision-making processes or day-to-day operations. Customers frequently use them in supply chain management to automate their processes and unlock massive amounts of data. That way they can obtain a better insight into their business operations. The company offers software through traditional on-premise solutions, cloud solutions or a hybrid combination of both on-premise and cloud solutions. By offering customers choice and flexibility it creates strong long-term customer value. Managers face challenging strategic decisions on a daily basis because of rapid digital evolution. The latter creates significant changes in the workforce, new business models and regulations like GDPR in Europe. Global media is currently spreading the news about trade tariffs, recession talks, and geopolitical issues. However, OpenText has a strong, resilient business model and can even help companies grow during turbulent times. For instance, if a company in South Korea wants to move its production plant to Vietnam it can easily connect to the OpenText cloud for a digital supply chain. That way it can save money and time compared to making a physical move.Source: Investor Presentation, July 2018One of the key products in 2018 is a Release 16 EP5 which extends security, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and cloud support into the market-leading OpenText EIM platform. It helps organizations with their digital transformation and offers customers a coordinated platform intended to yield the benefits of scale and single-vendor interaction. The company has made significant investments to their cloud infrastructure over the past couple of years. In the Release 16 EP5, virtually all of its products are available in the user-friendly “OpenText Cloud” that can be run from anywhere.Another key product is OpenText Magellan, an enterprise software, that has historically been focused on managing data and content archives. The company is trying to develop artificial intelligence solutions to transform this digital information into useful knowledge and insights for its customers. Source: Investor Presentation, July 2018Strong M&A pipeline, organic growth, and excellent partner distribution are the key growth factors, that will help the company to achieve its target operating cash flow of $1 billion and adjusted EBITDA range of 38% - 40% in FY 21. Key strategic incentives in FY 19 are to broaden reach into EIM, B2B Integration, analytics, discovery, and the cloud computing verticals. The key business growth drivers are a continued transition to the OpenText cloud and increased market penetration. OpenText has a great opportunity to upsell and cross-sell newly gained technologies to its existing sticky customer base or to newly acquired customers. Subscriptions allow users to receive the latest product updates and thereby increase recurring revenue per user and customer support revenue. Latter represents 50% of total revenue in Q1 FY19 and the particular segment has a strong growth opportunity with a transition to the cloud over the next couple of years. A high gross margin of 90% reflects the positive customers’ satisfaction and strong engagement of the platform.OpenText is also well-positioned to take advantage of indirect sales opportunities due to its strategic partnerships with companies like SAP SE, Microsoft, and Oracle. It is also making key investments in the OpenText Cloud that will drive growth and customer adoption in the future. These investments will create even more predictability in the long-term cash flow growth, what would motivate the company to run a hybrid business model, which intends to grow faster than a traditional on-premise business model. However, the whole transition to the SaaS business model has certain risks, as payments are made over time rather than with upfront fees. That can correspond to lower revenues and cash flows in the short term.The M&A will remain one of the key growth drivers as the company is a platform operator. Thus its strategy is to purchase assets and drive value creation through integration and innovation. It has an excellent M&A track record so far, with strong capital allocation discipline by having efficiently deployed $5.8 billion for acquisitions over the last 10 years. Companies in the SaaS universe are trading at EV/REV multiple of 5x and OpenText usually acquires targets at 2x revenues. If the stock market continues with its downturn that would create even more M&A opportunities for value-driven OpenText to take advantage of lower valuations.Source: Investor Presentation, July 2018OpenText labels ideal acquisition targets as special situations that must have a strong leadership team, enable the strong vertical and geographic expansion opportunities and drive higher recurring revenue growth, margin expansion, and strong cash flow generation. The company also emphasizes cost synergies and free cash flow over revenue synergies and the key metric of evaluating M&A efficiency is ROIC with a reported value of 17.5% in FY18.OTEX Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsBased on data in YCharts figure above, we can easily spot how large acquisitions usually drive strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Lack of large acquisitions usually results in lower revenue growth, for instance, in 2015 and 2018. However, the company is still driving margin expansion despite the slightly lower revenue growth in 2018. The key reason is the successful integration of acquisition targets with significant cost savings. Acquisitions and asset purchases usually take a little longer time to reach its full market potential or cost synergies as the company doesn’t offer consumer type of products like a Tesla model 3.Source: Investor Presentation, July 2018The company has a total addressable market of $100 Billion, with huge growth opportunities in IoT, cloud computing and artificial intelligence markets. According to the Forbes website, the enterprise SaaS market is growing by 32% per year. I firmly believe once the company transitions into the ""pure"" SaaS business model it will achieve a higher CAGR over the long run. The cloud computing market is highly competitive and the primary competitor is IBM, with numerous other software vendors such as Veeva Systems, j2 Global, Pegasystems and Adobe Systems. In certain markets, OpenText also competes against certain divisions of large companies like Oracle and Microsoft. However additional competition or a disruptive innovation could cause a market share loss, intensified pricing pressure, and reduced margins.Source: 10-Q, October 2018The company reported, total GAAP revenues of $667.1 million in Q1 FY19, compared to $640.6 million in Q1 FY18, missing the analyst estimates of $687.4 million. Both gross margin and operating margin increased 90bps to 66.1% and 120bps to 14.9%, respectively. Margins expansion was driven by the stronger revenue growth from cloud-based offerings together with well optimized and flat costs in Sales & Marketing and R&D compared to Q1 FY18. The company reported Q1 FY19 non-GAAP net profit and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $161.6 million and $0.60, respectively, in-line with analysts’ consensus EPS estimate of $0.59 and up 10% compared to Q1 FY18 numbers. It has $787.9 million in cash & cash equivalents and 1.7x consolidated net leverage ratio. Therefore the company has the capital flexibility to continue with its strategic acquisitions at even better valuations at the moment.In the OpenText cloud, there were 9 customer transactions over $1 million compared to 7 deals in Q1 FY 18, together with strong reported demand in Financial, Consumer Goods, Technology, and Healthcare industries. The company completed an acquisition of Liaison Technologies for $310 million in December 2018, which is a provider of cloud-based application integration and data management solutions and has a powerful business model with 100% cloud-based recurring revenues and strong renewal rates. Liaison will be integrated into OpenText business network and will offer customers to build new application technologies in mobile, SaaS, cloud, etc. That will help customers to address the massive explosion of data these days by offering them a strong framework to speed up complex information integration and modernize their global value chains. I expect OpenText to pursue such acquisitions in the near future, that will follow digital evolution trends and expand accordingly technical capabilities of OpenText cloud-based solutions.There is a very important ongoing dispute with IRS, regarding the corporate reorganization in fiscal 2010. Following the comments from IRS, an expected additional NOPA could result in an aggregate liability of approximately $585 million, inclusive of U.S federal and state taxes, penalties, and interest. However, OpenText will vigorously contest the decision, what might lead to the incurrence of significant expenses.OTEX PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe analyst consensus estimate for FY 19 is total revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $2,841.4 million and $2.67, respectively. Shares are now trading at forward P/E and forward EV/REV multiple of ~12.5x and ~3.7x, respectively. Both multiples are trading at a discount compared to the peer group and also at the discount compared to the SaaS market average EV/REV multiple of ~5x. As plenty of M&A deals in SaaS universe are going at more than 10x revenues, therefore, I believe the current stock price is undervalued and in the case, OpenText gets acquired one day, the stock price can rise over three times. If the stock market continues to fall, I would “buy the dip” and slowly build up the position.OpenText Corp. is still an interesting buy even though the stock has outperformed S&P 500 over the last several years. Considering the recent US stock market sell-off and overall bearish sentiment on the Wall Street any business growth slowdown or lower than expected guidance over the next several quarters might be a trigger for a significant decrease in the stock price. The key bullish catalysts are the continued organic and inorganic market penetration as the company has robust up-sell and cross-sells opportunities to the existing customer base and also to newly acquired customers. Another important catalyst is a powerful, resilient business model that doesn’t feel strong adverse effects during turbulent times or in a recession. Key risks to my thesis are intensified competition in the cloud computing market, ongoing tax dispute with IRS, or a significant slowdown in recurring revenue growth rate."
4045307,35181,2017-02-13T08:39:24-05:00,"First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY) is the first and only ETF to provide exposure to the fast-growing cloud computing industry.Between now and 2020, worldwide spending on public cloud services is expected to soar to more than $195 billion.Despite the great promise for cloud computing, the ETF has not really performed much better than the S&P 500.I devised an investment strategy that significantly outperforms the S&P 500. The model portfolio periodically chooses 5 stocks from the holdings of SKYY.From the 5 stocks, my preference is OTEX, which has 41% ROE, improving analyst rating, falling short interest and a stock price that appears to be breaking out.","First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (NASDAQ:SKYY) is the first and only ETF to provide exposure to the fast-growing cloud computing industry. This market segment is growing by leaps and bounds and should do so for several years to come. For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services recently announced that its operating income increased from $580 million in the year-ago quarter to $926 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced that Azure revenue surged 93% year-over-year.According to research firm IDC:The share price of SKYY should be in the clouds, right?Well, no. Despite the great promise for cloud computing, the ETF has not really performed much better than the S&P 500.In fact, you could get almost the same performance holding the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) with a lot less volatility.The reason for the mediocre return is because there is a limited number of public companies that are focused specifically on cloud technology. Besides small pure play cloud computing companies, SKYY necessarily holds larger firms involved in the cloud computing space, but they derive much of their revenues from other operations. This minimizes or eliminates any advantage that the themed ETF may have over a broad index. I had a similar problem with Global X Internet of Things Thematic ETF (NASDAQ:SNSR) as was described in this article. Fortunately, being a small investor, I can pick and choose from the holdings of SKYY instead of buying the entire ETF.One nice thing about ETFs is that the fund provider must, by law, publish the stock holding daily, and this makes the job very easy using Portfolio123, my investment tool of choice.Using Portfolio123, I devised an investment strategy that significantly outperforms the S&P 500. The model portfolio periodically chooses 5 stocks from the 30 stocks held by SKYY.The model ranks the stocks based on two criteria: highest 5-year compound annual sales growth and lowest Beta. The model has been live since July 28, 2016 and has outperformed SKYY by a wide margin.Investors can get access to this model by paying a small monthly subscription fee. Unfortunately, I cannot reveal the 5 picks in this article, but instead, I am going one better, and that is to reveal the one stock from the 5 current holdings that I believe is shooting for the clouds (literally).The stock is Open Text Corporation (NASDAQ:OTEX).Why I Like OTEXOTEX is one of the 5 picks from my cloud computing stock portfolio, which means that the stock has good compound sales growth and relatively low Beta compared to most of the SKYY holdings.The stock price has risen from under $22 to $33 in the last year, and is now near a 52-week high, while sitting at a support level. The stock appears to be ready for take-off.OTEX has a trailing twelve month (TTM) Return on Equity (ROE) of 41.7%, third highest of the cloud computing stock universe, higher than Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) both have higher ROE than OTEX, but have lower 5-year compound sales growth. In the case of IBM, the 5-year sales growth is negative.Open Text announced that it would acquire the Enterprise Content Management division of Dell back in September. Since that point in time analysts have been warming up to OTEX, with the average recommendation improving from 2.1 to 1.7 now. Note: 1 is a strong buy.Likewise, the short interest percent of float has been dropping. It was approximately 3.4% in September and now it is 2.3%. This means that fewer traders are taking a short position in the stock, which is generally considered to be positive.Based on the above observations, I believe that buying and holding OTEX alone is better than buying SKYY."
4018042,96536,2016-11-02T04:11:55-04:00,Open Text Corporation operates in a unique niche known as Enterprise Information Management.The company has grown from a small spin-off to a multi-billion market cap leader and shares are near all-time highs.This article pulls back the curtain on the long-term operating trends driving this performance.,"Open Text Corporation (NASDAQ:OTEX) (TSE:OTC) is a Canadian software leader in Enterprise Information Management (NYSEMKT:EIM). That means OTEX is focused on helping organizations manage unstructured business information and processes from any device.The company operates in a highly technical and rapidly evolving field. As a leading expert in the field of EIM, OTEX is rapidly developing a competitive advantage. Plus, due to the nature of the OTEX business, I suspect OTEX has sticky customer relationships with high switching costs. This should further strengthen the economic moat of OTEX.However, instead of simply makes these qualitative assertions, I like to try and quantify them by taking a look at the long-term financial results. Finding trends in the longitudinal data can help quantify the strength of the company's competitive advantage. After all, something is pushing shares of OTEX to new highs.OTEX Business Overview:OTEX first incorporated in 1991, as a small spin-off company from the University of Waterloo. The company filed for IPO in 1996 and has since grown to USD $7 billion in market capitalization. So what's driving the success?The company operates in one segment: the design, development, marketing and sales of Enterprise Information Management software and solutions. Despite it being a single segment, the company has a diverse geographic footprint. About 50% of revenues are earned in the US, while the rest are distributed throughout Europe, the UK and beyond (source).Enterprise Information Management comes down to the handling, processing and securing of unstructured data. This is in contrast to enterprise resource planning, which typically works with a smaller amount of structured data. OTEX offers a suite of cloud products that manage information flow through its entire lifecycle. This gives clients a better-integrated and more comprehensive solution.Over the last 10 years, OTEX management has spent $3.7 billion on acquisitions to fuel growth. While I'm sometimes skeptical of companies that buy growth like this, in the case of OTEX these results seem to have been accretive. Plus, the company is also focused on organic revenue growth. Typically, 10-12% of revenues are invested in R&D to fuel internal innovation.So to see if the company truly is delivering value with their on-premise and cloud information management services, I'd like to see if key historical operating metrics back this up.OTEX Financial History:To try and get better quantification of the supposed strong competitive position of OTEX, I like to look at long-term operating results. In viewing these statistics on a ten-year basis, the trailing-twelve month and headline quarterly results have a lot more context. I'm especially interested in finding consistent trends, which can be more reliably forecasted out into the future. All of the charts below showing long-term financial trends were made with data from Morningstar (source). The first graph I want to show you is revenue.The reason I like to start with the top line (source) is because it gives a very unobstructed picture of how well companies are able to meet demands from their end markets. If customers are continuing to buy, that can give a company a lot of wiggle room. And as you can see in the case of OTEX, the trend looks pretty strong. Although results have reached a plateau the least 2 years, the overall trend looks good.For context, in 2015, recurring revenue made up 84% of total revenue. This speaks to the stickiness of OTEX services. It also implies high switching costs for customers, which can help further underwrite future growth as revenue and income snowball. Given this dynamic, I think that OTEX sales should be relatively profitable. To confirm, let's look at gross margin results.All things considered, this trend in gross margins (source) is quite consistent. While there is a little year-to-year variability, it's happening within a small band. And these high numbers again reinforce the economic moat OTEX enjoys.In particular, consistently high gross margins are important because they speak to the durability of the competitive advantage of OTEX. As an investor, this is something I like to see because it means results are more likely to continue in the future. It also means shareholders profit from revenue. To confirm, here's a graph of EPS performance:To my eye, this trend in earnings (source) is almost as good as it gets. The company is stair-stepping earnings higher year after year. To further confirm, I'd like to take a quick look at free cash flow results. The reason I want to double-check this way is because sometimes subscription-based businesses can recognize revenue in odd ways.However, it looks like the cash results on a per share basis (source) very closely track the trends in income. This speaks to the high quality of the earnings, and gives me further confidence in the longer-term trends we're seeing above. That said, we still haven't discussed how shareholders are benefiting from these results.And while OTEX recently started to pay a dividend, the track record is only a few years long. So although I think OTEX has dividend growth potential, especially given the 36% payout ratio, the current yield is only 1.39% and it isn't yet a reliable income stock. On the other hand though, OTEX has done an effective job retaining and compounding earnings.As you can see, this trend in book value (source) is about as good as it gets. And personally, this is a trend I love to see as a shareholder. The reason is, it really goes to show how your equity value, on a per-share basis, is growing over time. All things being equal, this serves as an additional margin of safety for your investment because share price should track this trend. Plus, it goes to show that management has regularly done a reliable job increasing equity value.Now, with that backdrop in mind I think it's hard to deny OTEX has some very appealing traits of a high quality business. However, there are also risks to consider when thinking about investing in OTEX.Potential Risks to Investing in OTEX:OTEX certainly looks like an intriguing investment opportunity. But as with anything, there are always possible downsides that need to be considered.First of all, OTEX operates in a highly technical but very competitive environment. While the results above show that the company has done a good job to date when it comes to monetizing their technology, this isn't a given. There are a number of large and well-capitalized competitors that are trying to help businesses better capture, understand and improve based on their data. Unfortunately, a breakthrough by a competitor could mean a fatal blow for OTEX.Beyond the ongoing risks from execution and competition, OTEX shareholders also face the possibility of bumpy results from quarter-to-quarter. Owing to the long sales cycle of OTEX products, as well as the complex nature of their services, quarterly results are not always as smooth as Wall Street might like. For potential shareholders this volatility is something to be aware of. It's also another reason I like to keep the longer-term trends in mind.Finally, another risk to consider is the price tag on shares of OTEX. While they aren't outrageously priced given a forward P/E just over 10, shares regularly trade at a premium to the S&P-500 (source).Conclusion: Holding on to OTEXI was lucky enough to pick up shares of OTEX a few months ago. And since then, the decision has worked out quite well. Although the stock is volatile at times, I think the long-term trends offer assurance for investors. So should shares of OTEX pullback in any meaningful way, I may look to expand my stake in this company. But what do you think? Does OTEX look like an appealing investment to you?"
4104015,102837,2017-09-04T19:38:18-04:00,"OpenText has a track record of identifying great acquisition targets, acquiring them at a fair price, and successfully integrating the acquired companies.The company offers an ever more diverse set of solutions to a growing and already impressive customer base.Even if the company only grows earnings at half the rate of analyst estimates or its average historic growth rate, it is undervalued at the present time.","This analysis will show why we think OpenText (OTEX) is one of the few undervalued companies in the technology sector. Per the fiscal 2017 annual report, OpenText made progress expanding into the enterprise information management such that the company sees a total addressable market size of $35 billion. Given the overall market size and associated need of enterprise information management, OpenText expects to have long-term strategic flexibility with attractive options to grow the business. OpenText's software assists organizations with efficiently finding, utilizing, and sharing business information to improve productivity. The company also provides solutions that facilitate the exchange of information and transactions between supply chain participants such as manufacturers, retailers, distributors, and financial institutions. By unlocking massive amounts of data, OpenText helps its customers gain better insight into their business to improve decision making. The company offers solutions for almost every industry and its software offerings integrate with most of the main business software providers such as SAP (SAP), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and SalesForce (CRM). The company plans to mainly fuel growth through M&A. The company has already closed 57 acquisitions including ANX, HP CEM, Recommind, HP CCM, and the enterprise content division of Dell-EMC in fiscal 2017. In fiscal 2018, the company acquired Covisant and announced the intention of acquiring Guidance software, an information forensics company that will strengthen OpenText's eDiscovery offerings. Electronic discovery or eDiscovery refers to finding and securing electronic data in order to search it for use as evidence in legal cases. One thing to note about the Guidance acquisition is that in addition to diversifying OpenText's offerings via eDiscovery tools, Guidance Software also comes with a customer list that includes 78 of the Fortune 100 companies, per the Guidance website.Speaking of diversification, we should touch on the main segments covered by OpenText's software offerings. The Content Services area offers solutions for things like content management, records management, and archiving. The Business Process Management segment provides software for analyzing, automating, monitoring, and optimizing structured business processes that usually fall outside of the scope of existing enterprise systems. The Customer Experience Management area improves time to market by giving customers, employees, and channel partners personalized and engaging experiences. This is done through web content management, digital asset management, customer communications management, and social software. The Discovery solutions offered by the company organize and visualize all relevant content and make it possible for business users to locate information quickly and make better decisions based on timely, contextualized information. The Business Network segment deals with offerings that facilitate efficient, secure, and compliant exchange of information inside and outside the enterprise. Finally, the Analytics solutions help organizations gain insight from their structured and unstructured information, make predictions as well as visualize and report on business processes, customer interactions, and other sources of information. Most of these services are available on-premise and increasingly through the cloud.This high level overview is provided to show the diversification or wide array of solutions provided by OpenText. Of course, the offerings continue to be expanded and leveraged largely via the many acquisitions and some organic growth. As far as organic growth the company plans to invest about 10% of revenues in R&D each fiscal year. In its 2018 fiscal goals, the company stated it plans to broaden its reach into Enterprise Information Management, B2B Integration, Analytics Discovery, and the Cloud. One example of organic growth is the Artificial Intelligence Platform, which was showcased at the annual conference in July. The company aims to use AI to transform digital information into useful knowledge and insight for its customers. The platform is expected to be available for release in fiscal 2018.We consider the diverse customer base to be another positive for OpenText. This diversification should be expected, given that we are talking about a company with a market cap of $8.55 billion. The customer base includes a number of the Global 10,000 organizations as well as mid-market companies and government agencies. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of revenues in fiscal 2017. The company also has partnerships with most of the prominent enterprise software companies including SAP, Microsoft, Oracle, Accenture (ACN), Deloitte Consulting, and other system integrators. Of course, OpenText does compete with these partners with some of its offerings. OpenText's main competitor is IBM (NYSE:IBM), but the company also competes with many other software vendors in niche areas such as Veeva Systems (VEEV), j2 Global (JCOM), and Pegasystems (PEGA), to name just a few.In fiscal 2017, revenue grew for every product type including Licensing, Cloud services, Customer support, and Other Professional Services. Customer support, cloud services, licensing and professional services accounted for 42.8%, 30.8%, 16.1%, and 10.3% of revenues, respectively. 59.2% of revenues came from the Americas while the remaining 31.5% and 9.3% came from EMEA and Asia Pacific, respectively.The first area we want to look at is how sales have been trending. Over the past 10 years, we see pretty impressive and consistent growth in sales. The same can be said for net income per the table shown below. Click on the table to zoom in on the picture. The giant increase in net income for fiscal 2017 is a result of a one-time tax benefit associated with the reorganization of the company's worldwide subsidiaries. Therefore, this net income number is of little value, and a closer look at the net income statement is required.Source: barchartSales have grown at an average annual rate of 13.70% over the last five years while EPS grew at an average annual rate of 15.55% over the same period. The real question with OpenText comes from the cash flow statement. Cash flow from operations has been fairly steady over the last five years and easily covered PPE investments. However, as mentioned above, the company achieves a large percentage of its growth via acquisitions. Potential investors need to have confidence that OpenText will continue to build on its track record of strategically identifying companies that are a good fit and then successfully integrating these acquired companies.Source: barchartAs may be expected long-term debt has been increasing as a result of these acquisitions. Equally concerning is that the common shares outstanding count has also increased every year for the last 10 years. Of course, this dilutes the share of earnings for existing OpenText shareholders. This graph shows the negative side of growing through acquisitions rather than organically.OTEX Shares Outstanding data by YChartsDespite the negative trend seen in long-term debt and the increasing outstanding shares count, the company has performed well. As long as OpenText continues to be successful in integrating the acquired companies, the stock will continue to reward shareholders. The stock has outperformed the Nasdaq over the last five and ten-year time periods. We think this will continue to be the case, given the company's track record of strategically acquiring companies and leveraging the existing strengths within the greater organization while growing its already impressive customer base.OTEX data by YChartsWe looked at the company using a discounted cash flow model. Of course, we did not use the EPS number for the trailing 12 months, $4.17, since this would be meaningless given it incorporates a large one-time tax benefit for fiscal 2017. Instead, we used the lowest of 15 analyst estimates for fiscal 2018 EPS, $2.30. If we assume a PE ratio of 15 five years from now, OpenText could have a future annual growth rate of less than half the average analyst estimate of 15% for the next five years, and the discounted cash flow model would still show the company as being undervalued at the current price. Keep in mind that the company grew sales by almost 14% per year on average over the last five years. Our valuation assumed that the company would increase its dividend at the same rate as earnings over the next five years, and we did not assume any dilution related to issuance of more shares. Both of these assumptions may not be realistic. Nonetheless, we still view our model as conservative, given that we used the lowest analyst estimate for 2018 EPS, used a future PE of 15, a 10% discount rate, and found that a long term growth rate as low as 7% would give us a target buy price equal to the current share price. The current dividend yield is 1.63% and comes with a very comfortable payout ratio of 11.90. The table below provides a few other financial metrics and compares them to the industry averages.Source: ReutersOpenText has a track record of identifying great acquisition targets, acquiring them at a fair price, and successfully integrating the acquired companies. This has resulted in a company that offers a diverse set of solutions to its growing list of customers. OpenText is one of the few cheap technology stocks in the fairly pricey market. We think the company can achieve the mean long term EPS growth rates provided by analysts which come in at 15.55. However, even if the company only grows earnings at half this rate over the next five years, which we do not think will be the case, the shares are cheap, per our DCF model discussed above. Additionally, options can be used to provide some additional income. For example, using a buy-write strategy, an investor who buys 100 shares of OpenText could choose to sell a covered call. One call an investor could sell is the one expiring on November 17th with a strike price of $35. A seller of this call would receive $35 based on the current bid and would only need to sell the shares if the stock price increases by 8.16% in the next two and a half months. If the option expires worthless the seller keeps the $35 premium which equates to about a 0.83% additional return over the holding period or an annualized return of slightly over 4 percent. Regardless of whether or not an investor chooses to use options with OpenText, we think now is a good time to initiate a position in the company, and we rate it a buy at the current price."
4124685,98236,2017-11-14T13:18:00-05:00,"OpenText reported results for fiscal Q1 last week.Somewhat surprisingly, the company reported a beat on revenues but just in-line EPS.Again, surprisingly, the company provided specific guidance for Q2 that was mainly in-line with prior expectations.The company continues to successfully execute its strategy of achieving most of its growth through acquisitions.The company continues to be able to get its acquired companies to its business model, usually in a year or less, leading to sustained EPS and cash flow growth.","OpenText (OTEX) reported the results of its first fiscal quarter just over a week ago. Thought you missed it because the share price didn’t react? No, you didn’t miss anything in terms of the share price reaction - operationally the quarter was a beat and actually a raise as well, at least in the context of how OTEX usually (doesn't) provides guidance. But share price reaction was almost invisible. And that really presents investors with an opportunity because this is perhaps the first quarter in more than a year that has seen noticeable organic growth.As many readers will be aware, at this point, OTEX has made its living acquiring the cats, the dogs and the rats of the enterprise software world, and if not transforming them into high-luster properties at the least executing a strategy that allows the OTEX to retain a high proportion of the revenues of its acquisition (usually between 70%-80%) and to transform the acquired businesses such that those revenues reach the company’s business model margins in a year or so. With OTEX able to achieve operating margins in the mid 30% range, this has been a highly profitable strategy, although one that investors have not really embraced. OTEX is seen by some as the quintessential roll-up, and regardless of its success it is valued that way.OTEX shares have gone up and down over the course of this past year, but have really appreciated very little and have performed far worse than the software average (IGV). Perhaps this reflects the stronger performance of the shares on both an absolute and relative basis in the wake of the company’s deal to buy Documentum, announced back in September of 2016. The deal has produced the results the company had forecast and EPS, on a non-GAAP basis has grown sharply along with GAAP operating income. The deal led to a secondary offering to pay part of the consideration, but the company has improved Documentum operating results at a pace that overcome the dilution and EPS is now forecast to reach $2.48 this year, up a bit more than 20% from fiscal 2017 results, while current revenue growth estimates as reported to First Call are calling for almost a 20% increase.I have far less trouble with this company’s strategy than many other analysts and other observers. Finding bits of potential silver and gold in a sea of dross is a worthwhile skill, and the ability the company has to manage acquisitions and squeeze out cost synergies is a valuable skill, although one not currently highly valued by investors. The fact that the company was able to absorb properties as poorly situated in terms of their ability to generate sustained profits as Guidance Software and Covisint last quarter and continue to grow operating margins and ultimately beat prior expectations is somewhat of an unusual feat for a software company.I have owned OTEX for some time now and have enjoyed both the runup and suffered through the lengthy period of stagnation. Investors almost surely value some consistent organic growth more highly than the company’s deal making prowess. I think OTEX can achieve a moderate level of organic growth, although the growth of the markets in which it competes is not all that sprightly. But the company will continue to find opportunities in the detritus of the software space and execute on its acquisition strategy which will drive EPS and free cash flow growth at strong levels.The shares will not be for all readers and all investors. I have a portfolio filled with volatile, momentum growth names and this is a bit of a counter balance. If I were only owning one or two or three IT stocks in a portfolio, this probably would not be amongst the names I would choose. But I think the current share price simply does not reflect the realities of the company’s business and its continued ability to find deals and maximize returns.OpenText, as mentioned, is an acquisition machine. As such, some of the metrics it reports are not comparable to those of other companies against which it competes. The company reported a 30% growth in revenues including a growth in Annual Recurring Revenue growth of 29%. ARR is now about 76% of total revenues and has trended higher as a proportion of total revenues at a modest rate. It will, I think, be inevitable that this figure will transition higher over time, Last quarter ARR rose from 71% of revenues to 76%, partially a result of normal seasonality. As ARR rises as a proportion of the total, it will have some negative impact on growth optics, which will be hard to discern in the midst of the impact of the company’s likely future acquisitions.ARR is the company’s preferred growth metric, and I do think it is a better indication of the actual state of the sales effort than other reported numbers. ARR essentially eliminates optics that can interfere with an accurate evaluation of a company's sales success for a company like this transitioning to a higher proportion of ratable revenue sources.The company also reports a metric called MCV (multi-year contract value). Essentially, an increasing proportion of customers are leasing rather than buying software from OTEX and do so with an MCV arrangement that obligates the customer to pay a specific amount over the term of a contract. This offering, available for about 3.5 years now, has been a significant factor in both the growth of ARR and the decline in reported license revenues. Historically, looking at license revenue changes was a preferred method of analyzing growth. By now, the MCV metric needs to be considered with the license metric and that combination showed growth.Just how fast is OTEX growing its top-line organically? Answering that question specifically is not possible for outside observers and the company doesn’t provide any specific metrics that might be used to figure “real” organic growth. Management continues to target low single-digit organic revenue growth opportunities. Lots of that is coming from cross-selling and upselling within specific verticals.The two new growth opportunities for this company are its offerings in AI and for the Internet of Things (IoT). The company’s Magellan AI offering is likely to be am incremental demand driver at this point although it is likely to have more of an impact in future quarters as it was just made available in July. AI is a nice adjunct to the company’s core EIM (Enterprise Information Technology) offering. Basically, the AI functionality will enable users to enhance the value of their data by solving advanced analytic problems. Magellan is designed to digest a multiplicity of data types, historically one of the more significant problems in using data effectively. Magellan is designed for use by so-called citizen data scientists and thus taps in to one of the major new areas of demand in the IT space.OpenText has been struggling to use some of its data collection/management capabilities to create an Internet of Things offering. Some observers suggested that the acquisition of Covisint was part of a broad strategy to develop a broadly based IoT set of tools that could be sold within the company’s user base. It probably sounds better in a strategy discussion than it will actually sell.The company's most recent acquisition was a company called Guidance Software. Guidance offers a relatively well known product called ""EnCase"" which really does what the name suggests. It provides security for end-points and will fit well with the many other EIM offerings of OTEX. The company is global in scope and probably has the opportunity to expand its revenues more rapidly in less penetrated geos. At this point, the company derives 41% of its revenues outside of North America and given the company’s alliance with SAP (SAP) as well as its very broad set of EIM offerings, it should be able to grow international sales more rapidly than sales in the rest of the world.Will these higher-growth demand opportunities allow the company to achieve its very modest organic growth business model? I think the odds favor that. But when a business is operating at such a modest growth level, the odds are that some quarters will not show positive organic growth. That said, OTEX is clearly the leader in the EIM space by a significant margin these days as can be seen by the Gartner report linked here. Given the company's dominant position in the market, and some of its newer capabilities, it would seem more likely than not that OTEX will achieve growth at or above market rates in its space for the foreseeable future.I have linked here to a few different reports that relate to both market size and market share trends. Depending on definitions, the market might be growing anywhere form 1.5% of 18.5%. I obviously haven’t the tools or the insight to suggest which definition is most likely to match the offerings of OTEX. I think it is fair to conclude that looked at holistically, both the market size and growth rate are more than adequate to support the goals articulated by OTEX - and then some.The anniversary of the Documentum acquisition will be in January 2018. Documentum and the other business components acquired from EMC had revenues of around $600 million, or a bit less at the time it was acquired. So, almost all of the revenue growth being reported apparently is coming from Documentum, although it is likely that in the course of the acquisition and as a result of product overlap, the real revenue addition was perhaps more in the range of $110-$120 million/quarter. But the point is that starting in the company’s fiscal Q3, absent any further acquisitions, reported percentage growth numbers will decline dramatically. Whether the expectation of that optical decline in growth rates is of concern to investors is hard to determine at this point.At the end of the day, OpenText has a secret sauce that it uses to maximize operating margins and cash flow. The company is clearly not basing its strategy on attempts to maximize either the growth rate or market share in its core space. This shows up dramatically in the very low spend ratios the company budgets for both research and development and for sales and marketing.What it does better than just about anyone else is to buy vendors that are competitors or are in spaces that it can bolt-on to its existing offerings and then wring out cost savings to bring the acquired revenue to the company’s mid-thirty percent operating income model in a year or 18 months. It is a skill that most other acquirers simply do not have or choose to pursue. Inevitably, choosing to pursue profitability as opposed to market share or growth is not a strategy that's comfortable for many investors who have been trained for many years to look at market share and growth metrics as the most important components of valuation.Over the next couple of years, management has set an aspirational margin goal of 34%-38%. While forecasting the timing of unknown acquisitions is notionally a fraught exercise, I have no reason to expect the company, as the CEO said in this last conference call and many times in the past, will not be able to continue to find attractive acquisitions that can lead to major cost synergies coupled with some moderate level of cross selling/upselling opportunities. If it all works out, the company’s plan would see EPS reach $3.70 by fiscal year 2020 - a result that would most likely produce strong share price appreciation and positive alpha over the coming years as that goal becomes more visible.It is to be sure a bit of a challenge to look at the specific numbers in a quarter to evaluate the progress of this company in terms of achieving its overall margin objectives. That is because of the impact of various mergers coupled with substantial seasonality in which fiscal Q1, the quarter recently reported, typically shows the lowest operating margins of the year. Operating margins last quarter were more or less in-line with prior expectations, even after absorbing negative accretion in this last quarter from the acquisitions of money losing Covisint and Guidance Software.I like to look at GAAP metrics in terms of my comparative analysis. The problem is that for a company that is comparing results with a substantial acquisition to those from before the acquisition, the metrics can get very blurred. Overall, year on year operating expenses climbed by 30% as reported. Removing the special charges and the amortization of acquired customer-based intangibles shows a similar increase in opex year on year.Gross margins fell by 150 basis points year on year which was mainly a function of inherited, low-margin customer support contracts. That impact will reverse in coming quarters according to the CFO’s forecast. Stock based comp is not a major factor in earnings or cash flow - it was flat in dollars and fell to 1.3% of revenue.Overall, the year-on-year improvement in margins as reported was quite small. The end result this past quarter was a combination of the improving the margins of the Documentum acquisition offset to an extent by the negative impact of the two most recent acquisitions which added costs but little revenue to quarterly results. The company has indicated that it anticipates that margins will be significantly stronger in the second half of the year than the levels it reported in Q1. Management expects that Documentum’s margins, which were 25% last quarter, will reach 35% by the end of the fiscal year and that it will have made significant progress in moving both Covisint and Guidance Software margins to a similar level. The company has reaffirmed its forecast for non-GAAP margins of 32%-35% for the year, and with interest costs of $125-$130 million and a current outstanding share balance of 266 million coupled with a reaffirmed revenue forecast of about $2.75 billion, that yields an EPS forecast in the range of $2.50-$2.60, a bit above the current published First Call consensus.OpenText shares have been valued modestly by some standards and that is not likely to change in any material way in the next year and beyond. Investors will not pay high valuations for any company built on acquisitions, regardless of almost anything else. And the company will not achieve rapid organic growth based on its strategy of maximizing operating margins. In addition, it is reasonable to suspect that moving the company’s business model to a few hundred basis points more of recurring/subscription revenues is likely to constrain short-term, reported organic growth.Currently, OTEX has a market capitalization of about $8.9 billion based on today's share price and 266 million share currently outstanding. It has $2.4 billion of net debt. Those metrics create an enterprise value of $11.3 billion and an EV/S of about 4.1X based on revenue expectations for the current fiscal year. Because of the way OTEX is structured, it is somewhat difficult to compare the company to other IT vendors. It has been able to achieve a 14% revenue CAGR going back over many years. It has, within the past year, been able to make one of the more accretive transactions in its history. I think that the EV/S metric is reasonable although it is hard to develop a specific comparison given the unique strategy that OTEX has chosen in terms of growing it business.As mentioned, I think current guidance suggests that the company is likely to achieve EPS this year of close to $2.60. That is a P/E of 12.8X, and a P/E that doesn’t rely on a great deal of stock based comp. There are not many companies in the IT space with such a modest P/E that have any level of growth. I believe that the shares are a bargain based on the company’s P/E metric.Last year the company generated free cash flow of about $360 million. Overall, cash flow was constrained because of a variety of balance sheet items most particularly including the growth in receivables as the company absorbed the Documentum business, and the business it bought from HP (NYSE:HPQ). In Q1, cash flow was constrained because of a paydown of payables and other balance sheet items related to the company’s two most recent acquisitions. The company doesn’t provide specific guidance for cash flow, but based on the current track of both earnings and depreciation, CFFO for the year might reasonably be anticipated to reach around $650 million, with free cash flow around $575 million. That would be a free cash flow yield of about 5.1%. Again, that is perhaps not a deep-value level, but reasonable enough given the longer-term growth of the cash flow as part of the business model.OpenText provides its investors with a modest cash dividend. At this point, the payout is about 20% of expected non-GAAP earnings. Based on the company’s comments on payout ratios over the years, I think it would be reasonable to expect another dividend increase, which would be the sixth in a row. Typically, dividend increases have been declared early in a given calendar year. Assuming another dividend increase, consistent with historical patterns, the yield for 2018 would be in the range of 1.8%. These days, I suppose, that is considered to be an acceptable yield. Most of the company’s cash flow in any given quarter is going to be used to retire debt and to reduce the leverage in the company’s balance sheet.OpenText is, no doubt, a somewhat unusual company in the IT space in that it is run more for the attainment of operating margin targets than it is for growth. There is growth to be had in the EIM space, which depending on the source of the analysis and the definition of the space, is probably continuing to grow at close to double-digit rates. OTEX will not reach that level of organic growth because it will devote its resources to acquisitions more than operating expenses. The company’s level of sales and marketing cost at less than 20% of revenue is far below ratios that even much larger software vendors expend in that category. The company’s research and development spend ratio of around 12% also is significantly lower than that ratio for many other software vendors.The difference in expense ratios, or the company's profit generation, has been used to acquire vendors that can benefit from being a component of a much larger business focused on EIM. It is a strategy that's working well and should work well in the future. While it is a “roll-up” strategy it offers differences in that acquisitions are expected to reach the OTEX business model rapidly and are expected to add to the company’s ability to provide users with a wide range of functionality in the EIM space.As the shares responded little to the Q1 beat, they are more of a value now than before the earnings release. The company is relatively highly rated with 14 of the 16 analysts who report their recommendations to First Call calling it a buy. As mentioned, the shares have done little for some time now. I expect that in the coming months, the company will please its holders with additional accretive announcements that will yield higher EPS than the current consensus estimates. And I think additional analysts are likely to start covering the shares with buy ratings. I think given the decent valuation metrics and the opportunities the company has to execute its strategy, it will be able to generate positive alpha going forward."
4048669,98236,2017-02-22T23:48:22-05:00,"Open Text announced the results of its fiscal Q2 and gave guidance of a sort with regards to expectations for its crucial Documentum merger.The company produced results that were a noticeable beat in terms of reported revenues and showed a surprising acceleration in the growth of license revenues.The company did not update guidance for its core business - not terribly surprising and consistent with past practice. Its forecast for the Documentum accretion was a bit greater than previously anticipated.The company has many cross-sell and upsell opportunities that it has not yet quantified.The company's forecast of cost synergies remains on the conservative side, and management suggested it could be updated based on initial experience in integrating Documentum.","Open Text - everything old is new againIt is unusual these days to see companies have beats based on better-than-anticipated license revenues. Most companies are busy explaining why license revenues have contracted and why investors shouldn't worry about those kinds of things. And for the most part, companies in the IT space dealing with both the cloud and user desire to consume software ratably do get the benefit of the doubt, both from this writer and from most investors on that score these days. And so it was quite surprising to see Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) print a quarter that actually showed organic growth of some level, much of which was driven by the strong performance of those solutions that are part of the company's portfolio of license offerings. The surprise was not of the order of say the surprise that would be engendered if the New York Times wrote something positive about our president. But license revenues exceeded prior published expectations by almost 10% and if Open Text has ever had a larger percentage license revenue beat on a quarterly earnings report, I am not aware of it.One ought not to get carried away by the license revenue beat - it lifted organic growth to something in the range of 2%-3% on a constant currency basis from nil in fiscal Q1. The company continues to have an aspirational goal of achieving 5% organic growth and it continues to fall short in that regard to a greater or lesser extent.And the company's earnings, while a beat of a couple of percent, saw operating margins decline due to the impact of absorbing some of the costs from the plethora of acquisitions it has made over the past several quarters.Overall, the company reported quarterly revenues of about $543 million, up 17% year on year, driven significantly by a number of acquisitions. The company doesn't really provide an organic growth number and it might be complicated to do so. I think organic growth rebounded from less than stellar performance in prior periods to the range of 3% this quarter, but I certainly do not have the tools to be precise with such an estimate. EPS for the period was $.54 compared to a prior consensus of $.52. OTEX earnings include a modest level of stock-based comp, which accounted for $.03 of reported non-GAAP income. Most of the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP were and have been for amortization and a significant tax rate differential between GAAP and non-GAAP income presentations because of a one-time gain recognized as the company brought its IP portfolio to Canada.In the wake of the consummation of the acquisition of Documentum, an accretive transaction of some magnitude, and the decent earnings performance the company has achieved, most analysts have raised estimates. For the full year of fiscal 2017, which ends 6/30, the current consensus EPS forecast is now $2.07 compared to a consensus estimate of EPS $2.01, 90 days ago. Estimates for fiscal 2018 EPS have also grown to $2.50 from $2.16. The company is actually forecasting cost savings from the Documentum acquisition that amount to $.21/share after tax, and which should be mainly realized in fiscal 2018. I think that the current estimates represent a particularly conservative evaluation both of potential cost savings and any revenue synergies that will be created by the merger and which should be seen in fiscal 2018. Indeed, despite the cross-sell and upsell opportunities going both ways, the company has forecast no revenue synergies either now or in the future, which represents a significant opportunity for the company to exceed the current consensus forecasts.As many readers are aware, Open Text is one of those companies in perpetual transition, and over the years, I have written more than a few articles explaining why organic license revenue growth was just over the horizon. While OTEX, under current CEO Mark Barrenechea, has asserted a position of primacy in a space it calls Enterprise Information Management (EIM), it has never really been able to produce any measurable organic growth. It has probably had a better level of success than its competitors in the space, and it has built a large moat of complementary solutions - some cloud, others subscription and others still on-premise. Much of the balance of this article will be focused on the impacts of the acquisition and where the company can go from its new position.Who says organic growth is a prerequisite for share price performanceInvestors have rewarded the company's most attractive ability, that of being able to successfully on-board acquisitions acquired at bargain prices and move them to a highly profitable operating model within a few quarters. It's been that capability, for the most part, that has made the company a rewarding holding for investors even though organic growth has been basically invisible. Over the last year, the shares have appreciated by a bit more than 40%, and the shares have been strong performers over an even longer span than that. At this point, the most salient question for observers and for investors is going to be the success the company will be able to achieve in terms of wringing significant accretion out of newly acquired Documentum, formally known as the Enterprise Content Division (ECD) of Dell.Not all of the analysts who provide estimates to First Call have updated their projections at this point, and there are certainly complexities in the specifics of the company's reported numbers due to the merger. In particular, the company will take a one-time deferred revenue adjustment of about $25 million in the next couple of quarters and a further $25 million deferred revenue write-down over a lengthier period and will report a restructuring charge of $50 million as well as it takes cost actions to optimize its new structure. I will go through some of the salient math a bit later in the article with regards to the company's updated projections. But overall, as will be seen, the company has rather attractive valuation metrics that have really gotten significantly more attractive in the wake of the opportunities presented by the absorption of Documentum.While estimates have risen to some extent, I believe that there is more to come. Management is forecasting that Documentum will lose between 5%-10% of its revenues post the acquisition. Documentum revenues had been declining at a CAGR of 2%-3% in any event for some years before the merger. It would not be surprising if Documentum revenues did initially decline in the wake of the merger, and it is consistent with the experience OTEX has had with many of its other acquisitions, but I would be remiss in pointing out that to me, part of the rationale for the merger would be in eliminating the former major competitor in the EIM (Enterprise Information Management) space. Part of my rationale in holding the shares personally, and I do, is that I expect to see some significant opportunities for cross selling and some level of stronger pricing with the elimination of a Documentum alternative as a significant competitor.In looking at the technology assets that OTEX acquired with Documentum, probably most significant in terms of potential revenue generation, will be Documentum's LEAP platform, which offers a modern architecture that is likely to be incorporated as a mainstream solution by OTEX. In addition, long ago, Documentum acquired Captiva, which as its name suggests was and remains one of the leading document capture applications and an operation called Kazeon had been designed to work with one of OTEX's more recent acquisitions, Recommend.Documentum was not well integrated while it belonged to EMC. There were probably many reasons for that, some financial, many cultural. Because EMC itself has been a company focused on the largest accounts, it tried to take Documentum in the same direction. Many of the OTEX customers can use what Documentum has, but they have never been offered those solutions. Conversely, OTEX has a strategic goal of selling more to the enterprise and Documentum ought to help with that effort.It is hard to quantify what the opportunities will be for OTEX in terms of cross sell and less competition. It is harder still to forecast the specific cadence in terms of when the various opportunities are most likely to be effectively exploited. But the fact is that there are tailwinds for OTEX now that did not exist heretofore. Management has suggested during the conference call held earlier this month that Documentum will cease to be shrinking in terms of its actual revenues sometime in the range of 3+ quarters. While that may seem a bit optimistic to some given the history of the last several years, given the market structure and the track record achieved by OTEX in this area, I would be reluctant to gainsay that kind of projection.The company now has many solutions in the content management space and one might anticipate that over time, there will be a tendency to integrate the solutions and to integrate duplicative offerings such as Document Science with StreamServe and Exastream. Users really do not need a choice of multiple customer communications technologies, and the opportunities the company has to both strengthen margins and lower costs through eliminating some solutions seems compelling.Management has made it quite plain that part of the strategy it has going forward to optimize the financial performance of the merger is to target IBM's (NYSE:IBM) FileNet as a soft underbelly in terms of account take-away potential. The company clearly believes that the integration of its historic offerings, those of Documentum and those that it has acquired over the years in both analytics/AI and Discovery are going to allow it to offer a differentiated set of solutions compared to FileNet. I think the results IBM has seen with FileNet suggest that it has been an orphan child since its acquisition and that OTEX may achieve some significant success with its competitive targeting.I would be surprised as well, if the ultimate cost synergies of the Documentum merger didn't turn out to be noticeably greater than the 10% of revenues that the company is currently forecasting. This company has proven itself time after time to be able to expand originally forecast cost synergies; indeed, that represents a significant part of historical EPS growth that OTEX has achieved over the years. I expect that will prove to be the case when it comes to eliminating duplicative costs in the wake of the acquisition of Documentum. The company has set a very low bar for itself and one that has been accepted without any real questioning by the reset consensus forecast for revenues and EPS.What's happening in the rest of the company?This is really a company with as many moving parts as any I cover, and especially so given that its current revenue run rate is not yet $3 billion even in the wake of the company's most recent acquisitions. And so far as that goes, management explicitly said it would be continuing to stir up its brew with yet more acquisition in the balance of the fiscal year. I feel sorry for the staff that has to on-board this torrent of new OTEX employees.Last quarter saw a rather significant upturn in the company's research and development spend ratio. Overall research and development spending rose by 42% year on year and was up by 12% sequentially. Surprisingly, the specifics of that scale of cost increase went both unremarked and mainly unquestioned during the conference call. The company said that there were some unremediated costs that were a function of the recent acquisitions, particularly that of the two companies recently acquired from Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) Exastream and Experience Management, as well as the Recommend business that offers E-Discovery solutions. Overall, research and development on a GAAP basis was 12% of revenues, hardly some wild ratio, but certainly something different, particularly in terms of the trend, than has recently been seen at this company. Research and development spending for the last 6 months was 12% of revenues, compared to 10% in the year-earlier period, and it remained at that ratio last quarter. With the acquisition of Documentum clouding reported numbers going forward, it will difficult to determine just how OTEX has dealt with the engineering talent it has absorbed from HP.Other expense ratios were more or less consistent with prior trends. The acquisition of so many businesses simultaneously did lead to some minor expense blips that lowered gross margins and increased the other significant expense ratios marginally. While invisible overall, future quarters will see benefits from the remediation of these specific costs, I believe, as the company integrates what it has recently acquired and moves those acquisitions onto its business model. That said, I think most shareholders would take a trade that lead to a bit higher organic growth in exchange for a small increase in research and development expense ratios, the devil of course, being in the details of such a trade.Because of the complexity of the company's revenue model, it seems inevitable that some metric or the other is going to have sub-optimal performance in any given quarter. This time around, the company saw a modest decline in MCV, a cloud booking metric. Professional Services revenue was stagnant for the quarter and stagnant for the first half of the year. That probably relates to prior license bookings metrics which had shown no growth. I would expect to see Professional Services revenue growth resume at a significantly faster pace in the wake of the license revenue attainment this quarter.The anatomy of an accretive transactionIt is probably worth the time of readers to look at a snapshot of the accretion that the Documentum transaction can mean to OTEX over the course of the next 18 months or so. It can be painful to try to review the prospects of all of the different divisions that OTEX operates, and I am not sure that anyone really can do a great job of handicapping which of the many product areas will be a standout. But with this acquisition, probably half of the company's revenues are coming from the company's EIM space and lots of the earnings growth is likely to be a function of the accretive transaction that has brought Documentum to OTEX.The division that OTEX acquired from Dell had a revenue run rate of $580 million. The company has forecast that it will lose between 5%-10% of revenues this year, and the division had been bleeding revenues at a 2-3% CAGR. While Documentum had produced operating margins in the mid-20% range for EMC, OTEX is forecasting that it will be able to achieve operating margins in the mid to high 30% range by next fiscal year from this property. As mentioned earlier, I think there is a significant opportunity for OTEX to achieve significant revenue synergies, but I will ignore that for now.I am guessing that on an incremental basis, Documentum revenue, which I will estimate to be $550 million next fiscal year, will produce operating margins of 37%. That would yield operating income of $203 million. The company financed the purchase with a mix of debt and equity. It sold 9 million shares (18 million post-split) at the end of last year, and it has increased its debt over the past year or so. The most conservative way at looking at the transaction would be to look at the cost to the company for debt. Its latest debt was sold with a 5.875% coupon. So, it is costing the company $97 million in interest and it is likely to earn $203 million. With a current tax rate of 15%, the company has increased its earnings on a net basis by $81 million, or $.33/share. Over time, that contribution will almost certainly increase significantly. Using a different methodology that calculates the weighted average cost of capital, produces significantly more accretion for this transaction. To the extent that the company is able to achieve greater cost savings or is able to achieve revenue accretion, it will achieve a greater increase in the expected EPS contribution of Documentum.ValuationAs mentioned earlier, valuation for OTEX shares, despite their appreciation have remained reasonable. It is important for investors to look at 12-month forward estimates because Documentum has had different seasonality than does the rest of Open Text. In particular, some costs will be front-end loaded, and normal OTEX Q4 seasonality is going to be muted.The First Call consensus revenue estimate for the next 12 months is approximately $2.6 billion. The company has a current market capitalization based on 247 million shares outstanding of $8.3 billion. With net debt of $675 million, its current enterprise value is just less than $9 billion. That yields an EV/S ratio of 3.5X. The current consensus earnings per share forecast for the next 12 months is about $2.35. That yields a P/E of 14X.The company's cash flow through the first half of the year is not totally representative due to income tax adjustments of some size. The company essentially relocated its IP assets in Canada which resulted in booking a very significant non-cash gain and an equally significant non-cash tax liability. Overall, operating cash flow for the quarter declined 14% because of a cash tax payment. Operating cash flow for this company has typically be in line with reported non-GAAP net income.The company has reduced DSOs to just 52 days, probably as low as it is reasonable to anticipate. The company has a modest balance of deferred revenues, and these have been stable so far in the fiscal year. The company has a relatively modest level of capex, and with the Documentum merger, it will have surplus facilities for some little while into the future. The company does pay a modest dividend, which costs about $110 million/year at current rates. The dividend yield of less than 1.4% is better than nothing, but really is not a significant reason to own the shares.My expectation is that free cash flow will reach about $600 million for fiscal-year 2018, which is a more representative level, uninfluenced by large mergers and other one-time events. A free cash flow yield of 6.7% is a reasonable baseline if the company can execute on the many opportunities it has to improve revenue growth and especially to build operating margins. I think much of the free cash flow is likely to be deployed in paying down some of the debt that was contracted to pay for the Documentum merger. I would be surprised if the company resumed share buybacks in the near future.I think the company has provided itself with an easy bar at this point. I think the strength in its business last quarter may well have been a harbinger that the ""other"" parts of its strategy are seeing traction. And for sure, I see more accretion through cost savings and revenue synergies than the company has chosen to project to this point. While the company produced dramatic positive alpha in 2016, it did so based on several highly accretive transactions whose results are just starting to come into focus.OTEX is a consolidator and a decent operator, and it is not a real growth company as those things are defined. But consolidation is not an evil row to hoe, and this company does it well, and is not hugely valued for its expertise. It should be able to produce continued positive alpha for investors."
4083398,103356,2017-06-22T20:26:19-04:00,"With an industry P/E that is 389% higher than firm P/E, the company is heavily discounted by the industry. This, in turn, provides a potential long-term opportunity for investors.As a result of global businesses becoming more data driven, the demand for EIM software has gone up.Long-term price target: $50.","Investment ThesisOpen Text is a very attractive investment because it has strong fundamentals and is an investment that is growing at a reasonable price. It is undervalued due to its low relative P/E and low PEG. I can affirm a price target of $50.Company IntroductionOpen Text Corporation (NASDAQ: OTEX) is an enterprise information management software developer based in Waterloo, Canada, that operates in 31 countries worldwide. Open Text focuses on six major product lines. These product lines are discovery, analytics software (AS), enterprise content management (ECM), business process management (BPM), customer experience management, and information exchange (IE).(Source: Company 10-K)Price HistoryOTEX data by YChartsComparing Open Text Financials to Competitors(Source: FINVIZ)Looking closely at financial metrics identified in the comparables chart above of Open Text's biggest competitors Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ: CDNS) and ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANSS), it is pretty clear that Open Text looks like a much more attractive investment. I can affirm this belief because Open Text has the best financial performance and valuation. Open Text has stronger valuation metrics such as P/E, P/B, P/E/G, Profit Margin, ROE and 1-Yr EPS projections.For any investor looking to invest in the mid-cap Application Software niche, Open Text would look like the investment with the strongest potential upside. Its low P/E relative shows that this company is undervalued. This low P/E also shows that this company is doing well in its earnings reports and is valued accordingly to its potential projections. Compared to its competitors, there is a stronger chance that investors will get better returns on their investment because of this company's strong return on equity, earnings growth potential and PEG relative to its competitors. Its exceptionally low PEG indicates that this company is growing at a reasonable price.Mispriced by IndustryOpen Text has a P/E of 7.46. According to calculations based on Yahoo Finance estimates, the mean P/E Ratio for the Application Software industry is 36.5, which is 388% higher. Because the industry P/E is significantly higher than the company P/E, it is safe to say that this industry severely discounts the value of this company, making this company very undervalued compared to the rest of the industry. This, in turn, is an attractive indicator for prospective investors because this company is severely mispriced by industry metrics and is a relatively cheap investment. For an investor looking to invest in this industry, this company has a strong upside for higher return compared to companies valued at the industry median because it is trading much lower than the industry median.Valuation based on Industry Peer Metrics(Data Source: Yahoo Finance)I personally feel that when we compare the multiples of Open Text to the relative peer multiples of EV/EBITDA and EV/Revenue, Open Text is undervalued compared to the rest of the industry. Open Text looks like a cheaper investment compared to other investments because of its extremely low P/E valuation. Using industry multiples valuation, Open Text has a potential upside of ~50-62%. This can be justified based on looking at the valuation field below, where valuation estimate for Open Text based on peer multiples is around $48-52 a share.(Data Source: Yahoo Finance)Strong Fundamental Indicators:Return on EquityROE (Trailing)= 39.38%ROE (Annual-Last Reported)= 14.94%A very strong ROE is a really strong indicator that Open Text is a strong investment because this tells us that Open Text is effectively using its equity to return robust profits and is profitable. This provides a strong upside for an investor because the value of the company can go up as a result of strong profit based on its historical annual ROE. In the past ten years, Open Text has seen a strong growth in its return on equity. This, in turn, shows that Open Text is becoming more profitable in its investments.OTEX Return on Equity (Annual) data by YChartsHigh Profit MarginOpen Text last quarter reported a trailing Profit Margin of 50.89%. This is a strong indicator of financial strength because this shows us that this company is very efficient in its production and services processes. If we look at its annual profit margin, one observation to note is that this company has growing profit margins, which means that the company is becoming even more profitable, which could show higher valuation in the future.OTEX Profit Margin (Annual) data by YChartsValuation based on Cash Flow GrowthValuation Field: With DCF and Price TargetPrice TargetThrough evaluation of projected cash flow growth and relative peer valuation, Open Text has a 56-60% upside with an estimated price target of $50. Its intrinsic valuation based on its cash flow growth is in line closely with its peer valuation. This affirms the company is undervalued as it is trading at around $32. There is a strong upside for this company due to this enormous discount between its intrinsic value and trading value.ConclusionOpen Text Corp. is a hidden gem in the application software industry. With a history of strong financial growth, strong fundamental drivers, and a strong potential for strong cash flow growth in the future, Open Text will continue to grow as a leader in EIM software development. Open Text is severely undervalued based on its relative valuation compared to peers and the discount between trading value and intrinsic value, which can provide a very strong opportunity for an investor in the long run."
4081331,98236,2017-06-14T08:38:22-04:00,Open Text will soon close its first complete quarter since buying Documentum in January.The results quarter should present a clearer view of the potential of the merger.The company is in the midst of an effort to explain to investors that its priorities are growth through acquisition and efficient operation.This is a very different paradigm when compared to the strategy of most enterprise IT vendors.The shares reflect some significant level of investor uncertainty with regards to the potential the company has to execute a rather different strategy in its space.,"Open Text - How much is enough respect for Open Text?What do investors want from their IT names? Pretty simple really - organic growth at a rapid cadence. A path to profitability, a decent cash flow story. Maybe since the Goldman Sachs's report about the valuations of tech names, they want something else. They probably aren't likely to find it. There are lots of reasons why people have been willing to pay a lot for IT shares, and most of the reasons are real. Maybe stocks in IT growth companies have gone too far, too fast in terms of their share price. I have sold some of the ones I used to own - with great reluctance and the hope that I am smart enough and have the discipline to return to the names I like. I never had any intention of selling Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) but I let it go. I have sold both Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) far too soon - it seems like eons ago, for essentially the same reasons. As the Cole Porter ballad goes, ""is this an earthquake or simply a shock?"". But that is a different discussion and one in which my own view is just that - a view and nothing dispositive.Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) has a different strategy than the FANG quartet or IT growth companies in general, and it is one that has not made investors particularly happy recently. Organic growth has been hard to find here, and management is not fixated on maximizing sales growth. It is a significant change in emphasis since the current CEO began his tenure believing he would be able to restore organic double-digit growth to this company.Should OTEX change its strategy? I doubt if it would be all that successful if it tried. So, the strategy investors see now is the strategy that can be expected going into the future. The skills in which this company excels are in deal making and operations and not in the development of software solutions that are cutting edge. Open Text has developed this playbook over the years, with a certain amount of fits and starts, and it has produced decent numbers for the business, although numbers that have been pockmarked with misses over the years.Just as an example: At some level, OTEX competes with Veeva (NYSE:VEEV) for content management dollars. No one thinks, I imagine, that OTEX is going to move up the food chain in the life sciences content management vertical and successfully compete with Veeva or its equivalents. It has neither the aspiration nor the skill set to do so, and its business model is not amenable to the investment that would be required to compete on the basis of the most advanced technology in a narrow vertical. So, Veeva is likely to show a far faster growth rate in overall content management dollars on a percentage basis than OTEX. But Veeva is simply not going to try to compete for enterprise content management dollars. That isn't what it does, or wants to do either. Different strategies, different models, and both can make for decent investments.I think investors should pay careful attention to the commentary of the CEO on this conference call and going back a couple of years. In fact, the CEO, in a passage I'll quote later on, has made it quite clear that OTEX is not going to maximize top-line growth. He calls his strategy one of creating long-term intrinsic value, and by that he means, essentially, maximizing cash flow and cash flow growth. There are other companies that have IT portfolios built around the similar principles - Roper (NYSE:ROP) comes to mind as a public company while Infor is well known as a private vendor which has built a successful business in the space. And, there are a number of VCs who think that they have a strategy to create value by assembling a portfolio of doggy IT companies. Good luck with that, although it has certainly resulted in a good time for some investors.The title for this article comes from a song ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" in a successful Broadway musical show called ""Gypsy."" The song was composed by Jule Styne with lyrics written by Stephen Sondheim back in 1959. Mr. Sondheim, hard as it might be to believe, is approaching 90 and is still writing music. The song was originally sung on stage by Ethel Merman almost as though it was written for her style alone, and it more or less became her theme song. It has been reprised many times by many performers and still finds a place in modern popular culture - it apparently was part of a movie from 2014 called the ""The Fault In Our Stars.""The plot of Gypsy was eminently forgettable for me, the song is one I have remembered since I first heard it - it was actually played at one of the galas as part of the Kennedy inauguration. Lots of times in looking at IT vendors, in recent quarters, it can seem as though everything is coming up roses. Think Veeva or Guidewire (NYSE:GWRE) or even Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) the last time around. The question for investors is when, if ever, Open Text can enter the Elysian Fields and see everything coming up roses. It could happen - the table is laid, but it most certainly hasn't happened, and the shares have been a consistent laggard for more than a year now.The company has consummated a substantial number of bottom fishing transactions that are likely to be massively accretive over the years. The company certainly has technology initiatives that seem to have the promise of being well received by its customer base. But it has yet to find, or perhaps even look for, the key to unlock organic growth. And, there the shares sit, up just a bit more than 10% over the past year when the IGV has appreciated 31%.OTEX has been one of the sorrier of investments I have made this past year, and I keep looking for some signs that things are about to change. I suppose on a day like Friday, when OTEX shares were only down 0.58%, I had some solace. But I do not really buy stocks for their defensive characteristics. I can just leave them alone without too many negative consequences.The Quarter That Wasn'tIt is about a month now since OTEX reported the results of its fiscal Q3. The results were felt to be a miss on both the top line and earnings, and the shares declined by 10%. It is a bit difficult to know what was a reasonable set of expectations to anticipate for this initial quarter that included the results of Documentum for part of the period.The acquisition of Documentum ought to prove to be one of the more seminal events for Open Text. The ability to consolidate one of its principle rivals in the content management space has many prospective advantages for this company which I have summarized in past articles.Management said that the acquisition contributed revenue of $80 million during the quarter, or about 13% of the revenues reported for the period. The CEO said that the results of Documentum were consistent with the targets that Open Text had contemplated when it bought the company. He also said that he expects a rather substantial increase in quarterly revenues from the acquisition in this current quarter, especially considering normal seasonality, i.e. it (Open Text) actually got most of the revenue there had been to get from Documentum last quarter because it acquired and reported the third month of operations.The company also enjoyed top-line benefits from other acquisitions it has made in the past year, including the customer communications management assets of HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), Recommind, ANXeBusiness, and some print management software that it bought from HP, Inc. (NYSE:HPQ). I imagine that all or at least a high proportion of the 35% growth the company reported was a function of the acquisitions. The company still hasn't generated any noticeable level of organic growth, and that is surely one of the factors that is putting a cap on share valuation.Did Open Text miss reasonable expectations for the April quarter? Given that the company doesn't disclose specific quarterly targets, it is a bit hard to tell. Revenues adjusted for the Documentum acquisition declined about 5% sequentially. Historically, the company has seen some level of seasonality in which revenues decline between the December quarter and the March quarter. This company continues to derive a significant level of on-prem license revenues which were up by more than 50% sequentially in Q2, partially, no doubt, as a function of the HPE acquisitions that generated revenue for a full quarter. So, the subsequent decline in license revenues, excluding Documentum, probably should not have been surprising. This company simply isn't going to be a growth machine, and the top-line results it posted in Q3 probably represented reasonable performance, especially in the wake of the many distractions during the quarter.As was noted during the call, the company's reported results were masked to some extent by the transitional services agreement that was part of the Documentum transaction. This was an extremely contentious point during the conference call, and some analysts simply weren't persuaded that the integration of Documentum is on track because of the reported results in Q3. Simply looking at the conference call transcript a month or more after I listened to the conference call reminded me of the frisson that had been expressed by numerous questioners during the call.That being said, OTEX, particularly since it announced the Documentum acquisition, has been well regarded by the preponderance of covering analysts. At this point, it is rated a buy or strong buy by 13 of the 16 analysts who cover the name and report their ratings to First Call.TSA agreements are a normal and common part of asset purchases; on day one, the people in the acquired business have to have a place to work and a network over which to communicate and IT systems and can't be laid-off in a week or two. Essentially, Open Text paid EMC for the actual costs of the services provided + some kind of service charge. From the perspective of the quarterly earnings number, the TSA and the timing of the acquisition probably had the impact of $.10/share in EPS, although without specific information from the company, that is more in the nature of a guess than something that is provable. And, of course, Documentum had been mis-run by EMC for many years, and its margins are far less than the targets that Open Text have for the business.At the very least, Documentum had been willing to make very steep concessions on professional services contract both to keep its utilization rate at an acceptable level and also to help the company sell software.At this point, I think it is of limited value to look at the specific line items of expense and revenue although I discuss them at a cursory level below. The metrics in the past quarter really don't say much about how the acquisition will play out. They say very little about the revenue synergies, the reality of the product road map, or much about the cost synergies OTEX will realize. This being Open Text, I would be very reluctant to bet against it in terms of cost synergies.The discussion that wasn't had during the conference call that needs to be at least mentioned is the competitive potential from some of the newer entrants in the content management space who tend to focus on a specific vertical. Perhaps the most prominent of these is the set of Veeva Vault solutions targeted at the life sciences space. Typically, Open Text projects retaining 90% of the customers it receives in an acquisition transaction. That is going to be a more challenging achievement this time around, given the structure and evolution of the ECM space, although I would suggest that like many software applications, user mobility is limited.What does the future hold for Open TextThis company has never really supplied investors much in the way of specific guidance, particularly in terms of top-line expectations. The discussion during the current quarter conference call was no exception in that regard. Despite the relative muted performance of margins last quarter, the company is still forecasting full year operating margins near the top of its current range of expectations, or about 34%. I think, given the history of this company, that it is reasonable to believe the company will meet or exceed its margin targets.The consensus forecast as published on First Call is that revenues will show a normal seasonal pattern in the June quarter, compounded by the impact of owning Documentum for a full 91 days. The company has plenty of solutions to sell and a very large TAM to address and plenty of heads involved in selling. It would be tiresome, no doubt, to attempt to go through all of the company's many offerings and handicap them and look at competition. But information management is certainly more than large enough to support decent growth for Open Text for the foreseeable future. The most recent Forrester report, linked here, says that OTEX is the leader in both of the content management spaces that it looks at. Another study linked here says the space will achieve a 19% CAGR through 2021 and will reach annual revenues of $66 billion by that time.The way OTEX defines the market excludes some of the business services in the later definition but still finds a current TAM of $35 billion. Given the market research studies, it is self-evident that the company could probably achieve more rapid top-line growth.Why doesn't OTEX grow faster organically? The fact that it doesn't do so is really by choice and part of the company's overall strategy. It doesn't grow faster organically because it basically invests its cash flow in acquisitions and not into operating expenses. That leads to the company spending far less on both research and development and sales and marketing than do its peers. I think it is important for investors to understand that this is a conscious choice and not simply a happenstance.Most quarters, the company is achieving its objectives. The problem is that often its objectives really do not quite match up with investor preferences and can lead to an unhappy share price progression. I think it is important that investors understand the company's strategy. It is one that has been significantly refined over the years and no longer calls for the cadence of organic growth that had been the case some time ago. Based on the operational record of this company, this strategy is more likely to be realized.The CEO said during his conference call presentation that ""Our first principle is the long-term growth of Open Text intrinsic value and we are building a steady predictable business with strong recurring revenues, now on an annualized $2 billion run rate…""M&A remains our leading growth driver, and we will continue to grow and invest in our M&A team, further scaling up our capital deployment...""Perhaps surprisingly, the company CEO says that the investment strategy will not be slowed in the balance of the year. The company has financial resources and commitments that will allow it to continue to buy businesses and last week it announced another one of its ""junk-heap"" acquisition by agreeing to buy Covisint (NASDAQ:COVS) The $75 million consideration, net of cash, is just a bit more than 1X revenue, although revenues have been shrinking and the company has made losses indefinitely.Covisint used to be a shooting star in the dot-com days. It subsequently belonged to Compuware till it was spun-off. The company operates a marketplace for enterprise buyers and sellers and competes, to an extent, against other purchasing software such as that currently offered by Coupa (NASDAQ:COUP) and by the Ariba operation of SAP (NYSE:SAP). While it is unlikely that it will be able to grow organically without a massive investment that will never be made by OTEX, it can readily evolve to the typical OTEX financial model in which it contributes $20-25 million of operating income generated by recurring revenue sources, a strong return on the cash investment that OTEX will make.That doesn't mean the company will not innovate. It continues to do so, and it has launched an AI service called Magellan. It offers all the ""Must haves"" to compete effectively at an enterprise level for almost any level of content management RFP.Looking at some expense metrics and where they might goLast quarter is an anomalous starting point from which to consider many cost ratios for Open Text. The impact of the merger and the concomitant services agreement as well as the deferred revenue haircut make comparisons only marginally useful.Overall, gross margins for the quarter came to just less than 65%. In the year earlier period, gross margins had been 68%. The decline in gross margin was pretty broadly spread, although customer support (maintenance) margins fell by the greatest amount, proportionately. Typically, maintenance produces gross margins of close to 90% for this company, and it would be surprising if margins in that category did not return or even surpass that level in shorter term.The company indicated that Documentum had entered into several larger transactions in which professional services margins will be compressed. Overall, professional services margins fell by about 100 bps year on year. But all of the company's revenue categories were impacted, and some of the impact will likely carry into this quarter before abating.Through nine months, the research and development spend ratio was 12.2%, and I think it is reasonable to expect that the company will constrain that ratio going forward. The company supports a huge set of solutions with a relatively modest investment in research and development. The ability to make appropriate tradeoffs between product development and profitability is a key ingredient of the company's operational performance. It almost insures that the company will never achieve double-digit organic growth, but it does provide the resources necessary to fund acquisitions.The company spent 20% of revenues on sales and marketing last quarter. The expense ratio in that category was up substantially year on year but up less than it might have been sequentially. It is probably redundant to point out just how much less this expense ratio is compared to high growth IT vendors. Overall, the three typical operating expense categories were 40% of revenue last quarter compared to 39% of revenues the prior year.The company CEO actually specifically forecast double-digit revenue growth in fiscal 2018 which starts in three weeks, and that seems to be a high-odds outlook given the impact from additional two quarters of revenue from Documentum in addition to whatever acquisitions that Open Text is likely to negotiate and to close over the coming year.The company was able to increase cash flow from operations on a sequential basis significantly during the quarter. CFFO came to $156 million in Q3, up from $107 million in Q2 but still below year-earlier levels. CFFO was limited by the decline in GAAP income the last couple of quarters which has been under pressure from factors discussed above. On the other hand, most of that decline was made-up by the substantial increase in the category of depreciation and amortization of intangibles that stems from the mergers that have constrained GAAP income.The company did report a significant level of deferred revenue for the quarter, although a bit less than was reported in the year earlier period. It is, I think, difficult to use the increase in the deferred revenue balance as a potential indicator in terms of cash flow generation going forward given the numerous cross-currents affecting that metric in the wake of acquisitions over the past year. Given that cloud services and subscriptions now make up about 75% of total revenues and that proportion is likely to climb, I imagine that deferred revenue generation will probably rise a bit faster than total revenue and will represent an increasing percentage of cash flow going forward.At this point, stock-based compensation is a minor factor in cash flow generation. Last quarter, stock-based compensation was just over 1% of total revenues and less than 4% of reported CFFO.ValuationWhen evaluating Open Text shares as an investment, the principal question relates to how it has achieved the record on which typical valuation metrics are evaluated. As has been mentioned, OTEX is a company whose growth is mainly a function of acquisition and of disciplined operation. That is not what many tech investors value the most in their investments.Should they? That would be a very subjective answer on the part of this writer or anyone else. I could make the argument that trying to run a hyper-growth company is like sitting atop a high-pressure steam engine with the safety valve disabled and some band of crazed stokers feeding coal into a boiler at a manic pace. Most investors in hyper-growth tech names, like this writer, are well aware that some of our investments are doomed to implosion.In the case of Open Text, implosion isn't the primary risk given the breadth of the company's portfolio and the proportion of its revenue that now comes from ratable sources. And, it is hard to even get a fix on bookings because of all the puts and takes on the deferred revenue line. But this company can fail, even if only by a little in terms of revenue generation, and it can be unsuccessful in finding acquisitions that will meet its criteria both in terms of cost and in terms of its ability to drive the acquired businesses to the company's business model. By the end of the decade, the company is expecting operating margins pushing 40%. In addition, Open Text has accumulated a significant level of net debt and fixed costs as part of its business model. Leverage is surely a risk, at least in classical valuation models, and this company's net debt is 20% of its enterprise value, not really excessive but certainly high for an IT vendor.Currently, the company has 265 million shares outstanding, which is up noticeably from the year-earlier level, almost entirely due to the secondary offering this past December which was undertaken as part of the funding of the Documentum transaction. It has a current enterprise value of $10.8 billion. Sales are projected to be about $2.6 billion for the fiscal year starting July 1st. That is an EV/S of just over 4X. In isolation, I doubt that most investors will consider an EV/S 4X be a great bargain.On the other hand, the company has a projected P/E of 13X on forward earnings, and that is one of the more reasonable of those metrics to be seen in this market.As mentioned, over time, I expect that free cash flow will consistently exceed reported non-GAAP earnings because of the growing influence of deferred revenue generation. That has not really been the case so far this year due to cash flow factors that are less correlated with long-term operational performance such as balance sheet items. At this point, I won't even try to put together a free cash flow estimate for the coming fiscal year although those exist, certainly. But the elements of cash flow, excluding balance sheet items, might suggest that the company will be able to generate between $750 million and $800 million in the coming fiscal year, which would be a free cash flow yield of between 7% and 7.5%, certainly a healthy level considering the current state of valuations in the IT space.I think that investors buying OTEX shares should understand that they aren't buying hyper-growth or even category dominance. It is always possible that the company will generate more organic growth than that which it has planned, but the investment case should not be made based on that kind of prognosis. I own the shares because I think the Documentum merger will pay off dramatically and because I think the opportunity the company has to reprise such accretive transactions is as great as it ever has been."
4005845,25120,2016-09-13T08:38:29-04:00,"Open Text accelerates is acquisition trajectory with the purchase of assets from Dell/EMC.The $1.6 billion deal is the largest acquisition to date and adds another chapter to this growth story.While management has created a lot of value in the past, I am cautious amidst high valuations and poor organic growth rates, as dealmaking creates operational risks as well.","Open Text (OTEX) is a very interesting business. This Canadian software business aids customers to deal with their non-structured data, called ""enterprise information management.""The company has grown through a string of acquisitions, making it actually a roll-up company. While a roll-up strategy has a negative sound to it, the accompany has actually done a great job at managing and integrating all these acquisitions. By doing this, management has created real value for shareholders, aided by valuation multiple inflation over time as well.While the past has been excellent, I wonder if investors can look forward to similar impressive returns in the years to come. Given the high multiples at which the company is trading, questionable organic growth rates and huge integration tasks, I would advocate for some caution.The BusinessI had a look at Open Text back in June following the acquisition of $315 million worth of assets from HP (HP). I was truly impressed with the company which grew sales from less than half a billion a decade ago to a run rate of $2 billion at the time. This was in part, or to a large extent, driven by 53 acquisitions being made over that time frame. Looking back at the cash flow statements for the past ten years, I estimated that Open Text made roughly $3 billion worth of deals over that time frame.The math behind the deals made sense as operating profits rose from roughly $40 million (10% margins on $400 million in sales) in 2006, to margins of 20% on sales of $1.8 billion in 2015. A $500 million business in 2006 has seen its enterprise value increase to $8.5 billion by June of this year, creating $8 billion in incremental value on the back of $3 billion in dealmaking. With regular capital spending running at very low levels, value was created either by the fact that valuation multiples have risen, or through margin gains and organic growth.I ended concluding that the truth was probably somewhere in between as the company announced further expansion by buying assets from HP in a deal adding some $110-$125 million in annual sales. The pro-forma company was at the time on track to generate $2 billion in sales and after-tax margins of 15%. Net debt of $1.18 billion was seen at little over 2 times pro-forma EBITDA of $550 million per annum.Based on the results so far for the fiscal year of 2016, GAAP earnings were seen at around $2.25 per share. I estimated that the huge amortization charges on the back of past acquisitions hurt GAAP earnings a great deal, with adjusted earnings running at levels closer to $3 per share. Based on these numbers, shares traded at 27 times GAAP earnings and 20 times adjusted earnings at the time.Making A Huge MoveWhile Open Text is still working to integrate recent acquisitions, the company made a huge move by acquiring Dell/EMC's enterprise content division. The unit includes products like Documentum, InfoArchive and LEAP. With the deal Open Text aims to boost its enterprise content management business and information lifecycle management operations.The deal is huge, valued at $1.62 billion. This implies that Open Text is paying a sales multiple of 2.7 times annual revenues of $599 million. Immediate accretion is expected following the deal which could close in a 3-4 month time frame, although management did not quantify the expected accretion. While the purchase sum will initially be financed with debt, Open Text does not rule out the issuance of new equity in order to avoid taking on too much leverage on its books.Open Text's management praises the recurring nature of the revenue base as most of the revenues are derived from maintenance activities, generated through a customer base of 5,600 companies.Pro-Forma ImpactIn July Open Text released its full year results for 2016. Full year sales came in at $1.82 billion, up 2-3% in constant currency terms. Fourth quarter revenues rose to $484 million which was essentially flat compared to the year before on an adjusted basis. This was worrying as organic sales were essentially flat. Cloud & subscription revenues make up a third of total revenues, yet growth of 5% is not that inspiring given the growth rates reported by other players in the industry.Note that these results do not include the purchase of the HP assets and of course the Dell/EMC deal. These two deals combined cost the company nearly $2 billion but will add roughly $700 million in annual sales.Open Text ended the fiscal year with $1.3 billion in cash and little over $2.1 billion in debt. Including pension related obligations, net debt stands at around $900 million, as the HP and Dell/EMC deal will result in a pro-forma leverage position of roughly $2.9 billion.Open Text's stand-alone EBITDA came in at $610 million in 2016, in part driven by huge amortization charges. If we assume that the acquired activities post similar EBITDA margins in the low-thirties, EBITDA might increase by another $225 million, for a $920-$950 million pro-forma EBITDA number. If that assumption is realistic, leverage ratios are seen at little over 3 times EBITDA, assuming no shares are being issued to finance the deal.Open Text's 122 million outstanding shares traded at $60 before the Dell/EMC deal was announced, for a value of $7.3 billion. Including pro-forma debt of $900 million, the company traded at a $8.2 billion valuation, equivalent to 4.5 times sales. The purchase of the Dell/EMC deal at a 2.7 times sales multiple therefore looks appealing, marking a big discount in terms of sales multiples versus Open Text's own valuation.Investors like the relative low sales multiple being paid for the business. Shares jumped by $5 in response to the deal, as the jump represents a $600 million increase in value on the back of a $1.62 billion deal.Final Remarks, Too Much Valuation RiskOpen Text ended up reporting GAAP earnings of $2.33 per share for 2016. Non-GAAP earnings came in at $3.54 per share but they were inflated by large amortization charges which are structural in the case of Open Text, as well as other charges. Given the structural nature of acquisitions, amortization costs are a real cost for the business. For that reason, I am not comfortable in using the non-GAAP earnings multiple as investors ""pay"" for these charges based on the initial transaction sum.If we factor in a combined $700 million addition in sales from the HP and Dell/EMC deal, on a stand-alone revenue base of little over $1.8 billion, Open Text will grow to become a $2.5 billion revenue business. While the company claims that adjusted earnings will rise on the back of the deal, real accretion is expected to be limited in the near term.Financing costs on the $2 billion in acquisitions will eat a large portion of additional operating profits provided by these businesses. The company itself posted operating margins on a GAAP basis of 20% this year. If the combined HP and Dell/EMC assets will post similar margins of 20%, operating earnings might jump by $140 million per annum. If we however assume $2 billion in incremental debt financing at 5-6%, additional interest expenses of $100-$120 million will ""eat"" most of these additional operating earnings.That said, synergies will be realized following the rapid pace of balance sheet deleveraging, operational cost savings and improved position in the marketplace. Open Text could furthermore use a portion of its +$1 billion cash holding to finance the deal, avoiding some of the incremental interest expenses.While the track record of the business is great, Open Text already trades at $65 per share, equivalent to 28 times trailing GAAP earnings for 2016. Even if synergies and deleveraging will boost the earnings in the years to come a +20 times GAAP multiple seems rich amidst a 3 times leveraged balance sheet. While I really appreciate the track record of the business, I worry about the pace of dealmaking as well. Organic growth is really not existing at the moment, and it is very dangerous to keep acquiring businesses, certainly if they underperform by shrinking after they have been acquired.While Open Text is building a portfolio of all kinds of information/document systems, it is very hard to judge the sustainability of all these technologies and products. As leverage is not even the greatest concern, given the excellent cash flow conversion on the back of large amortization charges, valuation is a key reason to be worried. I simply worry about paying a rich multiple for a business which is not reporting organic growth at the moment. To alleviate some of my concerns, I would like to see market-equivalent valuation multiples on GAAP earnings before my interest is triggered. That translates into a targeted entry point in a $40-$50 region, levels far removed from the current level in the stock."
3983896,98236,2016-06-23T11:48:16-04:00,"Open Text has announced several acquisitions of some significance in the past few weeks.These acquisitions, based on management commentary, are likely to add visibly to anticipated EPS during the course of FY'17.The company has said that it is on a track to deploy $3 billion of capital ""in the next few years"" by making smaller and larger accretive acquisitions.The impact of the company's V-1 product release should start to be visible in the results of operations achieved this quarter.If V-16 is successful, it will produce the first significant organic growth for this company within the recent past.","Classifications can be dangerous to the health of the alpha seeking investor!Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) is one of the more unusual of the companies that I have ever followed. At one point in the dim past, it almost might have been labeled a growth company, although that is probably an exaggeration. At various points, it has had the characteristics of a GARP name or a value name and it has always been a roll-up- at least in the time I have known of it. But it has managed one consistent characteristic in that the shares have tended to appreciate over time for one reason or the other and made a new all-time high the other day at $61.OTEX has not proven to be a name of particular interest to many SA readers, perhaps because of its leveraged balance sheet (it recently sold another $500 million of debt with an interest rate of 5.875% to partially fund the acquisitions described below), perhaps because of its unorthodox business strategy or perhaps because it is located in Canada. 96% of the shares are held by either institutions (91%) or by insiders (5%). It does pay a dividend, although with a yield of 1.57% it probably doesn't attract too much interest from income oriented investors. Because of its highly unusual business model and because of its recent share price appreciation, Open Text is unlikely to be a table thumping buy to most observers and the consensus recommendation is in fact below the average for IT vendors according to the Thompson/First Call consensus. It is basically cheap enough but not deep value. The current mean price target is less than 5% above the current share price although that hasn't been adjusted for the recent string of acquisitions and the likely impact they will have on EPS estimates. For now, my guess is that when the company gives what guidance it does on its fiscal year end conference call, it is likely to increase its EPS expectations to take account of its recent string of acquisitions.I chose to write this article at this point because the company has recently announced a slew of acquisitions, that at least on their face are likely to cause upward revisions to both revenue and to EPS expectations. The shares in the past few days have appreciated by 5%. In the few days prior to that, they were down 5%. That is actually a little worse than the IGV index in the very short term which is up a couple of percent.Management has spoken to having a backlog of potential acquisitions that fit its requirements. If it announces more acquisitions between now and the conference call, the more significant the increase in guided EPS can be. I believe that investors still do not appreciate just how key acquisitions are to the success of the OTEX operating model. No acquisitions, little growth. Significant acquisitions will correlate with unexpected EPS increases. To the extent that investors understand that by far the most important indicia of success for this company is successful acquisitions, the more importance they will ascribe to the announcements of the last few days.As I point out below, the company has the opportunity to achieve significant organic growth for the first time in many years. We will see if that will actually happen in this present quarter but the consensus estimates are hardly forecasting that it will. The consensus revenue forecast is for no top-line growth this quarter and for growth next year that would be below that accounted for just by the sum of revenue contribution from the acquisitions recently announced. As I go through below, the expected growth in revenues next year of about $140 million or almost 8% compares to current revenues of $237 million for the acquisitions announced in just the last few days. So real organic growth, should it take place, would actually be a significant surprise to investors.No one, except those individuals interested in self-flagellation, finds it easy to recommend shares that are at an all-time high. And yet that is the position in which I find myself. I think that the shares are a reasonable investment whose misunderstood and derided strategy is one of the more interesting in my coverage universe. It has, in CEO Mark Barrenechea, one of the more capable CEO's in the IT world and it seems to have evolved into having a reasonably productive salesforce (sales and marketing spend is less than 19% of revenues so far in the company's fiscal '16 year although given this company's multiple revenue streams it is really a bit difficult to evaluate the efficiency of sales and marketing spend when compared to peers). At these share price levels, a commitment in OTEX shares is not likely to make readers rich. It can, however, produce decent positive alpha.I was first introduced to the name many years ago by a friend who was responsible for much of the company's recruiting. It seemed like an interesting story at the time. Its two major competitors had gotten consolidated by IBM which had bought FileNet and EMC which had purchased Documentum. So, to a greater or lesser degree, OTEX was the last of the major content management vendors to remain independent. That is usually a positive development as investors will speculate about consolidation potential and the companies that have been consolidated will tend to be less effective competitors once they are in the hands of much larger and slower moving organizations. (As part of the EMC fire sale of assets, Documentum was shopped a couple of months ago but has so far not been sold. It seems to have experienced diminishing product sales since EMC initially acquired it all the way back in 2003.) When I first met the then CEO of the company, John Shackleton he told me it was his goal to drive revenues to $1 billion and then sell the company. Of course it didn't happen that way and instead, OTEX remains independent and has become the consolidator of note in its space.And in those years, demand in the content management space was buoyed by the need for electronic compliance solutions. It was the era of big scandals and all companies wanted to digitize their content as a way of complying with document retention mandates and being prepared for lengthy discovery processes. So, despite the Great Recession that was soon to eviscerate demand for most software solutions, OTEX kept chugging along. In the nature of things, most application software is bought and really can't be sold. (I do not want to suggest that personal relations are not of crucial importance in the sales process. What I would suggest is that no matter strong the personal relationship might be, no salesman has ever persuaded a user to buy something that he/she hadn't planned to buy in the first instance.) No one in the world has woken up one morning and decided that he/she wanted a new ERP system because they saw a beautiful new model in the showroom or on a commercial. Companies almost regardless of the state of their IT budgets found the resources to buy content management solutions to satisfy the strictest of regulations regarding document storage and recovery that were enacted in the wake of both the Enron scandal and the financial crisis. And hence, trying to become an expert on one of the few IT names that was growing in 2008 became an important accomplishmentOTEX, through no particular prescience of its own, all of a sudden owned the best franchise on the block with significant competitive advantages from weakened competition and significant demand on levels far above typical IT buyers. If your CEO tells you that you need to purchase and deploy a content management solution the response is usually to get one on order Tout Suite. (As an aside and coming from a former Houstonite, Tout Suite, which is the name of a downtown Houston bakery café, has the best macarons and its sister bakery which is actually called Sweet is really the standard by which all other bakeries in Houston are measured. I am absolutely certain that my indulgence for Sweet's pot du crème's has added inches to my girth but then there is the House of Pies-Texas Pecan Fudge ought to be made illegal-but as this is an article about investing and not eating in Houston, enough of that). And so back in ""08-'09 when everything else was busy imploding, little OTEX just chugged along. Even then it was known as a roll-up, but maybe a best of breed roll-up. It had just finished digesting Hummingbird, another content management vendor that had a hit a soft patch it and was able to pick up a high end content management company, Vignette very cheaply in 2009, after that company had imploded. The shares were actually up by about 15% in 2008, dramatic alpha or anything else one might call it in that disastrous year.Fast forward to 2016. I wrote about OTEX for Seeking Alpha in February of this year when the shares were at about $47/share. The shares closed on June 21 st at $61. I am not about to claim any prescience. 30% appreciation is decent but I could have picked many mid-sized IT companies that have enjoyed more or less the same share price appreciation over that time span. Overall, the IGV software index since that time has gone up by 27%, so OTEX has produced precious little in the way of positive alpha.OTEX has reported a quarter since my first article, and the results were… well the results were mediocre on a charitable day. And so I felt compelled to write another article trying to explain how a miss might be reinterpreted as a beat. And indeed that has turned out to be the case, at least in part. So what now? I think that the answer to that question is basically a function of how you define OTEX. It is not a growth company. It actually has had little or no organic growth and that been the case for at least all of this decade. The company's strategy, which has been articulated on many occasions by CEO Mike Barrenechea, is to serve as a consolidator for what are basically smaller technology companies who haven't the resources to take their vision to the next level.Open Text, as was true of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) a decade ago, has figured out how to integrate these relatively ""doggy"" properties, hack at their cost structure and produce reasonable financial results centered more on operating margins than on growth. It has been an interesting ride and if one can ignore trying to classify this company in a particular way, I believe the shares have profit potential even after the company's recent share price appreciation.Fishing in hidden ponds and quiet backwaters for trash fish and an occasional lobster or crayfish that come together to make a nice bouillabaisse.OK-my mind often is fixated on food. What can I say. Just so you know, today is the crayfish (in the south we say crawfish) festival in Spring, TX.One of the issues about trying to run a software company-or really any company-whose entire growth strategy is based on acquisition, is that it needs the involvement of the CEO on a full time basis. Mark Barrenechea had received a diagnosis of leukemia early last year and he was forced to limit his involvement in the company's affairs for much of 2015. Mr. Barrenechea did set up an office in his hospital room but inevitably momentum was lost, not perhaps in the day to day operations of Open Text, but in the ability to negotiate and to close acquisitions. The results of his absence were quite apparent.Open Text acquired Actuate on 1/1/2015 which followed the acquisition of less well known GXS Group in early 2014. Much of the growth that OTEX reported over the past 12 months or so has been a function of those two deals and their integration into OTEX, particularly with regards to the margin enhancement that the company has been able to achieve. Those two acquisitions had revenues of a bit greater than $600 million on an annual when the acquisitions closed and that represents more than 1/3rd of the company's current revenue base. I am not altogether sure just how much those acquisitions or their successors are faring these days in terms of revenue. Actuate was a very sick company when it was bought and I feel certain that OTEX would have moved to cut out the dead wood and let revenues settle to a place where profitability could be achieved. But regardless of that, I believe that it was those acquisitions that allowed OTEX to report a 2% decrease in revenues but to increase non-GAAP EPS by 21% and to achieve a 33% growth in cash flow with cash flow margins of 43% last quarter.But after those two deals, the balance of 2015 saw no substantive merger activity until the end of the year when OTEX bought Daegis for $13.5 million in cash. Daegis was apparently a struggling firm but with solutions that filled some ""white space"" in the overall OTEX EIS stack in terms of E-Discovery and governance. It offering fit nicely into the context of the overall solutions offered by OTEX.Earlier this month, Open Text bought a privately held company called Recommind for $163 million which has a current revenue run rate of about $75 million and is forecast to be immediately accretive. Recommend is a vendor of what are called eDiscovery tools which as the name implies, help users to find the data that exists in the content management silos that Open Text (and others) have sold. Again, it is an easy solution for OTEX to sell and further develop as e-discovery is part of an enterprise sale with content management.In late April, the company acquired a company called ANX. ANX, which had revenues of $30 million cost OTEX $100 million and was forecast to be immediately accretive to earnings. ANX is said to be a leading provider of cloud-based information exchange services to both the Automotive and Healthcare verticals. Here, OpenText was able to do a deal that hit 3 of its desired criteria. ANX is cloud based, its solution fits nicely into the company's Business Network and it helps OPEX enhance its market position in two target verticals.Early last month OTEX completed its acquisition of the ""Customer Experience"" software assets of HP (NYSE:HPQ). That deal cost OTEX $170 million for which it got $85-$95 in annualized revenues that was immediately accretive. And finally a couple of days ago, OpenText agreed to buy HP's customer communications management software for $315 million. The acquisition is forecast to add about $120 million of annualized revenues to OTEX, to be immediately accretive and to be on the OTEX operating model by the end of Q1 2017.The point of going through this bit of tedium is to illustrate precisely how the platform strategy of OpenText can work in practice. I have no idea if all of these acquisitions are going to work and in none of them did the company forecast any revenue synergies. It is likely that the acquisitions will cost some level of product revenue as the combinations become consummated. But in all the cases shown above, the acquisitions will fit in nicely with the whole suite of content management solutions that OTEX is already selling and both sales and development functions can be readily consolidated regardless of the sales success of the newly enlarged product lines.The net of these transactions is that OTEX annual revenues are expected to increase by $237 million which would add 12% to current analyst consensus forecasts of fiscal 2017 revenues. Further, and just using the projections made by OTEX in its acquisition press releases, the transactions will add between $.35-$.40 to the annual run rate in EPS sometime during fiscal 2017 (ends 6/30/17). That is not insubstantial given current analysis consensus EPS forecast for EPS of $3.95 for the period before the inclusion of these acquisitions.OK, that is what management is forecasting. Are there any less self-interested projections that might help readers/investors? I would like to point investors toward some objective source regarding the value of these latest 4 acquisitions. Most of the acquisitions come from mighty dusty corners of the IT universe or they have been operations inside of HPQ that almost certainly were never carefully tended. They have strategic value, or so it seems. OpenText has been doing these types of acquisitions for a decade or more and has a corporate culture that allows it to shed bits and pieces of its acquired companies quickly and without greatly disturbing operations. Needless to say, some acquisitions will work better than others-that is always true. It is even possible that one of the acquisitions might grow-that has happened in the distant past. But for the most part, I have to take management at its word on these kinds of projections simply because of the company's track record and because there is no really objective mechanism to actually analyze multiple acquisitions of small companies in a short time frame.But beyond these acquisitions, the CEO said on the last conference call that ""There are hundreds of assets available within the EIM market and our pipeline of targets is increasing."" I think there is little doubt that this company, will indeed, continue to acquire these kinds of assets and to make them contributors to the value of the shares.Why can't OpenText produce organic growth like most normal company's in IT are able to do?It is a fair question and it is one that obviously weighs significantly on share values. On the last conference call, the company's new President Steven Murphy commented that the company's goal is to ""balance cost discipline with driving sustainable organic growth initiatives."" Company CEO Mark Barrenechea, commented that the ""EIM market (Enterprise information Management) is growing by greater than 7%. So the management recognizes that the market it addresses is large-more than $20 billion in spend-and that the EIM space does have a decent level of growth. Management, and CEO Mark Barrenechea has a belief that the stars have aligned and with the release of V.16 and the product road map going forward, the company will start to achieve noticeable organic growthSo why hasn't this company produced any organic growth? There are many potential answers but I have never seen or heard a company presentation that addresses that subject with specificity and clarity. John Shackleton, the former CEO of OTEX never seemed all that upset about anything other than executing on the acquisition strategy of the company and could take quarterly license misses without breaking a sweat.On the recent conference call, Mark Barrenechea gave as good an answer as any I have heard from this company and I think, therefore, that it is worth quoting at length from his comment. Mr. Barrenechea said,Single sentence answer to the question posed at the outset: OpenText focuses on doing multiple acquisitions. Not said, but implied, I believe, is that identifying targets, closing deals and executing on the OpenText platform strategy has been the priority, certainly compared to organic growth.I think that it is fair to say, that the potential for organic growth based on the company's new product release is as strong as it has been for years. On the latest conference call, management cited some positives in terms of early adopters. Management laid out an extensive product roadmap complete with extensions, or ""enhancement packs or EP's"" as OTEX calls them. I think that the next several quarters will be the proof points as to whether Release 16 lives up to its hype and management expectations.If it does, it will surely change the valuation metrics that analysts use to forecast price targets. If not-well so long as V-16 isn't an unmitigated disaster, its performance will not be as critical to sustain a purchase recommendation for the shares as the continued success of the acquisition strategy.Basically, then, the acquisition strategy is not about revenue synergies and it is all about cost synergies. The company has completed over 50 acquisitions in the past decade. It is hard, I imagine, to focus on integrating 50 companies (some of which to be sure, are tiny) and to try to maximize product revenue simultaneously. OpenText is far more interested in getting its acquired businesses onto its operating model than it is in trying to maximize its revenues or market share. The model depends on growing cash flow in order to have enough cash to be able to buy more companies. It does not depend on trying to maximize growth rates, especially since doing so would inevitably impact the company's operating model.Mr. Barrenechea talked about the opportunity for OTEX to deploy $3 billion of capital over the next several years on the latest call. He is basically suggesting, I believe, that the company can buy $3 billion of software properties that will produce $1 billion+ in annualized revenues that will be operating on the OTEX operating model which can reach operating margins of 38%. He was, I believe, implying that the company has and will generate sufficient cash to make those acquisitions without any equity raises and with only a modest amount of additional debt. The accretion potential for such a plan, if it is successfully executed is significant. Overall, if management pulls this off, it will increase reported non-GAAP EPS by more than $2.50.No one, including this writer, actually thinks that OTEX could possibly add $2.50 in reported EPS to its bottom line over the next 4 to 5 years through the disciplined acquisition strategy forecast by the CEO-but that is the potential and would happen if OTEX never grew organically over the time period. Management has talked about organic growth both recently and over the years but it has not happened. Management has articulated its strategy of being a ""platform"" acquisitor and that has worked well. I will take cash flow and earnings growth any day over 5%-10% annual organic growth which might come at the cost of the company's strong operating model.Management continues to believe that its Release 16 will promote significant organic growth. I have written about it in the initial article that was posted on this site. It ought to promote organic growth and maybe it will, but the potential for this business is more in the acquisitions. I doubt that many analysts at this point are forecasting much in the way of organic growth at this point. It would be too fraught to do so given the track record of this company. I would look on noticeable organic growth from this company as lagniappe more than a central component of the investment case.I will say that this CEO does have an exceptional grounding in the EIM technology. He is actually the CTO of this company as well as the CEO. Mr. Barranchea makes a good case with regards to his product road map and his positioning-I just can't bring myself to want to bet the farm on organic growth when I know that the acquisitions that OTEX has made, and is making, have a history of working and at the scale forecast by Mr. Barranchea are adequate to support the investment thesis for the shares.But it will certainly be interesting to see if OTEX can actually compete with IBM's Watson which is a part of the OpenText strategy., Again, there are far more people who think that Watson is the next big thing in IT and who will never believe that a company like OTEX could never compete with that juggernaut.There is almost no way that I know in which the integrating sales forces is not going to lead to at least a short-term drop in the sales of product revenues. And that is one reason why management spoke about wanting to buy companies with a recurring revenue model. Integrating R&D is another way of saying that OTEX will focus on areas of higher return and not attempt to keep the entire product lines of all the companies that it acquires. But from my perspective, given that the recent acquisitions actually fill holes in the OTEX EIM suite, over time there will be some level of revenue synergy as current customers add the additional functionality to their installations now being sold by OTEX and as the combined sales staff is able to propose larger and more comprehensive deals to prospective customers.ValuationCurrently, OTEX has an enterprise value of about $8 billion. Current revenue expectations for fiscal '17 which is the most appropriate time period to use as it starts in less than 10 days are for just less than $2 billion. So the EV/S is 4X. Probably average for a vendor with a hybrid revenue model at this point. The consensus EPS for FY' 17 is for EPS of just less than $4.00. In the wake of the recent acquisitions, I think that the consensus forecast EPS is likely to rise, particularly after the company provides guidance in about 6-7 weeks. But at the current consensus, the P/E is a quite reasonable 15X. At this point, I have to pause to comment that OTEX does use stock based comp although it is actually a pretty small amount in terms of the overall income statement. Through the first 9 months of the fiscal year, stock based comp. was $19 million which was about 1.5% of revenues. Stock based comp was down a bit in the most recent reported quarter when compared to the prior year. So, the P/E is based on ""real"" earnings.The best operating metric last quarter was operating cash flow which grew by more than 30%. Most of that was a function of the significant increase in GAAP net income for the period. For 9 months, cash flow has risen, but not by all that much. All of the 9 month increase in cash flow is a function of the increase in net income. Based on current trends, it seems likely that operating cash flow for the year ought to be about $510-$520 billion. That would be an operating cash flow margin of 28%. Free cash flow yields are not a particularly useful metric to calculate for this company as so much of the calculation is dependent on the timing and the amount of acquisitions.I believe that valuations are reasonable just based on the apparent success that the company has recently had in closing accretive acquisitions. Should the company start to achieve significant organic growth, the share price appreciation potential is far more significant than is inherent in the consensus. I think the current valuation does allow for significant positive alpha even in the wake of the share price appreciation since February.Wrapping thing Up!This writer is well aware that OTEX shares are at an all time high. It would be far easier if the shares hadn't enjoyed recent share price appreciation. But despite their run, I believe there is still positive alpha ahead."
3887786,98236,2016-02-11T13:03:08-05:00,"Open Text reported a significant upside to earnings for its fiscal Q2 extending its string of upside performance.Beneath the headline numbers, the company dramatically overattained on product revenues with strong bookings and strong license revenue growth.Management has provided a very easy hurdle in terms of operating earnings for the balance of 2016.Management has forecast market share gains against weakened and disorganized competitors in the content management space.The company is preparing to release a new version of its core software platform that may drive product revenue as well in 2H.","Introduction/Operating DetailOpen Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) reported the financial results of its fiscal Q2 that ended 12/31 on February 9, 2016. In some ways this was a very typical OTEX quarter in which revenue growth was minimal but EPS growth significantly exceeded expectations. I have been following this company for many years now and more quarters than not, I have seen this kind of headline result. But I think if one drills down a little deeper this was actually a better quarter than met the eye. One place to look to see just how strong this quarter was for the company is through the disaggregation of the company's income statement. I had written about the company recently and while I felt it had favorable valuation metrics, I had speculated as to whether what had been a very stodgy laggard in terms of revenue growth might become some kind of growth sprinter. And now there is a bit of evidence that the there are grounds for optimism on that score.Open Text, like many other older enterprise software vendors is in the midst of transitions, both to what is calls digitalization and to what is simply known as a recurring revenue model. There are huge differences between vendors in how the transition is being managed and the financial results that can be achieved in the interim.I would focus on a couple of specifics in the recent release. License revenues increased by 19% in constant currency to $82 million. There are those in the analytical community these days who look down upon on-premise license revenue. But the fact is that in the short term that is where the cash flow dollars are and that is where the short term operating leverage is located. I suppose, if I had my druthers, I would have preferred to see an extra $10 million in Cloud services and subscriptions, but in the short term, being able to manage a transition that includes retaining license customers as well as building a cohort of managed services customer is really the name of the game. It is not something that m any vendors can achieve and the results of both Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) are testimonies, if any are needed as to how difficult the transition can be. The fact that IBM's software revenues declined by 6% in constant currencies while the same metric for OTEX was up 7% is the kind of statistic that suggests the strength of the company's underlying performance.Another comment that is probably not going to receive the attention that it deserves was the booking statistic which the company describes as Minimum Contract Value, or MCV. MCV last quarter was $57 million which again is probably a stronger number than it may seem on the surface. This is a relatively mature company with a long roster of installed customers. MCV as this company calculates it, relates to the increase (italics mine) in the minimum contract value of committed spend. MCV was up by 45% sequentially from Q1 and about 10%+ in constant currency from the year earlier period. Part of the MCV attainment showed up the customer support line which grew by 9% in constant currency year on year, again a difficult attainment when a company is moving to subscription based revenue generation. The strength in customer support is another pillar of strong operating margins. Customer support has exceptionally high gross margins, requires minimal development resources and uses little sales capacity. The ability of this company wring 37% non-GAAP operating margins up by 420 bps from the prior year has lots to do with the successful management of the transition and the ability that this company has had to sell its installed users greater parts of its much broader product footprint.Although it is hard to measure sales productivity precisely in the absence of some accepted number for the gross value of total bookings, it does look as though the company achieved a significant achievement in that metric. Sales expenses declined by $5 million year on year, constant currency license growth was 19% and the MCV number certainly reflected a decent level of bookings. Sales and marketing is still greater than the quarterly value of license revenues but the relationship between those numbers improved significantly year on year. I would be surprised if the company could not improve that relationship further based as much on higher sales as on lower absolute dollars of spend.The company was able to increase its cash generation by about 13% to $124 million for the quarter despite a significant negative change in receivable balances which cost the company $41 million in cash flow. Management has committed to insuring that DSO improvement will be a priority in coming quarters and I have no reason to believe that a company moving to a recurring revenue model will not be able to control its DSO's in a fashion consistent with maximizing cash flow. Stock based comp, at $7 million was a relatively small percentage of overall operating cash flow. The company has no significant level of capex other than acquisitions; last quarter capex dollars were just $13 million although the company did use part of its operating cash flow to fund the purchase of Daegis for $22 million.Open Text has never been the most forthcoming of companies with regards to forward guidance and that has not changed much in the current fiscal year. The company is sitting with non-GAAP operating margins at 35.6% at the end of 6 months and is suggesting that it will have operating margins of 34% for the full year. I suppose it could happen and then it is also possible that I might go on a diet composed of protein shakes and lose 50 lbs. (just look at my picture and analyze how likely that might be.) I am not sure if I ever can recollect years in which this company's highest margins were not posted in its Q4 (June quarter) and typically the current quarter is better than Q1. I might remind readers, that Q1 had just $51 million in reported license revenues and I believe that license revenues are, in the short term, the single biggest determinant of operating margins. I imagine that most analyst models will use margins congruent with company guidance despite the contortions that are going to be necessary to have 2nd half margins significantly lower than 1st half margins. If there were a single reason to be positive about Open Text shares it would be that short of some revenue disaster, the company is quite likely to enjoy significant upside earning performance relative to revised expectations for the balance of the year.Commentary about the CommentaryManagement struck a few interesting themes in the course of its conference call on February 9th that are worth reprising and elaborating upon. Company CEO Mark Barranchea has said on numerous occasions that he anticipates little organic growth from OTEX in the current environment and he said that again during the course of the conference call. But he also talked about competitive opportunities this company has vis-à-vis both Documentum and Interwoven. For all of the acquisitions this company has made over the years, its revenue mix still contains a high proportion of content management solutions and is certainly one of the leaders in the space. Its major competitors include Documentum, now part of EMC (EMC), Interwoven, now part of HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and FileNet, now part of IBM. According to most market research sources, the content management space, or what OTEX describes as EIM, is still on a decent growth trajectory. Obviously the definition of what is included in the space has lots to do with both its size and projected growth rate-but all the studies say it is growing. Mr. Barranchea talked about the market share opportunities that he foresaw against companies like HP, IBM and of course EMC. It is hard not to believe that this company will not succeed in increasing its market share as it builds out its technology stack and competes against company's whose technology is stagnating and whose sales efforts are in the midst of some disarray. So, in the context of a growing market and significant market share opportunities, I think that OTEX has significant opportunities for organic growth. How much, and how much should be relied upon in building a valuation matrix is something I really don't know and haven't the tools to figure out. But I do think that the company is going to have the opportunities to achieve some decent levels of organic growth as its market grows, as it foot print broadens and as it pulls away from competitors whose parents are underinvesting in their content management technologies.I would also like to make a comment regarding the acquisition opportunities for this company. Open Text has grown prodigiously and profitably through acquisition. There are those who will say it is nothing but a roll-up. I think the time for that debate has long since passed but the fact is that few companies in the enterprise software business have done it better than OTEX in terms of buying some flagging vendor and making both the necessary cuts and necessary investments to create lots of shareholder value. But it hasn't made a significant acquisition since it bought Actuate and there are those who might say at the current size of OTEX, Actuate, would barely qualify as significant. Management talked about its desire to make acquisitions and the company has a balance sheet with $725 million in cash-although it does have $1.6 billion of debt. It is no secret that the IPO market has been inactive lately and that VC funding has been far costlier and difficult to obtain-both factors that ought to make acquisitions easier. I would be very surprised if the company were to go many more months without finding a couple of decent sized acquisitions-not perhaps transformative but certainly of a scope as to yield noticeably visible increments to revenues and earnings.Finally, I think it would be well to comment a bit regarding the company V 16 product launch. I certainly don't have the information that I would need to evaluate all of the features and the benefits that the new launch is supposed to encompass. But it seems likely that there ought to be some product cycle induced revenue opportunities in the wake of such a sizable and comprehensive product launch that might give investors comfort in expecting that the company's second half product revenues will exceed those reported through the end of 2015.ValuationSeeking Alpha contributor Brian Nichols has commented regarding valuation in his most recent article regarding the quarter. Just for the record, and even in the wake of the company's 10% share price appreciation today, this company is still very reasonably valued particularly if some of the hidden positives that I have discussed come to fruition. The company has an EV/S of about 3.4X, although I really think that metric is lower given that it calls for extremely limited growth in revenues for the balance of the year. It has a P/E of something like 12 on what I assume will be significant EPS revisions-but again as I pointed out, the revisions are unlikely to be really closely connected to reality given the way seasonality works for this company. This company will continue to see significant growth in operating cash flows as operating income rises and some attention is paid to receivables. Capex is low and operating cash flow should handily exceed $600 mil. suggesting that the shares are selling for no more than 11X ""free"" cash flow. The company has plenty of financial leeway to fund prospective acquisitions.ConclusionOpen Text reported another strong quarter on February 9, 2015 and one that in some ways was stronger than the headlines might indicate. Not only did earnings beat by $.11 in the wake of a huge increase to 37% in non-GAAP operating margins but license revenues grew no less than 19% in constant currency and support revenues were up by 9% on that basis. Management guidance, for what it is worth, is self-evidently exceptionally conservative and short of some marked deterioration in the macro climate it ought to be handily exceeded-it would hardly be a surprise to see OTEX EPS for the year reach $4.00 or even more, and should revenue growth be part of the mix, than even that estimate could prove to be conservative.The shares, even after an almost 10% appreciation today, are down by 22% over the course of the past 12 months and they are also down marginally since the start of the year. It is my view that if the shares were cheap before as I suggested in my previous article, they are cheaper still and I think that despite the 10% share price appreciation this remains a favorable entry point for investors."
3983583,25120,2016-06-22T08:27:31-04:00,"OpenText is a serial acquirer with a great track record.The company recently announced another deal to buy assets from HP, sending shares to all-time highs.Following a great momentum run I would be cautious given the elevated valuation multiples and lack of organic growth.","OpenText (OTEX) is a Canadian provider of software which allows companies to handle their non-structured data, called enterprise information management. The company employs a roll-up strategy with regards to acquisitions. While more companies employ such a strategy, OpenText has been very successful at integrating the acquired companies. As a result, OpenText has delivered on great sales growth and margin expansion, delivering on +700% returns for its investors over the past decade.After looking at the aggregate impact of dealmaking, it seems that OpenText's roll-up really creates value. Shareholder dilution has been limited, debt is very manageable as actual GAAP revenues and margins have shown a big improvement. The company continues this strategy with another round of acquisitions, this time buying some assets from HP (NYSE:HPQ) in a $315 million deal.Looking At The Growth RecordOpenText has increased its sales by a factor of 5 times over the past decade, as revenues are approaching the $2 billion mark. The company proudly claims that cash flows have increased by a factor of 10 times over the same time frame, now coming in at little over half a billion. Growth has been driven by continued dealmaking as OpenText has bought 53 companies since its existence, creating a true roll-up machine.This spectacular growth needs to be examined, as such a roll-up strategy in potential can hide poor operational performance. While it is hard to find revenue numbers and purchase price for each individual deal, we can find some clues by looking at the annual reports.The cash flow statement of the annual report reveals a great deal of information. In 2015, OpenText acquire Actuate for $292 million while the purchase of Informative Graphics came in at $35 million. This followed the $1.08 billion purchase of GXS in 2014, accompanied by the $30 million deal of Cordys that year. Going further back in time, OpenText spent roughly $350 million on deals in 2013, $250 million in 2012, and another $250 million in 2011.These amounts overshadow the regular capital expenditures made into the business. A quick sum shows that OpenText spent $2.3 billion on deals in the period 2011-2015. This follows cumulative M&A worth $650 million in 2007-2010. This indicates that the company has spent roughly $3 billion to expand the business between 2006 and 2015.How Does It all Add Up?OpenText has grown from a revenue base of $410 million in 2006 to $1.85 billion in 2015. Operating margins have improved from roughly 10% of sales in 2006 (after backing out special charges), to more than 20% in 2015. This resulted in an earnings explosion, with earnings having risen towards $235 million last year, up from just a couple of million a decade ago. With dilution being limited to just 20% over this time frame, and OpenText operating with a manageable net debt load, it is fair to say that this has not been a low quality roll-up.As a matter or fact, shares have risen from just $6 in 2006 to current levels at $60 per share. With 122 million shares outstanding, and a $1.2 billion net debt load, OpenText nowadays has a $8.5 billion enterprise valuation. This compares to a valuation of just $500 million back in 2006. The numbers above reveal that roughly $8 billion in enterprise value has been created over the past decade, while actual M&A activity came in at just $3 billion. It is clear that management has created a lot of value in the process.More DealsOpenText reported another deal as it is the latest business to acquire assets from HP (HPQ). OpenText will acquire customer communication management assets including HP Exstream, HP Output Management, TeleForm and LiquidOffice in order to improve communication and automation processes.OpenText will pay $315 million for the assets which are expected to add $110 to $125 million in sales, for a sales multiple of 2.5-2.8 times. The $8.5 billion enterprise valuation of OpenText shows that the company itself is trading at over 4 times sales.OpenText cites growth, leading positions and a strong partner channel as reasons behind the deal, pointing towards a recurring revenue base. Not unimportant, the deal will be immediately accretive to earnings, although the accretion has not yet been quantified.The HP deal follows the purchase of Recommind at the start of June. OpenText paid $163 million for the data analytics business which is anticipated to add $70-$80 million in sales.The Pro-Forma BusinessWhile the long term performance of OpenText has been great, the company actually reported a 1.6% fall in its third quarter sales which came in at $440.5 million. Currency fluctuations had a big impact, with organic growth coming in at 1.7% in constant currency terms. Similar trends have been reported for the first nine months.Based on these trends sales come in at around $1.78 billion this year, as the HP and Recommind deal will expand the revenue base to $2.0 billion going forward. The company is posting earnings of roughly $270 million on a trailing basis, for after-tax margins of roughly 15%. A similar after-tax margin of the HP assets could add $15 million to earnings, although the actual contribution is anticipated to be very limited given the financing costs. As recent as May, OpenText raised $600 million in 2026 notes at a 5.875% rate.The pro-forma business now operates with roughly $400 million in cash and $1.58 billion in debt. This net debt load of $1.18 billion excludes very modest pension-related obligations of roughly $60 million. With EBITDA coming in at roughly $550 million, leverage ratios come in just above 2 times EBITDA. Remember that the company generates a lot of cash, allowing for a quick pace of deleveraging.Projected earnings of $270 million come in at roughly $2.25 per share. With shares trading up some 30% on a year to date basis, OpenText is certainly not cheap at 27 times earnings. That being said, GAAP earnings are seriously impacted by amortization charges relating to past dealmaking. Goodwill amortization charges alone come in at $110 million a year, suggesting that earnings could come in at around $3 per share if we exclude these costs. That translates into a much more manageable earnings multiple of 20 times.Final ThoughtsOpenText is a great business. The aggressive acquisition strategy has been achieved while the company has avoided massive dilution, and it also hasn't increased leverage to non-sustainable levels.The issue is that the growth results are very well recognized by the market. Following nearly 30% year to date return, OpenText now trades at 27 times projected earnings, while leverage is moderate at 2 times. While some sort of premium can be justified given the great expertise and track record with regards to dealmaking, some caution is also needed.I am somewhat worried that organic sales growth is pretty flat at the moment. What is particularly worrying is that the cloud service and subscription segment, which makes up 40% of total sales, is not growing at all. This comes at a time when competitors are showing very rapid growth in this area.The other concern relates to the relevancy of all the deals, as OpenText hereby acquires multiple platforms and software solutions. The lack of cohesiveness in terms of some of the offerings, make that I question the longevity of some of these solutions. This is especially the case at the IT world continues to change at a rapid pace. On the other hand, OpenText has a truly impressive and diversified customer base.While the track record with regards to operational achievements and past dealmaking absolutely has to be applauded, I am not willing to pay such a high multiple. The bull case reminds me somewhat of the great future value being created by ""platform"" companies, leaving shares vulnerable for a setback. I furthermore worry about the long term competitiveness of each of the software solutions, given OpenText's very diversified strategy in a rapidly moving world.While I could be proven very wrong with my cautious stance, and miss out on a further home-run, I'll take my chances. That said, shares have the tendency to fall at times as well. Exactly a year ago, shares traded at just $40 per share. A 20 times multiple on $2.25 in GAAP earnings, or a 15 times non-GAAP multiple (excluding amortization charges) amounts to $45 per share. At those levels, I would be inclined to pick up some shares."
3969598,98236,2016-04-29T13:24:30-04:00,"OTEX reported both top-line and EPS misses of minor magnitude, but shares actually advanced.The company achieved record cash flow and announced two accretive acquisitions.The company's organic revenue growth has been stuck in neutral for some time now.The two principal competitors of OTEX, IBM and EMC, have other more important priorities and have under-invested in this market.The company's V.16 release is the best chance for organic growth at OTEX that has been seen in the last few years.","How to manage a non-growth businessOpen Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) reported earnings earlier this week. From a 30,000-foot view, it looked as if the company had a small EPS miss of 5% compared to the prior consensus and a smaller revenue percentage miss of 2%, again compared to prior estimates. Misses are rarely good things unless there is some hidden secret which these days is primarily a business model change. But the shares finished 3% higher on the day and are now up almost 20% since I wrote my last article on this name on 2/11/16. Indeed, one analyst chose to raise his price target from $55 to $65 on the shares. Over that same time, IGV (Software Index) showed comparable appreciation, rising 19% over the period. Still the shares have handily outperformed IGV since the start of the year, rising 19% while the software index is down a couple of percent.Part of the miracle of getting shares to rise with an earnings miss has to do with the location of the miss. As it happens, the revenue shortfall centered in professional services which is not a leading indicator. Management blamed the miss in PS on shoddy execution, and I probably believe that since it reflects poorly on management execution. Not being able to initiate projects already in backlog is a bit embarrassing. That being said, most analysts, seeing that the miss was a function of professional service deliveries, most likely cut the company a hall pass.I never can know for sure what is in the minds of investors at the margins in situations like this. But what one needs to know, I think, is whether the company's shares can continue to levitate without real earnings growth - or growth in something. If there's going to be alpha left in this name, that alpha can't come from the sources that allowed shares to appreciate and headline numbers to miss.One thing to note, before exploring that question in some depth, is that OTEX provides but the sketchiest guidance. So, it is hard to determine if the company actually met or failed to meet its own growth targets. Certainly there has been no movement in estimates on the part of analysts.I think the one significant answer to the seeming conundrum is that the cash flow for the company grew by 33% to a record of $190 million for the quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $171 million. The increase in cash flow for the quarter was driven primarily by the more than 100% increase in GAAP net income for the period coupled with a more than 50% rise in deferred revenues.The growth in cash flow prior for the year to date was far less substantial. For the nine months ending 3/31, cash flow grew by just $15 million or just 4%. Since the company doesn't forecast earnings, it obviously doesn't forecast cash flow either. That being said, analyst consensus forecasts for EPS show earnings rising sequentially by about $19 million. That is probably a conservative forecast as the consensus numbers track normal seasonal patterns. Typically, in Q4s, OTEX sees a significant rise in receivables since license revenue grows due to seasonal factors. In part, however that has usually been offset by an increase in payables. So I think it is probably reasonable to assume that operating cash flow will climb to about $200 million for the quarter, which would be more than 50% growth for the prior year.If it all works out that way, OTEX will grow its operating cash flow to more than $600 million for the fiscal year that ends 6/30 and will generate free cash flow of around $540 million. That would produce a free cash flow yield of 7.3%, which is quite a bit higher than the free cash yields generated by most ""old line"" software vendors these days.This company pays a small dividend and the current yield is 1.5%. But for this company to achieve significantly greater alpha in the future, it is going to have to grow the top line, and that is what I will examine below.How to achieve top-line growth without really growingBuy it. I mean buy the growth. Some readers may not like that answer, but as it says in the GEICO ad, ""this is what we do."" Buying companies is really what OTEX does and has done for many years now. Investors are obviously not going to pay the highest valuation for growth derived inorganically. Many companies with acquisition strategies can't find the right kinds of assets to buy. But somehow, this company has managed to take what are lumps of coal and transform them, if not into silk purses, something that generates significantly greater levels of earnings and cash flow.The company announced two accretive acquisitions in its earnings press release. One acquisition was of a small company called ANX and the other was the acquisition of the ""Customer Experience"" suite from HPQ (NYSE:HP). While neither acquisition is earth shattering, they are both strategic from the point of view of fitting into other current OTEX offerings and they are both accretive instantly and will add as much as $.25 in EPS to company earnings.Open Text has a lengthy history of growth through acquisition. Whatever growth it has been able to generate the past several years has been inorganic. The company has been able to take the doggy assets of its acquisitions and wring out enough cost savings such that the new revenue stream generates average corporate margins. With average corporate margins pushing 34% these days adding $120 million to the revenue stream is going to add $40 million to the operating profit line and $32 million to net earnings. That is almost as much as the overall growth in EPS that the company achieved over the past two years.Management stated during the course of the conference call that it expects a more regular and faster pace of acquisitions going forward. It maintains that there are a number of accretive acquisitions currently being considered. Given this company's history, the strategy of growth by acquisition makes lots of sense and has not proven to be as risky as some, including this writer, might have feared a few years ago.With the company now increasing its cash generating capability significantly, it will be easier to fund future acquisitions. The company has said that it intends to deploy $3 billion over the next few years in pursuing its acquisition strategy. Based on the kinds of companies OTEX buys and its forecast business model of 34-38% operating margins, $3 billion in acquisitions will add something like $1 billion/year in revenues and $350 million in operating income and $280 million in net income. That works out to over $2/share in earnings accretion.I well recognize that many readers will be skeptical that OTEX can manufacture earnings through acquisitions or that it can do so on a consistent basis. I would point out two things. This company buys the unloved and unwanted assets of the world. Its largest acquisition recently was that of Actuate. Actuate had shopped itself for literally years without getting any takers. OTEX was the only potential suitor and bought the company for a modest valuation after the shares had dropped by 55% in the few months before the acquisition. Most other IT vendors just do not have the mindset to want to emulate such a strategy.The preponderance of enterprise IT companies would have radically different criteria in making acquisitions. That is the real reason why OTEX can actually find companies or businesses to acquire. I would not bet that it will not be able to do that. But I would bet that in terms of share price appreciation, the shares will always look undervalued until the company can demonstrate sustained organic growth. Not much growth, just a little I think will satisfy most investors.I discuss the issue of organic growth below because without organic growth, likely returns going forward will not be enough to achieve much positive alpha.I really don't like to invest in enterprise IT vendors that can't achieve organic growth. OTEX has been able to grow its top line primarily by acquisition. Any chance that it can achieve organic growth any time in the near future?The simplest answer is that OTEX will probably show some organic growth, but not by all that much. It would be a tremendous boon to valuation and perception if the company could put together two or three quarters of clean organic growth, but that really hasn't happened in more than a few years. If it's going to happen, the next few quarters are the most likely time for the company to deliver organic growth, and primarily because its Version 16 release that is now in general availability, but also because of the changed competitive landscape.The large companies that OTEX competes with are IBM (NYSE:IBM) and EMC (EMC). IBM has a business in FileNet that directly competes in the ECM space with OTEX. Since ECM is not a focus area for IBM, it has not received the resources to innovate significantly. And that really makes sense. If IBM is going to grow, it will not be because of any success or lack of success of FileNet. Being a share donor in a low-growth space like ECM is the right strategy for IBM at this point.EMC is obviously in the midst of turmoil as a result of its pending merger with Dell. At one point, Documentum was competing quite successfully with OTEX. Now, EMC has sold off its cloud assets in ECM and it has stopped innovating or investing in the space because it has other, significantly higher priorities. So, if the company is going to achieve organic growth, this is surely its window of opportunity to do so.The company has been in the process of putting together a strategy to capture market share in its heartland content management space almost since CEO Mark Barrenechea took his current job. Version 16, the latest manifestation of that vision, is now in GA, and this might be expected to be the initial quarter during which it makes a contribution to top-line growth. It was sold to some large existing customers last quarter, but this quarter ought to provide at least some evidence that the strategy is going to be successful.I would like to say that Version 16 is going to solve all of this company's problems in achieving organic growth, but I can't make any such assertion. Open Text had almost a decade ago during which content management grew apace as it was adopted as a way of solving the document retention problems that most companies now face in order to be compliant with many new laws and regulations and court cases.There are other use cases for content management that the new release is supposed to enable, but teaching sales people to sell new use cases is not the easiest of undertakings. I think the best that can be said with any degree of confidence is that the Version 16 release has been so hyped both internally and to the company's user base that there is probably some significant pent-up demand for the product.Open Text recently appointed a new President, Steve Murphy, to oversee field ops. While Murphy reports to Barrenechea his responsibility is primarily revenue attainment; in other words, sales. He claims that in his introductory tour, the feedback regarding Release 16 is clear - ""We have the best products positioned in the right market with deep customer loyalty, reflected both in the amount of follow-on sales and the growth of cloud revenues.""I'm not going to try to spend time doing a deep dive here for readers. Version 16 has brought the company an intriguing partnership with salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) in which salesforce will sell the ECM suite to its own users. That is a significant new channel for OTEX and matches what it already does for Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and (NYSE:SAP). No panacea, but another source of revenue. OTEX will be using the CRM cloud to host its V.16 cloud offering. And the enhanced release of Version 16 will support Apache Hadoop immediately, which is a way for this company to compete with IBM's Watson. I think it was well said by the CEO that ""a sledgehammer (Watson) is not needed for the majority of predictive workloads that we can see."" Over the next 15 months, this company will start competing with Watson head to head.I imagine that there is some hype regarding the capabilities of V.16. It wouldn't be the software space if that weren't the case. But it seems likely to me that V16 will engender some level of renewed growth in the ECM space although how much is hard to calibrate with the level of information that is accessible.The other growth area that has been in arrears almost since it was announced is the Open Text cloud. Without a tiresome repetition of the numbers, the OTEX cloud hasn't been achieving much growth. Part of the reason for that is that the OTEX cloud, for the most part, consists more of a managed service offering than SaaS applications. SaaS exists at OTEX, to be sure, but the focus is on managed services. The CEO said that Release 16 was going to be the solution pillar for future sales of managed services. Again, without quantification it becomes really difficult to draw specific conclusions. I think cautiously optimistic best encapsulates what I think of the probability that V.16 reignites sustainable organic growth for this company.Is the valuation at a level that upsides will be appreciated to the extent of producing significant alpha?Let's start by taking a look at valuation on an absolute basis. Certainly, as I mentioned above, the company's cash-generating capabilities have led to a free cash flow yield well above the expected range for older software vendors. The other valuation metrics aren't quite so straightforward. The company has a current enterprise value of $7.59 billion. Revenues this current fiscal year are forecast to be about $1.82 billion using the analyst consensus from 15 analysts who publish estimates. So, that is an EV/S of a bit over 4X, and that is no particular bargain for a company without organic growth. The P/E of 15.5 is reasonable, but not particularly cheap.I think the good thing here is that expectations are quite modest at the moment. Next year's growth is expected to be 6.6% although that number is likely to rise given the two recent acquisitions. EPS growth from this year's $3.60 to $3.90 also is not particularly a stretch since the acquisition alone is going to account for two-thirds of the expected increase.Analysts have a mean price target of $57.47, and the shares are now $56. There are a couple of buys and the same number of holds in terms of analyst recommendations. So, really, no one is looking for any great performance for this company, I think. Indeed, the highest price target currently listed is $65. It will be a considerable surprise to the analyst community if this company can achieve real organic growth.That is a good set-up for appreciation. Low expectations, lots of skepticism and a potential new product cycle. Like I said above, cautiously optimistic.Summing UpOTEX delivered another humdrum quarter when it reported a couple of days ago. It missed, but the miss was relatively small, and it was focused in the area of professional services, not a leading indicator of future performance. The company has announced two acquisitions that will add materially to both revenue growth and to EPS during FY 2017. The company generated record cash flow of $190 million during the quarter. Management believes that it will be able to make $3 billion of accretive acquisitions over the coming years which would have the impact of growing earnings by more than 50% from current levels. It is hard at this juncture to handicap the probability of that happening. The company does have a long and quite successful track record in terms of making smaller highly accretive acquisitions.I think the key to the performance of the shares in terms of substantial differentiated upside is going to be the potential resumption of organic growth. If it is going to happen, it is going to happen now. Competition is in disarray. The company has what it self-describes as its foremost software release ever in V.16. The product was only available the last few weeks of last quarter. This should be the quarter in which some indication of its success becomes visible.Given this company's historic track record in terms of organic growth, I'm cautiously optimistic. On the other hand, the positive alpha potential will be substantial in the wake of a successful V.16 launch."
3884626,24663,2016-02-10T17:22:37-05:00,"My 92 rating on OTEX last year has proved to be correct.Despite being much higher, and soaring after earnings, OTEX is still showcasing great upside value.There are four big reasons that OTEX is a top buy.","With yet another strong quarter, there is a good chance that Open Text Corporation (NASDAQ:OTEX) stock will have completed the transition from market laggard to undervalued, and now a top stock opportunity in just one year's time. After falling 35% in the first six months of 2015, OTEX has since rallied 30% since the end of July 2015, vs. a 15% loss for the NASDAQ during the same span. And thankfully for investors, this good performance is likely to continue.OTEX data by YChartsI first wrote about OTEX on July 30, 2015, to Tipping the Scale subscribers, identifying it as a stock that ""tipped the scale"" with a rating over 90. What made OTEX so appealing was how quickly it managed to reverse the bad fortunes that pushed its stock lower in the six months prior to my coverage.Back during that fiscal fourth quarter of 2015, Open Text, a business intelligence cloud company that offers customers products with an average return on investment of 68%, outperformed top line expectations by 800 basis points, won 26 new contracts worth more than $1 million each, and signed a deal with SAP (NYSE:SAP). In other words, Open Text was performing very well, and with it trading at just 11 times forward earnings, it scored very well on my numerical rating system.Now, fast-forward six months to Open Text's blowout fiscal second quarter and the company's revenue growth has continued to accelerate with the continuation of big, high dollar contract wins. While total revenue fell 1% year-over-year, it rose 6% in constant currency, which is far better than the double-digit declines it saw to start 2015.All things considered, there are four big reasons to be bullish long term on OTEX stock.First, it is a very profitable company. Its operating margin has quickly risen over the last year from 27% to 31% and now 37% during this most recent quarter. Last year, management guided for operating margins above 34% on a consistent basis, which it has now exceeded.Second, Open Text has a goal to spend $3 billion on acquisitions. Given that it has trailing 12-month revenue of just $1.8 billion, spending such cash should have a profound effect on both the business and the stock. And best of all, because the company is very profitable, it can fund these long-term acquisitions from operations without tapping debt markets.Third, 82% of Open Text's $465 million in last quarter revenue was recurring, but its smaller license business continues to be a bright spot. Specifically, licensing revenue accounts for the remaining 18% of Open Text's business, and its success is a direct reflection of the future performance of its recurring revenue business. That's good news since its licensing revenue rose 6.5% during this last quarter and a whopping 19% in constant currency. This suggests more bright days ahead for OTEX.Lastly, OTEX stock is still cheap. It traded at just 11 times forward earnings when I initiated coverage, but thanks to margin appreciation and much bigger profits, OTEX stock trades at just 12 times forward earnings despite being significantly higher since last July. Hence, OTEX stock trades at a huge discount to other cloud stocks, especially when you factor in its margins, licensing revenue growth, and the effect that $3 billion in acquisitions could have on Open Text's business.When you put it all together, OTEX is presenting just as good of an opportunity as it was back in July, if not better. After all, now we have three strong quarters in the book, not one. Therefore, we can conclude that Open Text's strong performance is a rule, not an exception."
4005898,98236,2016-09-13T12:07:00-04:00,"Open Text has announced that it will acquire the Enterprise Content Management division - primarily Documentum - from EMC/Dell for $1.62 billion - 2.7X revenues of 2015.The transaction will produce strong accretion for OTEX in terms of EPS and cash flow immediately and can produce additional benefits for some time to come.The acquisition removes one of the principal competitors in the commoditized ECM market which should improve pricing and the speed of decision making.It seems likely that OTEX will choose to raise some capital to avoid becoming over-levered and to retain financial flexibility.Despite the strong positive reaction, the shares have more attractive valuation metrics than they had before calculating the likely impact of the merger transaction and the potential capital raise.","Open Text and the law of unintended consequencesNo, it isn't the title of some Harry Potter tale. In fact, given how fond I usually am of obscure references, this one is almost pathetically straightforward. But that in the midst of the long and weighty observations that have been made about the implications regarding the integration of EMC and Dell, one of the less obvious expectations would have to be that the need for both cash and for focus on the part of the new Dell entity could have a massive impact on the Enterprise Content Management Space (ECM).Yesterday it was announced that Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) was acquiring the ECM division of EMC/Dell - primarily Documentum. The transaction as described below, even factoring in a likely capital raise, will lead to significant positive EPS estimate revisions by most analysts. Two banks that cover the name have already raised their ratings. I have written several articles regarding the name for SA. I have liked the name before and still believe that it offers investors significant positive alpha and as far as these things go, it is somewhat less volatile than the growthier names in the enterprise IT sector.Open Text shares have been a strong performer YTD and are up 35% over that period compared to the appreciation of the IGV of 6.5%. The shares were up 9% yesterday in the wake of the announcement and also in the wake of upgrades from two covering analysts, Dundee and BMO. (Open Text is headquartered in Waterloo, Ontario, and its shares are listed both in Toronto and on Nasdaq and it reports in USD and follows US GAAP in its earnings presentation. As a result of its Canadian headquarters, it is followed disproportionately by Canadian origin brokerages. It has adequate coverage from American brokerages as well.)In the wake of the pending merger, I think there remains significant upside. Estimates are likely to rise (my own pro-forma estimate as detailed in the article suggests that earnings accretion from this transaction, even in the wake of a potential/probable secondary, will show a jump of 13% compared to the current consensus with a further potential accretion looking out beyond the one-year run-rate of 10-15% percent.) Again, based on expectations, I think that the company's EV/S is 3.3X, adjusted for the likely capital raise. Again, on a pro-forma basis, the merger should bring an adjusted free cash flow yield on an ongoing basis to over 7%.The question of this company's organic growth - well it is on hold for the moment as it would be impossible to determine in the wake of the merger. The issue of commoditization in the ECM space is dealt with in whole or in part as a result of this merger. The company's status as a roll-up, or serial acquirer - well that's what it does although it knows how to do that and it seems to be a skill worth having.As mentioned above, I have written a couple of articles regarding the company and its outlook most recently on June 23. I liked the potential for the shares to achieve positive alpha then, and I think that the relative financial metrics have improved, even after the share price spike and even when looking at a likely capital raise. It is still a company with a significant runway with which to produce positive alpha.Some background dataIt was announced yesterday that Dell/EMC was selling its ECM division to Open Text for $1.62 billion or 2.7X EV/S based on 2015 revenues for the division of $699 million. It may not be one of the mega deals of this year in the enterprise IT space, but it will definitely have some far-flung implications for the space and for OTEX in particular.The current consensus forecast by 12 analysts had been that the company would achieve a bit over $2 billion in revenue and EPS of $4.10 for the current year. So, buying OTEX which derives 50% of its revenues from maintenance which should be rather stable, suggests that new estimates will increase by something like 25% from prior levels. The company has 122 million fully diluted shares.Its non-GAAP operating margin last year was 34% and the company generated $525 million in cash flow from operations (CFFO). The balance sheet, recently levered up by a $600 million debt offering, showed cash of about $1.3 billion and total long-term debt of $2.1 billion. The transaction is being facilitated by a $1.0 billion loan provided by the bankers, including Barclays, to support the transaction. The company indicated that it wanted to retain a conservative capital structure and might consider elements of cash on hand, new borrowings under current credit facilities and newly issued equity.What's getting boughtOf course, the main piece of the acquisition is Documentum, the leading competitor in the ECM space. But some nice adjuncts include InfoArchive which has lately been a relatively strong product that helps users to decommission legacy apps and archive inactive data, and LEAP which is a next-generation SaaS platform for ECM.One of the more important parts of this acquisition from the point of view of OTEX is the acquisition of 5,600 active customers with penetration in all of the largest pharma companies, 9 of 10 of the largest banks, 9 of 10 of the largest insurance vendors and 8 of 10 of the largest U.S. utilities. Some of these are customers that already have OTEX products; most do not.In addition, because of the global reach of EMC, Open Text will inherit operations in geos where it has never been able to offer its products due to issues of scale. How much that might be worth for OTEX is hard to estimate - but it has many products to sell in areas where they have never been offered.The overall TAM of the space according to IDC is around $11 billion which is expected to reach $17 billion by the end of the decade. Whether OTEX will see anything like that kind of growth which is an 11% CAGR is reasonably questionable given its years of being unable to eke out any organic growth. But that isn't the rationale for this merger.What's likely to be the impact?I think it is reasonable to model for some minimal revenue attrition from the results achieved by EMC in its last year of ownership of Documentum. Typically, some customers will not renew maintenance and others may not continue with projects in the wake of almost any merger.That may not happen in this case because there are so few viable alternatives in the high-end ECM space and the fact is that the major competitor remaining IBM (NYSE:IBM), simply has lacked an effective sales strategy in this space since it acquired FileNet many years ago.The big gorilla in the room is Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) SharePoint which has sucked most of the air out of the space by providing much of the functionality for a far lower cost. OTEX has managed to coexist with SharePoint for many years now and this merger will not do anything to alter that coexistence.For the last few years, the capabilities of the companies offering ECM have converged to the point that the market has been commoditized. Subtracting one vendor from the mix of three legacy vendors is going to mitigate that trend, for sure, I believe, and lead to a bit less price completion. How much less is impossible to forecast but it will most certainly not be insignificant. And a combination like this, which will give users one less alternative over which to agonize, is likely to reduce sales cycles by some noticeable amount as well.And there will almost certainly be some material cost synergies that will be effected almost immediately. Open Text has done more than a few acquisitions and it is experienced in removing costs from acquired organizations with a minimum of delay and confusion. Again, just to be conservative, I think that the acquisition will enjoy operating margins of 30% in the first year and almost certainly more than that thereafter. So, $550 million of incremental revenues, and perhaps more and $165 million of increased operating margins.OTEX borrowed money back in May for an interest cost of just less than 6%. It could, one supposes, use its cash balance and some additional lines of credit to pay for the acquisition. It probably won't. Using some cash and some debt and some equity in equal proportions is a very conservative way of forecasting the capital structure applicable to this transaction.But for the sack of simplicity, I will estimate that $550 million of the transaction will be financed by the recent debt offering and that produces an annual interest cost of $33 million. Using another $550 million of the company's cash balance will reduce interest income marginally, perhaps by $10 million. And funding the balance of the consideration, which would be an additional $500 million-plus, would take the equivalent of 8.5 million shares, using some discount to the closing price of $65/share today.The company uses a non-GAAP tax rate of 15%. So, overall, operating income would increase by $165 million, the cost of debt and the foregone income on cash balances would aggregate $43 million, yielding $122 million in additional pre-tax income and $104 million in additional after-tax income.The current consensus for EPS has been $4.10 which is $500 million. The new estimated after tax earnings would be $605 million and the new outstanding share count would be 130.5 million. That produces a new EPS estimate of $4.62 which is a ball park number I will use in calculating the approximate near-term impact on the outlook for OTEX.Over time, it is likely that the impact of the transaction will increase. It is not feasible to estimate the improvement in pricing and particularly in sales productivity, but it will almost certainly be noticeable. Again, no one can legitimately forecast the potential for cross-sell and upsell opportunities but they are certainly not inconsequential. Will the merger lead to that elusive organic growth? I do not propose to try to answer that at this time and, to an extent, it depends on factors beyond those involved with the merger itself.Obviously, looking for organic growth signs in a period during which both the product line and the sales force are being integrated makes no sense. Organic growth won't happen and shouldn't be anticipated until the impact of the consolidation is complete - likely 18 months from now. But buying one's principal competitor is the best way I know to show profitable growth.Open Text has a business model that calls for a target operating margin of 34%-38%. It achieved 34% operating margin last year. Given the accretive nature of this transaction, it would not surprise me to see the company push up against the top end of its range by the end of fiscal 2018. But then again, it could make another acquisition or three in that time span and that is a far more likely expectation than wondering how the company will deal with margins at the top end of its business model range.Could Open Text be acquired?I think it could, but it probably won't. It still has a significant license component to its business which is something distinctly unpopular with many strategic acquirers these days. The issue of organic growth also is one that would be difficult to overcome for the likes of an Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) or an SAP (NYSE:SAP). On the other hand, the company has a very strong business relationship with SAP that is responsible for more than 10% of current revenues.This company already is levered and it would remain so even if it sold some equity as I believe likely. So it would be a more difficult transaction to structure for private equity. CEO Mark Barrenechea has had more than a bit to do with the company's transformation and many private equity acquirers might be concerned about being reliant on an individual. I would bet against an acquisitionSumming UpOpen Text has announced that it will acquire the Enterprise Content Management division (primarily Documentum) of EMC for $1.6 billion. The transaction is significantly accretive and should lead to a significant increase in both EPS and cash flow estimates for the company. The shares have been strong performers this year and spiked 9% yesterday in the wake of the announcement of the transaction.I think that the benefits of buying one's principal competitor are manifold and still under-appreciated. Whether this will solve the organic growth issue remains to be seen. That being said, the benefits of this merger will be apparent immediately and are likely to keep on growing for some time into the future.The company will likely decide to raise equity to maintain its capital structure and to provide it with flexibility in the event that additional opportunities arise. My estimates take that into account and still see EPS growth of 15% compared to prior expectations immediately, with more to follow in future years.While nothing would be immune to a full bore market contraction, these shares have had less susceptibility than some to market downdrafts and that may be the case going forward. There is still plenty of runway for this company to exploit."
3771356,98236,2015-12-22T11:17:00-05:00,Open Text has set modest expectations for the current fiscal year.Analysts remain dubious regarding the company's execution capabilities and its ability to achieve organic growth.OTEX has developed a top-notch strategy focused on the cloud and well-documented value propositions.Growth and operating margin expansion create significant upside potential.,"For many years, Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) has sat on the edge of achieving an operating breakthrough. The company has printed decent numbers, but most of its growth has been inorganic and has been a function of melding acquired companies and getting them into a much more profitable business model. Because of the number and the magnitude of the acquisitions the company has made, it is somewhat difficult to show organic growth. Does that matter? It is probably one of the principal factors in restraining the company's valuation, which, at the moment, is trending toward the bottom of historical ranges.The company is one of the dominant players in a space called Enterprise Content Management, which industry consultants, such as Forrester and the Gartner Group, forecast is a 7-8% grower. The company also has a rather significant presence in cloud offerings and particularly in Big Data Analytics, one of the hottest spaces in the software industry these days - perhaps other than security, the absolute No. 1 priority for many large users. It's also a leader in Web Content Management, which is another one of those hot areas, and it is a significant player in Business Process Management and Information Exchange. If someone were trying to put together a company that ticked many of these high-growth boxes, they could do far worse than assemble the portfolio that Open Text has put together.So why hasn't the company achieved consistent strong product revenue growth? Perhaps a bit of a history lesson is in order. Once upon a time, the content management space, which is best defined as software that allows users to find and store non-structured data, primarily text but also charts and pictures and complex and non-standard data types, was considered a growth area. There were three primary vendors in the space, and two of them were snapped up by EMC (EMC) and by IBM (NYSE:IBM). Not to put too fine a point on it, but that was, at the time, the best thing that ever happened to Open Text. Neither EMC nor IBM focused required resources on the products they bought, and soon there was a huge drain of the best sales resources from the remains of the acquired competition. Open Text was able to pick off the best and the brightest salesmen from the competition and it was able to grow without the normal requirements of actually having the best products and great sales execution. Did senior management at that time take its eye off the ball? I think that was probably the case although no doubt there would be those within the company today who would not be happy with this contention.And then, the great recession struck and Open Text was able to grow because document retention and management had to be automated - the category became one of the few ""absolutely have to haves."" The litigation cancer in this country forced many companies to buy some kind of content management for compliance reasons even if there was no other real business requirement. It's impossible to measure all of that - other than it took place. I believe management coasted on having a product that was being bought and not sold and which was increasing market share because of the miscues of competitors and not because of its own virtuosity. And frankly the CEO of that era had been in the job for a long time as had some of his principal sales lieutenants, and collectively, they probably no longer had the ""fire in the belly"" that's necessary to operate a successful enterprise software company.Well, enough history. In 2012, a new CEO, Mark Barrenechea, arrived, and if you are going to invest in this company today, you believe in this man's vision and his strategy and his attention to detail. Yes, it generates quite a bit of cash, and yes, it has a relatively reasonable valuation metrics which one can find on Yahoo Finance - I do not think it's necessary for me to take up space recapitulating what is elsewhere available. But the fact is that Open Text's shares will plod along unless Barrenechea's vision and strategy is well chosen. And I think it is.One ought not to pretend that it's really possible to discern some proof points for that assertion in the numbers to date. The company is still printing EPS well below peak levels and its organic revenue growth has self-evidently been far below acceptable levels. But turning a ship around - even a relatively small ship (this company is still shy of $2 bil. in annual revenue generation) - is not something that can happen in a few quarters. And to be fair Barrenechea was sidelined with a serious illness for part of this current calendar year.I think that proving something that hasn't happened yet is going to happen is one of the more challenging undertakings in the analytical world. You can't prove that something will happen in the future because it simply hasn't happened yet. What ought to happen just because it's logical or because a strategy ticks all of the hot boxes doesn't always mean that logic will prevail. But the fact is that this company has essentially replaced all of its sales management over the past few years. In my opinion, this was a long overdue undertaking, and it has developed a suite of products that can work together to achieve what the CEO refers to as ""digitalization."" There are loads of unstructured and semi-structured data around and its quantity continues to grow exponentially. If it can be captured effectively, and understood and acted upon in a timely fashion, it is likely that it really will improve the performance of the users who adopt such a strategy.Business processes can be dramatically improved if information flow is optimized. Web content management is essential for users who want to sell things effectively on the web. Queries are something that customers obviously have to be able to do efficiently and in a timely fashion. The company bought Actuate a few months ago, and Actuate has been a company with lots of technology and very little sales prowess in the race to sell Big Data Analytics. And these days if you are going to go to market successfully, you have to have a robust suite of integrated tools that is all available in a hosted fashion, i.e. that is in the cloud. Open Text has all of the technology it needs to be great; it so far hasn't effectively capitalized on the technology to grow organic revenues at a meaningful rate and therein lies both the opportunity and the risk.It's pretty late in the game to talk about fiscal Q1 results; the company ended September which is close to three months ago now. The fact is that it was sub-par in terms of product revenue performance, and that is even after allowing for currency headwinds which were no worse than the company had forecast when it gave its fiscal 2016 targets. My own anecdotal checks have suggested that it's quite conceivable that the current quarter is going to show some bounce back from the revenue performance of Q1, but the checks are what they are, anecdotal and suggestive, and nothing anyone can take to the bank or anywhere else for that matter. But tonally, it does appear that the company has finally equipped its sales people with a message that is starting to resonate with far more large users than has recently been the case. And regardless of the current period results, it appears as though the company is starting to develop both the pipeline and the closing skills that are going to be needed to achieve growth.This company doesn't provide quarterly guidance, which makes it tougher than normal to really evaluate how it's doing relative to expectations or to internal targets. But that being said, one comment that CEO Barrenechea delivered last quarter was that even in the wake of the product revenue miss in the just reported quarter, he was confident about achieving full-year targets. That would imply some significant quickening of product revenue growth rates over this period and the balance of the fiscal year.Indeed, the company, despite the revenue miss, was able to produce a significant EPS upside and strong operating cash flow for the quarter, suggesting that some things were going very right. One could readily suggest that with better revenue performance and constant margin performance, the company would have a chance to significantly exceed current analyst EPS expectations which are a bit less than $.90 of EPS this quarter and about $3.65 of EPS for the year. Indeed looking out a few quarters, there is no particular reason for the company not to be able to exceed prior peak EPS of $5.57 with free cash flow significantly exceeding that mark, and if that happens with rising revenue growth, then the upside is surely far beyond the puny average price target of $52, which is the mean objective of analysts at this point.There are some caveats that I think must be discussed in dealing with a company with a checkered past and even present. To my mind, the most important of these is the competition from newer players in the space, most notably Box (NYSE:BOX), which is a cloud-only EIM vendor that is growing at almost 40%/year and whose shares are priced for a continuation of that kind of growth into the foreseeable future. There is no reason that OTEX can't win in head-to-head match-ups with Box; because of its product breadth, it ought to win, but so far, that has not happened at the level one would hope to see.The second caveat is the introduction of what the company calls its Blue Carbon suite of integrated EIM solutions. Blue Carbon is self-described by management as ""the most comprehensive and functional product launch"" in the history of Open Text. It would not surprise me, regardless of protestations to the contrary, if one reason for the revenue performance in Q1 had to do with anticipation on the part of both the sales force and of customers of the Blue Carbon introduction. I don't traditionally make a habit of second guessing management teams; presumably they know all the same history regarding the risks of product launches that I do. But there are inherent risks in any kind of comprehensive product launch - lateness, bugs, inability to train the sales force and much else. All of these could happen; presumably management knows the risks far more than I do and is ensuring they won't happen. Investors need to understand that this is both a risk and an opportunity. If it works, then this company ought to start growing faster organically than the EIM baseline segment growth of 7-8% I referred to earlier.A third caveat is the tax liability the company potentially faces. Like most North American companies, OTEX has adopted a variety of tax avoidance strategies. Some of those are being challenged by the IRS, and should the IRS prevail, there is a liability of perhaps as much as $500 mil. including penalties and interest. I think the odds of OTEX losing its case to that extent are low, but investors need to be aware that the liability, which is about $4/share, exists.And finally, the company does have substantial debt - it is in a net debt position of about $1 billion - which creates a slightly levered capital structure. Given the strong free cash flow generation the company enjoys, this is not a current issue, but for as long as I can recollect, Open Text has used selective acquisitions to grow, and management has been more than forthright that this is to be part of its strategy going forward. Most, if not all, of its acquisitions are made for cash. It's far easier to make cash acquisitions without a net debt position even though the company does have more than $600 million of cash on the balance sheet.Can Open Text become the alternative stallion to Box in the overall space that encompasses EIM, analytics and non-structured data types? I think it is a reasonable bet given the product families, the revamped management and the current market space. Blue Carbon is a potential wild card that could improve the company's competitive position significantly if it's brought to market in a timely fashion with appropriate execution. Based on all that I know and have heard, I like the chances of this company starting to show that its transformation is producing something far beyond the plodder of recent years, the new stallion in the space."

Moreover, the company continues to be a strong top three player in its core market, with a recent Gartner magic quadrant further solidifying this. Clearly, this remains a growth market, with most research analysts projecting CAGR figures in the mid teens over the next five years as unstructured data and content volumes continue to grow exponentially. We believe that OpenText is reasonably priced vs. peers and has plenty of upcoming catalysts to further fuel its stock upward. While we've always admired the company, it has been often priced at what we would consider a fair value range. Now is definitely an exception to this, and we believe it is a great time to take a long position, as the stock has an excellent chance to outperform technology software peers in the coming months and years. In this article, we detail key catalysts to explain our thesis and make the case for going long.Catalyst #1: Market Trends Continue to Favor OpenText VisionFor those not familiar with this technology, ECM software suites are commonly used in mid to large companies for managing and sharing unstructured data (various word documents, excels, emails, etc.). Basic functionality allows you to reserve documents for editing, and manage and classify content in a centralized server location instead of scattered on individuals hard drives. But this is just the beginning, as most suites, including OpenText, offer a variety of other necessary capabilities (e.g. setting data retention policies, managing security access requirements, and archival requirements, just to name a few). In the past decade, OpenText has made a number of acquisitions to branch out beyond its core, growing its portfolio and better positioning itself on a broader scale for what it terms ""Enterprise Information Management"", or EIM. The company now offers a number of other products which focus on process automation, content discovery (search), collaboration, analytics, and information exchange, rather than just the narrower focus of simply storing and managing documents.With the recent rapid development of Cloud computing, Mobile, and Social Media, organizations are looking for ways to fully harness the new paradigms while at the same time seamlessly integrate with their existing technology landscapes. One trend we have seen is the need for companies to rationalize their landscapes and focus on a few strategic partnerships with vendors which provide a range of capabilities around information management. Also, recently in the past two years, there is a new wave of ""digital"" transformation hitting enterprises, as major consulting firms and software vendors such as OpenText are working with clients to take the next step in really transforming businesses for a digital world. This is really an evolution of next generation capabilities, largely focused on analytics, the Internet of Things, interactive digital media, and also enabling further seamless integration between related products. As many market analysts continue to confirm, enterprise data and content is clearly a central theme as part of this transformation and expectations are for this market to continue to grow at double-digit rates.OpenText has shown strong growth in recent years, fueled both by a strong recurring business as well as acquisitions into new markets. We expect this to largely continue. It has seen a hiccup in top-line results last year mostly driven by FX impacts, but this will smooth out over time and the market should begin to reward the stock. Notably, we see there is still a significant runway in ramping up cloud services for OpenText products, as the company was a bit late to the game in really offering this service. However, its 80%+ of recurring revenues driven by license renewals and the fact that the company's core suites are deeply embedded in many Fortune 500 companies means that many of these customers will continue to upgrade to cloud services in the coming 2 years.Catalyst #2: Gartner Has Released a new Assessment Where OpenText Remains a Strong Top 3 PlayerEvery year, Gartner releases new magic quadrants for different enterprise software segments. These are widely viewed by IT decision makers and frequently used as a guide to shortlist vendors for an implementation. As expected, this year's ECM focused quadrant continues to place OpenText as a top three player. This should further help it to continue to maintain its strong base of existing customers, which are likely to use this type of information to validate their decision to stay with OpenText through the next upgrade cycle. Generally, due to near vendor lock in and the exorbitant migration project switching costs, companies are reluctant to leave a platform, but it does happen, especially in today's high paced world where features such as cloud capabilities and integration possibilities often trump the requirements around ECM functionality. However, we see the fact that analysts continue to view OpenText favorably, coupled with uncertainty in other corners of the market (e.g. EMC, more on this later), and OpenText is well positioned for a much better 2016.Catalyst #3: OpenText Yearly Enterprise World Conference To Unveil New Product Enhancements Next WeekStarting November 8th, the company will be hosting its yearly Enterprise World conference. This is the biggest event of the year for OpenText and is traditionally where product enhancements or changes are announced. The company has already announced that Blue Carbon, its next generation EIM products, would be further detailed. Beta releases are expected to follow in December, with general availability March next year. We expect this to lead to a new upgrade cycle to fuel the next wave of growth.Earlier this year, CEO Barrenechea stated about the event:In addition to the next version of Content Server Suite, we would note the company has also stated there will be new applications in the compliance area covering incident, vendor, policy and threat management. All growth areas. Also, we can expect to see details on the company's new focus on analytics and new capabilities around automated content capture.Catalyst #4: Recent Weak Results Should Improve in the Coming YearFor fiscal Q1 2016, results were just released this past week. Compared to last year, the company has not fared that well, with revenues of all major categories down single digits (licenses, cloud services, professional services, support). On the surface, this is concerning where we should be seeing growth and does highlight the competitive challenges in this industry. However, we would note that most figures were positive on a constant currency basis, and clearly results were being masked by the strength of the US dollar, which, barring any FX changes, is going to have a negative impact on results of the next two quarters as well. Recurring revenues were actually up 4% on a constant currency basis, showing at or above inflation level growth. The company continues to strive towards a 90% recurring revenue in the next 5 years. The business has also proven to be remarkably stable over time, with rising revenues and earnings consistently since 2008:In fact, revenues, EPS, and FCF have all grown at a CAGR in the 18-25% range over the last 5 years. The stock has more or less followed suit as well, rising from the single digits to the mid $40s. This is clearly market beating returns, and there is no reason to think that this cannot continue with the prospects of the market OpenText operates in, the company's leadership position in the market, and its financial flexibility to continue to make bolt-on acquisitions. Margins also have continued to improve over time, with operating margins up about 700 basis points in the last 6 or 7 years. Cloud services should continue to exhibit strong growth as well, as this business has grown from only $180M in 2013 to over $600M this year. As further upgrade cycles kick off in 2016, with new product releases coming out as part of Blue Carbon, we can expect cloud growth to remain strong.Catalyst #5: Valuation - Growth at a Reasonable PriceOn an EV/EBITDA basis, OpenText seems to be reasonably priced considering its positioning in the market and overall growth prospects of its industry. At 11.2x, we would also note this appears to still be on the cyclical lower end of the valuation scale for what the company has seen in the past 5 years, as shown in the chart below. Granted, the company looked even better back in August when it dipped down to close to 9x, but the company appears to still be attractive at these levels based on its own historical precedent.Turning to competitors, OpenText has a variety in the ultra competitive enterprise software space. In its core ECM market, it most frequently competes with the major IT players such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and EMC (NYSE:EMC). However, from a valuation standpoint, we think it is much more useful to look at other enterprise software companies that are in the small and mid cap range. Last year, Tibco, a competing enterprise vendor, was taken private for about $4B, or more than 18x EBITDA. Considering the relative similar size of the firms, as well as their similar embedded strengths and leadership positions in certain markets, we believe that OpenText would fetch a similar premium on a going private transaction making today's price seem very attractive. Looking at publicly traded comps, below is a list for comparison:Here we can see that OpenText has an EV/EBITDA valuation about 50% lower than the average of these firms and about 30% lower than the average on EV/Revenue. Of course, it should be noted that from a true competitor standpoint probably only Pegasystems and Adobe are regular competitors, but even so we can see from a collection of companies with similar business models and size characteristics that OpenText looks attractive. The one obvious negative is the company's large debt load, but we would note that its growing margins and free cash flow, coupled with its high recurring license revenue base, don't make this too much of an issue. Also, we can see that PEGA and Red Hat are probably being rewarded here for high revenue growth, but both are lagging far behind in earnings growth which is ultimately the true measure of value.Finally, on valuation, we would point out that on a cash flow basis, the shares also look attractive. Using single-digit growth rates, which are actually below most market analyst projections, we believe the shares should be worth $65, or nearly 50% above today's prices:A snapshot of our model is shown above, and the model can be viewed in its entirety here for those interested. We would point out that free cash flow is very strong and consistent; continuously in the 20-25% range of revenues, which really shows the cash generating potential of this business over time, and the stability that gives us confidence in future forecasts:Operating margins have also held in the mid teens in the past five years as well. This company is clearly one of quality and stability, two characteristics that we love when doing cash flow projections.Using standard CAPM and WACC principles, one could argue even for a more aggressive discount rate than we have used in our model, although we believe a risk premium is warranted for the relatively small size of the firm, constant risk of changing technology trends, and the historically low risk free rate. Nevertheless, consistent and durable results in the last decade lead us to be comfortable with a lower discount rate than would be used for other less profitable or more cyclical technology firms.Catalyst #6: Dell buying EMCRecently, Dell announced its purchase of EMC. This is a mega deal that must go through lots of hurdles so it is by no means a done deal yet; however, clearly, this brings an instant veil of uncertainty to the future of all the product lines in this proposed massive technology firm. While we expect the ECM product line, Documentum, not to have any immediate real impacts to its business, whenever mergers are announced IT decision makers are usually hesitant to commit to vendors. Understandably, they don't know what this will do to the product roadmap over the next 5 years, especially with deals the size of this one. We are certain there are many companies now which had shortlisted Documentum for an upgrade or migration, and they are now rethinking whether they should look at one of the other major competitors. We think this could help OpenText as well as IBM and Microsoft to pick up more share and see improved growth figures over current company estimates in 2016.RisksThe biggest risk to most enterprise software firms continues to be exponential technological innovation, which requires a non-stop R&D engine to keep churning out new releases and product suites with improved features every few years. OpenText is not immune to this constant battle. However, the fact that the company is so well entrenched in major corporations brings with it a huge margin of safety. For example, we have personal experience with one major client of OpenText, which even after deciding to do a large migration away from an older version of Content Server Suite to a competing vendor, the organization was still using OpenText (and paying license and support fees) for at least five years after it had originally intended to do so. This was because of the vast complexity and challenges of doing such migrations, which are often complicated by data privacy and data export laws when multiple countries and cloud deployments are involved. So this highlights how difficult it is for large companies to change from one vendor to another, both financially as well as technologically and legally. With recurring revenue already north of 80%, we are quite confident that management will be able to reach its goals of bringing this closer to 90% within the next five years. So knowing this and we can see that even with rapid innovations, companies are slow to adapt and the immediate risk is therefore much less than it appears to enterprise software vendors like OpenText which are so well entrenched.Another risk to be aware of in terms of short-term results, is that the enterprise technology market is very prone to ebbs and flows, where spending cycles fluctuate based on innovation budgets and the economy. This coupled with a long sales cycle with unpredictable RFP response times can mean that the company has difficulty forecasting near-term results. We believe though that in the case of OpenText, recent FX challenges have made results look worse than they are. We note that in the past year, the company beat estimates most quarters but had a large negative surprise in the March quarter. The sentiment is likely to reverse in the coming year as the company rolls out its Blue Carbon initiative and impacts from FX stabilize, but there could still be bumps in the road.The Bottom LineOpenText is a great pickup today at a reasonable price - 11x EBITDA. This company has shown strong consistent results for two decades now, growing to be a multibillion dollar enterprise software firm, and by most accounts, the most successful software company in Canada. With its top tier product suite and deep entrenchment in large corporations, expect OpenText to continue to generate copious cash flow and use this to further its growth via new product innovations and acquisitions. Some companies are not successful when they go down the acquisition route, but we would note that OpenText has a long history of doing this successfully with dozens of accretive acquisitions over the past two decades, and with a continuous track record of growing revenue and earnings along the way. With new product versions being released as part of project Blue Carbon in the coming few months, we believe now is a great time to start a long position before a new upgrade cycle begins in 2016."
3738336,50662,2015-12-07T12:53:15-05:00,"Open Text's revenue and net income was uninspiring and could be seen as disappointing.However, the currency effects and some one-time charges have skewed the bottom line.The adjusted free cash flow is actually twice as high as the net income, and the company used the proceeds to repurchase shares and to pay a dividend.That's nice, but I'd also like to see the company doing an effort to reduce its $1.5B+ long-term debt.","IntroductionI would think a lot of people have already heard about Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX), but I think very few people realize this isn't just a profitable company, it also is a company that is generating a rather substantial amount of both operating and free cash flow. Open Text is a Canadian company and is headquartered in Ontario.OTEX data by YChartsDespite this, the company's listing on the Nasdaq is very liquid with an average daily dollar volume of almost $15M, so there's no need at all to trade in the company's securities on the Toronto Stock Exchange.It doesn't look like investors should be expecting another double digit percentage growthOpen Text has a ""broken"" financial year and has already reported the results of the first quarter of financial year 2016 (which, according to the company, will be a transformative year). Unfortunately these financial results don't look great at first sight as its total revenue fell by $19.3M to $434.5M which is a 4.2% decrease. However, this doesn't mean Open Text's products are now less appealing to potential users because if one would have a look at the company's revenue in constant currency it would actually have increased to $468.1M which would be a 3.2% bump. So it's really too bad the strong US Dollar is hitting this company quite hard as it makes its top line appear to be quite weak while this is purely a forex effect.Source: SEC filingsOnce your revenues have been impacted by the stronger US dollar, there isn't really much Open Text is able to do to rectify the situation given the majority of its operating expenses are in dollars as well. Fortunately the company was able to reduce its expenses a bit, but yeah, as you can imagine the gross profit was still hit by a 4% lower gross profit. On top of that, the total operating expenses increased by $14M due to a $17.3M ""special charge"" which is related to the current restructuring program. So fortunately that won't be a recurring charge (at least it won't be in the long term). The operating income fell by in excess of 25% to $76.5M for an operating margin of 17.6% (compared to 22.7% in the same quarter last year).The net profit fell by 35% to $41.3M. Again, this might seem disappointing but a) the currency effects and b) a non-recurring restructuring charge play an important role to determine the net profit of Open Text in Q1 2016. But when you move over to the company's cash flow statements, I think you'll be in for a very nice surprise. As you can imagine, Open Text's depreciation and amortization charges are pretty high ($60.6M in the past quarter) whereas the sustaining capex is less than $18M.Source: SEC filingsBut let's not get ahead of ourselves and first have a look at OTEX's operating cash flow which was $92.7M in Q1 FY 2016. As I like to work with an operating cash flow that is excluding the changes in the company's working capital position, I usually always calculate the adjusted operating cash flow which, in this case, is $109.4M. After deducting the $17.2M in capital expenditures, the adjusted free cash flow in the first quarter of this year is $92M, and that's more than twice as much as the company's net income.But is a neutral development really a bad thing?As I really like this type of ""hidden gems"" where a company's free cash flow is (much) higher than its net income (which is usually the main thing investors are focusing on), this is a great ""bonus point"" for Open Text. The free cash flow was spent wisely on a dividend, an acquisition and a $50M debt reduction, so it's not like Open Text's management team is throwing all the nice cash away.The company also has repurchased 1.1 million of its own shares toward the end of the quarter. And due to this timing, this wasn't fully reflected in the company's per-share results just yet.And Open Text's dividend is there to stay. It has reiterated its intention to pay out 20% of the trailing 12-month operating cash flow as a dividend. That's pretty nice, but it does look like the operating cash flow includes changes in the company's working capital (which is the prudent thing to do when it comes to capital allocation) so the lower unadjusted OpCF in Q1 FY 2016 might lead to a slightly lower dividend, but there's absolutely nothing to panic about.Investment thesisI like Open Text's capex-light business model as the company's total capex (obviously excluding acquisitions) is less than 5% of its revenue and less than 30% of its depreciation rate. This leads to the fact the free cash flow is much higher than the net profit and even though this company is trading at in excess of 20 times its net profit, Open Text is still very interesting.Source: SEC filingsBased on the Q1 FCF and the willingness to reduce the share count, I'm expecting the company to end the year with 119 million outstanding shares and a free cash flow of at least $350M, leading to an FCF/share of $2.94. Based on the current share price of $49/share, the current free cash flow yield is 6% and that's actually really good. A nice catalyst could be to reduce the net debt which is costing the company approximately $70M-plus per year in interest expenses and repaying the $800M loan that is maturing in 2023 could really be a very nice (and important) boost to the company's cash flow."
3374815,24663,2015-07-30T09:46:40-04:00,"OTEX's quarter wasn't as bad as many had feared; it was actually quite strong.At just 11x forward earnings, OTEX does not reflect the valuation of other cloud companies.OTEX's sell off is overdone, and it is now prime to trade higher.","It's not often that you see a cloud service provider trading at 11x forward earnings, but that's exactly the case for the thinly covered company OpenText (NASDAQ:OTEX), who has seemingly slipped through the cracks of Wall Street. The provider of Business Intelligence cloud services and software has soared 10% in afterhours following its fiscal fourth quarter report, but I suspect that this is just the start of its run higher.After producing an average revenue growth rate of 16% over the last three years, OpenText had hit a wall with revenue starting to fall. The company has been going through a transition to move more revenue to recurring sources, to strike new partnerships, and expand its services to find new growth. The problem is that Wall Street is rarely patient when past growth companies hit a wall, and go through a brief period of distress. That's why OpenText shares have fallen 35% in 2015.Nevertheless, OpenText surprised everyone during this last quarter by beating analyst expectations by over $35 million to report $482.7 million in revenue. While that still represented a 2.3% year-over-year loss, it clearly wasn't as bad as the 10% decline that analysts had feared. Furthermore, if we exclude for currency exchange, OpenText actually grew in the quarter at a rather impressive rate.For example, Cloud Services declined 2% but were higher by 4% in constant currency. If not for currency exchange, the company's Licensing revenue would have increased 3%, its customer-support business would have gained 10%, and the 12% decline in its Professional services business would have been a loss of just 2% -- Professional Services is its smallest segment. The bottom line, OpenText would have grown 7% in constant currency.With that said, OpenText did experience a bit of turbulence in recent quarters, but it seemed to be quick, and the company looks prepared to move forward. The company closed 26 new deals worth over $1 million each during its last quarter to help boost the company's outlook for recurring revenue, which is expected to be around 85% of its total revenue next year. As a result of most of its revenue being recurrent, OpenText has very high operating margins and low costs associated with the business. Over the last four years, OpenText's operating margin has risen from 27% to 31%, and the company believes it could reach 34% next year.In other words, this is a company that's doing really well right now that has new opportunities in front of it that should help spark growth, like a partnership with SAP (NYSE:SAP) and plans to spend a whopping $3 billion on acquisitions in the coming years. Due to these combined things, I find it very hard to imagine that OpenText continues to trade at just 11x next year's earnings for much longer. As previously said, OpenText has flown under-the-radar for quite some time, most of the last five years, but personally, I am a big fan of companies that help other companies save money. Those are companies that always do well in the enterprise service space. As a result, I wouldn't expect OpenText's stock run to stop any time soon. In my opinion, it has quite a ways to go, and is now a great investment.If you're interested to learn how much upside exists, and how OpenText compares to other high rated stocks, check out Tipping the Scale.

2670565,72015,2014-11-12T13:45:17-05:00,"Open Text is a Canadian software company that has seen its stock perform well this year after making a large acquisition in January.However, the firm's competitive position does not look especially strong. This acquisition has weakened its balance sheet and the stock pays a below average dividend.In addition, earnings growth is expected to decline to a modest 11% per year moving forward, which translates into minimal upside potential based on my DRAG analysis framework.","Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) is a Canadian software company that flies under the radar of many global technology investors. However, after its acquisition of GXS in January, Open Text now employs over 8,000 people worldwide and has a market capitalization over $7 billion. The stock has performed well, gaining well over 30% during the past 12 months, but still trades at a reasonable multiple (14 times projected forward earnings). This article uses the DRAG framework to investigate Open Text to determine whether the stock will continue reaching new highs.Please click here to read my article which outlines the DRAG analysis framework in more detail.To summarize, the four variables used in a DRAG (dividend and risk adjusted growth) analysis are as follows (each company is ranked from 0 to 3 in each category): 1) How cyclical is the industry in which Open Text operates? 2) How strong is Open Text's competitive position within this industry? 3) How risky is Open Text's balance sheet? 4) What is Open Text's dividend yield and dividend growth history?The premise is that a company that operates in a non-cyclical industry with a strong competitive position and a clean balance sheet that pays an attractive dividend should trade at a higher earnings multiple than a company without these attributes, even if the lower quality company has higher projected future earnings growth. After adjusting for these variables, it becomes easier to compare companies in different sectors with different levels of future growth potential.Open Text DRAG Analysis:The best proxy for determining the volatility of Open Text shares is the iShares North American Tech-Software ETF (BATS:IGV). This exchange traded fund has a beta approximately equal to the broader market and includes Open Text shares (under 2% weight), along with heavyweight competitors such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and SalesForce.com (NYSE:CRM). Open Text's earnings have grown significantly over the past decade, from $0.20 in 2005 to $1.81 in its recently completed fiscal 2014. And while earnings have only declined one year during this time (2006), the firm's explosive growth has led to a well above average standard deviation of earnings. Although Open Text's high proportion of recurring revenue reduces the cyclical nature of its revenues somewhat, its industry is still rather economically sensitive, leading to an average score in this portion of the analysis.Compared to larger competitors such as Oracle and Intuit, Open Text does not boast overly impressive margins or efficiency ratios. The company has been improving in these areas over the last several years and its ROIC reached double digits this past year for the first time in the last decade. Although the company claims to be a leader in the Enterprise Information Management (EIM) market, its results speak to the competitive nature of this segment of the global software industry. As can be seen from the below chart, Open Text has seen impressive growth in its high margin Cloud business, mainly due to its acquisition of GXS. Further expansion in this segment could lead to improved ratios in the quarters to come and is a key driver of new revenue opportunities for Open Text:(Source: Company Investor Presentation)Although the company took on approximately $700 million in long-term debt as part of its purchase of GXS, Open Text's balance sheet is still fairly conservative. With nearly $500 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to approximately $1.3 billion in debt outstanding, the company is not heavily leveraged. One potential source of concern is the nearly $2 billion in goodwill on the firm's balance sheet, leaving it with a negative tangible asset value. Although this is not an uncommon attribute for a software company built through acquisitions, investors should recognize this fact before deciding to purchase Open Text shares. While the company most likely does not have the flexibility to finance any further large purchases without issuing additional equity, its balance sheet is not a major risk for shareholders.Open Text initiated a dividend in April of 2013 and raised it by 15% earlier this year, giving the stock a current yield of slightly more than 1%. While the payout ratio relative to earnings a higher than one would expect for a stock with such a low yield, the firm paid out only 25% of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends last year. While investors can expect the company to consistently increase this dividend moving forward, individuals focused on income generating stocks should likely look elsewhere for the time being, given the stock's below average yield.As previously mentioned, Open Text shares trade at a reasonable 14 times expected forward earnings. However, after averaging more than 21% annualized earnings growth during the previous five years, analysts anticipate that Open Text's EPS growth will decelerate to less than 12% per year during the next five. This decline in earnings growth is expected to occur despite impressive growth in the company's Cloud segment, stemming from its purchase of GXS. Unfortunately for the company's shareholders, neither its competitive position, nor its balance sheet, nor its newly created dividend deserve a premium multiple. The result is a solid software company, growing at a decent rate, trading at a sensible valuation. However, due to their recent strong performance, the DRAG framework does not believe additional upside potential exists in Open Text shares. This conclusion will likely cause me to sell at least half of my (highly profitable) Open Text position in the coming weeks and reinvest the proceeds in a stock that is viewed more favorably by this model."
1631992,42371,2013-08-13T13:12:57-04:00,,"ThesisIn today's market, it is hard to find a growth stock that hasn't already been blown up by the media, resulting in ridiculously high multiples and unjustified price advancements. But Open Text Corporation (NASDAQ:OTEX) is an exception. The company operates on strong fundamentals that consistently bring in more revenues, and there are a few drivers of growth for the future. Even better, the undercovered stock is currently trading at quite a cheap price. In this article, I aim to show you that with a solid foundation of fundamentals accompanied by growth drivers and impressive valuation, Open Text's stock could be a great purchase for many investors. I will give you a concise yet effective rundown, and you can follow it up with research of your own.Company OverviewOpen Text provides enterprise information management (NYSEMKT:EIM) solutions and software to companies across the world. Their products assist companies and individuals with a multitude of tasks and areas of work such as licensing for software and other products, e-mail management, content management, archiving, business process improvement, cloud-based file sharing, and more. The company derives its revenues from four main product types: license, cloud-based services, customer support, and other professional services. The company, headquartered in Waterloo, Canada, has 5,000 full time employees and was founded in 1991.In The Right Place At The Right TimeOpen Text is in a market that will grow at a much faster rate than the general economy in coming years. Demand for EIM services and software is always increasing as businesses are constantly growing and multitudinous tasks get in the way of letting them do whatever it is that they do best. When these problems arise, Open Text steps in and helps companies focus on their core business operations more often than they have to divert their attention to minor tasks and issues such as regulations, archiving, and more. With the undeniably high and growing demand for efficiency and effectiveness in all sectors, the predictions below, taken from the company's fourth quarter fiscal 2013 presentation, should come as no surprise to anyone.With 10% growth in line, how much of this will Open Text be able to capture? I believe it will be a significant amount. Because of the company's current position as a market leader, they will not only capture this growth, but create it. And in modern day economics, it is no coincidence that the creators and innovators are also the ones who profit. The company has made itself a leader by offering superior expertise and products that they have been able to develop through internal growth as well as acquisitions. For example, the company recently acquired ICCM Solutions, a long-time Business Process Management (BPM) partner. With this move, the company furthered its dominance in the EIM market. Through their growth, Open Text evolved from an Enterprise Content Management (ECM) company into a broader market, which is EIM, which forms its foundation on ECM. As they continually grow through internal improvements as well as acquisitions, the company will maintain its position as a leader in the market.Competition And Protection Against ItThis isn't totally Open Text's market, though. They have a number of competitors, such as International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and EMC Corporation (EMC). Let's compare these companies:As you can see, the competition poises one of Open Text's most serious risks. Not only is the competition larger, but they have more impressive margins as well. This doesn't mean that Open Text isn't an innovative leader in their industry, though. IBM and EMC are both giant corporations that are less focused on EIM than Open Text is. Even if they sell more software and services, Open Text is maintaining its position as a leader by providing high quality solutions and products to its customers. Another way that Open Text remains a competitive leader is through their global partnership program, in which the company partners with other business to enhance the value of their products along with the investment in them made by customers. For example, Open Text partners with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) by allowing the easy integration of their EIM products with many of Microsoft's desktop and server products. This integration allows customers to easily work with EIM products within Microsoft SharePoint and Microsoft Office.Partnerships such as these should be a key driver of growth and a competitive advantage as the EIM market continues to expand. By associating themselves with companies such as Microsoft, they give themselves greater exposure resulting in higher revenues as well as greater credibility. This partnership program is expanding rapidly, as it made up 41% of revenues in fiscal 2011 and 45% of revenues in fiscal 2012. With the success Open Text has achieved with this program, it is very likely that they will continue to expand their partnerships, resulting in increased earnings and revenues that will drive the stock price higher.Expansion Leads To Greater SuccessOpen Text is always trying to grow and expand their company in whatever way possible. In the coming years, cloud services should play a key role in the company's success and growth. This is a young component in Open Text's arsenal, that was just brought into play after the company acquired EasyLink in May of 2012. The company now can devote their resources to improving EasyLink and their internal ability to provide cloud-based services. Seeing that the cloud is currently rising to prominence and shaping up to be the future of data management, this is an extremely positive move for Open Text. In fiscal 2013, the company derived $174 million in revenues from cloud services. This is an impressive 12.7% of total revenues, a significant amount considering that EasyLink was just acquired last year.Investors can look for Open Text to make advancements in their cloud services. As a result, earnings will increase and once again, we are presented with another catalysts to drive the price higher.As the company expands their product offerings, they are also expanding their customer base. The customer base is already a serious strength for the company. It is thoroughly diversified, with many companies and industries being involved (as you can see below, in the graphic taken from the investor presentation).This diverse and impressive group of customers will help to drive future growth for two reasons. First of all, these companies are, for the most part, established companies that can be expected to grow with the economy in the coming years. As customers grow, they will need to manage more information, and thus demand for Open Text's products will increase. Secondly, these respected companies provide Open Text with credibility and market acceptance leading to new customers. This acquisitions of new customers has been going nicely in the recent past, and there aren't any indications that things will slow down. A few customers that Open Text has either acquired or received increased investments from in fiscal 2013 include Consol Energy (NYSE:CNX), the US Department of Education, Marvel Entertainment, and more that can be seen in the investor presentation I previously linked to. As a result of the two benefits I have addressed, you can see that Open Text's customer base has a tendency to grow exponentially.ValuationLet's compare Open Text's multiples and ratios to a few of its established pairs. Now, bear in mind that IBM and EMC are much more established companies than Open Text. The growth of the companies does not need to be factored into the price in such a big way as it does for a rapidly expanding company like Open Text.As I expected, Open Text might seem a little expensive when compared to its older peers. But take a look at the graph below, which shows IBM's historical PE ratios.IBM PE Ratio TTM data by YChartsAt one time, as you can see, it was trading for nearly 40 times earnings. And if you think that is extreme, EMC was trading far above 100 times earnings around ten years ago. Despite these high PE ratios, things worked out for both companies' stocks. And we can expect that things will work out for Open Text's as well.In order to get a better understanding, I also performed a discounted cash flow analysis, using a 9% discount rate (the company's WACC). A sensitivity chart for the results can be seen below.I highlighted two areas. The gray area is what I would consider the realistic yet pessimistic outcome, while the yellow area is the conservatively optimistic area. With the stock currently trading at $67.30, the downside ranges from a loss of 8.5% to a gain of 10%. The responsibly optimistic predictions range from a gain of 24% to a gain of 48%. Now, of course, I must justify the EBITDA multiples and revenue growth rates. I believe that the business could have a high EV/EBITDA multiple because the industry average for computer software is 9.70. With the high growth expected in the EIM market and Open Text's previously addressed advantages that will help them benefit from the growth, this multiple should not be considered too high. Revenue growth rates in my optimistic range are above analyst estimates of 10.60%. I believe that the company will achieve this growth because revenues for the last fiscal year increased almost 13%. With a young cloud-based services segment, a growing customer base, and a rapidly expanding EIM market, it won't be too surprising to see Open Text's revenue grow a bit faster. In fact, Open Text even grew its revenues by 15% in third quarter of fiscal 2013. Open Text surely has a shot at achieving that kind of growth in the coming years.With such strong catalysts to increase earnings being accompanied by an attractive valuation, it might not be a bad idea to buy a few shares in this rising industry leader.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1606502,48501,2013-08-06T05:11:42-04:00,,"OpenText (NASDAQ:OTEX) provides enterprises with Enterprise Information Management applications. Given the substantial growth rate of information, the company is well positioned to meet enterprise needs. Companies need to be able to organize the storage of information and be able to retrieve that information efficiently.The share price of OpenText peaked just below $75. Currently, the stock is trading at roughly $65.41. On a total return basis, OpenText has outperformed the S&P 500. But, more recently, the company has underperformed the benchmark index. That means there is potential for OpenText to outperform, near term.OpenText is a cyclical company that benefits from loose monetary policy conditions. Right now, the company is modestly overvalued. I would consider short selling at roughly the $69 level, which is what investors did when they sold just below $75. I will look to get long shares close to $50. OpenText is an investment grade security; investors should be more concerned with percentage of assets allocated than stop loss levels.RisksBusiness ProfileOpenText is an independent company providing a comprehensive suite of software products that assist organizations in finding, utilizing, and sharing business information from any device in ways which are intuitive, efficient and productive. Its technologies and business solutions address one of the biggest problems encountered by enterprises today, which is the explosive growth of information in terms of volume and formats. Its software allows organizations to manage the information that flows into, out of, and throughout the enterprise as part of daily operations. OpenText products incorporate social and mobile technologies and are delivered for on-premises deployment as well as through cloud and managed hosted services models to provide the flexibility and cost efficiencies demanded by the market.As OpenText continues to expand its product offerings through internal development and acquisitions, it has evolved from its heritage in pure Enterprise Content Management [ECM] into a broader and more comprehensive market category known as Enterprise Information Management [EIM], EIM, which forms its foundation on ECM, also includes a much richer set of capabilities that allow organizations to do more than simply ""manage"" content by optimizing the value of business information while reducing the costs associated with capturing, storing, and managing it. In addition to ECM, these capabilities are: Business Process Management (BPM), Customer Experience Management [CEM], Information Exchange [IX], and Discovery. In Fiscal 2013, OpenText completed its evolution from being an ECM company to an EIM company.OpenText tracks its business through four revenue streams: license, cloud services, customer support, and professional services. License revenue refers to the sale of its software product offerings, which provide information security and governance for all content and all business processes across the enterprise. The second component, cloud services revenue, refers to the sale of services arrangements. The third component is customer support revenue, whereby OpenText provides renewable, ongoing support and maintenance to customers who have purchased its products. The fourth component is revenue from professional services, which represents consulting fees it receives for providing implementation, training, and process and system integration services in relation to its product offerings.The licensing of OpenText products consists of five core solutions: Enterprise Content Management; Business Process Management; Customer Experience Management; Information Exchange and Discovery.The Enterprise Content Management solutions consist of content management, collaboration, records management, e-mail management, and archiving.The Business Process Management solutions, which interact with other enterprise applications such as those from SAP and Oracle, consists of business process management, dynamic case management, smart process applications, high volume imaging, strategic business planning and modeling, and reporting and analytic.The Customer Experience Management solutions consist of web content management, digital asset management, social media, customer communications management, portal, and mobility solutions.The Information Exchange solutions consists of capture, EDI services, fax management, managed file transfer, cloud-based sharing, and data integration.The Discovery solutions consists of content analytics, auto classification, search, semantic navigation, eDiscovery, and information access platform.The licensed products are numerous and offer a fairly comprehensive set of solutions. Also, content management will be critical for the success of enterprises as the volume and breadth of information continues to grow. Further, the integration with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) offerings is positive for the valuations of OpenText.The company lists International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), EMC Corporation (EMC), Hewlett-Packard Corporation (NYSE:HP) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) as its competitors. The extent of their competition in the market for EMI offerings is limited; I categorize OpenText as having a differentiated product.In differentiation strategies, companies attempt to establish themselves as the supplier or producers of products and services that are unique either in quality, type, or means of distribution. To be successful, their price premiums must be above their cost of distribution and the differentiation must be appealing to customers and sustainable over time. For the time being, OpenText is successfully pursuing a product differentiation strategy. Offerings from technology giants do not (to the best of my knowledge) match the features of OpenText.OpenText is using an active acquisition strategy: during the last three fiscal years, net cash used in investing activities exceeded cash provided in operating activities. Also, the company has a Director that is well compensated for providing acquisition advise to the company. So, the Director has an interest in acquiring companies that will add to OpenText's revenues, the executives are partially compensated based on revenue, and shareholders would like revenue to increase. Time will tell how the acquisitions play out.A large portion of the executive team leading OpenText are new to their positions. The company reports that they have been in their current roles for roughly one year. That is a red flag. I would prefer a more seasoned managed team; they have sufficient professional experience, but not in their current roles.The named executive officers increase their compensation by increasing shareholder value, worldwide revenues, and worldwide adjusted operating income. I consider their goals to be relatively well aligned with shareholders' interests. On the other hand, there are incentives to use inappropriate methods to boost these metrics for personal financial gain, at the expense of long-term investors.Further, under the long-term incentive compensation plan, total return outperformance relative to a peer company index is incentivized. That, to boost executive compensation through increased total returns, could have been the reason the company deciding to start paying a dividend. Or, returning capital to shareholders could be the best use of excess liquidity.What Employees SayEmployees of the company say that they would like higher wages. That breaks down into a few parts. One part is that OpenText wants to operate at the lowest possible cost while being able to attract and retain talented employees. On the other side of the coin, employees may not be putting forth the effort to earn higher wages. Or, they may not have the talents required to earn premium compensation. That said, almost everyone wants to be compensated at the wage that they perceive to be fair; said differently, who doesn't want more money?Next, some people are dissatisfied with management. A portion of that stems from their decision making; some people think management is making too many non-strategic decisions which is adversely impacting the quality of their strategic planning. Management is relatively new; so, they may be focusing on details that will allow them to execute their strategic vision. Another portion of the dissatisfaction stems from a belief that management doesn't understand what is happening in the ""trenches.""This may sound a bit harsh, but it is an honest opinion. There is some chatter about unsatisfied customers. In terms of the ""unhappy or ignored customers across all solution silos,"" I'm not sure how able this person is to accurately perceive the facts. I'll leave it at that (so it isn't too harsh). But, more than one person said the same thing. So, the company may need to pay more attention to its customers' needs.There is dissatisfaction with the integration of the products.One thing that really jumps out is when a current employee says there aren't any pros to working for the company. Further, it seems the sales reps are having trouble meeting the company's sales goals and are looking for new jobs.Overall, this sounds like the typically company. Employees want higher wages; employees are second guessing management's decisions. Some customers are dissatisfied. And, the sales force is not meeting its goals and is in the market for new jobs.Financial Performance ForecastAs previously stated, OpenText derives revenue from four categories: licensing; cloud services; customer support and professional services. The cloud services began generating revenue from OpenText in fiscal 2013. Overall, I am expecting the consolidated revenues to increase in fiscal 2014, relative to 2013; the software industry is growing.Revenues from licensing could be between $250 million and $322 million. Customer support revenues could be between $630 million and $790 million. Professional service and other revenues could be between $239 million and $302 million. Cloud services revenues could be between $170 million and $244 million; cloud services should have substantial amounts of upside with limited downside potential in fiscal 2014. Thus, on a consolidated basis, total revenues could be between $1.29 billion and $1.66 billion. Fiscal 2013 revenues were $1.36 billion.Further, on a consolidated basis, I'm expecting operating income between $155 million and $250 million with net income between $123 million and $199 million and EPS between $2.08 and $3.37.I think it is probably that the fiscal 2014 financial performance acts as a tailwind to the valuations.OpenText is both liquid and solvent. The firm does use leverage, which boosts returns to equity holders. I'm forecasting profitability to remain roughly flat.ValuationsI will use a few models to value the common equity shares of OpenText. I'll use a discount cash flow model and multiplier models. The company recently began paying a dividend; so, the dividend model may not be as accurate, longer term. That said, the estimate of value using the available inputs for the discounted cash flows is pretty accurate.Using a discounted cash flow model, I estimate the intrinsic value of the common equity shares of OpenText as $60. The current share price is $65.41. OpenText is overvalued by 9%. Discounted cash flow models are sensitive to changes in its inputs.Using the same inputs into a justified value model, I estimate that the justified price/earnings ratio is 30.66. The current price/earnings ratio is 33.6. Based on this model, OpenText is 9.6% overvalued and its intrinsic value is $58.87.Relative to its 5-year average price/earnings ratio, OpenText is 24% overvalued; that means the intrinsic value is $49.71. Using the price/book ratio, OpenText is 15% overvalued; the fair value is $55.60. Using the price/sales ratio, OpenText is 16% overvalued; the fair value is $54.94. The fair value based on the price/cash flow ratio is $67.12. The average of those fair values is $56.84. Thus, OpenText is 15% overvalued.The intrinsic value of OpenText is $58.57; OpenText is 11.7% overvalued. The lowest level that I would consider short selling shares is $68.68.The return on equity is higher than the cost of equity; consequently, OpenText is creating wealth for equity investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Portfolio123 has a powerful ranking system which allows the user to create complex formulas according to many different criteria. They also have highly useful several groups of pre-built ranking systems; I used one of them the ""Balanced4"" in this article.The ""Balanced4"" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like; EPS consistency, technical analysis, valuation, profitability ratios and dividend information, as shown in the Portfolio123's chart below.In order to find out how such a ranking formula would have performed during the last 15 years, I ran a back-test, which is available by the Portfolio123's screener. For the back-test, I took all the 7,014 stocks in the Portfolio123's database.The back-test results are shown in the chart below. For the back-test, I divided the 7,014 companies into fifty groups according to their ranking. The chart clearly shows that the average annual return has a very significant positive correlation to the ""Balanced4"" rank. The highest ranked group with the ranking score of 98-100, which is shown by the dark blue column in the chart, has given by far the best return, an average annual return of about 23%, while the average annual return of the S&P 500 index during the same period was about 2.5% (the red column at the left part of the chart). Also, the second and the third group (scored: 96-98 and 94-96) have given superior returns. This brings me to the conclusion that the ranking system is very useful.After running the ""Balanced4"" ranking system on all the tech stocks which are traded in U.S. stock exchanges and pay a dividend with a higher than 1% yield, on February 17, I discovered the ten best dividend stocks, which are shown in the tables below. In this article, I analyze the first stock of the list Open Text Corporation (NASDAQ:OTEX). I described the second stock of the list SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) in my SA article published on February 06.Source: Portfolio123Open Text CorporationAlthough OTEX's stock price has risen 82.7% since the beginning of 2013, it is still an excellent buy right now. This is compared to the 28.9% rise of the S&P 500 index and the 40.6% rise of the Nasdaq Composite Index during the same period.OpenText is the leader in Enterprise Information Management. Its products enable businesses to grow faster, lower operational costs, and reduce information governance and security risks by improving business insight, impact and process speed. Open Text Corporation was founded in 1991 and is headquartered in Waterloo, Canada.Latest Quarter ResultsOn January 23, OpenText reported its second-quarter fiscal year 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.08 and beat on revenuesFinancial Highlights for Q2 FY14In the report, Mark J. Barrenechea OpenText CEO said:Major DevelopmentOn January 23, OpenText announced that its Board of Directors has approved a two-for-one stock split of its outstanding common shares. The two-for-one stock split will be implemented by way of a stock dividend whereby shareholders will receive one common share for each common share held. OpenText's common shares are expected to begin trading on a post-stock dividend basis on the NASDAQ and on the Toronto Stock Exchange on February 19, 2014. The due bill redemption date will be February 21, 2014.On January 16, OpenText announced that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of GXS Group, Inc., a leading provider of B2B Integration Services. Total purchase price was $1.065 billion in cash and 1,297,521 OpenText common shares. OpenText used $265 million of cash on hand and obtained financing of $800 million in debt in the transaction. OpenText management highlighted that onboarding GXS onto the Open Text model will be completed by the end of F2015, faster than initially anticipated.My takeOTEX stock is not cheap, but its valuation metrics are still very good if considering its strong earnings growth prospects. According to Yahoo Finance, OTEX's next financial year forward P/E is at 14.02 and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next 5 years is at 13.65%, these give a low PEG ratio of 1.03, only CA Technologies (NASDAQ:CA) among the large software companies has a lower PEG ratio of 0.91. The PEG Ratio -- price/earnings to growth ratio -- is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth. A lower PEG means that the stock is more undervalued.I think that OpenText's decision to acquire GXS Group was a smart move. By combining OpenText's Information Exchange portfolio with GXS's cloud-based business-to-business integration services and managed services, OpenText will expand its leadership in Enterprise Information Management with the market's best products and cloud-based services. The combined cloud will now manage over 16 billion transactions per year, approximately 600,000 trading partners and 40,000 customers. I believe OTEX paid a reasonable price for a category leader (2.4x TTM revenue), and the company already cut 4% of the combined workforce on the first day of the acquisition close, leaving a total of 8,200 employees in the newly combined business.ConclusionOpenText has recorded strong revenue and EPS growth. It has good valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects. OpenText is achieving organic revenue growth in the core content management business (recently expanded to Enterprise Information Management) through new product introductions (i.e., Red Oxygen) while using the company's strong cash flow to drive accretive acquisitions. OTEX began to ship integration suites as part of Project Red Oxygen during the last quarter. Management reiterated its view that Red Oxygen is a major product cycle for the company, and it's expected to be the major growth driver during the year.All these factors lead me to the conclusion that OTEX stock still has room to go up. Furthermore, the solid dividend represents an income.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(NASDAQ:FNGN): With its subsidiaries, provides independent, technology-enabled portfolio management services, investment advice, and retirement income services to participants in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans.During the first quarter of 2013, Financial Engines' revenue increased by 29.15% to $53.9 million from $41.7 million in the same period in 2012. The company attributed the increase to its 38% year-over-year growth in revenue from professional management, which contributed $45.5 million to the company's revenue. Net income rose to $6.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, from $3.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, the first quarter of 2012. Gross margins decreased from 63.27% to 63%.Over the course of the last month, Financial Engines has recorded great gains when compared to its closest competitors. The stock returned 15.28% since May 6th, beating peers State Street Corp. (NYSE:STT) and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE:BK), which returned 11.12% and 6.03%, respectively, during the same period.Financial Engine's EPS grew by 20.68% over the last year, which is higher than competitor State Street Corp. (EPS growth over the last year at 10.61%). Additionally, at 35.0%, the company has a higher than average projected earnings growth rate over the next 5 years. The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's projected EPS growth over next 5 years stands at 12.45%, while State Street Corp.'s is 11.43%.Despite Financial Engine's solid performance, a glance at its short float in comparison to industry averages suggests that short sellers think there's more downside to the stock. The company's short float stands at 15.86%, which is equivalent to 23.86 days of average trading volume. For context, State Street Corp.'s short float is 0.78%, representing 1.14 days of trading volume, and The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's short float is 1.18%, representing 2.48 days of trading volume. A look at the company's valuation ratio versus industry average presents another drawback, as its Price / Free Cash Flow ratio is 76.43, considerably higher than The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (P/FCF ratio at 0).Back in May, Financial Engines announced that it was entering the individual retirement accounts market. As Insider Monkey notes, this will likely be quite lucrative for the company given the size and needs of the U.S.'s aging population. The Department of Health and Human Services' Administration on Aging reports that 19% of the population will be 65 and older by 2030.2. Open Text Corp. (NASDAQ:OTEX): Develops, markets, sells, licenses, and supports enterprise content management (ECM) solutions primarily in North America and Europe.Open Text reported a 15.5% year-over-year increase in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal year 2013, as revenue rose from $292.3 million to $337.7 million. Cloud services revenue totaled $44.4 million, which is a 3.9% sequential decline. Net income decreased from last year's $34.7 million, or $0.59 per share, to $24.8 million, or $0.44 per share. Meanwhile, gross margins increased from 63.61% to 64.24%.The software maker has also recorded great gains over the last month when compared to its peers. The stock returned 6.24% since May 6th and surpassed Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which returned 4.42%, and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), which returned 1.94%.Like Financial Engines, it appears that short sellers see more downside in store for Open Text's stock. The company's short float stands at 14.10%, which is equivalent to 35.32 days of average trading volume. This is significantly higher than SAP AG (short float at 0.57%, representing 4.07 days of trading volume) and Oracle Corporation (short float at 1.17%, representing 1.62 days of trading volume).Bloomberg reports that CEO Mark Barrenechea plans to continue the company's recent acquisition spree. From 2011 to 2012, the Canadian software company spent $750 million on five acquisitions, including cloud-based messaging provider EasyLink Services International Corporation. In regards to cloud services, Open Text will launch its Tempo series -the company's alternative to Dropbox and Evernote - at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.*All data sourced from Finviz.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Business relationship disclosure: Kapitall is a team of analysts.

1884131,36281,2013-12-08T09:00:00-05:00,,"These days when informed technology investors think about Waterloo Ontario, they generally associate the city with BlackBerry (BBRY), the troubled handset maker which has fallen hard and fast in recent months. However, all is not lost for Waterloo, and in fact there is a much brighter story now worth significantly more than BlackBerry. I am referring to the rising story of OpenText (NASDAQ:OTEX), a $5B company that is quickly becoming the star of Canada, at least as far as enterprise software is concerned. The company has been a long standing leader in enterprise content management (ECM) software since the early 1990s. These software suites are commonly used in mid-to-large companies for managing and sharing unstructured data (various word documents, Excels, emails, etc). Recently the company has made a number of acquisitions to grow its portfolio and better position itself on a broader scale for what it terms ""Enterprise Information Management,"" or EIM. The company now offers a number of other products which focus on process automation, content discovery, collaboration, and information exchange, rather than just the narrower focus of simply storing and managing documents.One glance at the stock chart, and casual observers may think they have missed the boat on this one, as the stock is up 50% in the past year, and also 11 out of 16 Wall Street analysts already rate the company a buy. However, the stock should have more room to run going into 2014 and I believe it will easily outperform the broader market. This is because the recent unveiling of project Red Oxygen, the company's biggest product launch in 20 years has just been announced a few weeks ago at the company's yearly flagship conference in November. This product suite should go a long way to tie together many of the recent acquisitions, clarify the roadmap of many product lines, and it should really demonstrate that OpenText has a solid vision and excellent grasp on the current technology trends in the market. I believe the product suite should set the stage for further customer expansion and a new refresh cycle at existing clients. This catalyst should further fuel the stock another 30-50% higher in 2014 and bring its valuation more in line with comparable small cap software companies.Market Trends Favor the Vision of OpenTextReaders like myself who are IT consultants or work in related fields in the enterprise software markets know very well the rapid pace at which the information revolution has been occurring the recent years. The below graph from OpenText explains very succinctly the trend:With the recent rapid development of Cloud computing, Mobile, and Social Media, organizations are looking for ways to fully harness the new paradigms while at the same time seamlessly integrate with their existing technology landscapes. The major trend that I have seen in recent years is that most of these technologies and concepts are blending more and more together. For example, you used to have distinct vendors for middleware software squarely focused on integration (e.g. Tibco (NASDAQ:TIBX) 10 years ago). However, overtime most of these vendors, including Tibco have started moving up the value chain into things like business process management (BPM) applications, and today this is often combined with case management, enterprise content management (ECM), and more recently with social and mobile capabilities. That is because all of these vendors are realizing that in practice, end users need to work as efficiently as possible with all of these technologies together in order to get the most value out of them. This also allows enterprise customers to keep increasing time to market, reach new customer markets, lower costs, and genuinely produce a positive IRR on software investment projects. What many casual observers forget or may not realize, is that most large organizations do move to adapt new technologies rather efficiently but they face increasing challenges with getting this to integrate with all of their existing legacy landscape. Often large and complex system integration projects run over budget and take longer than expected due to the difficulties in accurately predicting just how hard this can be, especially as every organization has its unique requirements and challenges to overcome. So the more of these capabilities that can be combined effectively into fewer products, the easier it often is for end users to generate real value from using them sooner.To put it simply for those readers with less hands on experience in this field, if you look at the above diagram, most large organizations now still have technologies in operation representing all of those categories - yes, even mainframes from 40 years ago! Adopting the new is much easier than getting rid of the old in many cases.Now looking at these trends more specifically related to OpenText, all target markets that the company operates in should see significant growth in the coming years. This was highlighted in a recent company investor presentation, which shows key projections from Gartner (NYSE:IT), one of the most prestigious IT analyst firms:What I really like here is that OpenText understands and gets these market trends where these technologies all need to work and in some cases blend together. They understand that for example ECM on its own may be about efficiently managing and storing high value information, but organizations will only get the full value out of this information if they have means to exchange it between systems, discover the content as needed, manage business processes needing to use this information, and allow customs to fully interact with and ""experience"" the content as needed.Major Catalyst - Enter Red OxygenSo putting the OpenText vision for EIM together, and the recently announced new Red Oxygen Suite will serve a number of key purposes for OpenText:1. Clarify the roadmap of recent acquisitions2. Bring a unified developer toolset, dubbed AppWorks which will allow development with APIs across all products in the different EIM domains.3. Bring a consistent user experience that will exist across products4. Synchronize new releases of all productsIn terms of the roll-out, the company is planning to release the first major new products in FY14 Q2, with the remaining pieces in Q3.A few interesting tidbits about the components of Red Oxygen to note that I think will position it very nicely for new customer wins:Valuation - Growth at a Reasonable Price Compared to CompetitionOpenText has a variety of competitors. In its core ECM market, it most frequently competes with the major IT players such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Besides this, there are also a few other small companies with strong ECM suites which are privately held (e.g. Hyland Software). However, from a valuation standpoint, I think it is much more useful to look at other small cap application software companies which have more similar growth characteristics and business models. The bigger companies mentioned all are involved in server platforms and other markets with different margin characteristics than enterprise software. I've chosen Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) and Tibco for this comparison, two companies with a similar profile to OpenText, and they also compete with the company in certain markets (e.g. Business Process Management, BPM).The margins of these three companies are relatively similar, with the exception of Pega which has lower overall profitability. What's most telling for me here though is the big difference in EV/EBITDA valuation, despite similar long-term revenue growth rates. OpenText has even done better at boosting its earnings and has lower debt than Tibco, which is impressive considering the recent acquisition spree that the company has undertaken. Pega has zero debt, but this makes sense for those who know the company, as from a pure organic growth standpoint, Pega is the most impressive of the bunch as it has evolved from only 1 major product suite which has taken significant share in the BPM market. A few years ago, top IT analysts, Gartner and Forrester, caught on to how complete the Pega product was, and they started consistently rating it near the top of their rankings. Whenever this happens, it is free marketing for software companies, as it typically results in them being short listed by almost every enterprise looking at technology initiatives in that space, in this example BPM. So this has naturally led to a huge growth in new customer wins for Pega.Pega has indeed been successful and still has a bright future ahead, and the market is clearly rewarding this potential with a healthy EBITDA multiple at more than 20x. I believe, however, that OpenText is now the one poised for a stronger run-up in the next few years, as its established ECM customer base and major partnership with SAP will help it to quickly springboard and gain market share in the new areas being pursued - BPM, Collaboration, Search/Discovery, etc. Taking recent developments into account coupled with the pending roll-out of Red Oxygen in 2014, I think that OpenText deserves a valuation multiple that is comparable with the other two; good for 50% upside from the current stock price.RisksProbably the biggest near-term risks for OpenText will be in its ability to execute and smoothly roll out Red Oxygen. Any delays in release dates, or a lackluster marketing response will probably disappoint the market's expectations on the Suite.In addition to execution risk, I believe there are some valuation risks to note, in the sense that the entire market is showing some signs of overvaluation. Although the stock is cheap compared to what I believe are its most similar peer companies, the entire market has run up so much in 2013 it's possible that any broad pullback due to macro uncertainty will hurt the stock prices of all of these companies. On the flip side, any improvement in the situation in Western Europe will be a big plus for Open Text. The EMEA region makes up about one third of total revenues. This has actually held up in recent results just as well or even a bit better than other regions in the world, but Europe is definitely still a clear laggard in overall uncertainty and hesitation towards big IT spending decisions.The Bottom LineOpenText is an excellent software company that is currently trading at a reasonable price. I believe that investors should never shy away from any company solely on metrics such as P/E ratios, even those with a value orientation. Price is what you pay, and value is what you get, and in the case of OpenText, you have a company that is trading very reasonably considering its solid margins and sticky business model. High recurring license and support revenues due to a large and slow moving enterprise customer base mean that OpenText has significant competitive advantages in its core markets. This protects the downside significantly, and as the company's strong vision and new Red Oxygen Suite rolls out fully in 2014, we can expect very good things out of the stock.Disclosure: I am long MSFT.

The planned shopping trip would have come after the business process management (BPM) provider pulled its IPO paperwork. At the time, however, we wondered if the would-be IPO candidate might not head to the other exit: a trade sale.Specifically, we floated the single name of Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX), which we noted had consolidated much of its core enterprise content management (ECM) market, but still appeared to be losing deals to rival vendors with more robust BPM offerings. However, we thought that valuation might make it tough to bridge the bid/ask spread between the two sides. In most of its dozen deals over the past decade, Open Text has paid somewhere in the range of 0.5-1.5 times trailing sales for its acquisitions. That’s true for its most visible purchases, including deals that saw it gobble up rival ECM firms Hummingbird in August 2006 and Vignette in May 2009, as well as add image capture software maker Captaris in September 2008.As it turns out, valuation didn’t necessarily snag Open Text’s significant acquisition to bolster its BPM credentials. The company said late last week that it will hand over $182m in cash for Metastorm. In a conference call, Open Text indicated that Metastorm was generating $70-75m in sales, implying a valuation of about 2.5x sales for the BPM provider. That’s a fair bit richer than the valuation that the Canadian consolidator has paid in the past.However, we suspect that guidance assumes a bit of revenue write-downs and (perhaps) a bit of sandbagging. The reason? Metastorm said in mid-2009 that it was above that level of revenue in 2008 and targeting $90m in 2009. In its IPO filing, Metastorm reported $60m in sales for 2007."
138695,22829,2009-05-20T08:46:58-04:00,,"by Brenon DalyIf Metastorm does re-paper an S-1, it will be a much larger company than the one that filed for an IPO last year. (The business process management (BPM) vendor put  in its paperwork in mid-May and then pulled it in mid-September.) The growth will come both organically and from acquisition, CEO Bob Farrell said Monday during a presentation at the JMP Securities Research Conference.In terms of organic growth, Farrell projected that the company would ring up about $90m in revenue this year, up from about $77m in 2008. Additionally, Farrell said he expected to add to the company’s top line with a shopping trip. We understand Metastorm has three term sheets out for possible acquisitions, with one possibly closing in the summer. One of the potential deals could double the company’s revenue. Farrell said his company has considered outside funding for a purchase, which is how it covered its 2007  acquisition of Proforma.In terms of target markets, Metastorm is looking in several areas, including risk and compliance, collaboration and document management. In terms of possible BPM-document management transactions, we would note that we recently heard of deal flow going the other way. Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX), having consolidated much of the content management market, said it may well look to buy its way into the BPM market."

2469115,72015,2014-09-03T18:01:30-04:00,"Open Text is a Canadian software company that has grown mainly through acquisitions.After a better than expected Q2 earnings release in July, the stock hit an all time high.Despite strong growth potential from its Cloud segment, Open Text shares trade at a compelling valuation using a forward P/E multiple.","Canadians are used to being disappointed by our technology companies. First it was Nortel, then more recently it was Research in Motion. But for both Canadian and global investors, Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) shares have significant growth potential, despite already posting some impressive gains.The hardest thing involved in writing an article about Open Text as an investment idea is trying to explain what the company actually does. The best description I found online is as follows:Open Text was founded in 1991 in Waterloo, Ontario (also home of BlackBerry) as a spin-off of a University of Waterloo project. It has made more than a dozen major acquisitions over the past 20 years, including its largest to date, GXS Inc. in January of this year. Its clients include a wide variety of corporations (Honda, Bell Canada, Sprint, Barrick Gold), government agencies (U.S. Air Force, Dutch Ministry of Defense) and institutions (Penn State University, University of Nebraska).As you can see from the three year chart included below, the acquisition of GXS (announced in November of last year) helped propel Open Text shares higher:The stock reached its most recent all time high after the firm's second quarter earnings blew past analyst expectations. Over the last three years, revenue has grown at approximately 16% per year while earnings have increased at a rate of nearly 20% annually. The best way to demonstrate the growth of the business is through its various sources of revenue and fortunately, Open Text itself created a chart which illustrates this effectively:While the License, Customer Support and Service segments are all expanding at a moderate clip, it is obvious that most of the firm's growth is currently occurring in its Cloud segment. The current analyst consensus puts earnings at $3.84 per share next year and $4.19 the following year. Given Open Text's long-term growth history, I would venture to guess that these estimates (especially for 2016) will be increased over time, but even at current levels, the stock trades at less than 15 times next year's project earnings.Open Text instituted a dividend in 2013 and currently yields a modest 1.2%. Due to the frequency of acquisitions over the past several years, the company's level of debt has increased to approximately $1.3 billion and I would expect it to focus on slowly paying this down before significant dividend increases occur, although free cash flow generation should accelerate once GXS has become fully integrated into the company.The investment thesis on Open Text is not particularly complicated. This is a corporation with a long history of consistent growth in an industry (enterprise information management) expected to grow at over 11% per year over the next several years according to Gartner forecasts. It trades at a price to earnings ratio similar to the market as a whole, despite a Cloud segment delivering exceptional revenue growth. Open Text is a technology company that global investors need to notice and Canadians need to learn to be proud of."
213921,23777,2010-07-11T03:03:18-04:00,,"Sell-side analysts and investors are, as they should, scouring to find the next Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).In order to help the process along, we ran our proprietary software with a few popular metrics capsulized in the table below.What is surprising from the table below is that investors had quite a few years to buy stock in Apple when it was between $50-$100 per share, for at that time the company was already showing a powerful rate of growth, and the ability to produce superior free cash flow and return on its invested capital. Over the ensuing five years, Apple has been able to reduce its risk parameters, which we measure as its cost of equity capital, and which we will delve into in additional blogs in the weeks ahead.As the table shows, for the period 1997-2009, Apple showed a compounded rate of sales growth of 11.8% per year, very similar to its growth rate in sales between 2000 and 2005.In addition to the metrics in the table, we reviewed at least 60 other fundamental metrics, from tax rate, cost of sales, and other financial stability variables, to R&D efficiency, patents, pensions and other post-retirement, purchase agreements, commitments, litigation risk, use of cash, growth in certain metrics compared to others, etc.We believe we have the most comprehensive fundamental database that exists! imagesLet me say, before I go further, that I have not found the next Apple, if indeed there is one out there. The closest company in all metrics was Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), but picking Google is no fun, besides being within 20% of fair valuation.From the initial screens, firms dropped out for many reasons, some financial, some credit, many “other,” such as pending litigation. Some firms were buying back stock, which Apple does not, and which we have long felt is a waste of shareholder cash. Share buybacks do nothing to enhance shareholder value and certainly nothing to improve return on invested capital (ROIC).With that said, what investor would be against a double, which we believe our recommendation offers.OPEN TEXT CORP.Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) develops and supports enterprise software specializing in Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solutions. It has strategic alliances with SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL). They have the second leading market share in its field at 18%, versus IBM’s 22%. ECM is essentially software that manages everything from invoices, mail spreadsheets and any other business content important to the firm. Open Text brings forth a best practices approach, combining features of the leading software vendors such as IBM’s Office, with those of Oracle, and SAP. The partner represents 10% of OTEX license revenue as their biggest partner.OTEX has a diversified global and customer base of leading industrial, government and financial firms. Sales are 53% North America, 39% Europe and 8% Asia and other.The recent fall-off in OTEX shares is creating good value for investors. Its shares, having reached $50 in May, due to a disappointing quarter from Europe and Asia, is now trading at $38. Over the past 5 years, revenues have risen by a compounded rate of 21.9% and free cash flow by 39% per year, a rate which is now obviously slowing considerably, but, whose long term growth approximates that of Apple. Recall Apple sputtered in quite a few periods itself.OTEX is seeing bigger swings in its quarterly GAAP results due, in part, to recent acquisitions making seasonality more pronounced. Such swings are being created by governmental expenditures, a large customer of recent quarters resulting from the most recent acquisitions. Even though earnings are showing greater inconsistency, free cash flows are remaining strong. In fact, the firm has stepped-up hiring in Canada, where business remains robust.With a market value of $2.1 billion, Open Text currently sells at 11.4 x free cash flow versus 16.5 xs for the S&P Industrials; 15% of its current market value is in cash which will see a significant build, ex acquisitions, over the coming years. Over the past three years its operating cash flows adjusted for balance sheet changes are roughly similar to its operating cash flows-this signals the management has not been engineering its balance sheet to raise cash, which is what one would expect with a strong, consistent producer of free cash flows like OTEX.Of equal importance is OTEX’s return on invested capital (ROIC) of 18.5% compared to its cost of equity capital of 9.1%, below that of the median S&P cost of capital of 9.2%. Cost of capital has risen of late due to greater volatility in its financial results. By comparison, EMC’s ROIC is 15.6%. The firm has shown a positive spread over its cost of capital in each year but one year since 2002, but still produced free cash flow in that year. The firm is very much a value creating entity, in good part from well-priced acquisitions. In this regard, management has stated it will be utilizing its upcoming free cash flows for acquisitions rather than buybacks. Acquisitions are small and thus have greater chance for success as integration and financial risk are reduced.OTEX has benefitted from a very low cash tax rate versus an effective rate, from large loss carryfowards (many from acquisitions) for which it is only allowed to utilize the credits over time. It has large foreign loss carryfowards. Of the total, $26 MM is domestic and $406 MM foreign. Expiration is not a concern. Its most significant tax jurisdictions are Canada, the US and Germany. Cash taxes should remain low for the coming five years, at which point the economy should hopefully bring up the most recent growth rate. In just two of its past six years, has OTEX paid greater than $7MM in taxes.Although not debt free like Apple, owing to its acquisition program, its fixed charges, including that related to pension are easily serviceable from operating cash flows, including debt reduction from free cash flows. Its discount rate related to its pension is, at 6%, is high but, as adjusted, adds little to overall liabilities. The fund is underfunded by $14.8 MM . Its annual service and interest cost is less than $1MM. OPEX has a 7 year term loan at LIBOR plus 2.5%, expiring in 2013 which they should have no trouble, given current conditions, extending. They are also employing a derivatives’ strategy as an interest rate collar having a $100MM notional value. Collection period and days payables outstanding reflect a healthy concern. OTEX uses a limited cash flow hedge for foreign currency.Given normalized 10% long-term growth, and 18x multiple, which would be conservative given its consistency measures, its weighted average and equity cost of capital, and 3% inflation, fair value is estimated to be in the low $80’s, a price which we feel should be realized within the coming three years.OTEX has risk and certain investors may not what to consider it - consult your investment professional.For additional information, see CreditTrends.comDisclosure: No positions"

After topping out at $39 in late September, the vicious market sell off took the shares to a low of $22.  That’s a 43% drop which took place in the course of just 5 weeks!  The stock has since recovered and is hovering just above the $30 level as I write.Open Text is one of the few remaining successful growth stories that is trading at a reasonable multiple.  The company has seen its growth rate decline from the 30-40% level to what will likely be 16% in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009.  But in this environment, any growth should be seen as extremely positive.The company develops content management software which helps customers keep track of the growing mountains of data.  One of the primary growth drivers for OTEX is a growing regulatory burden that requires firms to store, manage, and be able to retrieve a vast amount of information.  With a new administration taking office and relegating more power to the government, you can expect this trend to continue.During the quarter ended September, 2008, the company reported earnings of 53 cents per share which was up 28% over the same quarter last year.  Revenue growth was only 11% coming in at $182.6 million.  These metrics show that the company is able  to leverage their fixed costs and efficiently drive new revenue straight to the profit line.  With an impressive gross margin of 68%, the company appears to be operating very efficiently.Management is committed to maintaining strong profit margins which is why the company will cut their headcount by 10%.  This move is to take place after a new acquisition is completed and will eliminate redundant positions within the company.  As a result of this move, the company has taken a restructuring charge of $20 million, but with that charge behind us, it should be smooth sailing for the next quarterly report.OTEX reports earnings next week (January 28) and investors will be listening carefully to management’s perspective on the current market.  The customer base is certainly diversified by geography and by industry, but this may not be enough since the economic slowdown is so broad.  Still, a healthy balance sheet with plenty of cash should help to buffer any industry weakness.  The company is also in the middle of a large share repurchase program which could help the “per share” numbers look a little better.Given the low multiple on the stock, the strong balance sheet, and management’s commitment to profitable growth, I would expect the stock to trade higher over the next few months.  In order to see profits, we will need the broader market to show some resiliency.  But with all the stimulus capital being put to work, I believe the overall environment will take a turn for the better in the remainder of this quarter.  Please use caution with this name as it has a volatile pattern.  But if timed correctly, it could yield superior returns.OTEX Notes Disclosure: Author does not have a position in OTEX."
176661,20504,2009-12-05T00:09:52-05:00,,"Thursday we had some BUY signals on a number of tech stocks. Among them was Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX). Looking at daily data, the stock has been surging, bouncing off its 200-day moving average and moving above its 50-day moving average. Bursting above a short-term down-trend earned the stock a place on the Trend Busters list.  Let's pull back a bit and take a longer-term perspective. The following is the weekly chart and a nice, steady up-trend appears to be solidly in place. Open Text Corporation develops and sells Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solutions primarily in North America and Europe. Its products enable corporations to manage traditional forms of content, such as images, office documents, graphics, and drawings, as well as to manage electronic content, including Web pages, email, and video. They facilitate document management, collaboration, social media, Web content management, digital asset management, records management, email management, archiving, capture and delivery, business process management and content reporting.Open Text has over 46,000 corporate customers servicing 50mm users in 114 countries.Open Text is a $2.2B company. The PEG of less than one indicates the stock is not currently expensive. On the other hand, ratios like Price-to-Sales and Price-to-Book are not quite in the range expected for a value stock. But as a growth stock those ratios are not so important.What is important is a measure of growth. Here, things are split. Quarterly revenue growth is strong at 15.8% year-over-year. Quarterly earnings growth, however, has been somewhat erratic and was hurt by bad results in the most recent quarter. The following tables show how revenue has been steady but earnings occasionally take a dip.After a bad quarter the trailing PE is a high 48 but the forward PE is a quite reasonable 12. In other words, growth expectations are strong.The company just garnered a recommendation from Canaccord Adams. The target price was upped from $38 to $48. A Canaccord analyst says they ""expect a sequential pick-up in demand"" and that ""more material improvements in spend are projected for the first calendar quarter of 2010 based on our checks with industry participants. We believe that consulting utilization rates have begun to quickly improve in recent weeks because enterprise accounts are aggressively planning new projects that were deferred over the past 12-18 months."" In other words, growth is on the way.Furthermore, Canaccord has raised expectations that new product lines involved in the management of mobile and social media channels will begin to make more significant contribution to earnings now.I've written before how the enterprise software sector is less volatile than many other tech sectors yet delivers solid growth. Open Text fits well into this concept, as the weekly chart above shows. The Canaccord analysis seems reasonable enough. My own feeling is that Open Text is well positioned for an era where more companies are generating more and more documents that need management and collaboration across time zones and continents is becoming more and more common. As a leading company in document and content management, Open Text should be able to surf a rising tide in a growing niche.Disclosure: no positions"

And now that Open Text has completed the integration of Hummingbird, investors are focusing on fiscal 2008.

Tech Trader Bill Alpert can't figure out why: 1) Post acquisition, Hummingbird sales are down 20%. 2) Combined licence revenues, admittedly unpredictable, are down 22%; the company recently said they 'hope' license revenues will trend up later this year. 3) A former Hummingbird salesman has testified he was fired for refusing to cooperate with a scheme to inflate revenues. 4) Pre-acquisition, Hummingbird took reserves amounting to 23% of its gross receivables -- a huge percentage that has no precedent in company history; the reserves have since vanished. Inflated pre-merger charges can spring-load the acquiring company's post-merger numbers. The company already carries $33 million in restructuring reserves from eight previous acquisitions, raising suspicions the company may have artificially inflated acquisition charges in order to absorb post-acquisition operating expenses.

26668,20491,2007-02-12T03:59:38-05:00,,"Shares of Open Text Corp. (NASDAQ:OTEX) jumped to their highest level in more than two years on Friday morning, following the company’s second quarter earnings that came in ahead of consensus estimates. The Waterloo, Ont.-based business software maker’s stock has recovered well following a huge sell-off last spring, when the company’s weak results and forecast wiped off as much as 20% of their value in one day. This past quarter marked the first that included numbers from rival Hummingbird Ltd., which Open Text paid roughly US$489-million for in a deal that closed in October. Clarus Securities analyst Blair Abernethy said in a research note that the integration of Hummingbird appears to be on track, while the speed and extent of Open Text’s cost-cutting drove earnings per share well above his expectations. He raised his price target on Open Text shares to US$24 from US$23 and upgraded his recommendation to “buy” from “accumulate.” Meanwhile, Merrill Lynch analyst Edward Maguire reiterated his “sell” rating on Open Text shares, citing a lack of detailed information on the company’s specific operational segments, including Hummingbird’s connectivity business. Open Text’s cost-cutting measures appear to be working and the prospect of private equity interest could serve to limit the downside for Open Text shares, he said in a research note. However, Mr. Maguire recommends selling the stock until its combination with Hummingbird shows further signs of succeeding. OTEX 1-yr chart:"

The Canadian software company first disclosed the ""review"" in 2006, saying that the SEC staff had unresolved issues tied to accounting for acquisition-related costs. Such matters tend to be come under the thumb of the agency's corporate finance department.
That leaves the question, as I've written for several years: Is the enforcement division still nosing around? In 2005 I noted that the enforcement division called wanting a copy of a story I had written in 2002, while I was at TheStreet.com, that raised questions about revenue recognition. When I asked the company whether it had been contacted the by SEC about revenue recognition or ""other issues,"" it responded that it hadn't been contacted about revenue recognition. In a follow up, I asked: ""What about other issues?"" There was no response.

(NASDAQ:OTEX) fall 15% since he initiated coverage on the company in mid May, Blackmont analyst Lawrence Rhee told clients he now thinks the enterprise content management [ECM] provider is set for a rally. He raised his rating on the stock from ""hold"" to ""buy"" and left unchanged his US$25.50 price target, which represents upside of roughly 29% on the current share value. ""The market growth projections as well as the recent quarterly results reported by Open Text comparables should provide increased confidence that Open Text's upcoming fiscal 2007 fourth quarter results should also exhibit good growth,"" Mr. Rhee said in a research note. He elaborated, noting that Open Text competitor, Interwoven Inc. (IWOV), recently reported 11% year-over-year growth in total revenue at the same time bellwether software companies SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) and IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) were also reporting healthy growth figures. Mr. Rhee added that industry research firm Gartner has forecast the ECM market will grow 12.9% per year until 2010, from approximately US$2.9-billion to US$4.2 billion. That said, the analyst's bullishness going forward is tempered somewhat by Open Text's lack of disclosure regarding Hummingbird's contribution to the company since it was acquired last year, as well as management's decision not to provide guidance over the past three quarters. ""Lack of disclosure provides uncertainty about the growth profile for the Hummingbird business and the historical Open Text business."" OTEX 1-year chart"
16868,20308,2006-09-14T06:04:56-04:00,,"Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX), the Canadian software company, let it slip in its 10-K that it's under ""review"" by the SEC and apparently has been for some time.
Interesting, especially in light of what I wrote on March 3, 2005, when I suggested the company might be under SEC probe. As I wrote at the time: ""Regulators are clearly asking questions. I know because two officials of the SEC called Wednesday wanting a copy of a story I wrote in 2002 when I worked for TheStreet.com.""At the time, I  sent the company an email asking whether it had received inquiries from the SEC regarding ""revenue recognition or other issues.""
The company's response at the time, via email: ""We have had no requests from the SEC about revenue recognition.""
""What about other issues?"" I responded almost immediately via an e-mail. ""Is there any reason to believe the SEC is conducting a probe, informal or formal, of your company?""
The company never responded.
News flash -- this just in: Buried in the company's 10-K, under ""unresolved staff comments,"" Open Text discloses that
""Review,"" of course, could be another name for investigation. (The company has never before disclosed any SEC-related issues; companies are now required to disclosed ""unresolved staff comments."") No wonder the company never responded to my email about ""other issues."" The company, an active acquirer, has has a history of using the bare minimum requirement of SEC filings, not press releases, to disclose bad news. 
A month or two ago, for example, it waited until late on a Friday to issue an amended 8-K that said after its previously trumped-up acquisition of IXOS several years earlier revealed ""accounting irregularities"" related to revenue recognition and cost capitalization. Open Text wound up restating a few years of the acquired company's results.
Fresh from that botched deal, Open Text is now trying to buy (with debt, no less) Hummingbird. Meanwhile, it's trying to get those accounting-acquisition issues resolved. The big question: Which will come first?  
Update: When all else fails, talk takeover: That's what at least one bullish Open Text (OTEX) analyst is doing in the wake of the company's disclosure that it has unresolved comment issues with the SEC regarding acquisition accounting. Briefing.com notes that:
To which I say: Ain't no way this company, with unresolved acquisition accounting issues and a history of buying companies (like Ixos) with accounting issues, will be bought. (At least not without a thorough forensic scrubbing, the kind Open Text will have to agree to endure.)

20091,20099,2006-11-07T18:28:26-05:00,,"Open Text (NASDAQ:OTEX) reported what some people will call slightly better results and made much of its continuing integration of Hummingbird. Management claims to be happy. So why was there no comment from management about its absolute and relative drop in R&D spending? The drop was not insignificant: from $15.7 million during 1Q05 down to $14.2 million during 3Q06 and from 17% of revenues last year to 14% this quarter. In the latest conference call, management and big shot sell side analysts spent all their time talking about the integration. The Hummingbird acquisition is expected to be accretive in 2008, not earlier. Some analysts came close to talking about market share growth and what it will take for the company to grow faster than the market. R&D was not covered. Open Text is now the largest independent enterprise content management [ECM] vendor and is positioning itself as the Switzerland of that world. They appear to be bulking up with market share to make themselves look acquisition attractive, leaving the costly innovation to whoever will be buying them. The stock is trading near its 52 week high. If a takeover does not come soon, the company will have a successful integration with obsolete products. OTEX 1-yr chart:"

A handful of analysts who cover the stock hiked their price targets, including Blackmont Capital’s Lawrence Rhee, who expects the shares will rise to US$28, up from US$25.50 previously.
Mr. Rhee also noted that investors and analysts will likely be pleased by Open Text’s decision to provide some guidance, after being criticized for not doing so in the past.
Justin Kew at Versant Partners, who also has a “buy” on the stock, hiked his price target by US$1.50 to US$28. He recommended that clients be aggressive buyers at current levels.
Mike Abramsky at RBC Capital Markets reiterated his “outperform” rating and US$28 price target.
Steven Li at Raymond James also has an “outperform” rating on Open Text and raised his target by C$3 to C$31. Given that the company’s accounting concerns are fading and prospects for organic growth are looking up, he thinks the shares should rebound.
Finally, Peter Misek at Canaccord Adams warns that although the quarter exceeded expectations, his concerns have not disappeared. He thinks cash flow from operations fell short of the Street’s expectations, while distractions from the merger with Hummingbird Ltd. may have reduced the number of deals in the second and third quarters, thus providing a boost to this past quarter.
He maintained his “hold” recommendation and placed his target price (previously US$18) under review."

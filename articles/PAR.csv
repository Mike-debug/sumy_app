We didn't sell the shares despite this being a restaurant technology supplier, and restaurants are one of the worst affected sectors by the COVID-19 pandemic.However, we didn't buy into the short thesis that their customers weren't going to pay as these are large, well-capitalized chains for which this kind of software platform is pretty essential, but it was difficult to assess the level of impact. We did expect to see an impact. For instance:That is, we didn't expect a disaster but definitely a negative impact. But the stock was already down considerably, so we decided to simply stick it out. But not in our wildest dreams, could we have imagined this:And it turns out even we were too pessimistic as:However, the impact of the pandemic on the prospects of Brink isn't nearly as bad as many investors seem to have feared:Some of these are self-explanatory, but we will now substantiate some of these below.The company's customers are mostly large QSR (quick service restaurant) and fast casual (for the difference, see here) chains. These are well-capitalized with government help and little prospects of going out of business and tend to do better in economic downturns.A whopping 85% managed to stay open during the lockdown (through drive-thru, delivery, counter service), even though customer same store sales have been down 40%.These chains have gotten better at dealing with the pandemic and the effects of which are starting to wane (Q1CC):POS software is essential for such chains. This is perhaps even more so under the present circumstances when the system has links to mobile apps, order platforms and drive-thru, from the Q1CC:Brink is very flexible. It has just introduced Brink Pay, and acquired Restaurant Magic and Drive-Thru late last year. It also has an ecosystem of third party solutions which seamlessly integrate with Brink.Although revenues are suffering from the lack of table business, the take-up of Brink Pay by existing customers has been better than management expected.So, the longer-term prospects here are good. This is the part where the competitors making most money from, so it's a very useful addition.Speaking about competitors, Toast and Lightspeed are having considerable problems as both are much more dependent on table service in smaller chains as well as payment services, both of which have taken a bigger hit.Toast was valued at almost $5B in their recent $400M funding, and Lightspeed, which is trading in Canada under the ticker LSPD.TO, is also having plenty of cash left ($200M+), so they're not going away anytime soon, but they're much more impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here is analyst Adam Wyden from ADW Capital Management (Q1CC):Management has become ""very excited"" that the competition has become ""more rational."" That is, they're much less aggressive on pricing and expansion, one even fired its whole enterprise sales team, for instance.The company is also helping its customers make through the barren times (Q1CC):As noted above, the company's hardware business had a good quarter (up 20% to $18.6M), although this is due to the addition of Drive-Thru hardware sales. Although customers are in the middle of the Windows 7 upgrade cycle, but their hardware will nevertheless struggle in Q2 as regulations keep installers out of premises (Q1CC):Brink runs on any Windows device, so it's not always necessary for employees to be on-premise to do the installation, although this would be one without PAR selling the hardware (Brink has been a significant catalyst for hardware sales).Here is the development of the most important metrics for Brink the last number of quarters:The Q1 booking figures were somewhat disappointing, but given the circumstances, hardly surprising. Installations accelerated, but Q2 will pour some cold water over that.The backlog for Brink is now 1,180 sites. Brink ARR (annual recurring revenue) was $22.2M at the end of Q1, up $6.6M or 42% y/y. Recurring software revenue for Brink in Q1 was $5.2M, up 40% from a year ago.Of course, they bought Restaurant Magic in December last year, and this went pretty well, with 596 bookings and 507 store activations. Restaurant Magic ARR was $8.6M at the end of Q1 (+28% y/y). Then (Q1CC):So, there is cross-selling already in the first quarter they own Restaurant Magic, which is encouraging.Their government business grew 15% to $16.6M ($8.1M for ISR and $8.5M for Mission Systems and $0.1M for product sales so the growth is coming from ISR).Their core retail business (hardware and services) was $19.9M, up from $18.7M a year ago, although this included $3.5M for Drive-Thru which wasn't there last year. Hardware sales related to Brink were $6.7M, up 49% for the year. Overall hardware sales were $18.6M.The company's GAAP results were pretty ugly ($10.9M net loss or $0.61 per share), however (Q1CC):The company didn't provide guidance and when asked during the CC management answered (Q1CC):This isn't a surprise. Lockdowns only occurred in the second week of March, so it didn't have a large effect on Q1 figures, but the impact on Q2 will be significant.We are getting a little worried how fast the company is reducing its cash balance, which declined from roughly $77M early February after the new financing, to $60M at the end of Q1. Cash used in operations was $15.7M and another $2M used in CapEx.There were a few notable factors though, like $4M precautionary inventory building. They are embarking on a cost cutting program that is targeting to reduce cost by $10M annually, which would help to preserve cash.Data by YChartsWhat matters more perhaps is the valuation of Brink. With the government business and the hardware business each at $100M, this leaves $160M for Brink and Restaurant Magic, which have a combined ARR of $30M, but will approach $40M by the end of the year, so that's 4x ARR while competitors are trading at much higher multiples.We think a case can be made for assuming that the company will emerge stronger from the crisis, as competitors are much more dependent on table service and payments, with weaker customers. Brink is also much cheaper valued than their POS SaaS solutions, something we've noticed in previous articles.However, investors should basically forget the short term. The main risk is that the COVID-induced short-term turns out to be much longer than investors hope/expect, and quite frankly, we're a little worried how fast they are burning that cash from the convertible.If COVID turns out to be a protracted headwind putting the US economy in a prolonged slump with restaurants operating well below capacity, while not lethal, this considerably dents the outlook for the shares.Existing clients will still mostly pay, but some might start to struggle at some point, and new installations and the expected payments boom will be dimmed.While we stress Brink is cheap compared to the competition and actually better placed in this environment, we would like to know Q2's cash outflow before getting too comfortable here.Also, keep in mind that our base scenario is that COVID isn't going away anytime soon and will keep depressing consumer spending and could well lead to new periods of lockdown (or voluntary social distancing). Others might be more optimistic on this front."
4304917,105080,2019-11-09T15:24:10-05:00,"Over the course of the quarter, we significantly increased our investment in PAR as I believe that the actions of management today will pay significant dividends in the future.If PAR can buy a small SAAS offering such as inventory management or labor management, integrate the offering, and then sell into their growing customer base, the combination of organic growth and acquisitions could yield very high growth rates for the next several years.There are well-funded competitors, the board may have a different vision, and building a business is difficult, but if Savneet is successful, we are not playing for just +15%.","The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter.PAR Technology (NYSE:PAR) - Over the course of the quarter, we significantly increased our investment in PAR as I believe that the actions of management today will pay significant dividends in the future. In the case of PAR, seeking progress from the GAAP financials is a futile effort. The asset we want to own is the restaurant POS (point of sale) system, Brink, that remains buried under a defense contracting business and a hardware business that are currently far bigger.Here is what we know: the new CEO, Savneet Singh, has only been on the job since the beginning of the year and has only had resources since April when PAR raised money through convertible debt. Hiring well and spending well takes time. Savneet has focused the company and laid the foundation for growth by investing resources in stabilizing the product, building a payments offering, announcing the exit of a small ancillary software business (SureCheck), and articulating that the defense and restaurant businesses should be separated (timing uncertain). He has also taken actions to improve the profitability of the hardware business through both staff reduction and growth, most recently paying less than 2X cash flow for a drive-through related asset that fits well with the existing portfolio of restaurant solutions. This acquisition provides more stability to the hardware business and makes it larger, which makes the hardware business easier to separate. While new installations for Brink software were uninspiring last quarter and are likely to be uninspiring this quarter, these results are consistent with a desire to fix the product and please their customers in the long term. The decision to slow growth and build a more solid foundation is exactly the type of decision I want our jockeys to make: some short-term pain for longer term benefit. Several large chains, including Panda Express, are in pilot with Brink. Coupled with announced wins like Dairy Queen, a path to doubling the installed base of Brink over the next 12-15 months remains intact.Where is this all headed? Before becoming CEO of PAR, Savneet was trying to buy private software companies and build a ""Berkshire of Software."" He ended up putting aside that project and joining PAR. While he was trying to acquire software companies for himself, he wrote an article, ""Building the Berkshire Hathaway of Software"" (LINK), where he laid out his thinking:It strikes me that an enterprise-wide POS system is exactly the type of mission-critical business Savneet was referring to.Because the POS system is central to every transaction in a restaurant, it interfaces with more than a dozen other operational functions a restaurant operator must navigate such as inventory management, staffing, and loyalty tracking. PAR has the opportunity to buy, build, and partner in several of these adjacent functionalities and capture a portion of the economics. This quarter, the company is launching a payments module, which has been a larger source of profits for competitors than their software offerings. The acquisition opportunity would appear robust as well. If PAR can buy a small SAAS offering such as inventory management or labor management, integrate the offering, and then sell into their growing customer base, the combination of organic growth and acquisitions could yield very high growth rates for the next several years.Putting the pieces together, PAR has a rapidly expanding customer base that can be monetized at significantly higher rates. The sale of the defense business can provide the ""war chest."" There are well-funded competitors, the board may have a different vision, and building a business is difficult, but if Savneet is successful, we are not playing for just +15%.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4334285,21815,2020-03-26T02:18:15-04:00,"The shares of Par Technology crashed from $34 to below $10 in short order on the worsening pandemic shutting down much of its customers.However, there is some compensation from Drive Thru and delivery, and a case can be made that restaurants now need a sophisticated POS system more than ever.The company was also fortunate getting $115M at the top of the market, so there are no immediate cash worries.","Par Technology (PAR), as a market-leading provider for POS SaaS software (""Brink"") to the restaurant sector, has of course been affected by the outbreak of the coronavirus as customers are staying away from restaurants and many are closed.Fears about the impact of the coronavirus and associated lockdowns revert to:The latest figures we have been able to find are that restaurant transactions are down 8% from last year, but this was for the week up to March 15, in any case, more relevant for Brink (Fastcasual):Things on the ground move with amazing speed and the results for week up to March 22 are surely much worse. Basically, much of the industry is coming to a sudden halt.However, it remains to be seen to what extent this will impact the company:Management argues that to date (March 12) it hasn't experienced any impact (Q4CC):The change in its plans refers to upcoming deployments which have already been contracted (backlog).However, a week can be a long time under the present circumstances. With most of its customers on greatly reduced cash flow and uncertain outlook, this isn't going to be business as usual for quite some time.Management argued that more upmarket table service restaurants are likely to suffer more, like during the financial crisis. While that is likely, the fast-casual restaurants which make up the bulk of its clientele aren't exactly immune, so we're not too optimistic about the immediate prospects for most of the customers.The company also sees an increased need for its suite of solutions (Q4CC):While that makes a lot of sense, and the ROI on Brink is perhaps better than ever as a result (and recent additions of functionality, see below), it remains to be seen how cash-strapped clients will pay for that. ADW analyst Adam Weyden suggested on the CC that management might have to throw in big discounts or even free hardware, which is an idea to consider.Customers can ask for relief on the Par website update, and if it has closed restaurants the company automatically stops billing. Its blog has regular updates.There is even a map on its site which shows the different level of restrictions for restaurants in each state:The company completed its $42M acquisition of Restaurant Magic, a leading back-office solution and this should provide useful cross-selling opportunities.The company also introduced a table service module and Par Pay, its merchant solution. The table service module could double the TAM and increase ARPU but it is still a couple of months away from a broader roll-out.Par Pay is a great step forward as Brink was the only POS system without its own merchant solution and this has been the biggest earner for the competition.Par is trying to get ahead of them by offering a much simpler, more transparent fee structure (Q4CC):But needless to say, Par Pay isn't generating much in terms of fees with restaurants empty.Which is where its September 2019 acquisition of Drive Thru is coming in. Management argued it had performed better than expected in Q4, and it has just expanded the opportunities with PARk-it, a new module introduced on March 24 which (Fastcasual):Brink also facilitates easy online ordering and integrates with over 22 online ordering platforms like GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) and even helps restaurants getting on these. This is important, as delivery is likely to become the main source of revenue for restaurants for the foreseeable future.We can conclude that the incentives for investing in a POS SaaS system like Brink have considerably increased although much of that is theoretical right now, with customers and potential customers scrambling for cash.From the 10-K:Here is the development of the most important metrics for Brink the last number of quarters:The Q4 figures were disappointing to us, we were expecting an acceleration in deployments. Management argues this was the result of a critical part that was unavailable, negatively impacting both installs and bookings (but the issue has been remedied).ARR for Brink was $19.2M, an increase of $4.7M (32%) over Q4 2018. Brink SaaS revenue increased by $1.1M or 41%. Brink's ASP on Q4 bookings was over $183 per month, resulting in an ARPU of $2200.The open order backlog jumped to 1390 stores due to an accounting change. Hardware revenues associated with Brink deployments grew $2.5M or 90% in Q4.Total hardware sales were $20.2M in Q4 up by 25% (or $4.1M) but this is mainly as a result of the $2.7M addition from the acquired Drive Thru business.There was a 9% increase in revenue for its government business to $17.2M with $148M in backlog at the end of Q4.Data by YChartsCash flow looks like a problem but is mostly the result of a GAAP net loss ($15.5M in 2019, non-GAAP net loss was much smaller at $4.9M) and a $15.6M increase in accounts receivable, which now stands at $47.8M ($11M of which for the government business) at the end of 2018.While the increase was mostly due to the move towards its ERP system which changed invoicing towards the end of the quarter, this situation isn't likely to improve anytime soon, needless to say.One should also consider that the free cash flow was impacted by:The company was fortunate with the timing of the offering of its 2026 secured notes on February 6, and this is giving the company, per the linked PR:Together with the $28M in cash the company had at the end of Q4, this should take care of cash needs for quite a while, and we are inclined to say that the company could also sell its government business. Dilution hasn't been much of a problem (although there are another 2.8M shares coming from the conversion of the notes in 2026) and neither is stock-based compensation excessive:Data by YChartsGiven its cash kitty of roughly $77M, management argued it is in a good position to acquire other companies and technologies or do a buyback. That remains to be seen, as we would like to have a better grasp on its cash flow this year.Data by YChartsValuation took a plunge, no surprises here. Under more normal circumstances this would be a give-away valuation. With an EV of $250M, that's basically $50M for Brink if you value the government business and the hardware business each at $100M.Many unknowns for the foreseeable future, most notably how cash flow, bookings and deployments are going to be impacted by the partial closure of restaurants although there is some compensation from Drive Thru and takeout.While there is the case that restaurants need a POS system like Brink now more than ever and the company could throw in greatly reduced or even free hardware deals as an incentive, we're not sure how many companies are going to bite given the cash constraints.The share price has crashed, but we do see some gradual recovery as control over the outbreak is likely to arrive at some time. Buying now is likely to result in a great bargain for when that day arrives."
4305322,21815,2019-11-11T05:14:44-05:00,"The company is a curious combination of businesses: one that sells defense stuff mostly to the government, the other two sell POS hardware and software to restaurants.It's the POS SaaS software platform Brink that is the jewel, and new management coming in has recognized that, changing things for the better.Brink has multiple growth paths, new logos, rising ARR, additional capabilities, and an ecosystem of third party solutions,.One by one, the new management is removing the barriers that limited Brink's growth and kept its valuation multiples considerably lower than its competitors.","For quite a while we have argued that Par Technology (PAR) was transforming itself into something much better, a cloud SaaS company generating high-margin recurring revenues, but that this transformation was going painfully slow and without generating visible results.Par Technology is a core part of the SHU portfolio, and we even took advantage to double that position at $22.88 in August on softness in the share price.That looked like a well-timed investment, as the shares ran up to $30 but they have fallen back since because of lack of tangible progress speeding up the build-out of their crown jewel, Brink, their POS restaurant cloud software platform.You see a pretty dramatic reaction in the share price to the Q3 figures, so did the acceleration of Brink deployments actually materialize?Well, sort of in terms of bookings, but actual deployments remained well under the levels that was achieved in early 2018:The company is under new management with CEO Savneet Singh who has a greatly increased focus on Brink, but this has forced them to take a step back (in terms of deployments) before they can actually take steps forward. From the Q1CC:There was a whole lot of stuff that had to happen in their processes, and one of the last parts of that has just been completed. From the Q3CC:Management always argued that the real progress would start in Q4 and indeed things look distinctly up from here (Q3CC):The last quote mentioned a new large signing, and indeed the company has signed a customer from its POS hardware business (a business which the new management has turned profitable on a standalone basis, despite very long sales cycles). From the Q3CC:But ADW Capital Management analyst and large shareholder Adam Wyden confronted management with rumors that there is quite a bit more (Q3CC our emphasis):This wasn't denied nor confirmed by management and Wyden had more from his channel check (Q3CC):Not surprisingly, management didn't confirm nor deny, but what they did say was this (Q3CC, our emphasis):If their actual implementations can keep up with bookings, it looks like the 20K installed base target for the end of next year is still on.While their hardware clients can be converted to Brink, which just happened with a 3,600 Tier 1 restaurant chain, the opposite is also very viable, Brink customers buying Par's POS hardware solution (Q3CC):One of the highlights of the Q3CC was certainly the announcement of the acquisition of Restaurant Magic, for $42M ($13M in cash, $27M in stock and a $2M seller note payable over 3 years).They already worked with Restaurant Magic for years, it's in their ecosystem of third-party solutions so there isn't any technical integration. Some facts about Restaurant Magic:It's a nice fit (Q3CC):There are lots of opportunities for cross selling (Q3CC):And given that Restaurant Magic (RM) operates with a small sales force, Brink can boost RM immediately with their much larger sales force, producing revenue synergies which are at the basis of their 50% growth optimism for RM.Let's recap the main growth drivers:Signing new logos is something that they are doing, as we discussed above, but it should also be noted that the company is extracting better prices from new sign-ups.Brink is actually much cheaper than the competition, here is Adam Weyden on the Q2CC:At present, their ARPU is just under $2000 (per year) but this number is set to rise as it is artificially low by the friendly pricing they charged their first Tier-1 customer Arby's.During the Q3CC, management argued that new customers are signed up with an ARR (average monthly run rate) well above $200, which translates into ARPUs of $2500+, which is still well below the competition.But there are multiple ways for ARR to rise further:One way is developing more solutions, either in-house or through acquisitions. On the latter, we've discussed Restaurant Magic but two months ago, Par acquired M's Drive Thru Communications business. CEO Savneet Singh added the following color:In previous articles, we discussed the ever-increasing ecosystem of third party solutions that link with Brink to provide choice for customers, while Brink gets a percentage of the run rate. From the company's August 2019 IR presentation:The takeaway, confirmed again during the Q3 CC is that POS isn't even 15% of what restaurants spend. There are large opportunities beyond that, most notably merchant services.The company never had its own merchant services but they just introduced Par Pay, and this can add up pretty quickly as we showed in previous articles. Here is Adam Wyden doing the same on the Q3CC:Management responded quite positively to that and noted that giving away the hardware (Par has its own POS hardware business) is also good for many of their clients as it greatly lowers their upfront CapEx cost.On table service (Q3CC our emphasis):That's not where the good news ends (Q3CC, our emphasis):According to Adam Weyden, it's much higher than even that.The ugly headline figures for Par are mostly the result of its government business, which is lumpy and older contracts are tailoring off while new contracts have yet to gain sufficient ramp-up as revenues declined 10.9% y/y.But the new contracts are there (the company won numerous contracts as investors can see from recent PRs) and next year, the finances will improve substantially as a result.Many investors, us included, think it makes sense to try to sell this business at some stage, which would provide funds to speed up the development and/or deployment of Brink.Valuating brink at year-end 2020 with the following metrics:This amounts to an $80M run rate by the end of 2020. At a 10x sales multiple, this is an $800M company which still has two other businesses (government and POS hardware).Some might consider the 10x sales multiple too high, but one could just as easily argue it's too low. Competitor Lightspeed (LSPD.TO) which is serving smaller restaurants had a pretty decent Q2:Its valuation though is, well, quite significant. The company has a $2.60B market cap with a $2.43B EV and it's trading at a whopping 20x EV/S. It's not growing faster than Brink, it's not making a profit, and it's not cash flow positive. Earlier this year, it was trading at even much higher valuations.Then there is Toast, which did a $250M financing this year which values the company at a staggering $2.7B, although Toast does have 100% of its clients on its merchant services and therefore generates a higher ARPU and it's also growing faster.Demand for Brink has always been there, the SaaS POS platform is tailor made for large restaurant chains.But the company was unable to fulfill all of it. After new management came in and recapitalized the company and gave Brink top priority, this is now changing.What's more, the value proposition of Brink itself is improving significantly, with the addition of a popular back office application and the development of Par Pay, it's now a much more complete package.All that preparatory work will now start to pay off, and we should see increased bookings, deployments and wallet space, leading to a steady rise in ARR. For us this is a top pick in our SHU portfolio."
4290499,105354,2019-09-09T10:42:01-04:00,"Newly appointed CEO Savneet Singh, with his sense of urgency and a renewed focus on ROIC and the Brink business, brings renewed hope for a PAR turnaround.With its first-mover advantage, scalability, and exposure to large local and international markets, Brink can grow at an accelerated pace with new management and capital in place.The second quarter showed some signs of improvement.At current prices, Brink’s implied valuation seems widely discounted; an analysis of Par's sum-of-parts suggests 36% upside from here.","PAR Technology (PAR), a hardware and cloud-based point of sale (POS) technology provider to the world’s largest restaurants, recently captured investors’ attention with a management reshuffle. Par's newly appointed CEO Savneet Singh brings a renewed focus on return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) and capital allocation, is driving drastic changes to the strategic vision of PAR, and is positioning the company to a higher-value software/SaaS-focused business. The activist factor is key here - ADW Capital, for instance, has been pushing for change, and as a result the Board has appointed a new leader who brings both a sense of urgency and an actionable plan of action to realize the company's potential.Although the transformation is still at its early stages and could take some time to materialize, I believe the developments brought about by the new management will prove value-accretive to the company. Likewise, the massive undervaluation of Brink thus far, makes the stock very cheap here with ~36% upside.Activism has been rife in PAR for a while now, e.g., Adam Wyden of ADW Capital Partners, owning 10.3% of PAR, expressed his extreme disappointment towards the Board and its lack of direction, competency and strategy (letters here and here).Shortly after, the PAR Board appointed Savneet Singh, a relatively new member of the Board, as the new CEO. Mr. Singh is a seasoned software investor and has experience as a managing partner for CoVenture, a multi-asset manager and Tera Holdings, a holding company of financial software businesses. His appointment is key to PAR’s transformation, given his experience as a capital allocator - the reinvigorated management team could be the long-awaited catalyst to finally unlocking value at PAR.Following his appointment, the subsequent stream of developments has strengthening my positive impression of PAR’s new leadership; this could well be the turning point for PAR. Some noteworthy developments are as follows:During its FY 2018 company presentation, Mr. Singh reiterated the new focus of the business, which has now turned to Brink POS/Cloud Solutions. Since its acquisition in 2014, investors have long hoped for Brink, a key part of the PAR investment thesis, to be optimized.Under Mr. Singh, this hope could finally be realized as the spotlight is now firmly on the Brink POS ecosystem. The company has set aggressive growth targets for Brink and has renewed its focus on capital allocation, ROIC targets, and shareholder value accretion.Source: Pg 10 of Investor PresentationAlthough things are moving in the right direction, the PAR case will depend on management's ability to execute as well as the Board's capability and willingness to hold it accountable. Note that PAR has suffered management instability in the past - e.g., CEOs and independent board member resignations and the dismissal of a CFO.The Brink POS business has, rightly in my view, become the new crown jewel of PAR. The strategic shift re-positions the PAR business model to one characterized by higher margins and recurring revenue.While PAR’s hardware POS product had successfully penetrated the largest restaurant chains such as KFC, McDonald’s, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, Carl’s Jr and Subway, it provides lower margins and an unstable revenue stream. PAR’s cloud-based POS software, on the other hand, is recurring (via monthly subscription fee) and offers a higher margin.Source: Pg 13 of Investor PresentationFurthermore, Brink has considerable potential to expand further due to its scalability, first-mover advantage, and ease of integration within restaurant chains.The scalability of Brink POS also makes expansion easier and faster versus competitors. In fact, Brink is the only proven enterprise cloud POS solution that has successfully integrated large scale and multi-unit restaurant chains at multiple brands.From PAR’s acquisition in 2014, restaurants with Brink POS installed had grown from 400 units to 8,800 units. Big names such as DQ, Five Guys, Smoothie King, Pinkberry and Arby’s had installed Brink POS into their network.Source: Pg 22 of Investor Presentation Given PAR has already raised $75M from convertible bonds, additional investments in Brink should be well-covered, mitigating any capital riase concerns and reinforcing the view that Brink is well-positioned for accelerated growth into 2021.The company aims to have 30,000 Brink locations by end-2020 which appears to be achievable given the untapped market and existing client base. Note that the PAR hardware customer base is already about 400,000 terminals installed in 75,000 locations, but that’s only 60% penetration of the biggest restaurant names.Source: Pg 28 of Investor Presentation Its biggest hardware customers such as Subway and McDonalds, with a combined number of restaurant branches of about 64,599, have yet to be converted to cloud-based POS. That’s an estimated $123M of revenues assuming $1,960 of ARPU (2Q 2019 ARPU).PAR's 2Q19 net income was disappointing at -15.91% decline year-on-year (yoy) to -$1.11M though losses narrowed vs 1Q19's -$2.73M. The main driver behind the decline in sales was weaker sales in POS hardware and government solutions which offset the strong 40% growth in Brink. As seen in Figure 1, the decline in Q2 2019 sales growth was -0.97% quarter-on-quarter (QoQ), an improving trend relative to prior quarters. I see this as a signal of an improving sales trend which should play out over a longer time frame.Likewise, as seen in Figure 2, net profit margin (NPM) improved to -2.51% in Q2 2019 due to muted growth in expenses, a slower decline in sales growth compared to Q1 2019, and additional tax benefits. Source: MarketWatchFY 2019 may still be challenging as the company has just started to re-accelerate growth and shift its focus on Brink POS. Nonetheless, I am positive that H2 2019 and 2020 will yield stronger results given PAR Pay merchant will be monetized in Q3 2019. Likewise, additional government contracts awarded in Q2 2019 such as the $8.5m 5-year contract with the US Navy, the $8.3m contract for the Djibouti Navy. and the $15.9m five-year subcontract from BAE Systems.Although PAR stock has already surged 29.1% since October 2018, the stock remains undervalued. At current prices, the implied value of Brink is still very cheap and does not price in its growth potential. Assuming the value of businesses ex-Brink is at $310M, at PAR’s current price of $22.73/share, Brink’s implied value amounts to ~$3.59/share or a total of $62.19M. Assuming 10,000 units by year-end and a consistent ARPU of about $1,960, a sum-of-the-parts valuation would tag PAR shares' fair value at $30.90 or 35.9% higher than the previous closing price. Table 1. SOTP ValuationSource: Source: MarketWatch.co, SeekingAlpha.com and own researchNote, however, that a fair degree of conservatism has been applied - adjusting for a higher number of units installed and a higher ARPU, the target price could well reach $33.95, equal to a 49.4% upside.Overall, PAR’s focus on Brink, paired with its new leadership marks a new chapter in the PAR story. In just about eight months, new management has re-aligned PAR’s strategy and focus, which I believe will yield results over the medium term.The shift of focus to Brink POS from the hardware arm should allow PAR to re-allocate resources towards higher-margin, recurring income, and faster-growing business, and will minimize the unwarranted valuation gap brought about by prior management mis-steps.If executed well, Brink could well bring in revenues of about $240m in the short-term, although I think the cloud business has more to offer in the long run. Although PAR shares have already risen a fair bit since last year, I still think there is room to run on the PAR turnaround story with ~36% upside from here based on a sum of parts valuation."

There are some other good resources to give you an introduction to PAR, including Greenhaven Road's recent letter on Seeking Alpha and Shareholders Unite's quarterly updates.This piece is a deeper dive and update to our original piece in 2017, as much has changed since then:Our Base Case price target is now $42.50 (96% upside from current) and we see a reasonable path to $60-$80+ over the next few years with strong execution from new CEO Savneet Singh. The short-term setup for the stock has also improved, as we believe Q2 was a trough quarter and key metrics will begin reaccelerating in the back half of the year and into 2020. Finally, we believe the odds of permanent capital loss are drastically reduced at the current price, and that Brink’s momentum would have to continue to materially decline over the next couple years to cause that negative outcome.We believe the basic calculus for PAR’s price can be driven by three main factors:Getting these three KPIs approximately right and then using reasonably conservative assumptions on the rest of the businesses, one can home in on the underlying value of the stock, as we believe Brink is--by far--the largest value driver for the company.Question 1: How many restaurants will Brink be in?To quote Howard Marks, “the most important thing is” Brink’s unit count, as the ARPU and Payments opportunity will be amplified by the size of the install base. The chart below shows where we are now.Source: Company Disclosures (Conference Calls and Press Releases)Although unit growth has slowed to around 45% in the most recent quarter, we believe there are compelling reasons to believe it will reaccelerate in the back half of the year. First, management commentary:So, Q3 will be better than Q2, Q4 will be better than Q3, and 2020 will be better than 2019. We like that setup. Although Savneet is not specifically referring to unit growth in this quote (more Brink holistically), we believe part of the commentary is around an uptick in unit growth. The sections below dive a little deeper into how we think about the various unit growth opportunities, and our comfort in PAR’s visibility.While the company has not put out an official press release, we believe that Dairy Queen will begin rolling out Brink in their stores in the back half of the year because we have noticed an uptick in Dairy Queen job postings involving Brink. Dairy Queen has over 5,000 units in the US/Canada, meaning a full roll out of Dairy Queen will increase Brink’s unit count by over 50%. As we discuss later, we also believe Dairy Queen has materially better contract terms than their first major Tier 1 rollout, Arby’s. We estimate a full roll out of Dairy Queen will be worth, in of itself, $10-$15 million in annual recurring revenue, and will be a contributor to the back-half growth PAR is projecting. While the rollout will take some time, as we understand it there are incentives being given to Dairy Queen franchisors to take the plunge.What else will drive the unit growth in the back half of 2019, 2020, and beyond?We continue to believe Brink is sitting on a huge pipeline of potential Tier 1 and Tier 2 customers and we have evidence that one of their large hardware customers, CKE Brands (Hardees and Carl’s Jr., ~3,800 units), has been strongly considering the Brink platform. CKE is interesting because the former CIO of Arby’s, Darla Morse, is now the CIO of CKE brands, and both of those companies are owned by Roark Capital. We estimate Roark Capital has over 20,000 stores under their Inspire and Focus portfolios (which includes Sonic, Buffalo Wild Wings, Jimmy Johns, and many more). We believe the great deal Arby’s got from PAR was a foot in the door to get onto many of Roark Capital’s restaurants.As it relates to CKE, we have seen some recent hires/roles on LinkedIn that seem to indicate a ramp up in activity. The first screenshot below shows one new hire, the Director of IT for CKE, who was previously a Product Manager at Brink. The second screenshot shows an employee who is “highly involved in planning and execution of POS conversion to Crunchtime/Brink solution to all corporate restaurants.”Source: LinkedInSource: LinkedInWe have also seen posts on social media stating that Panda Express (who also owns fast growing Just Salad) is piloting Brink:Source: InstagramWe have heard from POS consultants that Dunkin’ Donuts is interested in Brink. This makes some sense given Dunkin’ Donut’s sister company, Baskin Robbins, uses PAR’s legacy POS software, PixelPoint. Dunkin’ has ~7,700 units in the US and another 3,180 outside the US. The point is, we believe the pipeline is stuffed full, and Savneet reiterates that:A hindrance to actually signing a master service agreement and rolling out Brink is the company’s ability to:After the company’s capital raise early this year, Savneet immediately sought out to ramp up hiring to accommodate larger and more implementations. More importantly, we believe Savneet has also ramped up R&D so that Brink can more confidently roll out the vision of the POS that the large Tier 1 restaurants want. The R&D efforts to more quickly roll out features in software should have a flywheel effect, as PAR is highly prioritizing updates that will be applicable across Tier 1 customer bases. Thus, if development can accelerate, it should also be able to accelerate a restaurant’s willingness to move forward with implementations more confidently.As these two pieces come together we believe the pipeline can begin converting to contract signing and then rollout which should result in an acceleration of restaurant activations in 2020 and beyond.It’s interesting to note that Brink’s other software POS, PixelPoint, still has over 12,000 stores using it today. That’s 3,200 more than Brink currently! PixelPoint is known better for their Table Service, Fine Dining, Tier 4, and International penetration, all areas that Brink is weakest in but where management sees potential.PixelPoint was horribly monetized as previous management sold perpetual licenses with very little maintenance, but we believe there is a material opportunity (sometime in the late 2020/2021 period) whereby the transition of moving customers from PixelPoint to Brink can begin to occur and accelerate. The sticking point to this happening sooner is, again, features. PixelPoint is still more robust than Brink in Table Service and International markets, an area where Brink has not focused on historically.Nevertheless, we believe it’s possible that over the next 3-4 years PAR converts half of the PixelPoint customers to Brink, which would be another 6,000 or so stores that are very poorly monetized currently. Savneet notes that customers in table service are so enthused by Brink that they are waiting for Brink to get their table service up to par:The last point deserves reiteration: “…our existing customers continually request international Brink presence.” This makes sense given many Tier 1 chains have a large international market and, long term, wants all their restaurants under one POS roof.Obviously, this makes the TAM substantially larger, as there are about 1 million restaurants in the United States and 6-7 million internationally who utilize a POS system currently. We believe that “internationalization” of Brink will not be as challenging as other players who might want to try to expand beyond the US (for instance, Toast). For one thing, PixelPoint is already able to serve international markets. Secondly, PAR serves their hardware customers in over 100 countries and thus has beachheads already established in most key international markets. Also, as we understand it, the entire SureCheck product was internationally capable from the get-go as their largest customer Walmart demanded it as part of the rollout. So, PAR has experience rolling out international operations from a few different vectors.Finally, a note on Tier 4, or the true Mom and Pop restaurants. While this is a large market, it’s also by far the most competitive market. In this particular market, we believe Savneet is trying to utilize channel partners more effectively, while also keeping an eye on the Payments prize (discussed below). On the last call, Savneet talked about “weaponizing” his channel partners and also discussed the concept of a “Brink Lite” offering which would be more applicable to smaller chains. While at this point we are not modeling tremendous gains in market share here, we do believe the strategy is sound and that having a more cohesive go-to-market plan should help the company pick up more Tier 4 restaurants, particularly if they can engage their channel partners more effectively with a compelling message.We believe Brink’s installed restaurant base is quite attractive as the restaurants are either growing quite quickly (MOD’s pizza—443 units going to 1,000+ over the next 5 years, Sweetgreen—91 locations, just raised another $200 million and is opening 15+/year) or are large Tier 1 and hence will have very low churn. Some are both. For instance, Five Guys Burgers, one of their first large customers, has aggressive growth plans, with almost 1,500 locations now and another 1,500 in development.Although a recession or downturn could slow the momentum on some of these chains, we do believe Savneet is hyper focused on getting fast growing chains onto the Brink platform, as the implied ROIC is much higher trying to get a 250 chain shop that’s going to 1,000 in a few years than potentially a stagnant 500 unit chain.Our point in walking through the Tier 1 opportunity, the expanded TAM, and the Organic Growth opportunity all are attempting to point to reasonable levels of visibility for growth over the next few years. At Voss we hate “hoping” when the numbers are not there yet (as they are not for PAR). To invest we want to have a very strong understanding of where the short term, medium term, and long term growth is going to come from. While it’s hard to pinpoint a ceiling, it seems reasonably likely to us that at worst things continue on at the pace they have been going (e.g. 500-700 units a quarter), which we believe materially lowers the potential for permanent capital loss as Brink continues to scale.On the other hand, as Savneet executes the playbook he is talking about, accelerating development release schedules, adding staff to increase implementation capacity, and launching into new markets, we believe we will see an uptick in installed units going from 700 a quarter to 1,500 or 2,000 a quarter…in fact, it’s really a matter of when, not if.Question 2: What will the ARPU be?The ARPU (or ASP) is the average revenue per user, or in this case, restaurant. It consists of both the software package and additional maintenance support revenue, and is what the restaurant pays on a monthly basis to PAR. In order to be able to pitch material ARPU growth, you either need to have a platform or you need to be the core application from which other applications can spring. In Brink’s case, it’s the latter. The POS is the “brains” of the restaurant by which all other systems are connected. It’s as close to an ERP as a restaurant will get, and hence we believe ARPU expansion is a real possibility. How big?Compared to our first note, this is where we believe the greatest incremental opportunity lies, as Savneet has started to more specifically lay out how the company will materially improve ARPU. The “football field” chart below is a recent addition to PAR’s investor deck, and we think it is instructive towards the long-term opportunitySource: Company PresentationPAR argues there is a clear path from going from ~$2,000 a year today to over $8,000 ($714*12= $8,568) over the next several years, resulting in high margin incremental revenue. After all, in software building your base is the expensive part while the ARPU expansion is where you make your money. How will they move the ARPU so much higher? Four ways:Improving PricingOne major thing we got wrong in our original note was the ARPU on the first Tier 1 customer, Arby’s. We had seen solid ARPU’s from other large customers like Five Guy’s and while we assumed some decline in ARPU since Arby’s is so large and was the first to “take the plunge” as a Tier 1 customer, once Arby’s started rolling out it became apparent that Brink had given Arby’s pricing below our expectations.Although we think there are still some legacy contracts signed before Savneet came on, and thus there could be some more “blips” in ARPU, it has been suggested on conference calls that Dairy Queen could be coming on at an ARPU materially above company average, which will be a good harbinger for Tier 1 customers to work off of in the future.Savneet has even commented that there are a few large MSAs sitting on his desk, waiting to sign, but that he wants to improve pricing on before signing. We believe Brink’s competitive position will allow them to right size this pricing and that Arby’s will be, in general, the aberration.Savneet has made it a point on both the Q1 and Q2 calls to talk about bookings signed in the quarter, and what ARPU those new bookings are coming in at:By our math, this $200 monthly ARPU ($2,400 annually) compares to their current aggregate ARPU of closer to $140 a month ($1,680). So just by “pricing modifications and value justification” they have raised ARPU by over 40% on new customers.As the football field concept shows, the actual cost of the POS software is about $140/month for a two terminal store, with some small upselling available with Kitchen Display Systems and Future Date Ordering. In order to get to $714 a month, new products will either need to be built (like PAR Pay), JV partnerships will need to be implemented (like ItsaCheckmate for Online Ordering, or Altametrics for workforce and supply chain management), or PAR will need to acquire partners.Whether to build, partner, or buy additional functionality and features is obviously complex and a bit hard to model. For instance, buying a company has the advantage of acquiring a development team in addition to the product and revenues, but can also be dilutive to shareholders and can be a distraction if the cultures don’t jive. Building can take longer but has other benefits like sharing native code bases. We believe Savneet is highly attuned to the pros and cons of each and will employ all of them to some degree. We believe at least some of the cash hoard the company got in their capital raise will be used on acquisitions.He has spoken about acquisitions on calls:When we wrote our previous note, we completely left Payment Processing (aka Merchant Services) off, because frankly the company had no product and had not announced work on a product. Now, with Savneet announcing on the Q2 call that a product is imminent for Q3, we can take a look at this opportunity in earnest. While we never like to ascribe too much value to a product that still does not technically exist, other POS company’s success in executing this straightforward playbook suggests that PAR Merchant Services will be worth something, it’s just a question of how much.So what is PAR’s payment processing initiative? Essentially it is PAR injecting themselves into the lucrative credit card workflow, whereby a business gets charged 2-3% every time a customer uses a credit card. While the 2-3% stays relatively static, how that revenue gets chopped up can be more volatile, as several parties have claims on the revenue (Visa, the issuing bank, and merchant acquirers like First Data or Global Payments).In recent years, software POS companies have successfully started getting pieces of this revenue, usually in the 40-65 bps range, as the POS already has all the data and is in a natural position to process that payment data. A good example of an original pioneer is Mindbody (yoga studio and gym software) who, right before being acquired by Vista Equity in 2018, had 1/3rd of their revenue coming from “Payments” and 2/3’s of their revenue coming from software subscription.More recently, direct comps to Brink, Lightspeed and Toast, have made payments a key part of their strategy. Toast, for instance, touts that 100% of their customers “take” payments and they get nearly 50 basis points (bps) of net fees. Lightspeed is targeting 65 bps of net take on credit card transactions.What can we expect from PAR? Voss is somewhat tempering our expectations here in terms of customer penetration as compared to Toast, and the take rate as compared to Lightspeed. The reason is primarily target market. Toast and Lightspeed are more SMB focused, where it’s easier to convince companies to buy the software and then package that with payments. These customers are also less sophisticated, and so negotiating higher net processing fee is easier. PAR is focused on larger and fast-growing restaurant franchises, and so our assumption is it will be harder to get this business. However, we don’t think it’s impossible, as we once asked the Five Guys Burgers (>1500 units) CTO about this and he said, “Sure, as long as their prices are the same or lower.” If we look forward into the future, when Brink is in 30,000 restaurants, and assume a take rate in the 20-40% range with 30-50bps of payment processing revenues, it can result in some material annual EBITDA:Source: Table by author, using assumptions from peers LightspeedIf they are able to achieve 40 bps at a 30% take rate on 30,000 restaurants, they can churn out almost $26 million in annual EBITDA ($32 mm in revenue), an amount we think would roughly cover their current EV right now (ex-Government business). Even at 30 bps and a 20% take rate, an incremental $13 million in EBITDA adds material upside to PAR. Most Payment Processors trade in the 15-20x EBITDA range, implying even $10 million in EBITDA (~$12 million in revenues) could have a material impact on PAR’s current valuation.If we were to dream a little bit bigger and think about when PAR gets closer to 60,000 restaurants, which should push incremental EBITDA margins even higher, and perhaps PAR gets closer to 40% take rate on 50 bps, this business on its own could generate $100 million a year in incremental EBITDA.Ultimately, we believe there is a large opportunity for PAR to get into the marketing and data analytics space to help their customers be more efficient and make their customer’s go to their stores more often. To explain simply, this could mean PAR taking 25% of a store’s advertising budget and running various marketing campaigns as PAR will be able to attribute more success on the campaigns than restaurants see from traditional media. We have spoken extensively to Jordan Thaeler at Whatsbusy, a data analytics and marketing company that uses algorithms to make recommendations on how restaurants owners can become more efficient and how they can drive traffic.He argues that the POS is in pole position to take advantage of this given their access to data from all different areas. The POS is the only source to generally know exactly what a customer ordered (moreso than, say, the credit card companies). While we are not modeling revenue from this explicitly, yet, we do believe it’s on the longer term product roadmap and a primer from Jordan can be found here.Question 3: What multiple should Brink get?The POS space is in landgrab mode, and the valuations are indicative of that. The best public comp to Brink is Lightspeed (OTC:LGHEF), a POS software and payments provider to the retail industry headquartered in Canada.Below is a snapshot on Lightspeed:Source: Image by author, using data from Lightspeed filingsAt 22x NTM ARR and 34x NTM Gross Profit ARR, Lightspeed is being given a premium valuation, although not necessarily out of whack with the general software universe. If we look at a scatterplot of EV/Sales (FY2) and organic growth rate (FY2/FY1) of 125 software companies, we get the following basic framework (Lightspeed is actually slightly below trendline):Source: Chart by author, using data from FactsetEssentially, if you’re growing at 40-50%, you should get a 15-18x forward multiple. This one factor alone has an r2 of 0.525.Now of course there are a number of things that can put you above or below trend, including scale, salesforce efficiency, churn, gross margin, Rule of 40, strategic value, acceleration/deceleration, length of runway, TAM, and many other things, but it’s a fairly good quick and dirty method.We believe an industry leading cloud POS product targeting low churn Tier 1 and Tier 2 customers should score quite well on most of these factors except for scale at this point, and we believe Savneet is working on improving salesforce efficiency and gross margin:Source: Table by author, as estimated by authorFor additional frame of reference, private competitor Toast raised another $250 million in March at a valuation of $2.7 billion. While we believe Toast is growing somewhat faster than Brink now, Toast is already generating a large share of their revenues from Payments, something PAR is just now starting. We do not believe Toast is in materially more actual units than Brink. Toast, as we understand it, is also burning gobs of cash to achieve their growth, so Brink likely has better efficiency metrics given their relatively shoestring budget.We started this note by saying an overly simplified way of valuing Brink is estimating unit growth, ARPU, and a reasonable multiple to apply to that resulting ARR. Below is a table where we lay out our 2020 forecasts for units, ARPU, and multiple in a Bear, Base, and Bull Case.Source: Table by author, using Voss estimatesNote we estimate the current ARPU at ~$1,875 on a current unit count of 8,800.In the analysis below, we take these values and come up with a framework for valuing PAR in total.Valuing PAR - Base CaseOur Base Case is for accelerating Brink ARR in the back half of 2019 and into 2020. While management has talked to returning to “historical growth rates”, which would be 80-100%, our Base Case assumes the lower end of this range, vs. the slower 40% witnessed in the last quarter. Critically, although we think unit growth could exceed 40%, we are keeping it at around 40% in 2020, while our more aggressive Base Case forecast is for 26% ARPU growth. Our 12x ARR multiple is a material discount to Lightspeed’s multiple, which we believe is reasonable given the complexity of PAR’s story and the lower scale.Assuming we are right on 50% ARR growth acceleration in 2020, Brink would exit 2020 running at roughly $33 million ARR (excluding Payments revenue), with some ongoing signs of scaling the business. Below is a Sum of Total Parts, which we feel is appropriate given the Government business ultimately being divested.Source: Table by author, using Voss estimatesValuing PAR - Bear CaseIn the Bear Case we actually slow down Brink’s growth to 29%, with only slight ARPU gains and 25% unit growth. Given our visibility into their backlog and pipeline, this would be a pretty severe disappointment, but could certainly happen in certain cases such as a prolonged global recession where restaurants pause their IT investments or if competition becomes more pervasive.In this case, we give Brink a $156 mm valuation and essentially hack the rest of our SOTP line items, resulting in 10% downside from the August 21st price.Source: Table by author, using Voss estimatesValuing PAR - Bull CaseIn this case we more material up the unit acceleration to 70%, while also accelerating ARPU gains and Payments uptake. For this scenario to work, PAR will have to roll out three larger Tier 1 customers by the end of 2020, most likely, and will have to get material uptake on their upsell initiatives like PAR Pay and start getting material revenue from their JV initiatives.Source: Table by author, using Voss estimatesThe Blue Sky CaseSavneet has laid out a compelling 5-6-year vision whereby Brink can get to 50-80k units, with an ARPU in the $8,000-$10,000 range. We believe he is including Payments revenue, and likely a couple of acquisitions, so it’s a little hard to model this completely, but we think it’s worthwhile to consider what the company could look like in 5-6 years’ time and let readers discount it back at their own rate.Below is a sensitivity table showing what Brink’s ARR could be under different unit levels and different ARPU scenarios:Source: Table by author, using Voss estimatesFor reference, 80,000 units would be 1% of total global restaurants with a POS system, 8% of North American Restaurants, or 22% of QSR/Casual/Fast Casual North American restaurants.On the lower end of the scale, with just 40,000 units at $6,000 annual ARPU, PAR would produce $240 million of annual recurring revenue, an amount we believe would be worth at least 5x ARR (or 3-4x total sales, compare to Lightspeed at 22x NTM ARR).Disclosures and Notices:This report is provided by Voss Capital, LLC (“Voss”) for informational purposes only.

4284802,21815,2019-08-12T09:25:09-04:00,"Another quarter with losses, considerable revenue shrink, and without an acceleration of growth in its Brink SaaS software.Management argues that the groundwork has been laid for accelerating growth from Q4 onward.We still think the patient investor will be rewarded, but it seems that it's going to take a little longer for things to turn up in a material way.","PAR Technology Corp. (NYSE:PAR) is a somewhat odd combination of hardware and SaaS software for the restaurant and government defense business. As we argued in previous articles, that obscures the growth and potential of its SaaS POS solution called Brink, which is really growing fast.Take for instance the five-year development:Data by YChartsThis really doesn't look like a promising business, does it? In fact, it looks more like a failing business. But looks can be deceptive, and in this case, they are. These seemingly bad developments are the result of:These still continued in Q2; the hardware POS business is simply suffering from long replacement cycles. Take for instance McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), a big PAR customer which just did a hardware replacement cycle; it's not going to embark on a new one anytime soon.So PAR's hardware business was down 29.5% y/y in Q2, and this was compounded by a 9.9% decline in its government business. Together this produced an ugly headline revenue decline of 16% to $44.2M and a non-GAAP EPS miss of $0.07 to -$0.18. (GAAP EPS was bolstered by a one-off tax credit of $4M).But the government business is already turning around after a number of contract wins, with backlog now over $152.5M and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio of 1.7.Despite the shrinking revenue, the hardware business actually managed to become profitable.Here are some Q2 figures from Brink:While these figures were a little disappointing, the company has been laying the groundwork for faster growth starting in Q4 and then in 2020. What's more, management argues that it has multiple growth avenues in front of it:We start with the ARPU increases, and Adam Wyden, the founder of ADW Capital Management, noted that the company is far cheaper than the competition (Q2CC):And here is the CEO's response (Q2CC):It's on 1,800 units and a little below $2,000 ARPU. How does it get there? Well, six years is a long time, and the first big boost to the ARPU is the upcoming merchant services.Here is a little calculation we made for a previous article, but we reproduce it because not everybody will have access to that article:Merchant services (here called processing as it takes a cut from processing transactions) will give a big boost to ARPU even if only half of the customers sign up for it.Another source for increasing ARPU is the ecosystem, where the company gets a cut of the take when clients use a partner application. In some cases, this could double the ARPU (Q2CC):But to put this into perspective, last quarter the revenue from partnership was essentially zero, so it will take time for this to ramp into significant levels.Two additional avenues are international growth and tier-4 restaurants. The first is driven by customer demand, as some of the chains the company serves have significant business overseas and is frustrated it can't use Brink software outside of the US.Tier 4 restaurants (with only a few branches) is a really competitive space and involves a trade-off. Basic SaaS revenue is likely to be lower, but the take rate on merchant services could well be higher.When looking at the table above, it becomes clear that 30K deployments by the end of 2020 now seem out of reach and even 20K will be quite a stretch.The company has signed up big customers which it hasn't even formally announced yet, like Dairy Queen, but it's clear these targets which were panned out not so long ago have shifted considerably and growth itself isn't accelerating:While PAR does have enough restaurants signed up, the bottleneck is accelerating in connecting these. During the previous (Q1CC), management argued it was laying the foundations for exactly that, and in light of that, Q2 results are disappointing, even if the real acceleration should happen in H2 and especially Q4.That remains to be seen. To get to 20K restaurants at the end of next year, it needs to accelerate deployments to 2,500 a quarter; the 30K target which was talked about last year seems out of sight to us.Data by YChartsThe hardware and government businesses aren't commanding substantial margins, and the revenue declines have worsened operating margins.Data by YChartsCash flows have deteriorated really considerably, but with the $80M financing in April, the company still has enough funds to last a couple of years - $58.6M to be precise.The company put its SureCheck business up for sale. Here is the CEO on the company's long-term strategy:In the light of this statement, it's puzzling why it has decided to sell its SureCheck business, which seems much more complementary to Brink and aligned with this long-term strategy than its government/defense business. And take the following (Q2CC):Another reason for keeping SureCheck, we are inclined to argue. At one stage, management argued that this could bring as much revenue as Brink.Brink's 2019 valuation isn't all that hard to calculate. At 2,000 ARPU with 10K restaurants producing $20M in recurring revenues, putting a 10x sales multiple on that, and you end up with a $200M business.The market capitalization of the company is double that (to which we have to add the shares coming from the convertible notes or the $60M debt), so valuation seems quite rich on today's state of affairs.With the further contraction in its hardware and government business, the headline figures are downright ugly, masking the promising development of Brink.Growth from Brink itself still isn't accelerating (if anything, the contrary), and this has likely frustrated some shareholders losing patience. We still think significantly better times are ahead, but it's going to take more time than even we expected.Acceleration is promised from Q4 onward, so patient investors can already participate; others might want to wait until signs of this acceleration actually emerge."

The shares had fallen back on a $70M capital raise through senior 4.5% notes due in 2024, while we think this is just what the doctor ordered.As we stressed in earlier articles, PAR Technology is a hidden gem even if its headline numbers don't look at all special (and that's putting it mildly):Data by YChartsRevenues have declined and operationally things look like going backwards considerably. But you have to peel back the layers a bit to get to the exciting bits, as PAR Technology consists of a number of businesses, like a POS hardware business and a government business.These two businesses didn't do too well last year, but the hidden gem in PAR Technology is Brink, its POS SaaS platform (for a description of features, see here).Its hardware business was down 41% y/y in Q1 in relation with the declining orders from Tier 1 customers but this business is always a little volatile with long replacement cycles.Its government business declined 6.3% y/y in Q1 (although there is still $135M in backlog), and the same can be said about quarterly volatility here. The business is still alive and well as it just won a new $8.5M order from the US Navy.Although these are not really growth businesses, its government business brings in cash flow with which to finance the Brink expansion and its hardware business is complementary in both directions.For instance, last quarter management said that it was confident that one of its Tier 1 hardware clients will sign up for Brink, and there are also sales the other way around, existing Brink customers buying PAR hardware ($4.5M, an increase of 71% y/y).Here are the main metrics from the quarter:At first sight installations have slowed a bit, but management projects a strong acceleration in H2 2019 (Q1CC):This was because the company invested in necessary improvements (Q1CC):In an earlier CC (Q2 2018) management gave an indication of the TAM:And management is involved (that is, installed, installing or in talks) with 20% of these, per management (Q2 2018CC):That's 60,000+ units and that's just the domestic part, quite a number of the chains operating in these segments are also operating abroad. Add to this that at one stage, management also argued that the company's food safety platform SureCheck's TAM could be as big or bigger as that of Brink.Management has set expectations for 30K implementations by the end of next year, we'll do a valuation calculation at the end of this article, not even including anything for SureCheck (nor its hardware or government business). The results are quite amazing.The bottleneck has been cash for sales and for implementation but the recent $70M financing should get a long way in removing this, which is exactly the reason why we took a position when that news came out (and the shares sold off).Here are the main growth areas:The company is giving pricing a little more thought than before (Q1CC):As a result, pricing is increasing as the company now books new customers at $200 per site per month or $2400 per year (while we based prior calculations on $2000 per year), Q1CC:This suggests the company is able to increase pricing, but it's likely at least part of the increase is related to its ecosystem as attaching third-party solutions also increases revenues for PAR.The company also added two new Tier 1 customers Dairy Queen (DQ) and an unnamed chain (which could be the hardware client it expected to sign). Dairy Queen's network of franchises is over 7,000 units and growing.Creating its own solutions will accelerate that, especially the merchants and payments solutions which are scheduled to go live in H2 this year (Q1CC):The merchant solution can be especially profitable as this is likely to take something in the order of 50bp on transactions going through its system, which for restaurant chains is in the order of $1.5M a year. So merchant revenue could be as high as $7500 per year, that's 3x what the company gets for Brink subscription (and service).Another way to improve its revenue stream is through its ecosystem:Here is an idea for the types of solutions available from its ecosystem (company website), many categories have multiple solutions:And just recently 6 new partners were added, this potentially creates network effects augmenting the value of Brink simply because it offers such great flexibility.Management argued during the Q1CC that the big Tier 1 restaurant chains want an integrated solution, and these integrated ecosystem partnerships allow PAR to provide a better value proposition to these big chains and also to increase its MRR (monthly recurring revenue).But one of the reasons it did the capital raise was that it sees interesting M&A opportunities to expand its own offerings, so stay tuned.Management argued that the additional increase in MRR from its ecosystem partners is the more immediate opportunity, as the big change want an integrated solution and often asks for specific solutions (Q1CC):That investment in its foundation enabling it to partner with a wide variety of third-party solutions slowed growth a bit, but sets Brink up for a significant re-acceleration of growth in H2, driven by both volume and increases in ARPU.Data by YChartsAgain, while margins did recover (less so on a non-GAAP basis) the downward trend is not surprising given the revenue decline in the hardware and government business. More importantly, this is effectively hiding a lot of good news from Brink.Product margin for the quarter was 27.6%, compared to 26.2% in Q1 2018, mostly due to a favorable sales mix. Service margin for the quarter was 28.6%, compared to 27.7% in Q1 2018 (these are non-GAAP margins).But management is reorganizing the restaurant business into the core (hardware) and Brink, and is planning some serious inventory reductions (Q1CC):There are additional cost-cutting measures (Q1CC):Data by YChartsWe update our table from a previous article. Based onYRR stands for yearly revenue rate.The 10K estimate for 2019 is rather conservative (the company is on 8000 already and expects a significant acceleration in H2). On the other hand, the 30K estimate for 2020 could well be too aggressive, so we added a more conservative target of 20K as well.The company has a contract for 8K installations already in the bag, which is just beginning to ramp and it expects one of its big hardware customers to sign up this year.The $2400 ARPU, on the other hand, could very well rise a lot further when more of its contracts include third-party ecosystem solutions, and this is something management expects to happen.So we could very well have something approaching $150M in recurring revenue by the end of 2020. At 10x sales, that's close to $1.5B, that's 5x the present market cap which includes other businesses (the hardware, government and SureCheck businesses).Toast, a competitor, raised $250M at 15x sales but it does have 100% pay attachments, so it is entitled to a higher valuation.One might be curious where we get the metrics for merchant services from; well, here is Adam Wyden on the Q2 2018CC (our emphasis):With these an ever increasing core YRR, and after adding payments and merchant services YRR can approach 8K-10K, which opens a line of sight towards $240M-300M of recurring revenue.One has to realize that this doesn't depend on anything spectacular happening, certainly not in terms of winning new customers but the critical element here is the take-up of the upcoming merchant services, which is something that remains to be seen. Investors are slowly waking up to these opportunities:In our view, the stock is a no-brainer. Its government business is generating cash used for the expansion of Brink and the new management isn't averse in selling that business. Its hardware business is complementary to Brink and Brink itself has a very long runway.Brink is increasing its average pricing, providing an integrated solution with the help of its increasing ecosystem which allows further average price increases.Since it had to invest in these capabilities, client implementation slowed a bit but that's going to ramp up in H2 as these investments are behind us and the company has $70M in new funds.Also in H2, the addition of merchant services and Pay offers a real shot at a really big jump in ARPU. The domestic market opportunity is very large and then there is international, and SureCheck.All the while, Brink is effectively hidden behind dud numbers of the overall business, but it is in hyper-growth phase that isn't likely to abate anytime soon, in fact the adding of Pay and merchant services will provide a substantial boost.Valuations might appear reasonable on today's metrics, but with so much growth around the corner, they really don't make any sense."
4250160,21815,2019-03-21T06:00:00-04:00,"While headline numbers could lead to the conclusion that PAR Technology is moving backwards, the reality underneath the hood is quite different.Brink, the company's POS cloud system, is growing rapidly and is vastly underappreciated and undervalued, in our view.New management seems to have a new sense of urgency to develop Brink, which is experiencing hyper-growth.Brink's installed base and ARPU will increase significantly over the coming years.","We think that despite fairly ugly headline numbers, there is a lot of hidden value in PAR Technology (PAR). The company has a gem in its SaaS POS platform Brink, with installations growing at 81% and important add-ons coming this year, increasing ARPU. We believe Brink is vastly undervalued still.One of the more promising companies we follow is PAR Technology. This is a company that is in the midst of a transition from a hardware-based company to a SaaS platform.These kinds of transitions usually produce ugly headline figures as revenues and operational performance take a hit. PAR Technology is no exception:Data by YChartsThis is pretty ugly, but investors are smarter and they have looked through this, with the shares rising greatly:And investors are right, in our view. However, since we last wrote about this company two quarters ago, the share price has stagnated, as the headline numbers have gotten worse.One of the problems is that PAR Technology really consists of three businesses, one of which doesn't even have any relation to the other two:The business which matters most for shareholders is the SaaS part of the POS (point of sale) business, which was acquired in 2014 and is called Brink. Before we get to that, first the results.Data by YChartsWith the decline in revenues, margins and cash flow have also turned south. The company's cash balance is actually a little worrying at just $3.5 million, although it has no debt.Brink is PAR Technology's cloud POS platform - you can assess the extensive number of features here. No disrespect to the other businesses, but for shareholders this is by far the most important one. First, a little progress report:And there are a lot more new deployments and wins. From the Q4CC:It's a little confusing, but what we made of it is that the company has 8000 installations, with a further 9000 in the pipeline to reach 17,000 signed, which include a portion of the 6000 from its new customer, but (from the Q4CC):And as analyst Adam Wyden from ADW Capital (who is really the go-to guy for this company, in our view) noted, it also doesn't include the Tier 1 hardware customer the company expected would sign up for Brink in the near future.That is, the company has a line of sight to 20K-40K deployments in the fairly near future, given what is already in the pipeline and given its growth rate.And like any SaaS platform, it tends to be sticky, and the company can add features to create new revenue streams from existing customers. It is doing just that:ARPU is a little over $2000 per deployment per year in recurring revenues, not even including service cost or anything from Merchant Services or PAR Pay, or any hardware sales attached to these.PAR Technology used to have a 30-34K target for the end of next year, which the company didn't confirm on the Q4CC, but it won't be far off. So, let's take that 30K number - that's $60 million in SaaS recurring income per year.Merchant Services could greatly increase this figure. It generates a take on payments in the order of 50-60bp, and assuming average gross flow of $1.5 million per year, that's $7500 per terminal.If half of PAR's Brink customers take this up, that's another $112.5 million, and then another $35-50 per month per terminal for PAR Pay, assuming $480 per terminal per year and an uptake of 50%. The attachment seems to go very well (from the Q4CC):What we haven't yet mentioned is that the company has new management, and it seems to be well aware of the opportunities and importance of Brink. Here's what the new CEO Savneet Singh had to say in this regard (from the Q4CC):We made this calculation in a previous article, noting the valuation disconnect as we called it. Nothing has changed since in terms of the disconnect. Here is the summary table:$180 million in SaaS revenue - give that a 10x multiple and the company would be worth $1.8 billion based on Brink alone (leaving out all of its other businesses). That 10x sales multiple really isn't all that extraordinary for a SaaS business, and the acquisition of a competitor, Toast, was done at 15x sales as we noted in that article.Of course, we're not at the end of 2020 yet, and the company doesn't yet have those 30K deployments. Meanwhile, the headline figures aren't pretty, as its other businesses had some setbacks.But this year PAR Technology could easily get to 17K deployments, and even if we don't assume any PAR Pay or Merchant Services attachments, this would still imply that Brink alone supports the entire market cap of the company.And one might want to remember that Brink deployments are growing at a torrid pace (81% in the last quarter). Surely, valuations can increase when one realizes that there is also a wave of attachments of PAR Pay and, especially, of the lucrative Merchant Services coming.While headline numbers are ugly, below the surface is a caterpillar about to turn into a beautiful butterfly. Brink's SaaS deployments are marching forward inexorably, with another big deal and another Tier 1 hardware customer also about to come on board, per management.With what we know, deployments can easily get to 17K by the end of this year, and this alone supports the entire market capitalization of the company.Then, it has a shot at getting deployments close to 30K by the end of next year or soon after. What's more, PAR Pay is already getting good attachment rates, and the lucrative Merchant Services will start to do so in the second half of this year, greatly increasing the recurring ARPU.You can buy PAR Technology now, get Brink with all this upside, and get the company's other businesses for free. That seems a good deal to us.In summary:"
4185876,21815,2018-07-07T14:19:57-04:00,"The shares of PAR Technology have doubled in less than half a year.Based on the aggregate numbers, there is nothing to warrant such a rise; in fact, one could say quite the contrary.However, beneath the surface there are two growing SaaS businesses which could develop into little gems.The company doesn't make this clear enough, but some investors have figured it out nevertheless.","In March, we researched PAR Technology (PAR) whose shares had gained substantially on the back of a shift towards a SaaS business model which is basically driven by the acquisition of the Brink back in 2014, from Retail Touchpoints:Well, how has that developed?PAR Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsNot really all that well at first sight, which makes the share price explosion this year a bit of a puzzle:And indeed, revenues declined 15.5% in Q1, but this was because of the lapping of a large hardware project for a Tier 1 customer which was completed in the first half of 2017, so they're falling out of revenues as they're not recurring.The company has three businesses:Looking in more detail, it becomes obvious that Brink is actually growing, and quite a bit. This is the fundamental tailwind behind the share price increase as the company is morphing into a SaaS business platform and our regular readers will realize that these are very attractive business models, at least in principle. Here are some interesting metrics from Brink:And, like all SaaS platforms, functionality and modules can be added, increasing the value of the platform and its stickiness. For instance, the company:The company has also added a new Brink POS hardware platform, the EverServ 600. So we know it's a promising business model, we know it's fast growing, we know it is adding functionality, but there is also quite a bit we don't know.An analyst, Adam Wyden from ADU Capital, lamented that the results are not more granular. Wyden argues the POS business is worth much more (Q1CC):And indeed, he does have a point, in our view. For starters, the goal of management is to reach 10,000 installed, or (a bit less ambitious) 10,000 booked for Brink by the end of the year.(After the earnings call, they managed to secure 200 more with the win of Duck Donuts chain.)When questioned, management argued they will reach between 9,000-10,000 booked at year-end, a little less ambitious still, but very good progress nevertheless.Wyden argued that, given the valuations of a major competitor (Toast), those 10,000 'boxes' (POS terminals) times $1.5M per box a year is $15B in client revenue passing through the company's POS system.Wyden argues that Toast earns 50 basis points on their revenue, and the company did a finance at 30x sales which would give a $600M valuation for Brink alone. (In fact, on the above metric, we would arrive at $2.25B).But that's clearly not right. According to management, the boxes have an MRR (monthly recurring revenue) of between $30 and $45, which amounts to just $3.6M-$5.4M a year.That is really is quite another ballpark and would value Brink at $150M, not $600M (let alone $2.25B). And that is applying this rather tremendous 30x sales multiple.A high multiple is warranted, these are recurring revenues, and there will be opportunities to up-sell, but still, 30x sales?But management also argued that they are negotiating better rates and at least some of that will take effect in the second half of the year. So the $30-$45 in MRR might move up.What's also not known, and where Wyden does have a point, is the margins that are made on that $30-$45 in MRR. We don't know, because the hardware and the software aren't split out, but management argues that the margins on the hardware are improving and that they are profitable.And with respect to that, having big Tier-1 customers like Yum (NYSE:YUM) and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) looks pretty good, but these big customers are also able to negotiate better deals, so they move the needle a lot in terms of revenues, but not so much in terms of gross margins.There is some segment information, summarized in the following table from the 10-Q:But Restaurant/Retail contains both hardware and software, and it also contains SureCheck, which is also a SaaS business. There was some good news:It's a bit of a curious mix, their POS and SureCheck with stuff like intel solutions (revenues of which grew 17% y/y) and their mission systems business (+9% y/y). Backlog increased from $111M to $118.7M sequentially and margins amouted to 8.1%.Looking at the table above from the 10-Q, you'll notice that the government sector is actually the one that brings positive operating income, even if that was down from $1.51M to $1.26M y/y.After the quarter closed, PAR government gained a substantial ($19.8M over 12 months with 4 options for additional services) contract from the US Navy.PAR Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsInvestment in Brink and a revenue decline has taken a toll on cash flow too, the company is still using cash ($2.5M in Q1 in operations). The company borrowed $3M in Q1 from their credit line.However, things are not as bad as they seem as accounts receivable increased by $5.8M in Q1 as well, due to a disproportionate amount of revenue recognition late in the quarter.Stock-based compensation isn't a problem, nor is dilution:PAR Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsPAR EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsValuation metrics have moved up from very depressed levels, and although on earnings basis the stock is expensive, its growing SaaS business model part is probably still reasonably cheap.The shares have doubled since mid-February. The market seems to have woken up to the transformation to a SaaS business model. While this was already ongoing, it was hidden by other businesses, the lack of enough separated out data and seeming lack of progress in consolidated data.Their government business brings in considerable operational profits, their restaurant business doesn't. But the latter is transforming into a SaaS platform, and what matters here is the growth.Despite substantial competition in the legacy, as well as SaaS POS market, growth (48%) is very substantial. We think the rally in the shares is justified and could see this continue, even if there isn't much visibility as to exactly how profitable their SaaS business could become.We still think the company is an odd combination of unrelated businesses. This could be a good thing insofar as their government business produces cash flow which enables them to lessen the financial demands of transforming their POS business to SaaS.But they could also sell that business and get a whole lot of cash to achieve the same goal. That would have the added benefit of making the underlying business model and its metrics emerge more clearly, and possibly get a substantial valuation boost as a result.What we do know is that the company sells for just over 1x sales. Given the operational government income, that seems eminently reasonable for that business, meaning their restaurant business is also valued at 1x sales.Now, their restaurant business is still mostly hardware, which usually commands low multiples.Hardware revenues were $26.3M in Q1, still dwarfing the $8.5M in Brink's annual recurring revenues, although there is also a recurring part of the hardware business and there is also recurring SaaS revenue from SureCheck.Management argued during the Q1CC that their hardware business related to Brink is profitable, but again, we don't have enough visibility to split this out. We know for instance that product and service margin are almost equal (26.2% versus 27.7%) and the latter is increasing slowly as their SaaS businesses are outpacing other service business.So, all we have is that there are two SaaS platforms, Brink and SureCheck. One is growing rapidly, the other one is also showing growth, and these could emerge as gems commanding a much higher valuation, but their POS SaaS business is still rather small."
2771595,68255,2014-12-23T06:15:00-05:00,"Over its life as a public company, PAR Technology has been a serial destroyer of shareholder value.Most of the board members and executives responsible for this value destruction have stepped down or been removed.Shares are up over 40% during the last 4 months, largely attributable to confidence in new board level leadership.Hope is largely justified based on new board members' experience and contrast to previous directors, but ongoing operational risks should not be overlooked.Split company scenario provides optionality argument for speculative investors.","When analyzing a company, it's always prudent to thoroughly examine managers' and directors' experience, history, motivations, and performance. While conducting research for my Furmanite (NYSE:FRM) note, I came across PAR Technology (NYSE:PAR), a company with no similarities except for lousy long-term performance and two individuals who had previously been long time board members for both companies. I was intrigued by how a point-of-sale (POS) terminal and software company that had long standing relationships with some of the largest fast food and hotel chains in the world could perform so poorly over the years. So, I decided to do a deeper analysis and valuation to get a better understanding of what is wrong at PAR, what has been fixed, and how much value is likely to be added.Business SummaryPAR Technology is primarily a provider of hospitality (restaurants, hotels, spas, etc.) management hardware and software. The company's products and solutions in its primary segment are POS terminals, property management hardware and software, food safety solutions, and task management software. The hospitality segment touts strong, long-term relationships with McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), YUM! Brands (NYSE:YUM), Subway, Hardee's/Carl's Jr, Carnival (NYSE:CCL), Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR), Starwood Hotels (HOT), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), and Wegmans. This segment represents 63% of revenues, but had over $5 million in operating losses in FY 2013.PAR Technology's second segment, which represents 37% of revenues, provides Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) technologies to U.S. federal agencies (including the Department of Defense). Services offered to the government include communications and operational support, signal and image processing, and command and control applications. Although the government segment is smaller by revenues it is growing faster than the hospitality segment and is vastly more profitable.Recent Historical ContextOverall, PAR Technology has grown revenues at a 1.3% compound annual growth rate from FY 2005 through Q3 2014 (TTM). From the beginning of that year through the end of last week (12/19/14), however, the company has lost over 25% in market price, adjusted for stock split. In addition, the company has only been profitable on a U.S. GAAP basis in five out of the last 10 fiscal years. Yet, despite that performance and a total of only $1.27 million of net income over the past 10 years, PAR executives and directors have managed to pay themselves well over $22 million.Beyond that, from 1996 to 2005, the company even provided several personal loans (including a home loan), using company funds in excess of $600,000, to former CEO Charles Constantino and executive Albert Lane. For those familiar with Furmanite and Sangwoo ""Bill"" Ahn led boards, this level of value destruction and personal enrichment at the expense of owners is common. Fortunately, for PAR shareholders, Mr. Ahn and his associate ""professional board members"" Kevin Jost and James Simms did not stand for reelection at this year's annual meeting. Whether or not this move was externally motivated is based upon speculation. Unfortunately, however, long time CFO Ron Casciano has become CEO and antics such as paying for an executive's apartment are still taking place.Operational DifficultiesAside from the management and corporate governance issues, PAR's primary operations are in an extremely competitive and quickly evolving industry. Though POS and hospitality management systems have been in existence for quite a while, recent advancements in mobile technology, interconnectivity, and cloud/software as a service (Saas) platforms have left even the most sophisticated legacy systems to play catch-up. In recent years we have seen the introduction mobile app payment and prepayment (e.g. Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) app, Taco Bell pre-order/pay app, etc.), proximity payment (NFC, e.g. Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL)), and mobile POS terminals (e.g. Square Register). Though many of these technologies can simply be add-ons to traditional POS platforms, they are often being used as an entry point to implement a company's own alternative platform. This inevitably leads to increasing competition in the space. Beyond traditional competitors such as NCR (NYSE:NCR), Panasonic (OTCPK:PCRFY), and Micros (now Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)), PAR is facing-off against offerings from Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), HP (NYSE:HPQ), VeriFone (NYSE:PAY), and PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY). Even where PAR is winning, margins have been driven down to a point where the company has been unable to make a return on capital anywhere near their cost of capital for much of the past decade. Put another way: PAR Technology has over 50,000 installed systems worldwide and yet has a cumulative operating loss of $13.3 million in the Hospitality Segment over the last two fiscal years. Implications for valuation: low operating margins and return on capital lower than cost of capital for the foreseeable future.At least partially due to competitive pressures, PAR Technology's R&D spending has also contributed more to poor financial results than to highly profitable product development. While one could argue that PAR's R&D spending has resulted in sophisticated platforms such as EverServ ® and ATRIO™ that are world class, the financial returns have been anything but good. Based upon an analysis of R&D spending, using a product cycle of 3-7 years, return on capital spent has been between 8.01%-2.65%. Though this is well above the company's often negative traditional return on capital, it is still well below the company's cost of capital. Unfortunately, the company seems to be unaware or unconcerned with the lack of R&D efficiency, as they continue to commit increasing amounts of capital to support ATRIO™ while refusing to answer the most basic questions about expected returns, product lifecycles, or refresh schedules. Implications for valuation: continued low return on capital and increased likelihood of spending on acquisitions.Paths ForwardGiven the context of PAR Technology's recent history, operational difficulties, and continued competition, it may be difficult to see a path to prosperity for the company. However, with new board level leadership and some level of creativity, there are still several options for PAR to create shareholder value.First and foremost, PAR Technology seems to finally be taking board leadership and independence seriously. Gone are ""professional board members"" (defined as individuals who do little more than occupy board seats for a living while offering little contribution to the value of the companies), and in their place are directors with relevant experience and expertise. For instance, Paul Eureck has substantial software and entrepreneurial experience, specifically related to POS systems. John Barsanti's role at Crane was also related to POS systems within their Payment and Merchandising segment. Finally, Todd Tyler's role at Battery Ventures is related to assessing SaaS opportunities. None of the three appear to have any prior relationship or allegiance to Bill Ahn. If this board is willing to lead strategically and keep the previous regime's executives under control, the company may have a chance to improve. Implications for valuation: gradual improvement of return on capital as the company improves product offerings.Perhaps the most obvious possibility to create shareholder value has already been floated by Lee Matheson of Broadview Capital Management: split the company. The company's Government segment and Hospitality segment currently have little overlap and have fairly easily separable assets and liabilities. The better scenario would likely be to sell the Government segment outright. As that segment is performing fairly well, the chances of receiving a premium are far more likely than if the company were to divest the Hospitality unit. In addition the remaining Hospitality segment could then be restructured with more focus, merged with another company (along with its significant federal and state NOLs), or be liquidated in a controlled manner. I will further analyze the split company scenario in the valuation section.If the company splits or remains intact, the focus still needs to be on improving operations of the Hospitality segment. Though little information has been provided as to financial position of Brink (the company refuses to answer any related questions), the acquisition certainly brings substantial improvement to PAR's cloud POS offerings. In addition, it plays into PAR's announced strategy of shifting toward more recurring revenue opportunities. If the company is also able to obtain efficiencies in R&D, these strategic shifts are likely to result in greater shareholder returns over time. However, if should be noted that these are all very nebulous strategic moves with little evidence of what their ultimate outcome will be. Implications for valuation: slowly improving return on capital.Valuation and PricingDue to the apparent transition and possible background activism taking place at PAR Technology, it is easy for investors and traders to paint whatever picture suits their purpose. With shares up over 40% already since the new board took over, discipline must be exercised when converting a narrative to value and price going forward. To that end, I used a perpetual growth discounted free cash flow to the firm model and two relative pricing methods. In this section I will not only explain my methodology, but also the details and assumptions that connect my view of the company and its end markets to valuation.Intrinsic ValuationFor the intrinsic valuation of PAR Technology, I used a three-stage (growth, transition, perpetual/terminal) discounted free cash flow to the firm's model based on revenue growth and target operating margins. The company's operating cash flows were valued as a going concern and discounted back at an estimated cost of capital. Cash was added back, and debt (including operating leases), deferred compensation, and employee options were subtracted out to arrive at a total value of equity. Total equity value was then divided by the current number of shares outstanding to arrive at a price per share.Base Year Inputs and AdjustmentsIn order to get an idea of PAR's true operating earnings, I was required to adjust for a few non-recurring items, such as separation and legal costs. I did not, however, add back stock-based compensation as the company has a habit of doing when reporting non-GAAP earnings. I also added rental income to operating earnings because it is a cash flow generated from the company's headquarters (and thus, not a standalone, separate asset). Beyond that, the only inputs requiring some degree of normalization were acquisitions and working capital. In addition, I converted operating leases to debt, as they are interest bearing obligations, and capitalized R&D (4 year straight-line amortization). The reasoning behind this adjustment is that R&D is actually a capital expense, as it creates a long-term benefit/intangible asset for the company. The effect is twofold: 1) Operating income is increased due to reduced expenses, and 2) the capital base is adjusted to reflect the R&D asset. The net effect on cash flows is neutral, but the adjustment does demonstrate how effective R&D has been in terms of return on investment (and long-term benefit as the company itself asserts). As mentioned earlier, for PAR Technology, return on research and development spending was less efficient than traditional capex and well below the company's cost of capital.Cost of CapitalFor many practitioners, deriving the cost of capital, or discount rate, is a menial task requiring only the use of a generic, intuitive, historical, or outsourced number. However, as the discount rate can have a substantial impact on valuation, I prefer to spend a fair amount of time on this component in order to add forward-looking granularity and specificity to the process. That said, I use a modified, forward-looking CAPM, which is far from perfect (after all, it is only one potential tool) and is not to be taken as an exact science or precise number. In order to find a market-neutral cost of capital, I use the following process: First, for the cost of equity, I derive a market-implied risk premium based on normalized existing cash flows (market dividends and buybacks), current risk-free rate, and current top-down projected growth of market earnings. In addition, I add a country risk spread for the revenues derived from outside of mature markets. Next, I use a bottom-up business beta from comparable companies within the integrated hardware/software systems, business services, financial transactions, and defense sub-industries and lever the beta to PAR's own adjusted debt-to-equity ratio. The reason for the business beta is simple: standard regression betas for any single company contain large standard errors, rendering them close to useless on a standalone basis. Multiplying the equity risk premium by the computed beta and adding it to the risk-free rate sums to a total cost of equity.Because PAR is not rated by any of the major ratings agencies, I had to create a synthetic rating based on the Standard & Poor's methodology, which heavily weighted to country risk, industry risk, competitive position, cash flow, and leverage. Obviously this is imperfect, but there were few other options since there is no public market for PAR Technology's debt. With that said, I calculated a B-rating and assigned the appropriate risk spread based upon that rating. Cost of equity and cost of debt are then weighted according to the market values of equity and debt (including capitalized operating leases). Shown below are the calculations.Revenue Growth and Target Operating MarginsIn order to estimate revenue growth and operating margins over the next ten years for PAR Technology, I had to account for overall economic growth (2-3%), retail POS growth (.9-1%), primary end market franchise growth (particularly MCD and YUM), increasing competition, the company's own products and advancements, and the company's history. In the end, I assumed that PAR will be able maintain current market share, make some conversions to a recurring revenue model, and be able to achieve growth in food safety as it becomes increasingly important in more countries. Therefore, I am using a 2-4% compound annual revenue growth rate for the next 10 years. In addition to more recurring revenue, I am assuming that SG&A (including R&D) will be tightened and lead to a gradual improvement in operating margins to 4-6%. In order to determine reinvestment requirements based on growth and operating margins, I used a weighted industry average sales/capital ratio and gradually moved PAR to that level of efficiency (3.75). Keep in mind, this could change drastically if PAR decides to become a more aggressive acquirer. Also, I am making no attempt to narrow down specific growth rates during specific years. What matters is the overall growth.Terminal InputsIn traditional DCF valuations, the terminal value carries much of the weight. However, if done correctly, there are substantial caps that keep the terminal value from getting out of control and over-inflating (or deflating) the valuation. Mathematically, for instance, a perpetual growth rate for any individual company cannot exceed the growth rate of the overall economy. Empirically, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond is a more accurate proxy for the long-term growth rate than economists' projections. Though it's still not perfect, it's better than simply making up a number. Based largely on history and reasons already discussed, I do not believe that PAR Technology can maintain pace with the overall economy. Therefore, I assumed a perpetual growth rate at roughly two-thirds of the overall projected GDP growth.Far more important than the perpetual growth rate are the perpetual cost of capital and return on capital assumptions. For cost of capital, I assumed partial reversion to the mean, moved the equity risk premium half way toward the long-term, adjusted geometric average (U.S.) of 4.61%, and maintained the existing country risk spread. I lowered the current beta of 1.17 to 1.11 as more stable businesses tend to trade closer to the overall market. For the cost of debt, I improved the current debt rating by one notch and applied the current B risk spread to the half-way point between the current 10-year risk free rate and long-term median value of 3.87%. I also increased the debt ratio slightly to 20%, reflecting my belief that the company will have limited access to substantially increased debt. Additionally, I used a long-term marginal tax rate of 35%, as the company is likely to repatriate most, but not all earnings obtained from outside of the U.S. This resulted in a total cost of capital in perpetuity of 7.27%.In perpetuity, I believe that PAR Technology has almost no competitive advantages in an industry that has minimal barriers to entry (if this is in doubt, look at the new entrants in the last 5 years alone). Therefore, I am being optimistic and assuming the company will find a way to earn a return on capital roughly equal to its cost of capital, even though this is not currently the case.Cleaning UpIn addition to valuing the operating assets of PAR, I needed to clean up for employee stock based compensation and deferred compensation. Because employee options represent both an equity claim and future cost to the company, I needed to subtract the value from the operating value of the company. I used a modified Black-Scholes method, data from the company's 2013 10-K, and sourced volatility and interest rates for the calculation. In addition, I subtracted the reported deferred compensation liability from the total equity value.My final, base-case, intrinsic value for PAR Technology's equity after adding back cash and subtracting debt, employee options, and deferred compensation is $82 million, or $5.28/share.Although this valuation is based on assumptions of a fairly strong turnaround, I recognize there is a fairly wide range of potential outcomes here. Therefore, I included alternative valuations in the table below.Split Company ScenarioOn page 75 of PAR Technology's 2013 10-K is a fairly detailed breakdown of the company's two segments. Although, it does not provide every detail needed for a complete intrinsic valuation, it does provide enough, along with subsequent 10-Qs and some reasonable assumptions, to get an adequate estimate. For the Government segment, I used current margins and return on assets as a guide for growth. Depreciation and capital spending were provided and debt and R&D were primarily used to support the Hospitality segment. In addition, operating leases attributable to each segment were estimated from the information provided on page 23 of the same 10-K. Cost of capital was greatly reduced for the standalone Government sector due to a more favorable assumed debt rating, lower sector beta, and lower debt-to-equity. In cleaning up, I split the employee options and deferred compensation liability evenly between the two segments, even though most of this would likely remain with the Hospitality segment. Put together, my rough estimate for the standalone government sector is $79 million.For the hospitality segment, I went through a similar process of ""nursing the company back to health"" as in the base case. I assumed a 2% revenue growth rate without the Government segment and a target margin of 4.5%. As mentioned, most of the debt, operating leases, and R&D expenses stayed with the Hospitality segment, which consequently raised the debt ratio, risk, and cost of capital for the standalone company. In addition, PAR's substantial NOL asset is primarily attributable to the Hospitality segment. Because this segment on a standalone basis represents far more risk than the company as a whole or the Government segment, I also factored in the probability of default for B-rated companies (30.5% for one standard deviation below the mean). This resulted in a total equity value for the Hospitality segment of roughly $28.6 million. In summation, based on my estimates, PAR Technology is worth roughly 31% more if it is broken up.PricingRelative pricing (aka the use of pricing multiples) is different than valuation in the sense that pricing is based on similar assets or something else external to the company, while valuation is based on the risk-adjusted cash flows of the company itself. Both methods are useful, depending on the perspective that you take. For example, if you take the perspective of buying shares to later ""flip"" to some other buyer, pricing is more relevant. Conversely, if you take the perspective of ownership in the company, valuation is more relevant.For relative pricing, I used two methods. In the first, I used PAR Technology's own historical high and low PE ranges over the past 10 years, and multiplied the median values of each range by a weighted average forward EPS estimate. The estimate is based on the current analysts' ranges (as limited as they are) in order to reduce my own bias and to introduce current market expectations into the process. Some caveats to this pricing method: 1) the company was only profitable in 5 of the last 10 years, so the historical PE dataset is relatively small, and 2) limited availability of analyst EPS estimates creates a higher range of error.The second pricing method was necessarily more rigorous than the historical PE method. In this method, I used a multiple regression analysis designed to control for differences across comparable companies (as opposed to the opinion-based multiple applications you are likely to see elsewhere). In this method, I compared various price ratios (P/E, P/S, EV/EBITDA, etc.) and inputs (growth, operating margins, return on equity, etc.), and was able to identify which factors were most important to the overall market in pricing the comparable companies. These factors were then used in the regression equation to predict at which percentile rank the company's stock should trade based on its own fundamental characteristics, and thus the appropriate multiple. For PAR Technology, I used a relatively wide scope comp group made up of companies within the integrated hardware/software systems, business services, financial transactions, and defense sub-industries. I found that the price/sales ratio was primarily tied to operating margin, return on equity, market cap, and debt ratio. Although, I do realize that price to sales is an internally inconsistent multiple, it showed the strongest predictive power upon analysis.In addition, the price/book ratio was also tied to return on equity and operating margins, though it did not have the statistical power that the price/sales ratio had.In the weighting of the different pricing methods, I gave the regression-based methods a higher weight than the historical PE, because the regression partially controls for real differences across firms. In addition the historical method was built on far less data. Note that I gave the P/S and P/B regressions equal weight because the P/S prediction is over double the current price and the intrinsic value, which I find somewhat unrealistic.ConclusionPAR Technology is a company in transition. After decades of poor performance and weak board level leadership, the company's shareholders finally have a glimmer of hope. With the sudden departure of former CEO Paul Domorski and longtime board members Ahn, Jost, and Simms there is substantial speculation that there is some level of stealth shareholder activism taking place. Though there is no official evidence of such actions, it would certainly be welcomed by those who have followed this company and the abysmal track record of those former board members (not just at PAR). That said, the industry in which PAR operates is extremely competitive, fragmented, and rapidly evolving. Shareholders and potential shareholders should not become overly optimistic on the ultimate value of the company. Given current information and my own assumptions, price and valuation suggest the company is currently fairly valued. There are scenarios that may present upside from speculation in PAR Technology. However, it would be just that: speculation with a high degree of remaining risk. For those with a low tolerance for risk, there are many better options. For those that can stomach the risk, PAR may be worth a shot.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."

It does have another business, providing ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) technologies to U.S. federal government. It has been a rough few years for the company:PAR Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsStagnating revenues and problems reaching profitability. However, as you can see, 2017 showed signs of some improvement; the fall back to a loss in Q4 is the result of the changes in tax policy. From the Q4CC:On a non-GAAP basis, the company broke even (a loss of $59K).Investors don't seem to be discouraged by this as they have bid up the shares quite a bit recently:Taking a longer term perspective is also interesting:From mid-2016, there is an uptrend in the share price. Fellow SA contributor Tim Insko has argued that previous management has not managed the company as well as it could have and has rewarded itself some pretty generous compensation packages, all approved by a particularly friendly board.This hasn't been the only problem; the POS industry is very competitive and faces rapid technological change. Three developments have improved the situation:The strategy shift seems to be generating some results. From the Q4CC (our emphasis):While this constitutes really significant progress, the picture isn't all rosy. Its food safety and digital task management solution business (SureCheck) disappointed in 2017, and management is shifting investments from this business to Brink (even if its two large anchor customers provide significant recurring revenues).In their IRS business, they are shifting focus from the low margin PMO (program management office) to higher yielding intel solutions business. The latter grew by 79% in the quarter - quite a result.The government business has a $111M backlog and could be a candidate for monetization, which is an interesting idea and would enable the company to focus entirely on the development of Brink.Overall recurring revenue (software and hardware support contracts) was up by 7.1% y/y, despite a 20.8% decrease in product revenue, mainly due to the completion of a major customer order in Q4 2016.SaaS revenue from Brink and SureCheck increased 90% y/y, and the company exited Q4 with $7.5M of annual recurring revenue from SaaS contracts.PAR Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe government business operating margin increased 55% y/y to 12.8%, although management expects this year to be in the normal range of 8-10%.Overall, gross margins aren't really trending, although there was some upturn last year.Margins are likely to improve as the company announced plans in reducing headcount, creating operating savings of some $3.5M.PAR Cash from Operations  (TTM) data by YChartsFrom the Q4CC:Of the $5.1M CapEx for 2017, there were significant investments in technology systems such as an ERP system. When these are completed, cash flow will receive a boost.PAR PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsValuation has crept up, but with a clean balance sheet, the EV/S multiple is where you would expect. Last year's (non-GAAP) EPS was $0.26, down from $0.33 in 2016, and the company doesn't provide guidance. The earnings multiple is steep, of course.There are a number of signs the company is on the mend. There is very solid growth in large parts of the company, most notably Brink bookings in Q4, which were related to three of its largest customers.SaaS revenue increased by 90% and the government's intel business grew by 79%. The big uncertainty is whether this growth can be sustained and how this will play out in terms of earnings and cash flow.We need a couple of quarters to assess this as the company doesn't provide guidance, but given the rise in the share price recently, at least some investors see the opportunity. We see it too, but with the aforementioned caveats.The company also has the interesting option to sell all, or parts of its government related business, which would allow it to invest more heavily in Brink."

At night I read the Harry Potter series to my six-year-old daughter. We are currently on book six. J.K. Rowling has turned a story about an orphan boy into an all-encompassing world. It is not simply the twisting plot that has kept our attention; it is how she tells the story. There are not fights, there are epic battles. Characters are not simply good or bad, they are epically good or bad. There is a wizarding world with its own language, customs, and social structure. In my opinion, anybody who can keep a six-year-old's attention for 2,500 pages and counting (without pictures!) deserves to be a billionaire.In the stock market, it is often ""the story"" that can drive changes in share price. Sometimes there are companies (such as Enron or Theranos) that are all story and no product. These, of course, are dangerous investment setups. From an investment perspective, it can be far more attractive when companies are just starting to effectively tell their story. It is far easier and less capital intensive for a company with strong products that resonate with customers to improve communications and positioning than it is to have strong communications but weak products. Often, with improved storytelling comes multiple expansion. For example, the PE ratio may go from 8 to 12, and even though the fundamentals of the company have not changed, the share price has increased 50%. Outsized returns come from revenue growth, margin expansion, and multiple expansion. A path to multiple expansion helps.I first became aware of PAR Technology (NYSE:PAR) a few years ago when Travis Cocke of Voss Capital laid out the collection of company assets in great detail. (Full disclosure: the Greenhaven Road Partners Fund is invested in Voss.) He clearly had found a ""50 cent dollar."" I just could not get comfortable with the management team. The founder's daughter was the CEO, and, in my opinion, the management and execution risks outweighed the siren song of assets selling at a discount.PAR Technology was started more than 40 years ago and is a hodgepodge of assets today. The original defense contracting business, near a military base in upstate New York, generates cash that has funded other businesses. There is also a technology hardware business that has been around since the 1970s when PAR's founder, John Sammon, created point of sale (POS) hardware systems for McDonald's. The company did a good job of growing its POS hardware business and has significant penetration in the largest fast food restaurants such as McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell, Subway, and Jack in the Box. Still, this type of hardware business is mediocre, as it is lower margin and ""chunky"" because there are long replacement cycles for the systems. If this was that the sum of PAR Technology, it is highly unlikely that we would invest.However, in 2014, the previously-mentioned founder's daughter had the foresight to purchase a small California-based company called Brink that developed a cloud-based POS software system for restaurants. While POS hardware is a low margin, one-sale-every-few-years-type business, the cloud-based POS software business has high-margin recurring revenue.At the time of the acquisition, Brink had approximately 400 installed units. Fast forward to the end of 2018, and the company has compounded installs by more than 100% a year to 7,700 units. Notably, this growth came with minimal resources, zero logo churn, and without converting any of their legacy hardware customers to the cloud-based Brink software.Last year, at the urging of Adam Wyden of ADW Capital, I looked at PAR Technology again. (Full disclosure: the Partners Fund is also invested in ADW.) Again, I could not get there. It was almost as if the PAR was hiding the software business - there was no investor presentation mentioning Brink. At the product level, there was also untapped low-hanging fruit for the company to grab, such as incorporating payments (credit card processing) into the Brink System. While many POS systems such as Square, LightSpeed, or Toast actually make the majority of their revenue off of their payments business, PAR has none.There was an enormous amount of potential in the software business, but it was not clear whether PAR could or would realize it. The company was being led by a manager in his 70s with decades of experience in the defense industry but none in software. While competitors were financing their software companies with mounds of capital, PAR was restricted to the cash its defense business was generating. In summary, the company was under-resourced, had the wrong CEO, and a history of poor capital allocation decisions that had effectively led to zero investor returns since going public decades ago.In today's stock market, the majority of shares are purchased by computers that scan press releases and use quantitative data. PAR's earnings releases had no breakout of the software business. The only time the company even discussed Brink was on the earnings calls where one could triangulate the unit's installation and revenue growth. At a time when SAAS businesses are getting very attractive multiples of sales, PAR's management was not breaking out any of the company's metrics, failing to tell the story of their software business in the language of software investors. They were treating Brink more like an asbestos liability than the crown jewel. I was concerned that the opportunity would never be properly articulated and more importantly never executed on. I passed again. Fast forward a few more months when, at the urging of ADW Capital and others, PAR's CEO retired and was replaced by interim CEO Savneet Singh. Savneet had recently joined the Board of Directors as an experienced software investor and an operator. The hiring of Savneet was the turning point.Savneet got to work very quickly. For the first time in years, PAR (Savneet) presented at an investor conference. In his first interaction with investors at the Needham Investors Conference, he touted Brink as the crown jewel of the company. He correctly stated that, historically, PAR had been run as a hardware business that happened to have a software asset, but going forward, the emphasis would be on building the software business. He also said they would launch a payments product in the second half of the year and laid out math that showed that payments could in fact be the biggest part of the business over time. The company laid off 8% of the corporate staff to free up dollars for Brink.Savneet was saying all the right things; however, at this time he was still in an interim role and faced significantly better-resourced competitors. Thus PAR joined our portfolio as a ""starter"" position. Near the end of the first quarter, Savneet was made the permanent CEO, and shortly thereafter the company announced a $60m convertible senior notes offering at attractive terms. The change in management and improved resources substantially de-risked the situation, and we increased our investment.So what have we bought? Brink Software can be used by almost any restaurant, but the company is focused on larger quick service and fast casual chains. In fact, Brink is the only proven enterprise cloud POS solution that has successfully integrated a large scale, multi-unit chain. The POS system is the spine of these larger chains, interfacing with inventory management, loyalty programs, accounting, payroll, and, increasingly, food delivery platforms such as Uber Eats and Seamless. For a large chain, building all of these connections is complex, time consuming, and important. Brink has been very successful penetrating and retaining such customers, including Five Guys, Arby's, and Sweetgreen. The investor deck lays out a lot of the details. There are opportunities to expand internationally and, to date, the large hardware customers still have yet to upgrade to cloud-based solutions. When these massive organizations do decide to upgrade, the only cloud-based system to ever sign up a 1,000 location+ restaurant will at least be in the conversation.So, what are we paying for Brink? What could it look like? Our cost basis is in the low $20s. There are 16M shares outstanding, a government business that is likely worth in excess of $100M and a hardware business that is worth something north of $50M, plus as a hodgepodge of other assets, which means we paid on the order of $200M for Brink Software. But what could it be worth? There were 7,700 software installations at the end of 2018 with average recurring revenue per location of $1,870. If you run the math, we paid a lot for Brink… call it 14X trailing recurring revenue. No, I did not put a decimal in the wrong place. However, given the stated backlog, recent customer wins including Dairy Queen (7,000 locations), and the forthcoming introduction of the payments business, this is a forward-looking business. I believe there is a very tangible path to almost tripling locations to 20,000 by the end of 2020.There is also a straightforward path to substantially increasing ARPU (Average Revenue per User), led by the expected rollout of the new payments product. Channel checks have indicated that Dairy Queen locations will be paying a substantially higher per-user costs as well, so ARPU will rise as they are blended into the base. With a much larger base of stores and a higher ARPU, very rough math gets us to less than 4X next year's revenue for Brink for a company that will still be growing 100% and have just increased ARPU 50%+. SAAS companies growing on the order of 100% per year with rising ARPU trade for much higher than 4X revenue. Lightspeed, which just recently completed its IPO in Canada, sports a valuation of roughly 30x run-rate revenue with inferior growth to Brink!Yes, there is execution risk here, but the product is built and the pipeline is built. Unfortunately, due to the lack of disclosures, the extraneous defense business, and other holdings, PAR Technology is not viewed as a software company today. I believe that Savneet will both simplify the corporate structure by selling or spinning off the defense business and explicitly lay out the Brink SAAS business. For those interested in learning more about Savneet's background and getting a sense for how strong of a communicator he is - and how he is likely to approach the CEO role - Patrick O'Shaugnessey's podcast provides an excellent foundation, as does his presentation at the Roth conference.Over time, I think PAR's business will be helped by the new products such as payments, increased investments in software, and reduced lead times for installation. Over time, I think the multiple will be helped by a communications strategy that includes spoon-feeding investors key metrics, allowing PAR to easily be compared to other more richly-valued software companies. Savneet may not be J.K. Rowling, but unlike his predecessors who were silent about their greatest asset, sometimes just talking is enough."
4202758,21815,2018-08-29T06:00:57-04:00,"The share price exploded whilst revenues and profits evaporated, but we think the shares could still be significantly undervalued.The company has a gem of a SaaS business that is growing like weed and will probably continue to do so for quite some time.A private financing deal at a competitor shows what kind of valuations that business could fetch.Questions remain as to what management intends to do in terms of speeding up growth and, perhaps even more importantly, merchant payments.","In previous articles, we noted some apparent disconnect between the booming share price of PAR Technology (NYSE:PAR) and actual revenue and operational metrics. The company's share price is absolutely booming:But at first sight, this isn't supported by any revenue or profit growth. In fact, quite the opposite:PAR Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsWe don't think we have ever seen such a glaring contrast between the stock price and developments in revenue and profits. Yet, we will argue that the company could actually be significantly undervalued.However, for PAR Technology investors, this is no mystery, of course:The SaaS platform was started with the acquisition of The Brink in 2014. It has taken quite a bit of time to get going, but going they are right now.The company has three businesses:The growth and reason for the share price explosion is the SaaS platform growth. Here are some numbers:Here is the market company management is targeting (from the Q2CC, our emphasis):Basically, the target of 30K installations is just 10% of the market. There are also hardware installations related to Brink, $2.6 million in Q2 (up 13% y/y) and some software-related service income (another $2.3 million, up 66% y/y).The company has more potential SaaS gems:Neither is generating significant revenues yet (Pay was only introduced this quarter), but there is considerable potential here, especially in Pay.Adam Wyden, the analyst from ADW Capital, points out that a venture capital deal for competitor Toast is putting some really big multiples on that company.The Toast valuation: $115 million; selling 8% of the company gives it $1.4 billion of market cap and valuing the company at 15 times its revenue. Here is Wyden (from the Q2CC):So basically, Toast is valued at $140K per unit, which is bizarre (but it is growing very fast, so that will come down), and it's certainly a multiple of PAR's valuation, even including all its other businesses.The target for PAR by its management is 30,0000-34,000 of installments by year-end 2020. The company earns roughly $2000 per installments in SaaS recurring yearly revenues, which would be $70 million.A valuation anywhere near the one that Toast just got would put the company above $1 billion in market cap, which compares rather oddly with the $360 million market cap it has today.Merchant processing is an even bigger opportunity. It generates a take on payments, which is 50-60 basis points for every dollar that is processed. The average money flowing through per terminal is roughly $1.5 million.Assuming just half of the terminals take this up (at competitor Toast, the uptake is 100%), that's 15,000 terminals x $7,500 per year per terminal in fees, which is $112.5 million in SaaS annual recurring revenues.And then there is PAR Pay, which is an add-on module for The Brink. Pay fetches $40 MRR, which is $480 a year per box. If the uptake is just half of Brink installations, that's another 15,000 x $480= $7.2 million a year in SaaS revenues, or another $100 million+ in valuation.Summing it up, taking 10K installments at the end of 2018 and 30K at the end of 2020 and taking only a 50% uptake of Pay and merchant processing:But there is one big difference between Toast and Brink. Toast is already doing merchant processing at 100% attach rates, which is a big difference from PAR, even if it has an opportunity here as well, but management was a bit non-committal (from the Q2CC):So this creates some doubt as to what kind of multiple the company could fetch if it did a financing. Probably not the 15x sales multiple of Toast, with its 100% payments attach rate.What's more, we have assumed a 50% attach rate, but even that might be too optimistic given the fairly non-committal comments of management quoted above.On the other hand, the company is generating income as a referral partner, and that income could very well rise if it becomes a retail ISO (independent sales organization).Putting a 10x sales multiple on the $180 million gets the company to a $1.8 billion valuation, but with a lower attachment rate this could drop significantly. With a zero attachment rate it's $670 million, but that's still twice the market cap of the whole company.And there are also ways we might underestimate its revenue generating potential. The company is targeting big restaurant chains for its Brink sales, and there are additional international installations which could be as big in the end.And there is SureCheck, and whatever other modules and functionality it manages to add. After all, this is a SaaS platform - a Swiss army knife type of business model.Now, there are a number of questions which become especially pertinent as PAR's competitor, Toast, is trying to accelerate its implementation (it is already growing very fast with 2017 revenues up 150%).There is no doubt that PAR Technology is making significant progress, but the company is doing this on a shoestring (it has just $600K in operational cash flow), as it uses the cash generated by its other business to fund the growth in Brink.But given Toast's assault on the market, we like to see things speeding up, which requires resources. There are three options here:The government business is a good business in its own right. It actually had a good quarter - revenues were up 22% to $17.7 million, with contract backlog at a record $111 million.The hardware business actually shrank because of the lapping of a one-off large installation (and this will disappear from the figures in the next quarter), but it is also complementary to Brink.There are numerous good reasons to go this way:Most of these points were actually raised at the Q2CC (and even the Q1CC), but management remained frustratingly non-committal. ""We hear you"" was the most common answer, although at one stage, management responded with a rather mysterious comment (from the Q2CC):And there was also some good news:So the company is at least talking to potential customers representing twice its ambitious installation number for the end of 2020, even if it's not going to close all of these accounts.But the question remains, does PAR Technology have the resources for such an enormous task?At first sight, it's somewhat bizarre that a company which has experienced a veritable share price explosion whilst its revenues and profits actually went south can still be called undervalued, but that should be fairly obvious after reading the above.While growth in Brink is very substantial, we think that more can be done here, as the company is quite constrained in terms of resources, and new installations requires resources, most notably installers and other service people.Given the type of money a competitor managed to get for selling just a fraction of its business, we think raising money at the subsidiary level makes the most sense, although selling the government business would also do.Raising money will probably have the additional benefit of putting a valuation on Brink that will be considerably beyond what the whole of PAR fetches on the market these days. It would provide management with the resources to speed installations up (also of PAR Pay) and keep competitors at bay as this turns out to be a rather brutal land grab.Management should make clear what its intentions are with respect to merchant payments though, as here lies another big opportunity, in our view.In any case, we think the shares are still worthy of a buy at present levels."

        It's under regulatory investigation.
        Two customers make up nearly 50% of revenues.
        TTM, cash from financing is outstripping cash from ops.
        This name, in my opinion, just isn't worth the risk.","As I was reading Par Technology's (PAR) recent earnings call, something caught my eye--namely, this innocuous-sounding Q&A (italics added).Despite the fact that more companies - like Google (GOOG) are refusing to provide guidance, it is still standard practice. Tesla (TSLA) gives guidance. FirstData (FDC), provider of POS system Clover, gives guidance. Many biotech companies, like Puma (NYSE:PBYI), give guidance. It's acceptable, I think, for a company to forego guidance it is has a history of transparency.PAR is not one such company.Indeed, PAR continues to be under investigation for ""violat[ing] federal securities laws by issuing materially false and misleading statements regarding the company's business and operations."" As it states in 2016 10-K:Unfortunately, this investigation hasn't been resolved, and it is still ongoing as of year-end 2017:In my opinion, this puts shareholders in a risky position. Even if the news is ""good,"" anytime a company is under investigation for misleading statements, the news is never really good. However the coin falls, it is hard to imagine the company coming away with its reputation intact. I believe it would be wise for investors to be wary. My second problem with PAR is its over-reliance on only a couple of customers. Look at its customer base, as it describes in its recent 10-K:Source: Company FilingsThe fact that two of its customers account for over 47% of its revenues is something of which investors should be wary. Relying on a couple of major clients for a significant portion of its sales is a risk: it is easy for a company to become too dependent on those small clients. In my opinion, this leads to a couple of major issues:These are risks that anyone considering PAR should carefully consider. This is particularly true when we take note of the little fact that it makes no money.In light of its dependence on two customers, the risk of its large customers defecting is even greater considering PAR makes no money and has barely been out of the red since 1985.In fact, as the chart above shows, it is actually earning less than it did back in 1985. This is in spite of enjoying 291% growth in revenue over that period. This raises the important question: if 291% TTM revenue growth doesn't translate into earnings growth - or earnings at all - what will?As we can see from the chart below, TTM cash from financing yet again outstrips cash from operations.Cash from financing allows companies to raise cash to maintain operations; cash flow from operations is, obviously, cash brought in through its regular business activities. Right now, it may be that PAR is overly reliant on keeping ops afloat through cash from financing.ConclusionPAR is a company with regulatory concerns, a few large clients that together comprise over 47% of revenues, cash from financing outstripping cash from ops, and it ultimately just doesn't make any money. As such, I recommend that investors stay away from PAR."
1956421,49861,2014-01-22T09:30:00-05:00,,"PAR Technology (NYSE:PAR) has had a rough go at developing its software business, which has put pressure on its stock as it has been unable to reach profitability. But 2014 is a key year for this business; it will be the year in which the company is either successful in implementing its software technology, or chooses to cut down its investment in this segment. But when we take a look at the value of the company's pieces, we see that investors have already discounted all of the value out of the software business. As we will show in this article, whether or not the software business is successful, the actions that take place in 2014 will return the company to profitability and help PAR realize a value much higher than its current price. Either the software business will be a success and the company will begin to reach earnings greater than $1 per share, or the company will cut investments in this business, which will return it to profitability and allow it to better realize the value of its two other profitable businesses, which are worth more than the company's current valuation.Business OverviewPAR Technology is a leader in systems and service solutions for the retail and hospitality industries. For more than 30 years, PAR has developed technology solutions for restaurants, hotels, spas, QSRs, entertainment venues, and cruise ships. The company maintains three segments (Products, Services, and Contract), but instead I would like investors to look at it as three different businesses: Legacy Government, Hardware, and Software. We will now get into more detail about each of the individual businesses. The thing I want to point out is that the Government and Hardware business are pretty steady; it's the software business that most of the analysis in this article will concentrate on.Government BusinessPAR's Government business, which represents about a third, or 36%, of the company's revenues, provides a range of technical services for the U.S. Department of Defense and other federal, state, and local governmental organizations. PAR Government Systems Corporation specializes in the development of advanced signal and image processing and management systems, with a focus on geospatial intelligence, geographic information systems, and command and control applications. Additionally, the Company's Rome Research Corporation subsidiary provides information technology, communications, and related services to the U.S. Department of Defense, providing comprehensive operational support worldwide.The Government business is actually how PAR got its start about 35 years ago, and the company has strong relationships in place that create a moat on this business. This is verified by its recent $85MM contract. To further provide support for this business, it is focused on the unmanned aircraft projects, an area in which the government has not cut spending. The company basically sources the technology for the government and takes a fee off this business. It's a steady-eddy $85MM-a year business, in which they make 5%-6% all in margin.There has been talk in the past about the company selling this business. Though I think it will eventually happen in the future, I don't see this happening in the intermediate-term, or at least until the software piece of the business is fixed. They make about $4-5MM a year off this business. Let's look at some of the comps:I am going to use a sales price of 6-8X profits to be conservative and considering it's not very growthy; it's more of a royalty-like stream. This gives me a range of value on this business of $24-$40MM.Hardware BusinessAs a leading vendor of point-of-sale hardware to the QSR market, PAR has developed committed long-term relationships with the industry's three largest organizations, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Yum! Brands (NYSE:YUM), and Subway. The McDonald's business is this segment's moat, as its makes up about half of the revenues in this business and the company has basically worked with MCD since the start of this business. Replacements make up the majority of the business, supported somewhat by new store growth, so it's also pretty steady in nature. Other significant hospitality chains for which PAR is the POS vendor of choice include Baskin-Robbins (NASDAQ:DNKN), Boston Market, CKE Restaurants, and Carnival Cruise Lines (NYSE:CCL).This business makes up about $90MM in sales at a 20% margin, meaning operating income comes in at about $18MM. Let's look at some of the comps:Since this business is only a slow grower and has some more risks than the Government business does, I think that it could be worth 5-6x EBIT, or about $90-$110MM.So overall, we see that these two fairly steady businesses alone could be worth $114-$150MM on a company whose enterprise value is about $70MM. So, what's the discrepancy? It has to do with the company's software business, where big investments in SG&A and R&D have provided basically no value to shareholders. Throughout the rest of this article, we will discuss the merits of the software business, and will show that the company will either realize value in the business by year-end or will chose to cut down its investments and return the overall business to profitability. Either way this turns out, the company will be worth significantly more than its current market value.Software BusinessThe software segment is the most interesting of the company's businesses. Even though this segment is currently losing money, most of the investments necessary have already been made, which means there is significant upside leverage to sales growth.For the food industry, the company's software offerings were designed in order to meet the requirements of different types of vendors including large and small operators, franchisees, and enterprise organizations in the Quick Serve Restaurant, Fast Casual Restaurant, and Table Service Restaurant segments. The EverServ™ software was designed with the intent of enabling customers to configure their technology systems to meet their order entry, food preparation, inventory, and workforce management needs. The new piece of this business, SureCheck, provides food safety monitoring and employee task management capabilities. SureCheck helps measure and store food temperature data. This is very important as it increases the customers' ability to ensure food is safe for customers, and helps provide protection when food safety litigation occurs. There has been some progress in this space, as it recently signed on Wegmans to use the software. In the company's latest earnings call, management noted that Wegmans choose its products after looking at 10 similar ones. Yes, this shows the space is highly competitive, but for a major grocery chain to choose this software after testing out the other products gives credit to the company's investment.For the hospitality industry, PAR's ATRIO software provides guest-centric property management capabilities in a series of fully-integrated modules that manage all aspects of the guest experience, as well as consolidating guest information and history across the operation into a single database. PAR also provides SpaSoft®, the industry's leading Spa Management System (22 of the top 35 star spas in the world use SpaSoft to support their operations). The spa business is a very good one, but the company needs to work on growing the ATRIO product. The company has recently seen more demand for the product, as Embassy Suites is in beta testing for their ATRIO software and has seen early success. In addition, the Ritz Carlton is implementing the software in China, and PAR is seeing additional interest in the Middle East, Europe, and Mexico.So we see that the spa business is pretty good, but the other pieces still need work as I forecast that the company needs to grow revenues by $25MM (not including the new contracts that were recently signed, as pricing has not yet been announced, and based on its current cost structure) in order to reach profitability. Once this occurs, the company should see incremental margins in the 60% range. Most of the investments are in place (and as we will talk about later, are still occurring), so now we will see if they work. Let's now review both two scenarios: if the software business works or if it doesn'tScenario #1 - The Software Business WorksUnder this scenario, PAR announces major contracts for its software technology, finally justifying its long-term investment. These contracts should be announced this year. At the end of the year, the company announces revenue guidance for 2015 of $280MM. Considering that most of the SG&A necessary to ramp this business is already in place, the company sees significant operating leverage, reaching EBIT margins of 7-8%. This translates to 2015 EBITDA of $25MM and earnings of $1.05.When we take a look at competitor valuations, we see that this business would be worth much more if the software business was successful:Using a blended valuation of 1.0x revenue and 15x earnings (I choose not to use the higher multiples because the other pieces of the business are still slow growth) we get a price target of $16, representing about 200% upside.In the long run, this could be a $400MM revenue company that has 10% operating margins. Considering PAR currently only has a value of $70MM, that is quite impressive.Scenario #2 - The Software Business Doesn't Work, Company Responds With Cost CutsPAR management has already noted that 2014 is a key year for the software business. The company has made some major investments in its technology, but has found little success (except for the spa business). After speaking with management, I believe that if major contracts are not announced this year, the company will cut its investment and right-size this business. In this scenario, management guides to about flat revenue guidance of $240MM, but about $15MM lower combined SG&A and R&D. This translates to 2015 EBITDA of $15MM and earnings of $.70.Using a blended valuation of 8x EBITDA and 12x earnings and this steady, profitable business, we get a price target of $8.50, representing about 60% upside. This actually comes in pretty close to the valuations of just the Government and POS businesses.Downside ScenarioAs investors always ask the question ""what can I lose on the downside,"" I wanted to provide a worst-case scenario for the company. In this scenario, the software business, except the spa business, is dissolved, the company loses all of its hardware business besides McDonald's (it has been with MCD for a very long time and has a strong relationship with the company), and maintains its Government business. This gets us to about $5MM of annual run-rate EBITA.Since it is basically like a royalty stream, I am assigning a 10x EBITDA multiple. If we include $5MM of cash on the balance sheet (I am assuming some cash burn as there would be losses before this occurs), this gets us to a value of $55MM, or about $3.75 per share (25% downside).If we look back at the sum of the parts, the valuation would put us near that same level. The Government business would still be worth $24-40MM, and Hardware value would drop to about $20-40MM. Overall, this is an unrealistic scenario, yet it still shows that the upside-to-downside ratio on PAR is quite attractive.RisksRisks for the company include:CatalystsCatalysts for the company include:ConclusionThe success of the software business is yet to be seen, but there has been some recent progress. Whether or not this business works out, I think the company will be worth significantly more by year end. There's more upside if the business works, but there's 60% upside even in a cost-cutting scenario. I believe there is low downside due to the value in the company's other businesses.Disclosure: I am long PAR. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1546162,48501,2013-07-12T10:56:18-04:00,,"PAR Technology Corporation (NYSE:PAR) (PAR or the company) has not had the best financial performance track record over the past 5 years; the net income numbers have been low considering the revenue growth. Thus, the 5-year average valuations are influenced by the subpar operating expense management. If management can lower the cost of revenue or decreases R&D spending and SG&A a total of 200 basis points as a percentage of revenue, the company would command a higher valuation.That said, cash flow from operations could get back to normal this year. Further, the company's new EverServ 7000 series should start to positively impact revenue in 2013 and 2014. Thus, with solid expense management, PAR should earn a higher price/sales and price/book multiple. Additionally, as PAR gains scale through higher revenue, the cost of revenue could decline.I consider this a speculative investment. Consequently, I'm looking for an upside of about $1.70 to $3.70 with risk of $0.70. The risk and reward are calculated from a share price of $4.30. That would put the price/sales ratio at roughly 0.50. The price/book ratio would be about 1.80. The price/earnings ratio would be around 20 (based on the forward price/earnings). Those valuations are if we get $3.70 of upside.As a point of clarification, I define a speculative investment as one that investors use a stop loss level, or an investment that isn't buy and hold. The second point of clarification, the reward/risk ratio is 2.5 at the $1.70 level and 5.3 at the $3.70 level; including a trailing stop loss, this could be an investment with close to a 10 reward/risk ratio. Hence, this is a speculative investment with a great risk/reward.Company ProfilePAR has operations in two distinct business segments: Hospitality and Government.PAR's Hospitality business, representing approximately 64% of consolidated revenue for 2012, provides technology solutions, including hardware, software and a range of support services, to businesses and organizations in the global hospitality industries.PAR's Government business, representing approximately 36% of consolidated revenue for 2012, provides a range of technical services for the U.S. Department of Defense and other federal, state, and local governmental organizations.PAR provides information technology solutions to two markets within its Hospitality Segment: Restaurants and Hotels. As a leading vendor to the Restaurant market, PAR has developed committed long-term relationships with the industry's three largest organizations, McDonald's Corporation, Yum! Brands, Inc., and the SUBWAY franchisees of Doctor's Associates Inc.In the Hotel/Resort/Spa market, PAR, through the company's PSMS subsidiary, is a leading global provider of software solutions for a variety of property types including city-center hotels, destination spa and golf resorts, cruise ships, and casino hotels.Risk FactorsLiquidity and SolvencyWith a company the size of PAR, it is important to check the liquidity and solvency position. The liquidity and solvency position are both solid.At the end of the latest quarter, the current ratio was 2.04. The quick ratio was 1.04. Financial leverage was 1.64 and debt/equity was 0.01.Cash and short-term investments as a percentage of total assets was 11.97%. Intangible assets were 16.25% of total assets.In conclusion, liquidity and solvency should not be an issue with PAR, in the near future.ValuationsIn this instance, a comparison to the S&P 500's valuations would be meaningless. Thus, in this situation, I will use the time series and 5-year average valuations to value the shares of PAR.*Price/Cash Flow uses 3-year average.On a time series basis, PAR is undervalued and heading towards fairly valued. Relative to the 5-year average, PAR is fairly valued. I conclude that par is moderately undervalued. But, as previously mentioned, the last 5 years have not been the best in PAR's history. Thus, the 5-year average valuations are probably skewed to the downside.PAR introduced the EverServ 7000 series, its flagship POS platform, in 2012. I think that will act as a tailwind for revenue growth and net income growth in 2013 and 2014. As a consequence, PAR could command a higher valuation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

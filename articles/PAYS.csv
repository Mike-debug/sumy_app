This could boost the plasma business.Stock is trading at 50x forward earnings which is supported by Street's estimated EPS growth of 33% in 2020e and 50% in 2021e.","PaySign (PAYS) released a strong set of results for 1Q20 with total revenue up 45.7% yoy to $10.6M and gross margin up 2.1 percent to 54.1% which was mainly helped by a favorable mix towards higher-margin programs. As a result, net income increased 76.8% to $1.5M. Breaking down revenue, plasma industry grew 24.8% yoy to $7.3M or 69% of total revenue. Pharma industry is a fast growing segment, registering 120% yoy growth to reach $3M or 28.6% of total revenue.The company loaded $326M to the card compared with $215M, up 52% yoy. Its revenue conversion rate of gross dollar volume loaded on cards was 3.24% compared to 3.38% the prior year. Typically, the first quarter is seasonally its lowest revenue conversion rate and if we look at Q219, revenue conversion rate was in fact 4.21%. As a post quarter indication, the management commented that for April 2020, the preliminary revenue conversion rate was 4.23% which is pretty in line historically.Data by YChartsStrong liquidityConsolidated cash, including restricted cash, has increased $9.3M or 20% to $54.8M compared to $45.6M at year end FY19. If measured by an adjusted current ratio excluding restricted cash and card funding liability, reflected 5.9x coverage compared with 7.9x at year end FY19.The company also returned the funds received from the Paycheck Protection Program as they did not see the need due to their strong financial position.The company now boasts a cardholder base of 3.1M which is up from 2.8M stated late last year. They added 2 pharmaceutical programs to the Patient Affordability business line which now stands at a total of 10 programs, and they also included several pharma and patient affordability programs to the pipeline. The company's plasma pipeline has expanded its coverage to blood and blood product collection centers.In 1Q20, the company did not see much of an effect related to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is beginning to see some effect, especially for plasma, as April numbers were down 15% yoy while pharma continued to be strong.Plasma donors for recovered COVID-19 patients are being recruitedAbout 170 centers have started to recruit recovered COVID-19 patients as convalescent plasma donors for use in possible COVID-19 therapies. These plasma collection centers are generally located in areas with large affected populations. It was mentioned that these donors are being compensated at a significantly higher level than standard plasma donors. This could imply a higher cost and lower gross margin than other plasma lines.Too early to tell regarding this current pandemicThe company is not giving out revenue guidance except that overall 2020 should have continued growth momentum and gross margins similar to that of 2019. I suspect that weak numbers in April with its larger segment, plasma, has had the management be cautious.That said, with the two new program additions, one of which is already live, while the other is about to load up, both programs have already generated some amount of start-up fees.According to market estimates, revenue is expected to grow in the 30-40% range during 2020e and 2021e. EBITDA is estimated to surge ~60% during the same period. And if we look at EPS growth, Street numbers point to 33% yoy growth in 2020e before increasing by 50% yoy in 2021e.These estimates are in line with the fast growth rate of the company, and if we factor in potential market share gains from an ailing competitor which was mentioned on its latest earnings call and that PaySign has had a strong quarter with ample liquidity, these strong growth numbers appear to be feasible.The stock trades at 50x forward P/E with a low of 20x put in during the depth of the broad market sell off late March. The stock recovered mainly due to the company's solid financial position and continued strength in its pharma business. It is worth following to look out for plasma to recover, especially with the inclusion of COVID-19 related plasma therapies in the future.Source: KoyfinSource: KoyfinSource: KoyfinSource: Koyfin"
4384784,105870,2020-11-04T06:59:50-05:00,"Strong payments play focused on the plasma donor end-market with strong historical growth and performance.The company was hit hard by COVID-19, but the long-term thesis is still intact.The valuation is compelling, and >50% upside is possible from this price.","PaySign (PAYS) is a payments company focused primarily on providing prepaid debit card solutions as well as a mobile-first digital banking solution. It initially went public back in 2006 via a reverse merger, and with a subsequent name change in 2019 to PaySign, the company now trades under the ticker symbol PAYS.The core of my thesis is that pre-COVID-19, PaySign was actually performing admirably. From a pure metrics perspective, it showed strong growth in 2019, with Gross Dollar Volume increasing to $859 million from $621 million the year prior, which represents ~38% YoY growth. This has come alongside improved margins, with the company's net profit conversion rate increasing to 0.88% from 0.42% the year prior. In turn, this drove strong EBITDA growth, with the company hitting $7.5 million in EBITDA in 2019 vs. $3.5 million the year prior.However, COVID-19-related headwinds had a massive impact on PaySign, particularly given the plasma donor concentration, with revenues sliding nearly ~26% YoY. Fears of the virus have significantly driven down the volume to these centers, and consequently, have negatively impacted the company's financial performance. Additionally, federal and state stimulus payments have thus far insulated the vulnerable donor base from having to donate plasma to generate cash. As stimulus payments expire, it is likely that we will start seeing an uplift in volume, but the timing and the magnitude of this uplift are still uncertain. But I believe that this dynamic has the potential to lead to a credible re-rate in the stock.Overall, PaySign's customer base consists largely of a variety of corporate and consumer brands that utilize such cards to increase customer engagement and retention. In the corporate realm, the company does have concentration around the pharma industry (~20% of 2019 revenues), where its cards are used to provide co-pay assistance prepaid cards to the eligible patient populations. Although this was the historical focus of PaySign since founding, the company has successfully diversified into other end-markets, which reduces exposure and risk to the pharmaceutical industry.PaySign's largest concentration is around plasma centers, which consist of nearly ~78% of its revenues. In this sector, the company has high penetration (~35% of the plasma collection centers in the US), which I believe demonstrates the utility of the PaySign solution to this growing end-market.Furthermore, the company does have a sizable government business that revolves around public benefits disbursement. Overall, as of the end of December 2019, it had over 3 million cardholders in over 300 card programs.PaySign's tech stack includes a variety of software and proprietary hardware components that covers the whole payments lifecycle from enrollment to transaction processing, to servicing. Its revenue base reflects this full-cycle platform, with the company generating fees from interchange, card management, and transaction fees.As seen below, PaySign was significantly impacted in Q2 by COVID-19-related headwinds, with total revenues dropping from $8.6 million the year prior to just $6.4 million this quarter. Similarly, while last year was profitable, the company has swung to a loss this quarter due to a meaningful decline in top line revenues. Much of this decline was due to softness in the plasma industry, as COVID-19 caused volumes flowing through these centers to materially drop.The key risk here is still COVID-19 given the company's reliance on the plasma industry for a large portion of its revenues. As we have seen YTD, volumes through these centers can be severely impacted by donor's concern around the virus, as well as federal stimulus payments, which have helped supplement the cash needs for this client base.Another key risk is the fact that the prepaid debit card market is highly competitive, with many scaled providers playing in the space. Although PaySign does appear to have built out a strong niche, it is still vulnerable to other competitors with comparatively larger financial resources to compete.Overall, PaySign has built a strong payments platform focused on pharma and on plasma centers. COVID-19 has caused near-term headwinds to the business, but I do not believe that the long-term picture for the company has changed. It has historically executed well, as seen in its 2019 performance and I believe that the company will be able to strongly rebound once this crisis is over. PaySign's current valuation of 6.7x EV/Sales (forward) as seen below, is almost all-time lows over the last year or so, and although warranted given the current situation, I can see the stock re-rating to a 12x multiple, similar to historical ranges, as we exit the COVID-19 crisis.Data by YCharts"
4337184,21815,2020-04-13T04:52:51-04:00,"The company had a stellar year with 48% revenue growth, margin expansion and a profit explosion.Some worries emerged about the company's financial control mechanisms and the impact of COVID-19, but the shares have sold off in a very exaggerated manner.The company is financially very sound, the control issues seem to be solved and the impact of COVID-19 is quite limited, at least for now.","The shares of pre-paid card processor PaySign (PAYS) have fallen out of favor, coming off from a high of nearly $18 last summer to $4 just a week or so ago, although they have bounced off from the lows quite a bit already.While there are some worries about the impact of COVID-19 and financial control issues, and one could legitimately argue that at $18 the shares were priced in the stratosphere, we think the shares are attractive here as the control issues seem to be settled and the impact of COVID-19 is limited, at least for now.Basically, the company has been on a tear:Data by YChartsYet the share price, like those of so many other small caps, crashed:But with PaySign there was an additional consideration, which was that an audit found some controls in need of improvement, which is why the company was late with filing the 10-K.Growth is hefty at 48% last year with revenues in their relatively new pharma vertical reaching $7.3M from $366K in 2018. They are increasing services in that vertical (Q4CC):Hub service providers (providing all patient connections during prescription delivery) are consolidating and hence competing with one another and PaySign is jumping in on the opportunity to get a slice of the pie as to be the engine for hub service providers.This required extensive investments in the development of capabilities, but as one can see below, results haven't suffered.The 10-K was finally filed on April 3 after several rounds for additional information by the auditor, but in the end there were no problems with the figures.Earlier, there were control problems identified by their auditors (Squar Milner LLP) and they were summarized in section 9A of the 10-K:However, the auditors also stated that this assessment did not affect their report dated April 3, 2020 on those financial statements, that is, they didn't find that the control weaknesses have affected the figures.Management has also undertaken measures to shore up the deficient controls (10-K):So this issue seems to have ended with a bit of a dud.So far (April 6), the impact has been minimal (Q4CC):The company isn't providing full year guidance because of the uncertainties relating to the impact of COVID-19, but they do expect continued revenue growth and similar gross margins to 2019. Since it's almost over, management did provide Q1 guidance:We would say that is pretty encouraging, although one has to keep in mind that the COVID-19 impact only really started late in Q1. Management also said that the company has flexibility on the cost side should revenues become affected. They already scaled back some marketing efforts of their PaySign premier card, limiting efforts to big existing customers.What's more, their biggest segment, the plasma business, is considered critical infrastructure so it hasn't closed down and it could conceivably benefit from the COVID-19 crisis:From the 10-K:Especially noteworthy is how revenues from their pharma vertical have scaled from next to nothing last year to over $7.3M this year. There were quite a number of positive takeaways from the year:While stellar, revenue was nevertheless slightly below expectations (Q4CC):And, also from the 10-K:Data by YChartsSome notable elements:CashData by YChartsCash flow has retreated quite a bit from the heights of Q1 but it is still significantly positive. From the 10-K:On top of significant cash flows, the company also has $9.6M in cash on the books, and this should allay any fears that the company could get into financial trouble as a result of the COVID-19 recession.While they have no access to the cash in pre-loaded cards, needless to say, these do generate interest income for the company ($441K last year). Given the solid cash flow, dilution hasn't been much of a problem:Data by YChartsData by YChartsWhile multiples have come down a lot from the giddy heights of a year and a half ago, at first sight valuation is still steep, but these are GAAP figures and backward-looking. Analysts expect an EPS of $0.18 this year, which isn't all that much higher than last year ($0.16). They expect it to rise to $0.27 in 2021.Now that the 10-K has been filed and no serious problems have emerged, we think that the shares are attractive here. While they are still far from cheap, the company is growing at nearly 50%, is expanding margins and produces significant amounts of cash flow.At first sight, the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be limited, although it might still be a little early to tell, but they have operational flexibility to adjust and have a substantial margin of cash flow and cash holdings so investors have little reason to worry.Quite frankly, it's difficult to imagine what could seriously derail the company, even if we get into a period of big economic headwinds. Even if the company experiences some headwinds in revenue growth, given how far and how fast the stock price has fallen, we would argue that this is already priced in."
4329880,20599,2020-03-05T11:04:54-05:00,PaySign’s revenue growth was almost flat until it started its upward trajectory in 2017.2019 earnings jumped by a whopping 270% from the previous financial year.PaySign continues to execute its growth strategy.,"PaySign (PAYS) surprised the market recently when profits increased by more than 40% from 2017 to 2018 and even surpassed that rate by six folds in 2019. PaySign, Inc. is an integrated payment processor and debit card program manager offering various services such as transaction processing, cardholder enrollment and account management, and value loading. The company offers customized payment solutions to various organizations including private corporations, government institutions, and universities. In the early years of operations, the company focused mainly on providing co-pay assistance prepaid cards to the pharmaceutical industry. In 2011, it began marketing corporate incentive prepaid card-based payment solutions targeting the plasma donation industry. By 2018, more resources were devoted to card programs in the pharmaceutical industry.Figure 1. PaySign Share PricePAYS’s revenue growth was almost flat until it started its upward trajectory in 2017. Annual growth rate was at the 20% mark in 2017, 40% in 2018, and 50% in 2019. The increase in revenue is mainly due to the growth in the company’s plasma programs and the new pharma business. These are not only a one-off increase as new onboarded plasma centers, and new cardholders will continue to generate revenue for the company. PAYS did not take profitability for granted in growing its business. 2019 earnings jumped by a whopping 270% from the previous financial year.Figure 2. PaySign Revenue and Net Income (Quarterly)Source: YChartEarly holders of PAYS enjoy an 800% portfolio gain in less than two years. Does this mean it is too late to jump into the boat? Analysts say that at the current price level, PAYS is still undervalued. Fair value is estimated to be more than 30% the current price. 12-month analysts' price forecast also looks rosy. The low end of the forecast is still 50% higher than the current price. The median price is $15.50.Figure 3. 12-Month Price ForecastSource: CNN MoneyContinued Growth Strategy PAYS continues to execute its growth strategy. In 2019, the company started marketing its premier card, which is a debit card linked to a demand deposit account. Material benefit from the premier program is expected to be felt by 2020. The company is also making considerable progress in evaluating several opportunities in the M&A front. In addition, PaySign’s zero-debt balance sheet provides ample room to use leverage and further spur its growth.For dividend-seeking investors, PAYS may not be the appropriate stock. PAYS has not paid dividends in the past and may still continue to withhold dividend declarations as it executes its growth strategy. With the sharp rise in earnings, the company may not be able to achieve the same level of profit growth in the succeeding years. PAYS's P/E ratio is also well above the industry and market average suggesting the possibility of cheaper alternative stocks.Accurately predicting a company’s inflection point is synonymous to looking for a needle in a haystack. Fortunately, the gains last longer beyond that point. PaySign might have reached its true inflection point, and it is not yet too late to ride along. Investors can never go wrong with a profitable, growing company.*Like this article? Don't forget to hit the Follow button above!"
4305188,21815,2019-11-10T13:54:29-05:00,"PaySign is fast growing, profitable and generates cash, and the growth is set to continue for the foreseeable future.The company leverages its core capabilities in new segments and expands the capabilities, leading to leverage and rising gross margins.There is also a significant amount of operational leverage, so profits grow even faster than revenues.Shares are not cheap, but not nearly as expensive as just a few months ago.","Early September, we bought PaySign (PAYS), the card and payment processor for the SHU portfolio, when there was a little panic, with the company announcing some plasma clients would postpone onboarding.As a result, the FY revenue guidance was lowered and the shares sold off, even if the FY EBITDA guidance wasn't taken down even an inch. We could not understand the size of the selloff, as basically all that happened was just a quarter of delay with no consequences for EBITDA; some might even take that as good news.The revenues will come anyway and the company apparently is increasing margins, otherwise how to explain the same EBITDA guidance on lower revenues?So we bought the shares (500) at $9.76 which seemed a very good deal to us, but in the proceeding months, there wasn't really much of a recovery, and the shares stayed range bound.But we have a feeling that a recovery is still in the cards after the company produced very good Q3 results, with GAAP EPS coming in at $0.05, which was 2 cents above expectations.And guess what, those postponed plasma clients with delayed onboarding all onboarded in Q3; problem solved. Should the stock, now unburdened by anything, revisit the former highs?Well, that remains to be seen. Those former highs in July were really quite high with the stock sprouting some astronomical valuations (see chart below) with shares on nearly 30x sales at one time.We don't expect things to get quite that extreme. There is a bit of a correction ongoing in high-multiple valuated growth stocks, but we are quite optimistic about the prospects for the company.The company started out by conquering the plasma center market where its cards are used by blood donors. But more recently, it has moved into the broader pharma market (now 22% of revenue, up from 20% in Q2), and it has introduced its Premier Card, which is much more than just a prepaid card. From its November 2019 IR presentation:This is a classic strategy of applying capabilities into adjacent markets and improving capabilities to open up cross-selling opportunities like with its Premium Card. The core capabilities are situated in its payment processing platform (November IR presentation):This is the flexible motor that allows PaySign to customize it depending on the requirements of the client. What we admire about the company is the logical stepping stone strategy based on leveraging existing capabilities to adjacent markets and developing new ones.Not only does this lead to a significant amount of growth, but it also expands gross margins as the pharma market often has more sophisticated requirements than the relatively simple pre-paid loading cards used in the plasma market, and of course, its Premium Card is a whole different beast altogether.So this strategy should lead to an expansion of gross margins, but not just because the increased sophistication of solutions, but also because the same payment processing platform (largely fixed cost) handles more customers, and below you'll see that gross margins have indeed displayed an impressive rising trajectory.Further expansion plans seem logical (Q2CC):The Premier Card will start to contribute to revenues next year.Here a summary of the results. From the November IR presentation:The company added 54 new card programs year to date, 45 in plasma, 7 in pharma and 2 in other corporate incentive programs with the total number of card holders rising to 2.86M.The guidance remains unchanged, with revenue between $35M and $37M and adjusted EBITDA at $10-12M.Data by YChartsWe noted above that the strategy of leveraging capabilities and expanding them leads to gross margin expansion as:And indeed that is exactly what happened (Q3CC):The favorable mix shift seems to indicate another valuable element here, where the same capabilities applied to a different market (pharma) can in and of itself lead to higher margin. This could be because the cards are used more often in pharma (blood donations in the plasma market are on a monthly basis at best) and/or the market might tolerate higher margins.However, there potentially is a third effect in play. From Q3CC:It is likely that this single co-pay program is more complex, hence earning higher margins.However, management indicated that in Q4 gross margin is likely to reverse a bit due to the onboarding of these plasma clients, so there will be a bit of a negative mix effect. Longer term, management expects gross margins in the 60s though.You also see a great deal of operational leverage in the model, with operating margin doubling in a year or so. Indeed, even in dollar terms, operating expenses were lower in Q3 ($3.1M) compared to Q2 ($3.4M), although well above Q3 2018 ($2.3M). The Q2 number was a little inflated though with some one-offs.Data by YChartsThe figure here both includes restricted cash (which is for customer cards) and the company cash, and the decline the last two quarters is in the restricted cash, the result of out-of-pocket expenses by pharma card holders, which will revert itself early in the next years when cards get reloaded. This shouldn't concern investors as the company's cash-generating capabilities are growing.The company has $8M in cash and $33.2M in restricted cash (funds held for card customers) and no debt. Share-based compensation isn't large by any means, and there has been some dilution, but nothing to worry about:Data by YChartsData by YChartsAnalyst expect an EPS of $0.16 this year and rising to $0.30 next year.With a profitable and cash-generating company spoiled for expansion opportunities, a business model full of leverage and retaining 100% of its customers, the risks seem fairly minimal.We therefore think that the main risk is market sentiment and valuation multiples. These are already in some kind of correction phase for the type of high-growth stocks like PaySign.What is not to like at PaySign for investors? The company sprouts high growth, with plenty of growth opportunities left, and it is already profitable and generating cash, with a strong balance sheet to boot.Add to that multiple signs of leverage and opportunities to extract greater returns from more sophisticated products like its Premier Card and perfect customer retention and you have a solid, long-term growth stock.Given the market correction in the valuation multiples for these kind of growth stocks, you can buy them at less exorbitant prices compared to a couple of months ago, which is why we pounced on the opportunities, and we feel it's still not too late to do the same."
4292649,21815,2019-09-20T07:26:16-04:00,"Priced for perfection, investors were getting scared by a restricted cash issue and a downward revenue guidance, and the shares fell almost 50%.On closer inspection we don't think these scares are all that scary so we opened up a position for the SHU portfolio.The shares are still not cheap and they are rather volatile, but there are few companies with the metrics of PaySign, boasting 50%+ revenue growth and triple digit profit growth.We think the good times can last for quite a while, given the rate of their pharma market penetration and the upcoming Premier Card.","Our previous article on PaySign (PAYS) a provider of pre-paid cards and processing services was only written in June but the stock has been very volatile since then. As you can see, the shares reached as high as $18 before falling back to below $9, this is all a little curious because the progress the company is making is rather smooth and, of course, impressive:Data by YChartsBut one can make the case that at $18, the shares were rather overvalued at more than 20x 2019 sales so that's one factor that explains the volatility. Here is an overview from the Q2 earnings deck:Apart from valuation concerns, the other issue that drove the shares back to earth was a change in that 2019 revenue guidance, from a range of $38M-$40M to $35M-$37M on the delay of onboarding new plasma-industry programs originally planned for the first half of 2019.The stock price reaction was predictable for a high-growth, high-valued growth company like this, they usually get punished very heavily when the sailing is a little less smooth than investors bargained. But the slaughter was pretty brutal and we took advantage to take a position for the SHU portfolio when the stock was at $9.76 on September 9.The onboarding issue seems a mere delay, and more promising, the company didn't adjust their adjusted EBITDA guidance downward (still $10M-$12M for the year), which suggests to us that the company is doing very well. It has to be pointed out that if that adjusted EBITDA guidance materializes, the leverage is pretty impressive, from the earnings deck:Not only does it constitute a triple digit growth, with lower revenue it implies an even bigger adjusted EBITDA margin, at mid-point (of both revenue and adjusted EBITDA) it implies a 30.55% adjusted EBITDA margin, up from 20.9% in 2018.That didn't seem to warrant such a huge sell-off to us, which is why we opened that position in the stock for the SHU portfolio. Here is how the company evolved:Starting off in plasma, were it still takes market share but the payments platform allows it to be leveraged into other verticals, so the company moved into other sectors, most notably pharmaceuticals.We couldn't find a break-down of the segments in the SEC filings but there is little doubt the pharma segment is up and running, from the company website:In the Q2CC, management argued that pharma now constitutes 20% of revenue, up from 15% in the prior quarter so this is ramping pretty fast, with more to come (Q2CC):One might also notice that they seem ahead of their pharma growth which they expected to reach 20% of revenue for the year but we're already at that run rate in Q2. These cards open up a variety of revenue streams:The company explaining its competitive advantage:We take this with a pinch of salt as it really depends which competitor one is considering (we for instance are quite impressed with the capabilities of Intelligent Systems (INS)). More interesting is what they list as technological differentiators:The key element why we like this company a lot is the opportunities its platform contains for leveraging to other sectors, from the Q2 10-Q:And a platform often allows the ability to create new revenue streams through innovation, one of which seems to be the company's Premier Card, which is about to launch (Q2CC):Note that the company hasn't factored in any revenue from the Premier Card this year, but they do expect it to be a material contributor to earnings next year.From the 10-Q:Just a few points of note:These are rather impressive figures, needless to say. Data by YChartsMargins are taking off and we already noted above that 2019 will accelerate things with adjusted-EBITDA margin guided at 30%+ with a 1000bp gain on last year.Indeed, in Q2 gross margin already gained 1036bp on Q2 last year, and the improvements aren't going to stop anytime soon (Q2CC):Data by YChartsThe graph is significantly overstating the cash generation as it includes restricted cash (dollars loaded to cards by customers and dollars to be loaded at a point in time). From the $48.9M of cash that was on the balance sheet at the end of Q2, $42.6M was restricted. But still, if one detracts the restricted cash, the company's 'own' cash position nevertheless doubled in H1 2019 to $6.3M, up from $3.0M at the end of H1 2018. The company has no debt.Investors got scared by that Q2 $42.6M restricted cash number as the Q1 number was $45.9M, and some thought this indicated a slowdown in business, but this is just lumpiness.The main risk we see here is that the plasma market is growing at 10% CARG and that PaySign has been growing much faster than that mostly by taking market share from Wirecard, the main competitor. Wirecard is much bigger, and the plasma market isn't nearly as important to them as it is to PaySign, which might have something to do with that as PaySign has been more focused to winning the plasma market (which they entered early in the decade). There are no signs of this happening, but the company not publishing the number of plasma center clients or market share (which was 33% in 2018) anymore has opened them up for this concern.Given their rapidly increasing foothold in the pharma market the risk isn't as serious as it was some time ago.Data by YChartsValuation, even on next year's estimated results, is still rather considerable but all the metrics have come down quite a bit and we don't see any barriers from a valuation standpoint. Analyst expect an EPS of $0.13 this year rising to $0.29 the next. In the high-teens, the stock was priced for perfection so when there arrived some scares, it's no surprise the stock fell back the way it has. We think the scares are overblown.Even if their gain in market share in the plasma center market is slowing (and there is very little hard data to suggest this is the case), it's no disaster as they are growing new verticals and next year have the addition of the Premium Card.While the stock is still not cheap, the company is growing revenues at 50%+ and EBITDA and earnings considerably faster still and the company is already profitable and cash flow positive. There aren't that many of these companies around, so that's why we took a position on the sell-off."

Investing in the company presents an optimal risk-reward proposition with minimal downside and substantial upside potential, and as for its price, it is overvalued. Paysign is a small-cap company with a market cap of about $560 Million dedicated to managing prepaid cards and process payments using those cards. Its future will be marked by how the public perceives their rewards program and their ability to create new products that can solve problems in the healthcare, legal, and insurance businesses. Paysign offers prepaid cards and payment services specialized for each industry in which they focus. About 20% of the business comes from Healthcare & pharma, and the number is expected to grow in the following years. The other significant sector they cover is Legal and insurance. Besides that, they provide Payroll programs for public and private sector and Reward programs. The company is also expanding to crowdsourcing solutions, which are growing in recent years, and it has plans to expand its Pharmaceutical incentives by integrating co-pay and rebates as a service. Source: Investor RelationsThe Plasma program delay hit the stock price hard, and while the delay will impact the current year revenue and earnings results, the long term prospects of the company are untouched, and the stock price drop could be an opportunity for new investors.

The forecast modeled an average gross margin of 48.7% compared to the past average of 43.9%, while G&A as a percentage of revenue has been between 25% and 46% with a tendency to be positive.

This method uses the ratio between the expected earnings growth plus dividends and the P/E of the stock to determine its fair value. A stock that has a 1:1 ratio is reasonably priced. The higher the number, the more underpriced the stock is.Source: AuthorThis valuation does not take into account the assets and liabilities of the company. The growth considered in the assessment is the average yearly growth of the next years, taking as reference non-GAAP earnings.With this valuation, arguably, the stock is at worst overvalued by 57% and at best overvalued by 18%. So the stock is overvaluedSource: AuthorConstructing an adjusted Beta Pert risk profile for the long-term prospects of the stock, we can calculate the risk profile for the company.Source: AuthorThe risk profile shows there is an 8% probability that Paysign will ever trade at a lower price than it is today. Considering the potential downside, upside, and the likelihood of each, the statistical value of the opportunity of investing now, is of 22.1%.Let's explain in greater detail the statistical value of the opportunity to invest in a company. The statistical value is the sum of all the possibilities of an event or a proposition, multiplied by their respective output.Betting heads on a coin flip, where if you win, you will get 100% return, but if you lose, you will lose 100%, has a statistical value of 0%. If someone were to bet an infinite number of coin flips, they would end up with the same money they began with.On the other hand, if the odds of the coin flip were heads, you win 200%, and tails, you lose 100%, the statistical value of the bet would be 50%.A 22% statistical value is fantastic, and while the size of the company is small, its prospects are not. The recent drop in the stock price provides an exciting window for new investors, while the current price is still above the fair price, the prospects of the company are tantalizing. The current moat of the company is scarce, but the specialization of its services could become a significant moat. As long as their services create meaningful solutions for the sectors they are focusing on, the company will have no issue in maintaining its customers. Given the exceptional growth in revenue that the company has shown in the past, and the reasonable level of debt, it just might be a time to get the stock, as Warren Buffett says ""It´s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price"".Current investors might not be delighted about the price dip, and while it could be tempting to double down, the current overvaluation of the company suggests that a better time to do so might come. New investors could enter half a position or wait for the price to become more attractive.

4292963,103738,2019-09-23T07:32:33-04:00,"PaySign has a bright short-term future ahead of it as it gains market share and introduces new products and offerings.But the long-term prospects aren't as cheerful, with mobile applications and cardless transactions looming over the company's business model.Even as PaySign remains versatile heading into 2020, it remains unclear if the company has what it takes to weather a shift in corporate spending habits.I remain bullish on the company's short- to medium-term prospects, but await further information and trend confirmations until moving bullish on its long term.","PaySign (PAYS) offers prepaid cards for corporate clients of all kinds, which helps the company manage employee and client expenses for various medical reimbursements and travel expenses, and it is also expanding its offerings into payroll and other general expense uses.However, the world is moving to cashless and cardless, with new mobile payment systems emerging every day and becoming easier and easier to use, like Apple Pay (AAPL), PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ). With this trend expected to accelerate in the coming years as faster and more reliable communication technologies emerge, it’s unclear how PaySign will fare.Even so, the company has a unique characteristic in that all of its business is proprietary, which means PaySign can tailor any and all of its products and services not only to its clients but also to changing consumer and enterprise spending habits and needs. A review of the company's technology and its underlying structure does reveal that PaySign has the potential to penetrate the cashless and cardless markets using its processing services and mobile application options, even if the scope of potential success is not clear.It seems that the company is well-positioned for the year ahead, but I believe a further review is warranted prior to making a determination of the viability of the business in the long run.The products and services that PaySign offers mostly fall under prepaid cards for corporations to organize their expenses when it comes to their employees and clients. Most of its offerings are around healthcare plans and reimbursements, which is a growing market in and of itself, and it’s expected to continue and grow at a rapid pace over the next few years.The company's other offerings include consumer rebates and rewards and donor compensation, and it is moving into other offerings which are popular among small and large businesses alike, such as incentive products, payroll cards, demand deposit accounts and various corporate expense accounts which can be controlled and worked through by the corporate headquarters without messing around with personal payments and rebates by employees.The company recognizes revenues from various parts of its business offerings. It takes in contract fees when companies sign with its services and then receives management fees for the day-to-day services which it offers to customers. Most of its revenues, however, come from transaction fees when the cards are used.This has an inherent problem with its current business focused on healthcare and pharmaceutical cards, given the fact that these might not be used all that often like general expense or other cards. The company’s diversification, however, should take care of this issue, which would have had some adverse effects given the high costs of maintaining its services package without receiving much premiums from the transaction fees on these healthcare plans and co-pay models most corporation use with their employees.The overall prepaid card market in North America is expected to grow at an impressive 22.3% CAGR through 2022, driven primarily by demand from small businesses which don't have the will or the way to purchase an expensive company-wide operating system to track and deal with all the different expense platforms they use with their employees and customers.These cards are offered in the form of reloadable and non-reloadable, which can be used for a wide variety of corporate and government applications throughout the business world. The reloadable cards primarily include payroll cards which can be reloaded every pay period, quarterly or yearly co-pay plans in the healthcare space, government benefit programs and any traditional general corporate expense structures which employees need to make travel arrangements or manage an expense account.Non-reloadable cards include gift or incentive cards, which are done after the balance in them runs out and traditionally include employee bonus benefits.PaySign has $6.3 million in cash, with $42.6 million in restricted cash belonging to its customer deposits and not available for operational use under most contractual circumstances. As the company has no long-term debt, it takes in around $500,000 every year in interest income from investing its cash reserves and other activities.EPS growth is expected to remain strong, with analysts expecting PaySign to report $0.13 in 2019 followed by a surge to $0.29 in 2020, more than double the previous year. Profitability is expected to continue and improve as the company takes on more business. The company's fixed costs are relatively stable now that it has assembled the team and services it provides, and margins are now higher with new clients than with previous ones.On the sales front, analysts expect PaySign to report $36.54 million for 2019 and then $60.4 million in 2020, representing a 65% growth rate, significantly higher than the industry CAGR of 22.3%, meaning that the company will be gaining significant market share throughout the next 2 years. Since the company's exact timeline is somewhat unclear, I believe that these estimated don't yet include any revenues, which will be brought in with the company's new products and services like payroll cards and other expense management cards expected to be offered in the coming months.Even though PaySign seems to be very well-positioned, with its flexible business model and proprietary information allowing it to adjust to any market-wide swings in the demand of reloadable and non-reloadable cards, the possibility remains that the company's offerings can become rather irrelevant in the next couple of years.The world is moving over to bank transfers and small-dollar transfers with mobile applications, and the use of cards, especially for payroll and government benefits, seems to be very limited to a small group of small businesses who don't want to spend big money on new systems.Even though healthcare expense management and co-pay opportunities seem to be the most viable for the upcoming 2-4 years, the move in the US to a universal healthcare program can put that expansion route on a definite hold. Even beyond the specifics of what a universal or Medicare-for-All type of healthcare program will entail, the fact that more of our medical information is now online means that big corporations will inevitably have the opportunity to partner with major healthcare providers, be it private or government-run programs, to create easy-to-use mobile application systems to handle the bulk of payments and expense controls.Given the risk factors involved, I don't know exactly how to approach the long-term prospects of this company. The short term (12-24 months) seems to be bright, and the company should enjoy significant market share gains as it uses its cash to effectively market its existing product and launch new products and services which will help them gain traction with small and larger businesses around the United States.Assessing a valuation range for the company for the remainder of 2019 and 2020, I believe that PaySign's growth rate alongside its market share gains warrant a 40x price-to-earnings multiple, which is similar to other growth companies in a fast-growing market. This brings its fair value to $5.20 per share for 2019 to $11.60 per share for 2020, meaning that the company is more than fairly valued for the remainder of 2019 but still slightly undervalued for 2020 (around ~10% for the next 12 months).Overall, even though the company will enjoy a nice boost in the short term on account of some competitive advantages, its focus on the growing healthcare market and given the fact that it's clearly set out to gain significant market share over the course of the next 12-18 months, long-term headwinds exist.With the move to a cashless and cardless future, it's unclear how adaptable PaySign will be if and when some of the basic functions which corporations use these cards for move over to mobile-based applications and services, which will hurt the company's business model.I remain slightly bullish on PaySign's next 24 months, but will be watching the shift in enterprise demand for prepaid cards very closely to determine the viability of the company's business model in the long run."
4269550,21815,2019-06-11T00:03:01-04:00,"The advantage of having your own payments platform is that it can be leveraged, and this is what the company is doing.It started in one vertical, plasma with fairly simple cards, and it's still growing fast here, but now is successfully moving to other verticals.The company enjoys 50%+ growth with 50% gross margins, it's profitable and cash generating.The shares have been on a terrific rally already and are fairly fully valued, the company can't afford to let up.","Payments processing is a fantastically profitable business if you do it right, we've recently discussed the advances of Par Technology (PAR), one of our favorite stocks we hold in the SHU portfolio and also Intelligent Systems (INS), although controversy has erupted on the latter.Here we introduce another payment processor which is really blistering ahead as the progress at PaySign (PAYS) is really impressive and investors have noticed the shares have tripled this year:SC Capital Group did a fantastic write-up here last year when the company still went under another name (3Pea International) and it now sits on 650% gains, so kudos to it.But it's been more than a year since the last SA article so it's time for an update. The progress in the share price is of course well supported by developments on the ground; from the earnings deck:Data by YChartsRevenues are zooming up and the company is now well in the black.The company started off providing a prepaid card to the plasma center business (processing blood donations) and that's still a very good business for it. The plasma business itself grows at roughly 10% per year but PaySign's prepaid card business grows faster, that is, it's taking market share.It can do this because it's historically focused and well-connected in this business while its main competitor, Wirecard (OTCPK:WRCDF), is much larger and has bigger customers in other verticals.This is a recurring business which generates a roughly 3.3% take rate. It does its own processing with its own software platform, with the additional advantage that this platform can be leveraged for use in other adjacent verticals:From the 10-Q:Management expects that the pharma vertical will already provide roughly 20% of revenue this year so that is a pretty good start.The next step in this is the introduction of the PaySign Premier Card which will happen in the present quarter (Q2). What is the difference with the cards it already issues? These are simple corporate spend cards, the Premier Card (Q1CC):There is little clarity on how the more sophisticated Premier Card is going to add but we can imagine at least two ways:There are plenty of ways it extracts fees from customers:Mostly for illustrative purposes as it's hard to compare feature for feature with the competition, but management argues that it has considerable advantages:Given the rather spectacular growth, it's obvious it is doing something right, no doubt about that but we analysed Intelligent Systems and its card seems far more versatile to us.However, that's probably much less relevant than it might seem at first hand with the market being segmented and the simple but effective card from PaySign the perfect solution for numerous verticals like the plasma industry.The Q1 results were nothing less than stellar:All in all, another stellar quarter.Guidance for 2019 hasn't changed:So basically adjusted EBITDA growth continues where it left off in 2018, growing well into triple-digit territory so it's no wonder the stock has gone gangbusters.Gross margin was 52% of revenue in Q1, up from 48% a year ago with operating cost at $3.0M (up from $1.8M a year ago). There is a beginning of operational leverage with SG&A only up 4.4% sequentially.Management argues margin improvement will continue (Q1CC):The business seems a license to print money:Data by YChartsThis might look surreal as these figures are larger than revenues. However, for 2018 as a whole, cash from operations was $16M and in Q1 the figure was $20M but this included $19.15M in changes in customer card funding which is restricted cash, from the 10-Q:The company has $12.0M in liquidity on its books. Stock-based compensation is rising rapidly but still pretty modest, well under 10% of revenue but there is a fair bit of dilution:In Q1, the average diluted share count was 54.5M so there is more to come.Data by YChartsNeedless to say, on a forward basis, valuations are not quite as extreme but still pretty hefty at a 12.5x EV/S multiple. Earnings multiples are even steeper, but aren't all that important right now (EPS is expected to come in at $0.13 this year rising to $0.31 in 2020).This is one of those stocks one wishes to have discovered one or two years back. Others here did, so kudos to them, they've been richly rewarded. It's difficult to imagine growth not continuing as there is very little to no churn and once it is in with a customer it grows with them.There are still expansion opportunities within its mainstay vertical, plasma, but conquering other verticals is now well on its way with pharma already supplying a good chunk (projected to be 20% this year) of its revenue.We have no idea what its Premier Card will be able to add in terms of additional revenue and customers, there was no discussion on the CC about the potential.But given the valuation of the shares, the company cannot afford even fairly small disappointments. We think one could still get in here, but we would not establish a full position.While waiting for a pullback, one could also sell put options to get shares cheaper or collect premium."

Mostly because stocks in this area have made me a lot of money, and the quickest way to my heart is through my wallet. But I like this industry for several reasons, and I especially like the business model: recurring revenues, high margins, predictable earnings, and a good chance for buyouts. Throw in the fact that I've had good luck investing in the payments space, and it's fairly easy to see why I've been accumulating 3Pea International (OTCQB:TPNL).3Pea International designs and develops payment solutions, prepaid card programs, and processing services under the PaySign brand name for corporate, consumer, and government applications. The company offers various services, including transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value loading, cardholder account management, reporting, and customer service.It also develops prepaid card programs for healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance, corporate expense and per diem payments, and donor payments for source plasma and automobile dealership incentives, as well as payroll cards, general purpose re-loadable cards, travel cards, and loyalty rewards cards for the hospitality industry.Its principal target markets for processing services comprise prepaid card issuers, retail and private-label issuers, small third-party processors, and small and mid-size financial institutions in the United States and internationally.Simply put, this is a growth stock trading as a value stock. It's also underfollowed, which means market inefficiencies are more easily exploitable. And it's obviously no surprise how I feel about inefficient markets. I've actually been following this company for a number of years, but have been increasingly upping my stake over the past 6 months or so. The last few quarters have shown impressive growth, but my feeling is that the best is yet to come.On November 13th, the company reported third quarter results, which showed growth continuing to accelerate. Revenue increased 42% to $4.0 million compared to $2.8 million in the same year ago quarter. Gross profit increased to $1.86 million compared to $1.30 million in the same year ago quarter.Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $500,168, or $.01 per share, compared to net income of $480,429 or $.01 per share in the same year ago quarter. Additionally, the company surpassed 1,390,000 PaySign Cardholders participating in 175 card programs as of September 30, 2017, up from approximately 1,000,000 cardholders participating in 120 programs for the period ended December 31, 2016.Mark Newcomer, CEO, said,Brian Polan, CFO, said,The company also gave a shareholder update that stated:The company also guided for 2017 revenue of $15-15.5 million, which would represent a 44-49% increase over 2016 levels. This would also imply management anticipates fourth quarter revenue in the $4.4-4.9 million range, which is nice sequential growth over the $4m in the third quarter. Assuming gross margins stay consistent with Q3 levels, which is probably conservative given management's commentary, Q4 net income will likely be in the $700,000-$1 million range.3Pea currently trades for about a $25m market cap. Companies in this industry tend to trade for around 4x revenue, even with much lower growth rates than what 3Pea is currently experiencing. For example, Payment Data Systems (PYDS) trades for 3.5x revenue with a (12%) growth rate, Green Dot (GDOT) trades for 4x revenue with a 28% growth rate. Planet Payment (PLPM) trades for 4.2x revenue with a (5%) growth rate. So valuing this strictly off revenue at a 4x multiple would imply a share price in the $1.40 range, roughly 125% higher than current prices.Using Enterprise Value/EBITDA also yields similar results. Companies in this space trade for an average of 20x EV/EBITDA. 3Pea is currently on pace to do around $3m of EBITDA in 2017, which would value the company at around $60m, or about $1.40 a share.The real wild card here is what the growth rate will look like in 2018. Management seems fairly confident this trend will continue, but I'm always cautious. Regardless, the models say this company should be trading for nearly $1.50 at the moment, not $0.60. So if this 40% growth rate continues throughout 2018, we'd be looking at a valuation of over $2 by the end of next year.In my opinion, one of the reasons for the undervaluation is due to the company trading on the OTC exchange. While this doesn't have anything to do fundamentally with the company, it does tend to reduce the number of potential investors. Simply put, most people don't pay attention to stocks traded OTC. The good news is that based on my research, the company currently meets listing requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market.While it is ultimately up to management to decide whether or not to pursue an uplisting, I would strongly recommend they consider it. I can't count the number of companies I've seen increase in value immediately after announcing their intention to uplist. And with 3Pea's current fundamentals, I'd imagine there would be investors chomping at the bit to buy this company - if they only knew it actually existed.Below are the listing requirements for the Nasdaq Capital Market. Currently, 3Pea satisfies all requirements under the ""Net Income Standard,"" except for the share price requirement. The share price requirement would likely need to be achieved with a reverse split.Source: NasdaqAt $0.60 a share, I think there is compelling asymmetric risk/reward in this opportunity. I obviously liked it better a few months ago in the $0.40s, but think there is probably less risk now simply because there is more certainty about the future and management has established credibility by hitting their targets. I also think this is an easy hold through at least the next few quarters. If the growth continues and margins start to expand, there could be significant value creation for shareholders.The stock is currently priced well below average industry metrics, despite fundamentals that are superior to other competitors in the industry. So even if growth doesn't materialize to the extent some are hoping, I still don't see a ton of downside from current levels. In fact, assuming the wheels don't fall off completely, I don't foresee a lot of potential downside here. Even at the current revenue and earnings run rate, and assuming 0% growth from current levels, the stock is still undervalued.That said, you never get hit by the train you see coming. I've been burned by tiny companies before and it will certainly happen again. But that's part of investing and taking risks. But at least with this company, I feel like I have the odds on my side. Naturally, one should exercise caution when investing in tiny companies. Competition in the payments industry is intense and smaller companies don't have the resources of their larger counterparts, and there is less margin for error.My current 12-month price target for the stock is $1.50, roughly 150% higher than current levels. This is only assuming a growth rate of 10-20% in 2018, which is well below the current trajectory. As far as potential near-term catalysts, I am hopeful to see an announcement of a Nasdaq listing. But even if an uplisting is not in the cards, management continues to deliver exceptional results, and eventually, the fundamentals will give way to shareholder value.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3095396,48411,2015-04-23T12:53:29-04:00,"TPNL continues to make it easy to own.The company has signed its first automotive vertical client and can now begin down the road of establishing a data and analytics revenue segment.TPNL financials also stand to get much less ""lumpy"" with the addition of a less seasonal segment.While meaningless to the underlying story this will make the overall story easier to understand to The Street.Continue to own and accumulate a TPNL position - much higher highs are coming.","Breaking Ground…As many of you know I initiated coverage of 3Pea International, Inc. (TPNL) for Seeking Alpha readers just a few days ago after covering this name on my prop research site for subscribers. After releasing this prop pick to the public shares have since moved 43% in total (on ~500% volume to ADV) in 3 days' time. However, I believe today's news that TPNL has signed its first automotive vertical customer to its PaySign Connect solution is an indication that the shares have plenty of room to move to the upside on all durations. TPNL is already an attractive financial story but entering into the highly fragmented but lucrative automotive vertical and initiating a ""big data"" revenue segment should provide answers to important questions that remain about the TPNL model. I'll explain.Lumpiness…So, to be perfectly clear about TPNL's model - the revenues are lumpy. That should be easily understood at this point with the company showing a trend of higher highs for full year revenues dating back to 2011 but in fact showing a sequentially lower full year revenue from 2012 to 2013 (see below):(SOURCE: CapGainr.com)This is why I've advised my subscribers and my asset management clients to view the TPNL story on a trailing 6 quarter basis. I believe viewing the model in this way provides a much more accurate way to view total health. That said, lumpy revenues is probably the biggest problem I've had in presenting the TPNL bull case to those interested. Still, even with this TPNL is an attractive story as lumpiness is not a sign of anything materially wrong.Now, however, with the expansion of verticals from primarily RX/Legal/Healthcare - which by nature of the verticals are lumpy - into a vertical, Automotive, that we know outside of small seasonal ramp downs in activity (mostly just around the Christmas holiday) runs advertising/incentive programs year round I believe TPNL may have just take a big step into smoothing out its financial performances. Now, TPNL has a vertical that can spend into and utilize its proprietary solution much more evenly throughout the year. Kevin Szura, the GM of the auto dealership that singed with TPNL, elaborated in today's PR:Again, automotive partners don't consider sales and marketing a seasonal luxury but an absolute mission critical necessity. This should provide much more frequent transactional revenues that because of the high efficiency and margin of the model should provide expansion of and more frequent free cash flow generation. I reiterate that TPNL generated in excess of 100% operating and net income in free cash flow in 2014. While today's PR is just one dealership to think that there won't be other early adopters (TPNL just announced this entry nine days ago) I think is to be mistaken. With TPNL's three year reseller agreement with Dealer Automotive Group, LLC, a group of auto dealers established to maximize negotiating power amongst the top automotive vendors, I expect this program to rapidly scale as the first cohorts of customers show traction and show program efficacy. I believe the data as well as the complete loop of services provided will be able to allow DAG and regional customers who've adopted to give TPNL's auto vertical national scale within 3 quarters. Remember, TPNL's infrastructure is already capable of handling a much larger capacity of use so don't expect any CAPEX and/or scaling delays with rapid growth. TPNL is ideally positioned to capture and retain auto vertical expansion.Data and Analytics…I believe that management is positioning TPNL to do three things in the mid-term:The ability to have a high margin segment and what that means to the total model growth rates and trickle down net income/free cash flow rates goes without saying. What doesn't is how this positions TPNL for an exit.In a space that has been hot and consistent with M&A I believe management at TPNL is positioning the company for an eventual buyout offer. TPNL would already be immediately accretive to a buying company and has no near-term hurdles to growth. I believe if an eventual buyout exit were to come that it would occur at what should be a record sales multiple for the space. Some private buyouts have been executed at ~30X current year sales. With the physical infrastructure already built out, again zero near-term CAPEX needs, and with a self-sustaining, self-funding model already being executed TPNL doesn't need a buyout to continue to grow into a leadership position in this low competition space. I'm just saying that I believe management is executing perfectly into a strategy that has TPNL looking more and more attractive to a suitor by the quarter.I reiterate that based on what was presented in my initiation article that I am not long TPNL in the hope of a buyout. Frankly, I believe in time TPNL can scale into being a much more lucrative long term hold without being taken out in the early stages of its growth. That said, it is my suspicion that management is operating with this in mind. That's never a bad thing by the way.I continue to recommend readers initiate and accumulate a long position in TPNL. TPNL, among its other successful segments, should have a steady new deal flow to announce over the coming months and should accelerate topline growth into 2015 as a result of early adoption capture for the automotive vertical.

4126470,51372,2017-11-20T13:41:10-05:00,"Substantially undervalued in comparison to peers, with a fair value per share over double the current share price.Robust margins, cash flow positive, and recently debt free.Projecting significant growth for the remainder of 2017 (44-49% growth in revenue with the number of card programs under management growing from 120 in 2016 to over 200).Significant room for expansion into other prepaid card verticals, with an industry showing ample room for future growth.","As long-time investors and followers of 3Pea International (TPNL) (“3Pea”, or “the Company”), we can attest that it has been quite a bumpy ride. However, as it stands, our investment thesis has remained intact - the Company is overlooked by the general investment community, and 3Pea continues to trade well below its intrinsic value. This has been echoed by a recent article called “Why I’m Accumulating 3Pea International”. Although fairly consistent with our view, we wanted to provide a little more detail about the company’s history, an in-depth financial analysis (including our projections), a brief industry overview, a detailed stock valuation, and a summary of the associated investment risks.We firmly believe the Company has turned a corner for the best as it is starting to show consistently positive financial results without any of the prior “lumpiness”. We expect 3Pea’s earnings growth to persist, especially with the substantial increase in active card programs. This should garner the attention of new investors and cause a steady ascent in the Company’s stock price.3Pea International Inc. is an experienced prepaid debit card payment solutions provider as well as an integrated payment processor that has over 1.5 million prepaid debit cards in its portfolio. The Company operates through its PaySign brand which offers a customizable platform for payment processing that can be catered to almost any type of prepaid program or industry need.3Pea is mainly targeting the following verticals:The Company has grown from an incredibly small player in 2013 with only 46 card programs under management to a much more meaningful payment processor with over 200 programs and over 1.5 million cardholders under management as of November 2017.Source: All data is from annual SEC filings and press releases. The Company only reported plasma donation centers under management prior to 2016 (which were used as a proxy for # of programs). The Company only started reporting cardholders as of 2016FYE. 3Pea's history is far from butterflies and rainbows in the eyes of its shareholders.The Company first got its spotlight when investors flocked to buy its shares upon seeing a blowout Q4-2014 (revenue of 4.94M and an EPS of 0.07) thinking that this was going to be the new norm. With this momentum, the stock soared over $1 in April 2015. However, the music soon stopped as investors digested the news of Q1-2015, which saw a significantly lower top and bottom line (1.6M in revenue and an EPS of -0.01). What most of those initial investors didn’t realize was that Q4-2014 was an anomaly. The Company simply happened to have a significant amount of loyalty programs ending in Q4-2014 and, according to 3Pea’s rules for revenue recognition, recognizes revenue only once the programs have come to an end.To make things worse, in October of 2015, the Company was hit with a lawsuit by PSKW for a breach of agreement, which was settled for a fine of 2.5M (1M was paid upfront with payments of 83,333.33 per month for the next 18 months). At the same time that the lawsuit occurred, the CFO resigned. Although no detailed explanation was given, shareholders were only left to assume that the previous CFO had something to do with the lawsuit. From our understanding, 3Pea deemed it to be a frivolous lawsuit but found it was in the Company’s best interest to settle in lieu of spending excessive legal fees fighting the case in court.After all these events occurred the Company closed the 2015 fiscal year with a weak working capital position, a 21% decrease in revenue, and a net loss due to the significant legal settlement expenses. Nonetheless, 2016 and 2017 show a significantly different picture…The investment community has had 3Pea in the penalty box ever since its image was tainted by the events that occurred in 2015. Nonetheless, we believe the Company has paid its dues and has shown significant progress in turning things around. Based on the recent year’s financial results, 3Pea is currently in the best financial shape it has ever been, yet it continues to trade at a deep discount to its 2015 price and well below the valuation of its peers. At the moment, the Company has:We have provided a summary of 3Pea’s key financial metrics further below along with our projections for 2017 and 2018.Historical and Projected EarningsSource: All historical data was pulled from S&P Capital IQ. The 2017 forecast was mainly derived from 3Pea's guidance with our own forecasted earnings for 2018.Debt and Working Capital AnalysisSource: Company data pulled from S&P Capital IQPrepaid debit cards are incredibly flexible and can be used in a loyalty environment (such as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) cards), for corporate purposes (such as paying for per diems while on travel), to facilitate compensation (in lieu of cash or cheques) along with many other uses. The appeal of prepaid cards has also grown as consumers have become increasingly debt averse. This is especially true for the younger generations, as they are progressively looking to escape interest on credit lines and overdraft fees.Allied Market Research projects that the global prepaid card market is anticipated to reach $3,653 billion by 2022, representing a CAGR of 22.7% from 2016 to 2022. The chart below shows the historical growth in the amount loaded onto prepaid cards. The amount loaded onto closed loop cards has grown from $263 billion in 2010 to $343 billion in 2016, while the amount loaded onto open loop cards has grown from $148 billion in 2010 to $254 billion in 2016.Source: Payment Industry intelligenceThis high growth rate bodes well for 3Pea shareholders as it signifies that there is a significant market opportunity with ample size to be shared among larger and smaller players. Although the Company is relatively small in this space, we believe it has built a strong reputation through its comprehensive PaySign solution which will help 3Pea continue to grow its card program portfolio.To properly assess 3Pea’s fair market value and trading multiples, we have compiled a list of comparable public companies with a market cap of $15 billion or less (all data pulled from S&P Capital IQ as of November 16th).Target Price and Fair Value AnalysisOur target price was found by analyzing 3Pea’s fair value over 3 valuations methods (EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, and P/E) while relying on our 2017 earnings projections. Given we are using 2017 forecasted earnings, we expect the stock price will converge towards this valuation over the next 3-6 months (assuming it will be valued on a TTM basis). Yet, given the stock’s limited liquidity, it may continue to deviate from its intrinsic value until it has received more coverage and that volume has risen to a reasonable amount (one of the major catalysts to this could be an up-listing). It should also be noted that these target prices are based on the Company meeting its guidance for the current fiscal year ($15-15.5M in revenue with margins projected as seen below).Source: Revenue derived from the mid-point of 3Pea's guidance with the remainder of the variables derived from the assumptions noted below. We have also included a chart above showing the fair value ranges based on each method's lowest, highest, and median/mean multiple. As displayed, even when we use the lowest multiples in our comp set, 3Pea’s fair value is higher than its current price in almost every valuation method. Although it would be unlikely for the Company's shares to trade near the high end of this valuation range, it provides an indication of the wide range of multiples for companies operating in the payment processing sector. No investment comes without risks. Before investing, please consider the following Company specific risks.Liquidity and Volatility Risk:3Pea is considered a micro-cap company, and its shares trade on the over the counter market. As such, liquidity is often very light, and bid-ask spreads are usually quite wide. When investing in companies of this size, you should typically have a longer-term investment horizon with no expectation of exiting your position in the near term or at the current market price. Companies of this size often experience higher than average volatility and can easily increase or decrease with small volume trades.Execution Risk:Although 3Pea has shown that its management team can execute and demonstrate earnings growth over the past years, there is no guarantee that the Company will continue to perform in this manner going forward. Given 3Pea is considered a smaller Company each member of the management team plays a much larger role in ensuring the Company’s success. Any retirement or departure of these key individuals could impact the future viability of the business. Furthermore, the Company is undergoing a significant ramp-up in card programs, properly managing this growth, and the on-boarding of new clients is necessary to minimize churn and ensure a sustained growth rate going forward.Political/Regulatory: The financial sector is an especially strongly regulated industry. Any future adverse policy or regulatory changes could impact 3Pea’s business model and operations. Although the current government has expressed a willingness to deregulate the financial industry, its unpredictability in regards to public policies makes future corporate policy changes hard to determine.Data integrity/Legal Risk:As seen by the recent Equifax (NYSE:EFX) data breach, financial companies such as 3Pea deal with a substantial amount of confidential information. Any data security breach could lead to a significant lawsuit, impair the Company's image, and cause an adverse impact on 3Pea's operating revenue and future growth prospects. The Company also depends on many third party service providers to properly operate its business. Any failure in properly rendering these services could impact 3Pea's ability to perform optimally or could damage the Company's reputation. Additionally, any potential lawsuit, legal fees, or settlement could impair the Company's working capital position and may require 3Pea to seek additional means of financing.Competition Risk:The payment processing sector is an extremely competitive environment. There are many large well-capitalized companies that operate in this sector and that could impair 3Pea’s ability to succeed. Although 3Pea has found a niche in certain subsectors of the prepaid card industry, there is no guarantee that it will be able to continue to hold its market share or be able to maintain its margins over the long term.Earnings Volatility Risk:As seen in prior years, when the Company takes on certain types of card programs, revenue may be recognized as a lump sum or in a non-recurring manner. Although the Company's focus is to increase recurring revenue sources, 3Pea may take on other types of card programs which may not have a recurring revenue model. These programs may cause volatility in 3Pea's future earnings on a quarterly and yearly basis.Based on our analysis, 3Pea International represents a true value play in the payment processing industry. The Company is in one the best financial positions it has ever been, with sustained growth, a positive bottom line, sufficient working capital, and no debt. 3Pea is projecting record earnings for the 2017 fiscal year with major growth in card programs under management. Using comparable company multiples, 3Pea’s fair value using 2017FY projected earnings is ~$1.40/share (~107% increase from the current share price). Though, if the Company’s 2017 growth rate persists into 2018 the Company's fair value could exceed $2/share over the next 12-16 months.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3084806,48411,2015-04-21T06:22:17-04:00,TPNL is a name that high net worth Seeking Alpha readers can't afford to not consider ownership in.TPNL has a superb model that is already at scale infrastructurally and is being grown into from a revenue standpoint.This has led the company to be able to become FCF positive at an early stage with no end in sight to its lumpy growth.TPNL realized operating and FCF generation in excess of 100% of its operating and net income lines - a rare realization in any space let alone the microcap space.Follow the TPNL story as I take readers deeper than initiation over the next few months - this name is set to move in a big way in 2015.,"3Pea International, Inc. (OTCQB:TPNL) is a low volume prepaid debit card payment solutions provider as well as an integrated payment processor that trades over the counter. Shares are volatile and primarily trade only around earnings entirely, it is my belief, as a result of a lack of awareness. TPNL participates in an attractive, neglected, low competition, high total addressable market space that has been hot for M&A as of late. With the single largest player in the space looking to exit as a result of regulatory evolutions and as a result of not being able to service this small revenue segment of its wider total spectrum the next two largest players in the space have been looking to acquire names with the financial profiles of TPNL. I view TPNL as an immediate acquisition target for names like Blackhawk Network Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAWK) and Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) as well as countless other names on the private side. However, and I want to underline this, the TPNL bull case is in no way dependent on an acquisition. TPNL's financials are growing at absurd rates that should continue to expand via external market share capture and internal cohort organic growth. TPNL is one of the most attractive, early stage, growth microcaps I have come across in the last several years. Regardless of share trading activity, I view TPNL as an immediate buy and accumulate.TPNL, as alluded to above, offers prepaid card solutions and processing services The slides below concisely outline the business at TPNL:As these services are generally widely understood, I'll leave the explanation of them very short. However, one should note when looking to add TPNL to a portfolio that it is vertically integrated which allows for much better margins than comparable peers and for what I believe are higher levels of retention. Based on cohort data that is evidenced in TPNL's investor presentation retaining customers has historically led to higher revenues at zero or little cost per customer acquisition (specifically referring to the new revenues on top of the revenues TPNL acquired via deployment of S&M expenses). I believe vertical integration and retention to be two very powerful and not well-known drivers of the financials. That said, I expect both of these to allow for upside performance when it comes to revenue generation and to forward-looking growth as I don't believe organic, follow on revenue growth from existing customers can accurately be modeled at this point.Also, it should be noted that TPNL has several other near-term revenue verticals, outside of the RX and Plasma verticals detailed above - the misunderstanding and lack of information in regards to these verticals is another reason I believe shares don't trade at fair value - that should create both a greater awareness of the company and a continuation of the rapid growth rates experienced recently. Simply put, when TPNL enters (for instance) the ""auto dealership"" vertical, I anticipate total monetized transaction count to rapidly accelerate which should allow TPNL revenues to expand quickly. Also, the rapid increase to overall customer count and the further nationalization of the company's footprint should create opportunities to realize greater economies of scale and general advantages that come with size.As for the financials, TPNL positions itself as one of the most attractive microcap stories in recent memory for me. The financials are almost unbelievable but certainly remarkable.TPNL has a strong balance sheet:Having ~$3.9 million in C&CE with ~$1.0 million in debt and ~$700,000 in AP TPNL's balance sheet is steady and has been well managed. TPNL has been able to grow its income statement and statement of cash flows without the use of essentially any leverage, without taking on risky Goodwill, and without delaying payables. I can't fully express how rare that is for a microcap.As for TPNL's income statement, this is where the story enters into the neighborhood of fantastical fantasy:For simplicity's sake, I've outlined the important line item growth rates below:You can see that TPNL has been able to realize an incredible amount of operating leverage Y/Y. This is a result of operating a business that requires very little expense to maintain once the infrastructure is in place (clearly, it is) and of having a business of very high margins. Y/Y revenue growth of 63.4% was able to drive 156% Y/Y gross profit growth, 311% Y/Y operating income growth, and 327% Y/Y net income growth. Again, this was done without the use of leverage and without the need to operate into a deep net loss. These of course led to 19.8% improvements to gross margins, 16.1% improvements to operating margins, and 15.7% improvements to net margins Y/Y. The actual margin profiles are listed above. Again, I can't stress that these results should actually improve (from a margin perspective) Y/Y as TPNL matures and scales up. This is assuming zero internal organic growth from existing cohorts and zero entry into ancillary verticals.The final financial statement might be the most bullish of all and is an illustration of the benefits of having a high growth business that requires little expenses to maintain and that has high margins - the minimal expenses being the key. The cash flow statement at TPNL is one that shows outstanding operating cash flow growth Y/Y while having substantially little CAPEX:TPNL at just ~$25 million in market cap and ~$18 million in EV generates ~$3.08 million in operating cash flow and ~$2.941 million in free cash flow. Yes, you read that correctly. This means that TPNL ex. acquisitions is self-funding. Yes, you read that right as well. TPNL should not need to tap the debt or equity markets for anything other than an acquisition. At EFY2015 C&CE balance, it could likely finance a roll-up acquisition with cash if it wanted to. That's a rare and outstanding level of flexibility to own in a microcap name.I've outlined how TPNL's operating and free cash flow stack up against income statement line items, operating income and net income. I've seen instances of a company being able to generate operating and FCF in excess of 100% of net and operating income at this size only a handful of times in my entire career:I recommend readers consider TPNL for an immediate long position. Full disclosure, I have been recommending and covering TPNL for CapGainr.com subscribers and I and my book of subscribers are long this name at lower pricing. Still, I definitely do believe this stock moves higher and higher for as long as it remains a stand-alone company. As its financials continue to improve its buyout sticker price will only get larger and larger and that might be, based on its inconsistent volume, the most likely scenario of being able to cash out shares all at once at a large multiple. That said, I think for those high net worth investors or those investors looking for a name to stash away in an IRA that TPNL is a great option that will continue to work well.RisksGood luck everybody.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

The company has never been stronger.The company is currently trading for a very deep undervaluation and in the most recent quarter, revenues have increased >80%.There are double digit margins and revenue growth. Debt is low and FCF is high. These are rare attributes for a microcap stock.Insiders own >70% of the shares outstanding. Compensation packages are conservative.The company has recently broken into the automotive sector. This is a huge market that can cushion the seasonal lumpiness of revenues.","3Pea International (OTCQB:TPNL) is a deep value stock in a very attractive/growth industry. Revenues are driven by macro tailwinds (the acceptance of prepaid cards) on a domestic and global level. The balance sheet is very clean and the company can fund all existing operations via FCF. In the past few months the stock price has tanked >70% on virtually no negative information (oh Mr. Market and your bipolar mood swings). From a business owner's standpoint, the company has never been stronger, and it continues to improve. TPNL is a rare find in the microcap market.SummaryTPNL offers prepaid debit card payment programs and other processing services. Customers include corporate businesses, Fortune 500 companies, large pharmaceuticals, prestigious universities and social media companies. The products the company markets and sells is under their PaySign Brand. Furthermore, the PaySign Brand helps customers; streamline operations, reduce costs, and increase revenues.There are two different kinds of cards TPNL sells; reloadable and non-reloadable cards-Reloadable Cards: These cards are mainly issued by employers to give to an employee via payroll (saves money in the long-run over the old way of paying via check). They are also used for government benefits; federal or state tax refunds.-Non-Reloadable Cards: These cards are only active until the money on the cards are spent. Generally used as gift or incentive cards. These are the types of cards that are issued by plasma centers, healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical assistance, corporate and incentive rewards and expense reimbursements.What Attracts Me to the Company?I am attracted to TPNL due to its deep absolute undervaluation, its history of posting high returns (double digit margins across the board), and recent huge quarterly revenue growth. TPNL also has a decent cash position, very good cash flow and there is very little debt on the balance sheet. The business model is extremely simple to understand and the business model is scalable. Finally there are macro tailwinds for reloadable ATM/prepaid card financial products.What is going on TPNL…are you OK?From April 21st, until now, shares of TPNL have fallen a dramatic >70%. Has TPNL's business value really dropped >70% in less than one year? Maybe investors were over enthused about the progress TPNL had recently that they started to run up the share price, thus paying for forward expectations and growth. If the former was true, then maybe the share price reverted back to its intrinsic value. All in all, the share price of TPNL is now in deep value territory. Let's figure out what has been happening in the past, for this may be the perfect picking time.We know that the share price started to increase from March 18th up until April 21st, when it peaked. In that time period there was a 10-K filed and the announcement of the break through into the automotive sector. What I find interesting, which is maybe just a coincidence, is that on April 21st, Dallas Salazar, wrote a bullish article on TPNL, via Seeking Alpha.Initiating 3Pea International: FCF Positive, High Growth And Operating LeverageSince the article the stock price has tanked. We do know the following…In my opinion, I believe that the value of TPNL's business model is worth more today than it was when the share price peaked on April 21st. Attentive microcap investors can now pick this company up for a deep value price, and wait for the market to realize the value behind the business model again. The selloff was a huge overreaction by Mr. Market, on virtually no negative information.Note: There was a lawsuit by PSKW, but this was settled on decent terms. TPNL will pay PSKW $2.5mm all together for the next 18 months.Is the Growth Sustainable?A very important question that must be asked and answered, in order to determine if TPNL is an investable security is; can the recent growth continue? More importantly, is TPNL's business model sustainable in the face of rapid technology changes? Or is their business model set up to die in the next 3-5 years? This portion of the research article will delve into the past growth that TPNL has exhibited, and it will dig further into if this growth can continue. If the growth can continue, buying TPNL at the current price could be a very good deal.All numbers in millions expect for per share itemsFrom 2012-2014, revenues have increased at a 15.38% annualized rate. The increase in revenues in the past three years derives itself from an increase in incentive reward programs, healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance, and donor payments from plasma centers. Going forward, I am expecting revenues to increase via the four former revenue sources and from the automotive sector and overseas (the European Union). Finally, as the company continues to utilize their PaySign platform, investors will start to see higher margins (this is already happening).In 2014 cost of revenues equaled 45% of consolidated sales. However, in 2013, cost of revenues equaled 65% of consolidated sales. TPNL's business model is extremely scalable. For investors who are not aware of what comprises the cost of revenues I have provided a quick list; transaction processing fees, data connectivity and data center expenses, network fees, bank fees, card production costs, customer service and program management expenses, application integration setup, and sales and commission expense.What I really like about TPNL is that they do not require a huge capex budget in order to secure future revenues. Thus, capex does not need to increase at a dramatic rate in order for revenues to increase. As time passes, investors will start to see more resources being devoted to the increase in sales and marketing (happening now) and an increase in SG&A for a planned expansion into Europe (SG&A is already up due to this planned expansion). Investors should realize that the company may raise capital in the future (debt or equity) in order for it to expand rapidly overseas in Europe. The company has said that they could expand into Europe without raising capital, but the expansion would not be as rapid.Since 2011, TPNL has been able to post a profitable year (on an EPS standpoint), every year. Not only have they been profitable on an EPS standpoint in the past, but the company has also posted positive FCF every years (except for 2013). As the company continues to grow its revenues and streamline its whole business model to the PaySign platform, you will continue to see margins increase. However, margins may be squeezed from higher SG&A expenses going forward, due to the speculated expansion in Europe.But can growth be continued going forward. Before we can answer that question, let's first take a look at the following statistics.According to the 2013 Federal Reserve Payments Study, growth in prepaid card payments increased at the fastest rate from 2009 to 2012 when compared to credit, debit, ACH and checks. In this period prepaid debit transactions grew at a rate of 15.8% annually, reaching 9.2 billion transactions in 2012. Transactions on prepaid cards have a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30.7% in the years 2003-2012, and a CAGR of 15.8% during the 2009 to 2012 time frame.Source: Expected Prepaid GrowthNote: The map above shows the Projected Open-Loop Prepaid Growth 2010 - 2017. As you can see, the worldwide growth potential for companies like TPNL are huge.So we know that there has been growth in prepaid cards in the past, and the growth is more than likely to continue going forward. What exactly fuels this growth though? A few reasons on why prepaid cards are gaining popularity are; easy money management services, insufficient qualifications for credit cards, identity concealment, transferable payments, tangible gifts, and lower costs (compared to other payment methods). The prepaid card industry has done well in addressing certain population segments (mostly younger people and welfare recipients), but the industry is still in its infancy. Overall, I believe that the growth in the prepaid card industry will continue to grow going forward. The industry is still in its infancy, there is strong demand for TPNLs products (domestically and internationally), and the company has a ton of ability to continue growing (positive FCF). I have provided a few good reading sources for investors interested in learning more about the prepaid card industry below.A LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL FOR GLOBAL PREPAID GROWTH BY 2017The Global Prepaid Card Market: Trends, Drivers and ProjectionsThe 2013 Federal Reserve Payments StudyValuationWe can clearly see that TPNL is undervalued on an absolute basis…Comparing TPNL on a comp basis is not really possible, since there are not many competitors in this industry (who are public at least) and the ones who are public have different business units that can distort a clear comparison (also a lot of competitors a much larger). One competitor, Payment Data Systems (PYDS) has a similar business model, but their stock price is also severely undervalued. We can do an individual valuation for TPNL on the basis that the company has a ton of potential to be trading at a much higher multiple in the future. I have provided the model below.All numbers in millions except for per share items.Note: I choose to leave the debt at zero since it is already very low to begin with.I believe that TPNL has a ton of potential to be trading with a multiple of 4.0x and post EBITDA of $4.00mm in the next year or two. First, the company has a clean balance sheet (they will not be held down by debt burdens). Secondly, the company is in a growth industry and has been and will most likely continue to see top line growth going forward. Thirdly, TPNL is profitable on an EPS and FCF basis (remember as the company has a very scalable business model). Finally, a multiple of 4.0x is a very conservative multiple for a growth company. As time passes and investors realize the story behind TPNL, I would be very surprised to see the company be trading with a multiple of 4.0x.ManagementMark Newcomer, is the Co-Founder of TPNL and has been the Chairman, President and CEO since 2006. In his college days, Newcomer attended Cal-Poly San Luis Obispo in which he majored in Bio-Science. Newcomer can be described as an entrepreneur specifically within the financial service industry. He has private and public company experience that he can bring to the table in operating TPNL. Newcomer's conservative salary, for 2014, is shown below.Source: SalaryWhat I like about management is that they are heavily invested into the success of TPNL. Check out the ownership structure.Source: 2014 Annual ReportNewcomer owns the biggest chunk of TPNL and not only does he own a big chuck but other important insiders also own big chunks. There is a huge incentive for management to continue to deliver going forward.Overall, there is not much information floating around the internet on the managing team of TPNL. I learned a decent amount reading the annual and quarterly reports, and management seems candid/competent. I do believe that the current management team has more than enough ample room to continue delivering profitable results for shareholders.RisksThe biggest risk in my opinion is margins getting squeezed by further competition into the industry. Right now TPNL is operating with very attractive margins. However, there are not many competitive barriers to entry that can stop other companies from stealing TPNL's very profitable business model. There is really nothing stopping a much larger competitor from coming in and offering much lower prices. This will give management a run for their money in which they will need to lower prices going forward. The bottom line will be hindered. However, another company may see the value of TPNL's already established business and offer a decent premium to buy it out. In the past, companies have paid >30x sales for similar businesses.Another risk is the event of shareholder dilution. Management has said recently that they may raise capital to fund an expansion into Europe. If management chooses to raise capital via equity offering, existing shareholders will get diluted. If the company chooses to use debt to fund an expansion in Europe, that is also a risk in it of itself. Investors should realize that the company will either issue stock or raise debt to expand into Europe. Good thing TPNL has high positive FCF.TPNL is also a very tiny company that has a volatile share price. The share price can rocket up or down on zero to no information. You must not have a faint heart, or be emotionally attached to your money if you are going to invest in TPNL. If you can't hold onto a stock for more than a year on average, you may want to pass on investing in TPNL. An investment in this security will most likely be a volatile rollercoaster. Long-term value investors will do well holding this name, but short-term speculators may get burned.The final risk that I think should be talked about is the lumpiness of revenues in TPNL's business model. On a historical basis, the second half of the fiscal year, usually brings in the most business. However, since the company has broken into the automotive industry, this may provide a cushion for when revenues slow down. If you want to read more into the lumpiness of revenues, I suggest you read Salazar's second article on TPNL, found here.I believe that there is a very high margin of safety attached to TPNL's current share price. There may be downside due to expected volatility, however, holding TPNL for the long-run is very attractive.Conclusion…At the current share price, TPNL presents itself as a very attractive microcap security. As I have stated before, the attractiveness comes from; low to no debt, high FCF and margins, high insider ownership, an undervaluation and a very attractive growth industry. The company has a very good historical past of growing revenues and the future looks very bright, especially if they continue to break into the automotive sector and internationally. My conviction is high that TPNL will continue to perform for years to come. Buying at the current price gives you a high margin of safety coupled with potential to grow for years. Long-term deep value investors will do well holding this name.Author's NoteThank you for reading my article on TPNL.

4160694,28961,2018-04-03T07:24:47-04:00,"Fourth quarter results continued to show significant top line growth and continued bottom line profitability.Management's guidance for 2018 calls for growth to meet or exceed the growth experienced in 2017.During the first quarter, the company began taking steps to meet the various requirements to apply for uplisting to a national exchange.The company has recently added several key executives from larger competitors.Despite a recent increase in share price, the company is still valued attractively compared to industry peers.","Back in November, I wrote about why I was accumulating 3Pea International (TPNL). And the stock is up over 80% subsequent to my analysis. The recent increase in share price has been for good reason: Management has executed flawlessly. Growth has continued to accelerate, profitability has increased (despite investing in new hires to support further growth), and according to management, the best is yet to come in 2018.For readers unfamiliar with the company, 3Pea International designs and develops payment solutions, prepaid card programs, and processing services under the PaySign brand name for corporate, consumer, and government applications. The company offers various services, including transaction processing, cardholder enrollment, value loading, cardholder account management, reporting, and customer service.It also develops prepaid card programs for healthcare reimbursement payments, pharmaceutical co-pay assistance, corporate expense and per diem payments, and donor payments for source plasma and automobile dealership incentives, as well as payroll cards, general purpose re-loadable cards, travel cards, and loyalty rewards cards for the hospitality industry.Its principal target markets for processing services comprise prepaid card issuers, retail and private-label issuers, small third-party processors, and small and mid-size financial institutions in the United States and internationally.Last week the company announced fourth quarter and year-end results. Revenues in the fourth quarter 2017 increased 51% to $4.6m. Net income increased 7% to $537,000. The lower growth in the bottom line number is attributable to the company continuing to add administrative staff, invest in infrastructure, and build out various departments to support growth.Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $15,234,091, an increase of $4,817,419 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenue of approximately 46% was primarily due to an increase in the number of new corporate incentive prepaid card products and growth within existing card products.Gross profit in 2017 increased to $6.7 million, or 44.0% of total revenues, compared to $4.5 million, or 43.6% of total revenues in 2016. The Company expects gross profit margins will improve in 2018.Net income in 2017 was $1.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.03 per share in 2016.The Company also provided a shareholder update:Commenting on the results, Mark Newcomer, CEO, stated:The company has also been aggressively adding new employees over the past several months. Many of these employees have been pried away from some much larger and more established payment companies. It's a testament to 3Pea's potential that these employees have left the relative safety of previous positions to join what is currently a tiny company. Some of these recent hires include:Joan Herman - Chief Operating Officer. Previous: Senior Vice President, Payments Division, Sunrise Bank. Served as a Director at Heartland Payment Systems, which was acquired by Global Payments (GPN) in 2015 for $4.3 Billion.Al Negron - Senior Vice President Business Development (Healthcare Vertical). Previous: PSKW (ConnectiveRx). Consulted with some of the most successful brand launch teams and product manufacturers including Alcon, Allergan, Eli Lilly, Novartis, Mylan and Pfizer.Mark Jacobs - Sales Director. Previous: Blackhawk Network (HAWK); currently being acquired by Silver Lake for $3.5 Billion. Previous: Euronet Worldwide (EEFT). Veteran of the prepaid and incentives industry with over 18 years’ experience with achievements in revenue growth, market expansion and new product launches for high-profile clients, including: AAA, Ace Cash, Alcon, Cox Communications, The Hershey Company, QuikTrip, Rent-A-Center and SBC Communications.Eric Trudeau - Chief Compliance Officer. Previous: Director of Card Operations & Risk Management, Global Cash Card. Previous: Sunrise Bank. Veteran of the prepaid industry with over twenty years’ experience. Vast knowledge of regulatory issues and compliance experience.Leslie Remenek - Sales Director. Previous: Hawk Incentives, a Blackhawk Network business. More than 25 years of client leadership experience and achievements in revenue growth, market expansion, and brand recognition for high-profile clients including Eli Lilly and Company, Siemens USA, and Bayer Corporation.Dennis DiVenuta, JD - Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Development. Attorney with 40 years of experience in healthcare, DiVenuta has provided employers and clients with legal counsel and strategic guidance in the deployment of a multitude of largely technology based solutions.When I first wrote about this company last year, my biggest concern was what the growth rate would look like in 2018. When I gave my 12-month $1.50 price target back in November, I was only anticipating a growth rate of about 10-20% in 2018. In fact, my exact wording was:With the company now guiding for revenue growth of 45%+ in 2018 and pursuing an uplisting to a national exchange, it's easy to see why I am increasing my target price. Based on current guidance, I'd expect 2018 revenue to be in the $22m range. I'd also expect EBITDA in the $4-5m range. Companies in this industry tend to receive higher multiples on revenue and EBITDA due to the recurring nature of the revenue and high margins.The average premium on revenue is around 4x and the average EV/EBITDA is around 20x. Companies like Green Dot (GDOT) and Global Payments (GPN) enjoy these premiums despite growth rates that are less than what 3Pea is experiencing. 3Pea is also in a somewhat unique position because many of the smaller companies in this space like Payment Data Systems (PYDS) and JetPay (JTPY) are currently unprofitable.While 3Pea's stock has seen some substantial gains recently, I believe this trend will likely continue. 2018 is shaping up to be a great year for 3Pea, and with an uplisting to a national exchange on the horizon, it should give way to further gains as more investors become aware of this opportunity. I am increasing my year-end price target to $2.00 from $1.50, roughly 70% higher than current prices near $1.15. This better aligns the company with average industry multiples, despite the fact 3Pea is growing significantly higher than industry averages.I obviously liked this opportunity better when the stock was at lower valuations, but still think there is attractive upside potential from current levels. In fact, I'd say there is probably less risk at current prices than there was a few months ago simply because we have better clarity about the future. The company positioning to get the stock on a major exchange should provide bid support under the stock for the foreseeable future.That said, you never get hit by the train you see coming. Investing in tiny companies is inherently risky and one should only invest in accordance with their own risk tolerance and investment goals. Smaller companies have less margin for error than their larger counterparts, and predicting financial results is often more difficult.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4379693,60561,2020-10-19T08:26:07-04:00,Paychex is a Dividend Contender with 10 consecutive years of dividend growth.Â  Shares currently yield 2.96%.Paychex is carries high margins and generates ample cash flow which it willingly returns to shareholders.The Census Bureau estimates there to be >30 M small-to-medium-sized businesses suggesting a huge opportunity for Paychex over time since their client list is just >680k.Paychex's client count has increased throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing lockdowns to curb its spread.,"Paychex (PAYX) was founded in 1971 and focuses on payroll solutions, human resources and benefits outsourcing for small to medium-sized businesses. The business is fairly sticky once clients are brought into the Paychex ecosystem due to high switching costs pertaining to payroll needing to be right and on time. Once a business gets brought in the risk of switching to a different provider is high due to not wanting to upset their employees with inaccurate paychecks.It's been nearly a year since I last analyzed and initiated a position in Paychex so it's time to take another look at what I believe is an excellent company. When I last examined the business the business appeared on the high side of fair value and since that time shares have delivered a paltry 2.05% return.The majority of my capital is invested in companies that have a history of paying and growing their dividend payments. That means I'm primarily invested in established businesses that generate ample cash flow, some of which can be passed on to shareholders via dividends. A lengthy dividend growth streak is far from a guarantee that the business will continue on in the future; however, I do believe that it helps to weed out some of the potential pitfalls that are out there.Image by author; data source Paychex Investor RelationsPaychex is a Dividend Contender with 10 consecutive years of dividend growth. Their streak had been longer; however, growth was paused during the Great Recession in 2007-09. While I want to see the businesses I own grow their dividends each and every year, I am a bit more tolerant of freezes of dividend growth especially given the severity of the situation during that time coupled with Paychex's aggressive cash return policy as can be seen later with their elevated payout ratios.Dating back to 1994, the year over year dividend growth rate has ranged from 0.0% to 80.0% with an average of 18.7% and a median of 10.5%.Of the 22 rolling 5-year periods over that time, annualized dividend growth has ranged from 2.2% to 50.0% with an average of 18.1% and a median of 14.0%.There's been 17 rolling 10-year periods over that time and annualized dividend growth has ranged from 6.0% to 30.0% with an average of 16.1% and a median of 11.7%.The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year period dividend growth rates since 1994 can be found in the following table.Table and calculations by author; data source Paychex Investor Relations*Dividends are growth rates are based off calendar year payouts.When investing in dividend growth businesses, the dividend payout ratio is a quick way to gauge the safety of the dividend payout from a potential freeze or a reduction. Image by author; data source Paychex SEC filingsAs I mentioned earlier, Paychex was forced to pause their dividend growth, although they did maintain their dividend level, during the financial crisis. The reason they had to freeze it is because of the elevated payout ratio that Paychex carries in normal times.The average payout ratio based on net income for the last 10 years is 82% and for the most recent 5 years it's 80%. The average free cash flow payout ratios are 71% and 70%, respectively.When I invest my savings into a business I try to take the approach of being a partner in the business which means I'm looking to own the business for the long haul. As such, my perception of the business quality plays a big role in the investment decision process in conjunction with the valuation currently offered in the market. However, before looking forward I like to see how the business has done across a variety of metrics over prior years.Image by author; data source Paychex SEC filingsOver the last decade Paychex has shown solid growth with revenues climbing 99% in total or ~7.9% annualized. Top line growth has materialized through a combination of organic expansion as well as through acquisitions.Operating income has grown 98% over the same time or ~7.9% annualized. Cash flow from operations rose 101% in total or ~8.1% annualized. Meanwhile, free cash flow grew 114% or approximately 8.8% annualized. Image by author; data source Paychex SEC filingsPaychex has maintained excellent gross margins with the 10-year average sitting at 70.2% and the 5-year average at 69.7%.With operating and free cash flow both outpacing revenue growth over the last decade, it should come as no surprise that margins have increased. My preference is to see a free cash flow margin greater than 10% which Paychex has easily surpassed with a 10-year average of 29.8% and a 5-year average of 31.0%.My profitability metric of choice is the free cash flow return on invested capital which represents the excess cash that could theoretically be pulled from the business based on the capital currently invested in the business. Image by author; data source Paychex SEC filingsPaychex has managed excellent FCF ROICs over the last decade with every year being greater than 30% which is well above my preference of at least 10% FCF ROIC. The 10-year average FCF ROIC sits at 41.8% with the 5-year average at 43.4%. Paychex's FCF ROIC took a hit in FY 2019 due to the Oasis Outsourcing acquisition.To understand how Paychex uses its free cash flow, I calculate three variations of the metric, defined below:Ideally, the business would be generating plenty of cash flow through its operations to support the entire capital allocation process including capital expenditures, dividends, buybacks and acquisitions. That means I want to see a positive FCFaDB over time; although, I'm not concerned about any year any particular that could be in the red since opportunities can be short-lived. Image by author; data source Paychex SEC filingsOver the last decade, Paycheck has generated $8.77 B in cumulative FCF. That's allowed management to return $6.17 B to shareholders through cash dividend payments and puts the cumulative FCFaD at $2.60 B.With that $2.60 B in FCFaD management has further returned $1.08 B of cash in total via share buybacks. That puts the cumulative FCFaDB at $1.52 B for the entire decade.When funded with internally generated cash flows, buybacks can be a wonderful way for companies to return cash to shareholders. Unfortunately, the $1.08 B Paychex has spent on share repurchases hasn't done much to reduce the share count. Diluted weighted shares outstanding have only declined 0.4% in total over the last decade or ~0.04% annualized. Image by author; data source Paychex SEC filingsConsidering that's ~12% of the cumulative FCF that Paychex has generated that's pretty disappointing. The lackluster share repurchases suggests dilution from either stock-based compensation, $336 M in total over the last decade, or the various acquisitions that Paychex has completed.As an investor in the equity portion of a business, the balance sheet is of crucial importance to protecting your investment. The reason being that debt introduces a level of risk.Paychex had eschewed debt in their capital structure up until FY 2019 with the Oasis Outsourcing Acquisition accounting for much of the debt that is currently on the balance sheet. Image by author; data source Paychex SEC filingsAdditionally I like to examine the debt ratios across EBITDA, operating income and free cash flow to see how quickly debt could be reduced if need be. Paychex's debt-to-EBITDA, debt-to-operating income and debt-to-free cash flow ratios are at 0.5x, 0.6x and 0.7x, respectively, for the most recent fiscal year. Image by author; data source Paychex SEC filingsFor valuing potential investments, I use several methods to determine what I believe is a fair value range. The methods I use are the minimum acceptable rate of return, ""MARR,"" dividend yield theory and a reverse discounted cash flow analysis.The MARR analysis requires you to estimate the future earnings and dividends that a business will generate, apply a reasonable terminal multiple on those earnings and then determine whether the expected return exceeds your hurdle rate.On average, analysts expect Paychex to show earnings per share for FY 2021, ending May 2021, of $2.82 with FY 2022 EPS to be $3.06. Analysts also expect Paychex to show 3.4% annual EPS growth over the next 5 years. I then assumed that Paychex could manage 4.0% annual earnings growth for the following 5 years. Dividends are assumed to target an 80% payout ratio.I like to use history as a guide to determine what the future multiple could be for Paychex. As you can see in the following YChart, market participants have typically valued Paychex's TTM EPS between ~15x to 30x.Data by YChartsThe following tables show the potential internal rates of return that an investment in Paychex could provide across the various terminal multiples given that the assumptions laid out above are reasonably close to how the future plays out. Returns include forecast dividends taken in cash and are calculated with a purchase price of $83.73, Friday's closing price. Returns are run through the end of calendar year 2025, ""5-Year,"" and calendar year 2030, ""10-Year.""Alternatively, I calculated the required purchase targets in order to generate the returns that I desire from my investments, once again if the assumptions laid out above are reasonably close to what comes to pass. My baseline hurdle rate is a 10% IRR, but I will also examine 8% and 9% levels as well.Dividend yield theory is built on the concept of reversion to the mean. The idea behind this valuation method is that stable businesses can deviate from fair value, but over time will revert towards a fair dividend yield level. I'll be using the 5-year average dividend yield as the proxy for the fair value of Paychex.Image by author; data source Paychex Investor Relations and Yahoo FinancePaychex shares currently offer a dividend yield of 2.96% compared to the 5-year average yield of 3.16%.I use a reverse discounted cash flow analysis as a reality check to see what the current share price implies about investors' growth expectations. It's a way to reverse engineer the expected cash flows that would be needed to support the current share price. I use a simplified DCF built on revenue growth, a static EBIT margin of 38.0% and one that increases by 10% over the 20-year period to 41.8%, a tax rate of 24% and a 4% terminal growth rate. I use both a 10% and an 8% hurdle rate to discount the cash flows back to the present.In the 8% hurdle rate scenario with the static EBIT margin, Paychex needs to manage 4.5% annualized revenue growth to support the price. The required revenue growth drops to 4.2% to justify the current price for the 8% hurdle rate and 10% EBIT margin improvement. The required revenue growth for the 10% hurdle rate scenarios are 7.2% and 6.7%, respectively.Paychex is an excellent business with gross margins around 70% and free cash flow margins around 30%. That leads to gobs of excess cash flow that can be returned to shareholders and which management has been more than willing to do with a target of paying out 80% of net income.Dividend yield theory suggests a fair value range between $71 and $87. The fair value based on the MARR analysis with a 10% IRR hurdle rate appears to be in the $50 to $60 range. While the fair value with an 8% IRR hurdle rate would be in the $60 to $70 range.The reverse discounted cash flow analysis isn't throwing up any red flags with 8% returns easily justified on what I believe would be low expectations. The possibility of 10% returns aren't out of the ordinary either if growth can continue on at slightly lower rates as it has over the last decade.A back of the envelope calculation for the compounding rate of the business using ROIIC and the reinvestment rate puts the business compounding its value by ~7-8% annually over the last decade.What's really amazing considering how hard small-to-medium sized businesses were hit during the COVID-19 lockdowns is that Paychex showed an increase for Q1 year over year from ~670,000 clients to >680,000. It's not a huge increase, but it does show solid client growth when many businesses were forced to shutter.The question then becomes what are the reinvestment possibilities. The payroll solutions and HR space is highly fragmented which is where the growth possibilities reside. According to the US Small Business Association, there are 31.7 M small to medium-sized businesses. Paychex is the 2nd largest player in the HR/payroll outsourcing space with 680,000 clients at the end of Q1 2021 or ~2.1% of the SMB's out there.In the Q1 2021 investor presentation, management is now expecting a bit of a rebound compared to their initial FY 2021 guidance. That's good to see, even if expectations are still for declines across the board.FY 2021 1st Quarter Investor PresentationThere's obviously a risk that the small-to-medium sized businesses will struggle if the COVID-19 risks inflate during the fall and winter and of course those businesses will also be more sensitive to swings in the direction of the economy. However, this business formation statistic from the Census Bureau does give hope that the worst could be behind us.Census Bureau Business ApplicationsGiven the current valuation of Paychex, I'm hesitant to significantly increase my position. However, I do feel comfortable enough with the valuation to continue on with my dollar-cost average approach.Interested investors could sell put options if they have cash earmarked for an investment in Paychex. Selling puts is a way to be the insurance company wherein you collect premium upfront in exchange for the potential liability of having to purchase the shares at some point in the future.The $77.50 strike option looks intriguing at the current mid-point of $1.98. Writers of the contract would take on the potential risk of having to purchase 100 shares per contract sold at a price of $77.50, but receive $198 per contract. That works out to either purchasing shares at $75.53, ~10% lower than current levels, or receiving a 2.5% return in approximately 2 months' time which works out to a 16% annualized return. In my opinion, that's not a bad tradeoff."
4378886,105510,2020-10-13T14:13:34-04:00,"Paychex reports better-than-expected 1Q21 results on record client retention, as well as cost-cutting initiatives.The full-year guidance is heavily weighted toward 2H but looks achievable at first glance.But client retention and pricing pressure amid a challenged macro backdrop represent key risks.At the current multiple, the risk/reward makes little sense to me.","Paychex (PAYX) posted a relatively strong quarter in 1Q21, but this was largely expected following the positive commentary heading into earnings. The key disappointment, in my view, was the lack of margin expansion - even with the range of cost-cutting initiatives implemented this quarter. And with limited incremental room for cost cuts ahead, margins should remain under pressure going forward. Coupled with the elevated multiple and limited upside catalysts, I see little reason to buy into the stock at these levels.Paychex reported 1Q21 revenue of $932m (-6% YoY), well above both consensus estimates and guidance for high-single to low-double-digit declines. The 1Q21 strength was largely down to record client retention, as well as strong digital engagement with prospective and existing clients. By segment, both the Management Solutions (-5% YoY) and PEO/Insurance businesses (-7% YoY) experienced declines but remained largely resilient through COVID-19 driven headwinds.On an adjusted basis, EBITDA came in at $365m, implying a relatively strong 39.1% margin, as lower discretionary spending, effective cost control initiatives (which are tracking ahead of schedule), and the revenue outperformance contributed. Backed by the improved margins, adjusted diluted EPS reached $0.63.Source: Investor PresentationTotal revenue is now expected to decline 2%-4% YoY (a slight improvement from the 2%-5% decline guided previously). Things are expected to pick up toward the second half of the fiscal year, with revenue guided to improve toward flat to low-single-digits growth YoY. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance also improved to down 6%-8% YoY (improving from the 6%-10% YoY decline guided previously) for FY21. Both the revenue and earnings guide beat consensus expectations.Source: Investor PresentationAlong with the updated guidance, management now feels good about the operating performance thus far in 1H21, which is positive. But a large portion of the guide now rests on the back half of the fiscal year, specifically 4Q. That said, the revised outlook sets an achievable bar, in my view, as management essentially took up the low-end of the guidance range on the positive 1Q performance, but left the high end in place.There could even be upside potential, given a new round of stimulus is not currently assumed in PAYX's outlook. But on the flip side, management's commentary that 40-45% of businesses surveyed are expressing the need for another stimulus round indicates retention risk across PAYX's client base in the coming quarters.Despite the pandemic, PAYX's client retention is still running at record levels, with its service model and the rollout of timely new features such as its loan forgiveness estimator playing a key role. Additionally, I think the more benign competitive backdrop has also contributed - while competition used to drive ~50-60% of client attrition, management expects less of a competition headwind, instead highlighting that most of the losses will come from bankruptcies or suspensions.While evidence this year would seem to support the secular case for low-touch software platforms accelerating disruption of longer-standing HCM/Payroll incumbents, PAYX is not yet out of the woods as elevated business failures look set to emerge as the key client retention headwind in FY21.Embedded within the updated guidance is the expectation for modestly increased prices for select clients in 2H, when the company anticipates businesses will recover. This would seem to make sense, but I believe raising prices will still be difficult given PAYX's focus on small and medium enterprises (SMBs). Evidence from the first wave of COVID-19 has indicated that SMBs tend to suffer disproportionately, and with a second wave looking increasingly likely, I think maintaining pricing will be challenging.My base case remains for a dip in client retention off the current record-high levels, particularly given the company has itself highlighted the weakness in the current economic backdrop (management guided toward a further drop off in employment without another round of fiscal stimulus). While a second round of stimulus would represent potential upside to guidance, I think the case for price increases this year is difficult and will likely only be limited to a smaller percentage of customers.In 1Q21, PAYX recognized ~$31m of one-time charges related to cost-saving initiatives, highlighting the extent of the operating leverage available from these initiatives. That said, there is limited room for more cost-cutting from here, given the original target of ~$40m of charges. Additional expense saves could add slightly to the operating margin, all else equal, but the case for further margin expansion is far from straightforward. Between greater PEO/Insurance contribution, as well as the return of costs that were halted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the path back to an operating margin in the high-30s % will be challenging.PAYX has executed well through the COVID-19 pandemic, and 1Q21 was a case in point. But the road gets harder from here, and the recovery path (both growth and margin) into FY21 looks highly uncertain, in my view, implying little reason to get bullish from a fundamental perspective. Plus, the elevated multiple and limited upside catalysts also keep me neutral. Key downside risks include macro factors such as bankruptcies and business starts, as well as the interest rate outlook, while execution risk surrounding Oasis also looms large."
4335823,105417,2020-04-03T09:47:35-04:00,"We remain constructive on PAYX shares and reiterate our BUY rating.
        Organic revenue growth remains robust, with middle single digit traction expected in 2020.
        Capital return remains sold, with dividend yield at approximately 3%.","In this note, we are reviewing Paychex (PAYX) latest earnings results, which came out on March 25. Recall that Paychex is a provider of human capital management (""HCM"") solutions for payroll, benefits, and human resource insurance services for small-to medium-sized businesses, with an outreach to nearly 700,000 clients. The company offers a wide array of services: from payroll processing and tax administration to regulatory compliance and HR solutions. We view PAYX results particularly interesting this time around, for two reasons: first, this is one of the first companies in the payments sector to report results after the initial coronavirus storm; second, PAYX tracks employment and unemployment data, which are in the process of seeing perhaps the largest upheavals since the Great Depression.We remain constructive on PAYX shares and reiterate our BUY rating. The payroll processing space is fairly small, with ADP (ADP) being the only other major competitor. We modify our P/E multiple (on 2020 earnings) of ~28x (down from 34x) in order to account for recent market turmoil. Meanwhile, our EPS estimate for the year 2020 is going up by 9 cents, from $2.96 to $3.05, which we believe says a lot about the company during these difficult times. When we apply the multiple of ~28x to the EPS of $3.05, we get the target price of $86 (down from $99). Organic Revenue Growth Remains Robust: While the firm may advertise its 7% Y/Y top line growth rate, with the revenue reaching $1.143 billion during the quarter, we note that organic rate was 5% Y/Y. Given PAYX's propensity for acquisitions, we actually believe that 5% is still robust and if the company can maintain the range in the 4%-5% band for the rest of the year, PAYX shares should do well.Three Core Drivers Continue to Drive Performance: During the quarter, we saw strong performance from PEO and Insurance Solutions segments, which were powered by Oasis (the deal has anniversaried by now, more on it below), growth in PEO clients, as well as increased number of health and benefits applicants. In addition, Management Solutions was very solid, driven by the growth in client base and higher price realization.Capital Return Remains Bright, As Always: We have stated before that for some investors PAYX is similar to a bond, given the attractive yield of ~3%. During the quarter, the company returned $222 MM in dividends to shareholders. While we have seen a number of companies temporarily forego dividends in light of coronavirus pressures, we do not expect PAYX to be one of them, primarily because payroll processing is not the industry expecting a bailout from the government (As a side note, the payments industry overall is shielded from the bailout ramifications, with capital return stories remaining intact). Number of New Product Launches Should Align Well With the New Reality of Staying-At-Home: This is, of course, a pure coincidence, but we do believe that Paychex recently went on a successful new product spree, which should prove to be conducive to our new reality. Among them are: 1) Paychex Pay on Demand; 2) Paychex Flex; and 3) Paychex Time for Apple Watch. There is no concrete way to quantify the impact of these new services, but they should cumulatively be conducive to the company's brand in the remote environment. Business will definitely use them more as their employees are working from home during the second quarter (and possibly longer).Management Solutions Vertical Remains Robust: We believe that Management Solutions growth will remain around 4.5%-5% Y/Y in the near term, as revenue growth per client (arguably, one of the most important metrics) is improving. At this point, we are not anticipating any new changes because of the virus. Let's Not Forget Oasis:  Much of the PEO performance should come from Oasis, the largest acquisition in the company's history, which (on an organic basis) should deliver as much as a percentage point of growth in 2020. While some headwinds are possible, we do not believe that Paychex will be losing clients because of the downturn. Remember, this is essentially a duopoly between Paychex and ADP, with pricing differences so minimal that defection rates are relatively rare. If anything, the percentage point could grow to 1.1%-1.2% range, helping explain our upward revision in EPS estimates (see valuation). Insurance Services Segment to Moderate: This is the only business that we expect to slow down in 2020, by as much as 300 bps, but this was anticipated, and we commented on the slowdown in our previous December 26th Article. We continue to view possible deceleration as being due to lower workers' compensation insurance rates. We are not modeling any coronavirus impact in this segment because it is not really relevant. We see the following four core risks to our thesis."
4335881,105352,2020-04-03T13:31:40-04:00,We feel we missed a good entry point when the stock price reached its 52-week low at $48 a share not so long ago.Paychex can sustain recent headwinds due to its pristine balance sheet and business model.We are interested in starting a long position at a figure below $50 per share.,"Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is one of those businesses one can call a ""compounder"". Before the Coronavirus pandemic, the company was firing on all cylinders, posting very solid growth rates, increasing operating margins and returns on invested capital.With cities in ""lock-down"" mode, small- to mid-sized business owners are in trouble. This will affect Paychex because it offers its services to those kinds of businesses. On a short time horizon, Paychex is going to be affected. However, its solid balance sheet and plenty of liquidity provide a huge safety net.We are waiting for an entry point below $50 to buy shares in Paychex. At those levels, we would be buying a quality business at a fair price.Paychex is a leading provider of human capital management. The company offers computerized payroll accounting services, direct deposit services, automatic payroll tax payments, tax return filings as well as human resources, benefits, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses (10 to 200 employees). The company has 670K payroll and professional employer organization clients.It works with service agreements that can be terminated by the client upon a very short notice. As of the latest annual report, the company disclosed an 82% retention rate, in line with its historical records.One could think of Paychex as a service platform in which clients can elect to add more services to their current agreement. If, for example, a client first chooses Paychex to take care of their payroll, at a future date, when the business becomes bigger, they might hire Paychex to do additional services such as HR, insurance, or PEO. On the other hand, clients can also opt to do their payroll for themselves, using Paychex's online service platforms. It's this ability to upsell and cross-sell to existing clients that makes the company an interesting business. There is a lot of flexibility in its business model.The company reports under two operating segments: Management Solutions, and PEO and Insurance Services. Management Solutions cover the payroll, employee payment services, and HR administration services. Payroll services within the Management Solutions reporting segment represent approximately 64% of total revenues.The PEO and Insurance segment is self-explanatory. It includes the company's services as a co-employer for its clients and insurance services related to workers' compensation and other insurance offers. In December 2018, the company made a sizeable acquisition when it purchased Oasis, an HR outsourcing service, for $992.2M, financed by $800M in debt notes and cash on hand, expanding its PEO solutions. PEO now accounts for 77% of this segment's total revenue.Paychex's biggest competitor is Automatic Data Processing (ADP), serving roughly 740K clients and with a market cap of 56.7B compared to Paychex's 21.5B market cap.The company recently reported third-quarter numbers on March 25th. It beat on EPS and came in line with revenue expectations. Paychex saw strong revenue growth, continuing its recent trend, at 7% to $1.1B for the quarter. The company is also benefiting from operating leverage, growing operating income at 10% for the quarter. This can be attributed to increasing prices, increase in the client base, upselling opportunities, and the growth in the PEO segment:Source: Investor presentationWhile these results show a company expanding at healthy rates, growth is going to be momentarily halted by the Coronavirus pandemic and economic shutdown. We believe Paychex is more vulnerable to the current environment as it focuses its efforts on small- to mid-sized businesses. These businesses could range from 10 to 200 employees and might include more mom and pop shops with fewer resources than bigger corporations capable of sustaining such headwinds:The amount of damage to Paychex might depend on how much assistance small businesses can get from the government or banks to keep them afloat. Management made comments about its initiatives in the third-quarter call:The company also stated it will be giving guidance on its fourth-quarter earnings call with an outlook for fiscal 2021, but gave investors a preview:Giving guidance could be a double-edged sword since there is so much uncertainty right now, especially since the service agreements Paychex has with these businesses are not long-term contracts and could be terminated in short notice.However, we believe Paychex has some degree of customer captivity which allows it to have huge operating margins and returns on capital:Source: Quickfs.netThe reason we think the company has some degree of customer captivity is that it operates in a very regulated environment. Every year there are new changes in laws, mandates, or local tax regulations. This could add extra work to a business owner besides the usual operation of the business and the complications that will appear along the way. Paychex solves that problem.Once inside its clients' business ecosystem, changing services might be a potential headache for small- and mid-sized business owners since they work directly with payroll, direct deposit to employees and taxes, activities related to the day-to-day operations. This gives Paychex one important competitive advantage: high switching costs.We believe Paychex can sustain recent headwinds due to its pristine balance sheet and business model.As of its latest reported numbers, the company has $953M of debt including operating leases in its balance sheet. The debt maturities are very long term, with $400M due on March 13th, 2026, and the other $400M due on March 13th, 2029. Interest on the debt ranges from 4.12% to 4.29%. Interest expense for the nine-month ended in February was $15.4M. Operating income for the same period stood at $1.2B.As far as liquidity goes, the company had $853M in cash and investments and $1.7B available under different revolving credit facilities.Paychex's business model is also very capital-light, which means low fixed costs and high variable costs. In a time like this, it works in its favor as the company is more likely to align its cost structure with expected revenues. Thus, the impact on operating margins can be contained faster than the capital-intensive businesses.These reasons allow us to be confident that Paychex can sustain the economic hardship.We decided to value Paychex based on an Owner Earnings calculation. We believe it approximates the actual cash flows available to shareholders after paying taxes, bondholders, capital expenditures and changes in working capital. We calculate Owner Earnings as follows:Source: Author estimatesWe also use the 10-year average number to smooth out any cyclicality and it provides us with a more conservative valuation. Using the current number would be too aggressive in our opinion, as it reflects a business on an impressive growth rate.By assuming Paychex can sustain $1.85 in owner earnings, using a cost of equity of 8% and a growth rate of 4%, we value the company at $46.25 per share.With a recent price of $64.42 (at the time of writing), we see Paychex as slightly overvalued. However, we are using very conservative estimates, especially in the growth rate, as the company has been able to grow at higher rates than 4%.We feel we missed a good entry point when the stock price reached its 52-week low at $48 a share not so long ago. Therefore we are just waiting for the market to give us another opportunity to buy.Paychex is a growing business protected by competitive advantages. That growth, however, is going to be impacted in the short to medium term. If one uses a long-term view of the company, it is not hard to imagine Paychex returning to high-single-digit growth rates.We are waiting for a better entry point and would be very interested in starting a long position at a figure below $50 per share. At that price, we would be getting an excellent business at a fair price."
4358660,105510,2020-07-15T14:36:19-04:00,"Record client retention rates seem to have boosted investor optimism after a largely in-line quarter.Given the Paychex story hinges on a recovery which has yet to materialize, the current ~27x fwd P/E multiple seems to be rather optimistic.Additional risks around competition and longer-term SMB health keep me on hold.","With COVID-driven headwinds still front and center, Paychex's (PAYX) recent rally may have come too far, too fast. And amid double-digit unemployment and a low rate environment, I am skeptical that we have well and truly reached the bottom. Though several KPIs have seen steady improvements since late April, any recovery is far from concrete at this juncture, especially given the recent resurgence in COVID-19 cases. My base case remains for an uneven recovery through FY21, which, relative to the lofty ~27x fwd P/E, suggests elevated downside risk relative to expectations. Coupled with additional risks around competition and longer-term SMB health, the risk/reward strikes me as unfavorable at current levels.PAYX delivered a largely in-line 4Q20 print, with revenue of $915m (-6.7% YoY) and adj EPS of $0.61. Lower check volumes and worksite employees (WSE) weighed on the core Management Solutions and PEO segments, while higher interest income from float supported the headline results.Source: Investor PresentationThe key highlight from the quarter, however, was PAYX's client retention, which improved to a record 83%. New business bookings have also been trending positively, although bookings are not quite back to pre-COVID levels. That said, things are certainly trending positively - almost half of PAYX's COVID-19 suspended accounts have come back quickly, while only ~1-2% remain suspended.WSE trends are also improving as states reopen, and the at-risk business in Florida has not seen a material change. Meanwhile, pay-on-demand and real-time pay adoption are also benefiting, although the solutions are not yet driving material revenues. Net-net, these data points support the notion that COVID-19-driven disruptions may not induce any structural shifts in the human capital management (HCM) business.PAYX has also further accelerated cost savings, with $40m of expected one-time charges for 1Q21, mostly related to the ongoing reductions of its geographic footprint. This is a step in the right direction, in my view, and shows flexibility by management in responding to the COVID-19-driven revenue headwinds, which should, in turn, help PAYX defend its margin profile amid a challenging macro backdrop. As of 4Q20, operating margins are down ~60bps, but penciling in the targeted cost savings, management could drive ~3-4%pts of YoY margin expansion heading into FY21, by my estimates.Source: Company FilingsDespite the record retention rate, FY21 guidance for revenue growth of -2% to -5% and adj. op margins of ~34-35% was largely in-line with the outlook provided in late May. By segment, Management Solutions is expected to be down 1-4%, PEO & Insurance Solutions down 2-7%, with float revenues at $55-65m. Bottom line metrics were also in-line with the prior outlook, with adjusted operating margins guided to 34-35% and adj. EPS set for a 6-10% decline.Source: Investor PresentationThe FY21 outlook depicts a tale of two halves - in the upcoming 3-6 months, PAYX is accounting for considerable stress, but heading into 4Q21, management is guiding toward results that are ""much closer"" to a pre-COVID-19 environment. This still strikes me as a tad optimistic, given both the logistical implications (i.e., distancing measures and activity restrictions) and employment improvements needed for a recovery toward the back half of the fiscal year. That said, management is (rightly, in my view) still adopting a wait and see approach with regard to improving retention trends before fully accounting for them in the outlook.On balance, the quarter was mostly positive, and management's bullish commentary pertaining to the state of small businesses was particularly encouraging. From the grim projections at the peak of COVID-19 that ~10% of the customer base would likely close, to the newly revised 1-2% levels, things are clearly moving in the right direction. But, a swift recovery is far from certain, and thus, I would be hesitant to underwrite a concrete employment recovery just yet. Instead, if recent weeks are any indication, the reopening will likely be uneven and subject to change.Bringing it all together, including the stock's current ~27x fwd PE, the PAYX risk-reward does not seem particularly favorable, in my view. Conversely, I see ample room for a downside surprise should the small business recovery slow amid COVID-19-driven disruptions. Coupled with the uncertain near-term pace of recovery, intense competition within the HR technology space, and longer-term risks related to the health of the SMB market are key reasons I would hold off on buying into PAYX at this juncture.Data by YCharts"
4333562,95006,2020-03-23T07:23:47-04:00,"In June of 2019, I warned investors about Paychex's high valuation and suggested investors sell the stock so that they could avoid a big drawdown.Throughout 2019, I suggested a general rotational strategy to help mitigate the dangers of high-quality, overvalued stocks.In this article, I review that strategy and check to see if Paychex's stock is trading near fair value, and I'll also share my potential buy price for the stock.","For the past two years, I have been warning investors about the dangers of overvalued, high-quality stocks and sharing a long-only rotational strategy to help mitigate the dangers of these highly-priced stocks. The basic idea is that when the expected 10-year forward returns of the target stocks (in this case Paychex (PAYX)) get low enough, one rotates out of the stock and into a pair of ETFs with the goal that the ETFs will be more defensive during a downturn. Then, when the price of the target stock falls more than the defensive ETFs, the investor who likes the target company can rotate back in and own more shares than they would have had if they just held the stock the entire time.In my June 22nd, 2019 article, ""Paychex: A 10-Year, Full-Cycle Analysis,"" I made the case that Paychex was a Sell.At the time, my two standard alternative ""default ETFs"" were the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) and the Invesco Mid-Cap Low Volatility ETF (XMLV). I tracked the results of my strategy (along with what would eventually become 42 other stocks I suggested selling due to high valuation this past year). The goal was to rotate half the funds back into Paychex once one could achieve a 20-25% ""free share gain"" and to rotate the other half of the funds back in once the stock was trading at fair value again. (For me, fair value, in this case, was an expected 10-year CAGR of 8%).In this article, I'm going to examine whether it is time for investors who were bullish on Paychex's long-term prospects who rotated out of Paychex back in June, to now rotate back in.SourceNormally, this is a fairly simple process of checking the results of the default ETF versus the target stock, but we had a rare event take place at the end of February where it became clear we were headed for a recession. When that happens, we move all of our ""default ETF money"" into cash. I meticulously documented that in my last update article, ""Going To Cash: Rotational Strategy Update (February 2020)."" The way I'm tracking the results now that the default money has been moved to cash is to calculate the returns on a theoretical $10,000 up to the point it was moved to cash, and then to compare that cash amount (which does not grow when it is held in cash) to the theoretical growth of $10,000 kept in the target stock.In this case, when the money from SPLV and XMLV was moved to cash, it would have been worth $9,506 so it would have been down about -5% over the holding period. But the primary goal of this strategy was to increase our shares in Paychex for free, so let's see what Paychex would have returned.Data by YChartsData by YChartsPaychex's stock has fallen about -38% since my warning article and a $10,000 investment would now be worth $6,138. The money that was first put in SPLV and XMLV, then into cash, would now be worth $9,506. An investor who followed this strategy could now take that $9,506 and buy +54.94% more Paychex stock than they owned back in June. In other words, an investor who owned 100 shares of Paychex's stock on June 22nd, 2019, could now buy 154 shares of the stock without spending any more money. This is above our 20-25% ""free share gain"" goal for the first part of the strategy, and so this part of the rotation is now complete.Paychex now joins eleven previous ""free share gain"" winners in the series so far.The first part of the approach was to rotate back in after a 20-25% ""free share gain"" was possible. The second half of the money is to be rotated back in when the forward 10-year full-cycle CAGR estimate is near fair value at about 8%. So, next, I'm going to run what I call a ""Full Cycle Analysis,"" which is the same analysis I performed back in June that identified Paychex's stock as being overvalued enough to sell. As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the two main drivers of future total returns: Market Sentiment returns and Business returns.In order to estimate what sort of returns we might expect over the next 10 years, let's begin by examining what return we could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. I start the previous cycle around 2007, about a year before the last recession.As I write this, Paychex's forward PE is 16.76 while its normal P/E this past cycle has been 24.40. If, over the course of the next 10 years, Paychex's P/E were to revert to its normal 24.40 level and everything else was held equal, it would produce a 10-year CAGR of about +3.82%. (At the time of my original analysis, this return was expected to be -2.14%.)We previously examined what would happen if market sentiment reverted to the mean. This is entirely determined by the mood of the market and is quite often disconnected, or only loosely connected, to the performance of the actual business. In this section, we will examine the actual earnings of the business. The goal here is simple: We want to know how much money we would earn (expressed in the form of a CAGR %) over the course of 10 years if we bought the business at today's prices and kept all of the earnings for ourselves.There are two main components of this: the first is the earnings yield, and the second is the rate at which the earnings can be expected to grow. Let's start with the earnings yield.Data by YChartsPaychex's forward earnings yield is currently +5.96%. The way I like to think about this is, if I bought the company's whole business for $100, I would earn $5.96 per year on my investment if earnings remained the same for the next 10 years.The next step is to estimate its earnings growth during this time period. I do that by figuring out at what rate earnings grew during the last cycle and applying that rate to the next 10 years. This involves calculating the EPS growth rate since 2007, taking into account each year's EPS growth or decline, and then backing out any share buybacks that occurred over that time period (because reducing shares will increase the EPS due to fewer shares).Let's start by looking at how much shares were reduced since 2007.Data by YChartsPaychex has reduced its shares outstanding by about -6% over the course of this cycle. I'll back these out for earnings growth estimates. When I go back to 2007 through today, I get a cyclically adjusted earnings growth rate of +6.46%, which is a pretty average growth rate.Next, I'll apply that growth rate to current earnings looking forward 10 years in order to get a final 10-year CAGR estimate. The way I think about this is, if I bought Paychex's whole business for $100, it would pay me back $5.96 the first year, and that amount would grow at +6.46% per year for 10 years. I want to know how much money I would have in total at the end of 10 years on my $100 investment, which I calculate to be about $185.53. When I plug that growth into a CAGR calculator, that translates to a +6.38% 10-year CAGR estimate for the expected earnings returns.Potential future returns can come from two main places: market sentiment returns or earnings returns. If we assume that market sentiment reverts to the mean from the last cycle over the next 10 years, it will produce a +3.82% CAGR. If the earnings yield and growth are similar to the last cycle, the company should produce somewhere around a +6.38% 10-year CAGR. If we put the two together, we get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR of +10.20%. Since this expected forward 10-year return is above 8%, Paychex is now trading near what I consider ""fair value,"" and for the purposes of this demonstration of the rotational strategy, an investor could now rotate the second half of the money back into Paychex. Next, let's see how the ""fair value"" portion of the rotational strategy performed.Sometimes, the ""free share gain"" portion of the rotation and the ""fair value"" portion of the rotation meet their goals at different times, and so the returns are different. In this case, the stock price has moved so fast, they met their goals at the same time, thus producing identical gains for both parts of the rotation at +54.94%.Paychex will now join nine previous rotational ""fair value"" winners.And now, this completes the demonstration of the rotational strategy with Paychex. The first half of the rotation gained about 54% more free shares, and the second half also gained about 54% more free shares. I have 33 additional high-quality stocks I'm still tracking, though, so we should have a fairly large sample from which to judge and analyze the strategy in the future.My basic threshold for buying a stock with a margin of safety and good forward returns is for the 10-Year Full-Cycle CAGR to be greater than 12%. But since we are going into a recession, I have a slightly stricter standard that I'm currently applying. First, I want the business's 3-year revenues to have at least appreciated by 10%. So let's check that first.Data by YChartsRevenue looks fine. The next thing I want is for the business earnings portion of the CAGR to be at least 9%, and I also want the PE to be at least within 20% of the PE during the trough of the last recession. These let me know that I'm not relying too much on future market sentiment changes for all of my potential returns, and it tries to get us at least somewhat close to the bottom in terms of PE. (The earnings of these companies will certainly drop over the course of the next year, so using the PE is really just a way to avoid buying way too early if the market has a history of sending the stock really low during recessions. It's not particularly good at picking exact bottoms.)The price at which Paychex will meet all these criteria based on current forward earnings is about $32.50, and that's the price I would, as a value investor, be a buyer of the stock. This isn't a 'target price', as much as it is a price that I think has a greater than 50% chance of occurring during this downcycle.So far, during this downcycle, I have purchased 23 stocks using this method, so plenty of the prices are hitting right now, but there is never any guarantee that all the stocks I'm watching will hit. I'm always trying to strike a balance between the likelihood of getting a lower price, and the likelihood of the price never dropping that far, so the price above is my best attempt to find a good balance."
4338572,95206,2020-04-20T13:30:05-04:00,"Paychex demonstrates exceptionally high quality when looked at from a return on invested capital perspective.Switching costs, scale, cost advantages and a strong niche positioning result in high customer retention rates and sustainable value creation â a wide economic moat.The current valuation offers an opportunity to buy the company for long-term investors, and owners should be ready to ramp up positions on future dips.","We constantly look for opportunities to add high quality companies to our portfolios at attractive prices. Paychex (PAYX) stands out as one of the best companies around with its surprisingly defensive profile backed by sustainable and impressive value creation as demonstrated by its nearly unbelievable return on invested capital. The company complements its strong operational profile with a pristine balance sheet. In short, the company is exactly the type of core position we would like to own in our portfolios, provided valuation is reasonable. This article will walk through the key points of the Paychex investment case and why it is a potential buy today.A quick glance at the company website reveals the following description: Paychex is a recognized leader in the payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing industry, with a steadfast commitment to success and a record of achievement that continues a tradition of delivering excellence. The company was founded in 1971 by B. Thomas Golisano with just $3,000 and a good idea - to make payroll outsourcing easy and affordable for small businesses. From those early days with just one employee, Paychex now has more than 14,000 employees serving more than half a million small- to medium-sized businesses nationwide. Paychex offers an ever-growing variety of payroll and human resource products and services that help clients do what they do best - run their business. With a wide range of services - including payroll processing, retirement services, insurance, and a fully outsourced human resource solution - Paychex customizes its offering to the client's business, whether it is small or large, simple or complex.It's also worth noting that B. Thomas Golisano still owns over 10% of the business and is Chairman of the Board. Investors get an idea about the company's strengths when viewing the numerous awards collected each year.Source: Company Third Quarter Highlights and Financial Results Presentation, Fiscal 2020Companies in the payroll and human resource services industry can build barriers to entry through scale and through high switching costs once a relationship with a client has been developed. Efficient use of information technology and effective marketing are also beneficial. Larger companies have the advantage of being able to service clients with multiple locations or complex needs.Paychex has several barriers to entry, but the most critical is clearly switching costs. Most small and midsize companies want valuable employee time and expertise focused on important strategic and operational activities, rather than administrative tasks. But effective management of payroll, benefits, employee regulations and other employee related functions is absolutely critical. Therefore, it is essential to find a reliable outsourcing partner for these functions. Once the time and effort is invested to find an outsourcing partner, employees are trained, IT resources are organized and confidential information is shared. The company can then continue on growing their business and creating value. There is little chance that any company will then risk payroll or benefit mistakes or want to re-share confidential information just to save a few dollars, especially when so much time and setup costs are involved. These switching costs are why Paychex has a retention rate around 80% with much of the client loss due to bankruptcy or acquisitions.Speaking more broadly about industry positioning, Paychex is one of the largest and most well established payroll and accounting services companies. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is larger, but also tends to focus on larger companies as clients while Paychex has developed a leading position with smaller companies, which usually have about 15 to 50 employees. Building up the customer service assets required to be effective in the industry requires a large initial investment and scale is important to spread fixed costs across numerous clients. Paychex has developed significant scale, a strong and diversified customer service presence, a solid reputation and efficiencies in IT and marketing that help protect its business and profitability. In short, Paychex has substantial barriers to entry which are the basis for its impressive and steady levels of profitability.We want to see high returns on invested capital and solid cash conversion sustainably over time. Well positioned companies in the payroll and human resource services industry benefit from its low capital intensity and have the ability to produce impressive cash-conversion metrics. Paychex is a fantastic example of a company that doesn't need to reinvest much of its earnings to maintain a high single digit growth rate, leaving plenty of cash to distribute to shareholders or to inorganically add to the business through acquisitions. At the risk of sounding dramatic, it's difficult to find companies with more impressive return on invested capital metrics than Paychex. The graphic below purposely includes the Great Recession years to show the defensive nature of the company's profitability through even a tough downturn.Source: RefinitivCombined with the company's mid to high single digit growth rates, Paychex is an impressive value-creating machine. We do want to highlight the critical combination of high return on invested capital and growth. The company's targeted growth rate is similar to the usual market rate of growth, leading some investors to assume a company like Paychex deserves valuation ratios, like a P/E ratio, similar to the overall market. But doing so ignores the value of quality. All else equal, companies with higher returns on invested capital deserve higher P/E ratios, as does Paychex. It is therefore possible that Paychex is a value stock even with a P/E ratio above 20x.Growth generally ends up in the mid-single digit range and is quite steady. Just have a look at the graphic below to see how reliable that mid to high single digit growth has been over the last decade. We left 2010 in there to show how resilient revenue was following the financial crisis, with 2010 being the only down year in the last several decades or more. There are also structural growth drivers as the industry benefits from an increasing complexity of human resource related tasks which is often driven by increasing regulation. As human resource functions get more complicated or expensive, the business case to outsource them strengthens. The advancement of online and computer payroll and bookkeeping services including new cloud-based offerings is another generally positive development for industry participants.Source: RefinitivRegarding growth, perhaps the most interesting development in recent years is the company's concerted move into the Professional Employer Organization (PEO) space. Following its acquisition of Oasis Outsourcing, Paychex is the second largest US PEO organization, just behind ADP. The acquisition was the company's largest ever valued at $1.2 billion and means the PEO offering now represents more than 20% of revenue.The PEO space represents a huge opportunity for Paychex. A PEO business essentially works by scaling risk and resources so that small companies can also provide competitive benefits such as health insurance and workers' comp expenses at reduced rates. It is exactly the small businesses that are Paychex's core customers that can benefit from a PEO. PEO services are even more integrated with clients' employee related systems with employees considered co-employees of the PEO company, strengthening Paychex's economic moat. Consolidation in the PEO industry has left five companies controlling half the market, and with only just over 10% penetration in the US, growth potential is substantial for Paychex. The revenue opportunity for PEO services may even be multiples of the company's traditional business and offers faster growth in a larger market. Needless to say, there is a large growth runway in front of Paychex and plenty of opportunities to re-invest the output of their cash machine.There is one short-term headwind to growth we should mention. Paychex withholds clients' funds as part of its payroll service offer to the tune of about $4 billion. The company earns interest on these withheld funds. Historically, it was not unusual for the company to earn around 3.5% on those withheld funds, with that dropping to closer to 1.6% in 2019. It's likely that the rate will continue to drop with the current monetary and fiscal backdrop. Perhaps longer-term investors will view this as a potential tailwind should interest rates ever rise again, but it's a meaningful headwind currently.Part of the strength of the Paychex investment case is the stable growth, even through economic cycles. But COVID-19 presents a truly unique challenge for most companies, especially on the top line and over the short term. However, Paychex recently reported and gave updated guidance for fiscal 2020 which ends in May, and there wasn't much in terms of a negative impact.Source: Company Third Quarter Highlights and Financial Results Presentation, Fiscal 2020In addition, the company gives a very preliminary estimate for fiscal 2021 indicating that revenue will be flattish to down low single digits. This guidance already includes the impact of the most recent interest rate cuts. The company also anticipates operating margins will be somewhere in the range of 35%, just 1% below the current level near 36%. It's a headwind, but it's hardly dramatic for Paychex and barely affects the long-term investment case. Things may end up significantly worse than management anticipates, but we offer the following thoughts on the possible impact of COVID-19.Small businesses are some of the worst hit by the COVID-19 crisis, but there are ways Paychex can navigate the current situation. First off, many of their clients aren't negatively impacted by COVID-19. From the company's recent results call, we see that 50% of its small business clients are experiencing minimal impact while another 40% are furloughing staff. It's also important to note that a large chunk of Paychex revenue is based on annual subscription type fees, rather than headcount directly. Government stimulus programs for small businesses will also create administrative work and regulatory requirements to qualify, and Paychex is well positioned to offer solutions and offset some of the revenue pressure.There will certainly be revenue headwinds from COVID-19 as businesses go bankrupt, interest rates stay low and unemployment rises, but the impacts on Paychex will be far from catastrophic. And with 35% of its cost base related to variable expenses, it's reasonable to believe the company's guidance that the operating margin will be relatively steady. Fiscal 2021 is unlikely to be the company's strongest year, but COVID-19 headwinds will more than likely remain a shorter term issue and will not stop Paychex from delivering high single digit revenue growth and operating margins near 36% over the long term. The investment case is very much intact.Paychex really is a cash machine. The company requires no inventory and little working capital. And it is incredibly impressive at turning profit into cash flow as demonstrated in the graphic below. Yes, they do really convert over 100% of net income to free cash flow every year.Source: RefinitivThe financial position is also impressive, with an essentially pristine balance sheet. $800 million of debt was taken out for the recent Oasis acquisition, but it's hardly a concern, and arguably only helps the company achieve a bit more financial efficiency. We also note the lack of large debt levels built up to do large share buybacks. Paychex has been busy paying dividends and investing in future growth while widening its economic moat instead.Source: Company Third Quarter Highlights and Financial Results Presentation, Fiscal 2020We primarily use our discounted cash flow model to derive a fair value of around $80 per share. The sell-side analyst average target price as well as Morningstar's fair value estimate come in around $69 per share. Considering the company's growth, return on equity and cost of equity profile, it likely deserves a P/E multiple in the low to mid 20s, which is also the company's long-term average.With the stock price just above $67, we see close to 20% upside and are re-assured by multiples that are slightly below long-term averages. All in all, the quality that can be purchased for the price makes it an attractive candidate when compared with other opportunities in the market today.Source: Refinitiv Datastream and I/B/E/S mean valuationsPaychex is an incredible business. The company steadily produces high levels of return with an excellent balance sheet while offering an attractive and secure dividend which should grow with company earnings. The steady business model and attractive cash flow metrics are protected by high barriers to entry and a strong established market position. In short, the company is exactly the type of core position we would like to have across our strategies provided a reasonable margin of safety or dividend yield can be achieved. It's somewhat unfortunate that we couldn't get this article published in mid-March as the stock price dipped toward $50 and when the title would have sounded more like an urgent plea to buy, but we hope it is helpful none-the-less. We have owned Paychex for many years and materially increased our position in the company around $53 in March. We can still recommend long-term investors buy a starter position at current levels, but in any case, urge readers to be ready to buy incredible quality at a good price. Be ready to buy Paychex."
4334503,92986,2020-03-26T20:34:23-04:00,"Paychex just reported its third-quarter earnings and once again beat earnings estimates due to high organic growth and steady margins.The company has lowered its full-year guidance due to expected weakness in its fourth fiscal quarter.As a lot has been priced in right now, I think the stock continues to offer good long-term entry opportunities.","On March 10, I wrote an article covering Paychex's (NASDAQ:PAYX) long-term potential and the benefits shareholders have enjoyed, and likely will continue to enjoy. In this article, I am going to discuss the company's latest third-quarter earnings and tell you why I am not selling despite ongoing weakness and uncertainty in the market. Writing this article was bittersweet as the third-quarter results were as solid as it gets. Unfortunately, ongoing coronavirus fears pressure the stock and make economic indicators somewhat obsolete right now.Source: PaychexLet's start by discussing third-quarter results. As you can see in the table below, EPS came in at $0.97. This is fairly in line with expectations of $0.96 and 9% higher compared to the prior-year quarter. While it does not matter much in light of what is about to happen in the fourth fiscal quarter, the company has maintained a strong historical growth streak without negative EPS growth rates.Source: EstimizeWith this in mind, let's move over to the top of the income statement. Total revenue improved by 7% to slightly more than $1.1 billion. The December of 2018 acquisition of Oasis contributed 1% to sales growth, while overall structural strength was confirmed by 5% higher organic sales.Source: Paychex Q3/2020 Earnings PresentationService revenues increased by 7%. Within services, management solution sales soared by 10% to $272 million. A larger client base across many of the company's services and business solutions pushed these sales higher in the third quarter. In addition to that, Paychex saw higher sales per client due to higher prices and increasing penetration of its products. Especially retirement services, time and attendance, and HR outsourcing.Interest on funds held for clients fell by 7% as a result of lower interest rates earnings. This was partially offset by higher average interest balances and realized gains. Total funds held for clients were impacted by wage inflation and increases within the total client base. Note that lower interest will remain an issue as the Fed has lowered rates to zero and is not likely to hike anytime soon.Moving over to operating income, the company saw a significant improvement of 10% to $470 million. The operating margin rose from 40.1% in the prior-year quarter to 41.4% in the third quarter.Before I move over to guidance, let's have a look at the bigger picture. Both sales and operating income growth have been solid in the past. In the past seven years, operating income has only declined briefly in 2017 after which the growth rate soared to 20%.Source: TIKR.com (Modified by Author)Unfortunately, this is about to change.I do not think anyone is surprised when I say that current times are 'unusual'. What we are currently dealing with is unprecedented in modern history. While 2008 was a crisis caused by massive bank defaults and illiquidity, we are currently hit by a virus that has the potential to break global supply chains and has almost erased demand in cyclical industries like lodging, entertainment, dining, and many more.The graph below is a good example of current times. While you are reading this article, the outcome of the initial jobless claims published on March 26 will be known. However, my point is to demonstrate the size of the hit the economy is taking. Just a few weeks after the coronavirus started to accelerate in Asia and Europe, the US could see the fastest surge in jobless claims in history - regardless of whether the number comes in at 4 million or 1 million.While I am writing this, Paychex is trading 34% below its all-time high. This is up almost 20% from the 2020 lows. This company has turned into a vehicle to track coronavirus 'sentiment' given the company's employment-related operations.If you take a look at the table below, you will find the company's updated full-year outlook. Just to remind you, only one quarter is missing to complete the full-year. That's why the numbers are looking better than one might expect. For example, fourth-quarter sales are expected to 'decrease modestly'. Either way, full-year sales growth of 8% to 9% and EPS growth of roughly 7% reflect all information the company had at the point of the release. That's why it should be taken with more than a grain of salt.Source: Paychex Q3/2020 Earnings PresentationThis is what management had to say about prediction uncertainties.Unfortunately, they added another sentence that once again confirms the uncertainty in the market.The most important thing I took from the company's guidance is that the effect on sales is not expected to be catastrophic. Fourth-quarter sales are expected to down. While this is a significant decline, given the company's history of robust sales growth, it makes the current sell-off an interesting buying opportunity. Right now, the price/sales and price/earnings ratios are at 7-year lows. Of course, sales and earnings are variables and will go down in the fourth quarter (and maybe beyond). Nonetheless, I believe buying at current prices will not be a long-term mistake. The only thing that could ruin this long-term trade is an economic impact so bad that the company will not only fail to grow its user base but even lose a large part of its customers.Data by YChartsI continue to like Paychex despite its position in a volatile business segment right now: employment-related services. Third-quarter earnings confirmed the company's strong (organic) sales and earnings trend, and its steady margins. In the fourth quarter, the company expects significant weakness and has lowered full-year guidance across the board. Nonetheless, the valuation has reached levels that make further long-term buying quite interesting. A lot seems to be priced in right now and only a further economic implosion could seriously harm Paychex's fundamentals.As I am already long, I will not be adding at these levels. Cash on the sidelines will be deployed in a number of stocks on my watchlist that I will cover as soon as possible.On a side note, keep your positions small if you are buying (anything). Volatility is elevated, and the economy is as unpredictable as it gets right now. And above all things: stay safe and healthy!Thank you very much for reading my article.

4356774,20715,2020-07-02T12:47:00-04:00,Paychex is set to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings results before the open on Tuesday.Analysts expect earnings and revenue to decline slightly compared to 2019.Sentiment toward the stock is rather bearish at this time.A new trend line has formed from the March low.,"Staffing and human resources firm Paychex (PAYX) is set to report fiscal fourth quarter earnings results on Tuesday and I couldnât help but notice how bearish analysts and investors are toward the company ahead of the report. The companyâs fiscal 2020 ended on May 31 and analysts expect the company to report earnings per share of $0.60 for the quarter.If the estimates are accurate, it would mean a decline in earnings of 4.8% compared to last year. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company reported EPS of $0.63. Paychex has seen earnings grow by an average of 13% per year over the last three years and they were up by 9% in the third quarter.Revenue is expected to come in at $910.9 million and that is down 7.1% from last yearâs $980.4 million. Revenue was up by 7% in the third quarter and it has averaged an annual growth rate of 10% per year for the last three years. Given the turmoil in the global economy at this time, an earnings decline of 4.7% and a revenue decline of 7.1% arenât too bad.I was very impressed with Paychex and its management efficiency measurements in particular. The company boasts a return on equity of 41.3% and a profit margin of 36.2% at this time. Both of those figures are well above average.With Paychex showing such positive fundamental attributes, I continue to be amazed by the bearish sentiment being directed to the stock. I have written about Paychex on four previous occasions and have taken note of the bearish sentiment on each occasion. When I first wrote about the stock it was trading just shy of $74. The stock did rally up to a high of $89.63 in February before falling sharply during the market meltdown. Even through all of that, the rally and ensuing decline, the sentiment changed little.There are 20 analysts covering the stock at this time and only two have it rated as a âbuy.â There are 16 âholdâ ratings and two âsellâ ratings. This puts the buy percentage at 10% and that is incredibly low. In fact, it is one of the lowest buy percentages I have seen lately.The short interest ratio has bounced around a little in recent months, but it is currently at 6.14. The ratio fell sharply in late March as the short interest fell from 8.9 million shares to 6.9 million shares and daily trading volume jumped from 2.9 million to 4.7 million. After that the short interest jumped back up, but the average daily trading volume has dropped.The put/call ratio is the one sentiment indicator that is pointing toward any sign of optimism. The ratio is at 0.524 currently with 15,060 puts open and 28,715 calls open. This reading is far below the average put/call ratio and it is far lower than the 1.41 reading when I wrote about the company in December. Looking at the ratio over the last few months though, the readings have all been below average. The ratio hasnât been above 0.60 since the beginning of April.Despite the bullish sentiment from option traders, I would say the overall sentiment is still rather bearish with analysts and short sellers being extremely bearish compared to other companies.The weekly chart shows how Paychex saw its stock price drop by almost half during selling in February and March. The stock was trading near $90 in February and dropped all the way down to $47.39 in March. The stock has rallied back sharply as the overall market has recovered from the panic selling in the first quarter. The stock is up over 50% from the March low, even with a slight pullback in the last month.You can see how Paychex was trending higher with the trend line connecting the lows from 2017 and 2018. There was a huge bounce off of the December â18 low through the first five months of 2019, but then the rally stalled. The meltdown in the first quarter caused the stock to drop well below the trend line, but the stock has moved back above the trend line in recent weeks.If we look at the daily chart, we see a new trend line has formed from the lows in March and May. The trend line is just above the $70 level now and it is right on top of the 50-day moving average.Both the weekly and daily overbought/oversold indicators are approaching overbought territory at this time. The little dip in the first part of June helped bring them down out of overbought territory. The daily stochastic indicators moved from overbought to oversold on the decline, but they have reversed sharply in the last few weeks.I am still bullish on Paychex for the long haul. I think the solid fundamentals and the bearish sentiment can help push the stock higher over the next few years. If you own the stock I definitely think you want to hold on to it. If you donât own the stock currently, Iâm not sure if right now is the right time to buy it. I say that based on the charts.The reason I use all three analysis styles is based in my investment philosophy. I believe the fundamentals tell us what stocks we should buy, but I believe the technical analysis and the sentiment tell us WHEN we should buy. The sentiment for Paychex looks good and over the long term, I believe the bears will eventually switch camps and help push the stock higher.Itâs the technical factors that I have an issue with right now. Because of the big rally off the March low, the stock is approaching overbought territory. There is also potential resistance from the February high and thatâs only about 17% above the current price. If the stock were to pull back to the trend line or the 50-day moving average and then rallied up to the $90 area, now we are talking about a move of almost 27%.I think the stock can get back up to the $90 area by the end of the year, but I would like to see a pullback or a consolidation period so that the stock isnât in overbought territory before I enter a new position on it. As I stated earlier, if you own the stock already, it is worth hanging on to it.If you would like to buy the stock and would like to buy it at a lower price, you could write puts against the stock. Writing the August 70-strike puts would get you $180 for each put you write and it would generate a return on margin of 17.3% if it expires worthless. If the stock drops below $70 and the stock gets put to you, your cost basis for the stock would be $68.20."
4331029,92986,2020-03-10T16:38:17-04:00,"I bought Paychex because of its attractive dividend yield and long-term capital gains potential.The company is supported by a strong product portfolio, which is generating high organic growth and long-term potential.Investors get to enjoy rising dividends, a strong balance sheet, and a high but stable payout ratio.","In this article, I will tell you why I recently added Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) to my dividend portfolio. This Rochester, NY-based provider of staffing and outsourcing services offers a good dividend of currently 3.4%, a solid balance sheet, a healthy payout ratio, and strong fundamental growth. I added the stock as I like the higher dividend yield caused by the stock price decline and the company's future potential. While mid-term challenges will likely continue to cause volatility and potentially further stock price declines, I have little doubt this company will be a strong long-term addition to my portfolio as I expect both capital gains and increasingly higher dividend payments.Source: PaychexPaychex, founded in 1971, is a provider of human resource, payroll, and benefits outsourcing services for small- and medium-sized firms. The company, headquartered in Rochester, NY, employs 15,700 employees, and is a member of the S&P 500 with a market cap of $26.6 billion. The company operates with an integrated, cloud-based HCM (healthcare data management) platform and a personalized technology-enabled service model. As a result, the company is a leader in comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions and has more than 670,000 clients employing more than 12 million employees.Having an 'interesting' and promising product portfolio and business model is one thing. However, turning this into growth is another thing. As you can see below, the company has done tremendously well since the recession. Since 2010, sales have gone from $1.95 billion to $3.69 billion in 2019. Operating income has accelerated from $725 million to $1.38 billion. That's a 7.4% compounded annual operating income growth rate.Source: TIRK.comThe most recently revealed second quarter of the 2020 fiscal year is confirming further strength. Total sales accelerated by 15% to $991 million. The organic growth rate was at a solid 6%. Operating income rose by 11% to $342 million. The two drivers of growth were PEO (professional employer organization) and insurance services and management solutions. PEO and insurance services saw 57% higher sales due to the Oasis Outsourcing Group acquisition in December of 2018, growth in total worksite employees served, and a higher number of health and benefits insurance applicants. Management solutions were up 6% due to a larger client base, a higher price realization, and increased product penetration in retirement services, HR outsourcing, and suite solutions.In addition to that, the company launched Paychex Pay-On-Demand, which allows companies to pay their employees 'on-demand'. For example, on a weekly, or bi-weekly basis. The company also returned $222 million to shareholders in the form of dividends.Dividends, that's exactly what you want as a bonus when waiting for capital gains. Or in some cases, you stay for the dividend and get capital gains as a bonus. As you can see below, the current dividend yield is 3.4%. This means that the dividend yield has been pretty much unchanged since 2014 while the stock price accelerated by more than 80%.Data by YChartsThe only way to keep the dividend stable despite a rising stock price is by increasing dividend payments. That's exactly what the company has been doing. As you can see, it took the company a while to start the uptrend in dividends per share. Between 2010 and 2019, the dividend payments have accelerated from $1.24 per share to $2.30 in 2019. This implies an annual growth rate of 7.1%. Including the sideways trend until 2013. Also, note that the company did not cut dividends during the recession in 2007/2008.Source: TIRK.comWith this in mind, let's look at the payout ratio. Rising dividends sound good, but do you want a company that cannot afford to pay dividends? I already mentioned it in the intro, but there is no need to worry. The company is paying roughly 65% of its operating cash flow in dividends and 80% of its net income. Note that all numbers below are on a GAAP basis. It is also worth mentioning that the payout rates have been stable since the end of the recession.Data by YChartsAdding to this, Paychex is managing (almost) every single year to end up with a neutral cash balance after servicing debt, paying dividends, and capital expenses. However, there are outliers. These are caused by acquisitions and financing activities and always result in stable cash flow in the next period.Source: TIRK.comAlmost always, when I discuss a mature company that has shown accelerating sales and earnings, I also have to discuss an accelerating debt load. However, in this case, this is not at all what we are dealing with. Yes, total liabilities have gone up from $3.8 billion in 2010 to currently $6.1 billion. However, the company has successfully leveraged its business model. The 9-year CAGR of liabilities is at 5.2%, meaning that sales easily outperform debt growth.In addition to that, the liquidity position has been stable as well. The closest the current ratio has come to 1.0 is in 2012 when current assets only covered 107% of current liabilities. The graph below shows both the current ratio and total liabilities as a percentage of total assets. Not only have liabilities underperformed growth, but the total ratio of debt-to-assets has also significantly declined as well.Source: TIRK.comI bought Paychex because I wanted high-quality companies and because I have a significant cash position again after completely emptying my managed dividend fund at Robeco. I wanted, and still want, to put this money to work again, and I am buying good companies that offer a solid and growing dividend yield. Paychex is such a company. The stock has declined from $92 to $73 in just 3 weeks due to coronavirus fears and an imploding oil price.However, while these problems are mid-term problems, I am convinced that Paychex will be a good long-term investment. The company's product portfolio is generating solid organic growth while further strategic acquisitions keep innovation levels high. On top of that, we are dealing with a high payout ratio and a very strong balance sheet.Source: FINVIZWhile the stock is trading at 21.6x forward earnings, I think the need for yield will continue to push money towards dividend stocks. I might be wrong about the timing, but I have little doubt the company will quickly recover from any potential economic headwinds caused by the coronavirus.Let me know what you think!Thank you very much for reading my article.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) is a provider of human capital management (âHCMâ) solutions for payroll, benefits, and human resource insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses, with an outreach to nearly 700,000 clients. The company offers a wide array of services: from payroll processing and tax administration to regulatory compliance and HR solutions.The payroll processing space is fairly small, with ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) being the only other major competitor. We keep in mind our current P/E multiple (on 2020 earnings) of 32x for ADP when we conduct the valuation for Paychex, in addition to applying a 2x premium due to incremental top-line tailwinds. When we apply the resulting multiple of ~34x to our 2020 EPS estimate of $2.92 (up from $2.90), we reach our target price of $99.Oasis Drives Revenue Growth: It is no surprise that Oasis has been a game-changer for Paychex, contributing to low teens revenue growth and outpacing growth for other core segments, such as Management Solutions and Retirement Services. For the quarter, we expect PEO and Insurance Services group to grow 48% Y/Y, with Oasis playing a key role. (As always, it is important to separate increases in clients and worksite employees, which should both enjoy 15%+ Y/Y increase). Eventually, we expect revenue growth to stabilize in upper-single digits, albeit we see more tuck-ins in the near term, as inorganic growth opportunities continue keeping Paychex's multiple at 30x+.Core Segments Should Remain Robust: We are modeling 7% Y/Y growth in Management Solutions revenue segment for the quarter, with revenue growth per client improving, largely due to pricing increases. We note that the segment's growth represents a nearly 200 bps acceleration from the prior quarter. For Retirement Services segment, we expect 4% Y/Y growth, largely due to continued increase in asset fee revenues.SG&A on the Rise: If we do expect an impact to the bottom line, it is not from the softening revenues, but from potential increases around payroll and bonuses. This may create an incremental 3-4 cent EPS impact during the quarter. Capital Return Should Continue to Impress: We expect dividend yield to remain around 3% during the quarter and throughout 2020. Furthermore, we expect approximately 750,000 in share buybacks during the quarter.Pay-on-Demand and Real-Time Payments to Launch: These additional enhancements of real-time payments or employee direct deposits should further differentiate Paychex from ADP, albeit we do not see immediate revenue boost, since incremental client conversions take time and require at least 6-12 months to be quantified.Industry Trends Remain Solid: Payroll industry trends continue to support the Paychex story, particularly as long as the unemployment rate remains under 5%. Given the current macroeconomic situation in the United States, we expect such traction to continue at least through 2021, possibly longer.We see the following four core risks to our thesis."

While we do not have specific figures across concrete client accounts, it is our understanding that nearly all new clients will be aligned across a higher pricing structure.Oasis to Remain Core Driver for PEO and Insurance Services, With Overall Segment Growing 22% Y/Y: We expect demand for PEO services â essentially growth in existing client base â to remain in double digits. As always, it is important to separate increases in clients and worksite employees, which should both enjoy 15%+ Y/Y increase. At the same time, we note that PEO insurance costs should decelerate from 40% Y/Y growth to approximately 35%, according to our model, thus translating into about 1.7 cents in EPS savings.Expect Dividend to Grow in Upper Single Digits Y/Y: With the yield currently at 2.93%, Paychexâs dividend story has stood well over the years, particularly since most mature companies in the payments industry have a greater preference for stock buybacks (largely for taxation reasons). Paychex, in our view, has been leading ADP in the dividend direction, raising the dividend annually as much as 10% in some years. We believe that this pattern should only slightly moderate in 2020-25, with the average yield growing in upper single digits. We expect that dividends will represent approximately 76% of net income in 2020, down from 80% in 2019.Estimate HROi Acquisition Impact to Be Negligible in 2020: We are not including any top-line impact from HROi in our 2020 numbers. Further, we do not expect new major deals on the horizon in 2020, as the company assesses the likely peak in the US employment situation (recall, the latest unemployment rate stood at 3.5%). While some tuck-ins may be possible, we expect greater conservatism in FCF spending until macro variables become more stable.We see the following four core risks to our thesis."
4313865,105510,2019-12-23T12:06:04-05:00,Paychex posted strong Q2 numbers driven by strength in the Management Solutions business.But the PEO business continues to be weighed down by the Oasis integration.There is more risk than reward at current valuations.,"Paychex (PAYX) has had a strong run over the last few years, but upside catalysts look to be exhausted at this point. In the near term, at least, PAYX will be entering an investment cycle as it seeks to drive future revenue growth. Yet, at ~26x forward P/E, I think the market has largely discounted the upside potential, with little consideration for potential risks related to weaker data. As I see it, there are limited upside catalysts from here while the current EPS outlook is subject to downside revisions, and may not fully support PAYX's valuation.There was little to fault from the headline numbers, as Paychex posted a total revenue of $991 million, up 15.3% YoY (~6% organic) relative to last year. Key revenue drivers include PEO and Insurance Services, which grew 57.3% YoY (~10% organic), mainly due to contribution from Oasis and increases in clients and client worksite employees across the PEO business. The Management Solutions segment grew 6.0% YoY due to increases in the client base across services, growth in revenue per client, and growth in retirement asset fee revenue.Sources: 2Q20 Results PresentationOutside of service revenue, interest in Client Funds also contributed strongly, rising 8.7% YoY on higher average investment balances.Operating margins were slightly down at 34.5% (-130 basis points from last year), as total expenses rose 17.6% YoY, primarily due to contribution from Oasis, investments, and a mix shift toward PEO. Nonetheless, 2Q20 adjusted EPS topped consensus estimates at $0.70, up 8.1% YoY.Sources: 2Q20 Results PresentationGiven the low capex commitments and operating cash flow growth to $546.6 million, the YTD free cash flow remained strong at ~$501 million, up 15% YoY. The company did not initiate a stock repurchase the quarter, instead, deploying ~$222 million for its quarterly dividend of $0.62/share. The balance sheet remains strong - PAYX ended 2Q20 with ~$645 million in cash and corporate investments and ~$847 million in debt.Sources: 2Q20 Results PresentationMuch of the quarterly strength within Management Solutions (which includes the legacy payroll and Human Capital Management businesses) looks well-positioned for the selling season. Pricing leverage still looks strong, despite competitive pressures, as the suite of value-added solutions (e.g., retirement services and HR outsourcing) continues to gain traction. In addition, PAYX is also continuing to reap the benefits of improved operational efficiencies from the use of self-service tools and robotic process automation (RPA) efforts.I believe the up-selling of ancillary services like retirement is driving the strength in Management Solutions, as the company has made some clear improvements in onboarding earlier in the year citing mobile compatibility as a driver. The strong start has resulted in a raised outlook for the full year to 5- 5.5% (from 5%), which makes sense given the strong client sales momentum seen this quarter. While I think the upper end of the guidance range is achievable, I think the YoY growth will slow to ~4% in FY21 and FY22 as we lap the positive impact of the value-added suite this fiscal year.Source: Company Filings, Author ProjectionsAnother key point worth highlighting, in my view, was the strength in the mid-market, which drove robust sales growth across client segments; new deals featuring clients of 50-150 employees have been shifting the mix, given PAYX's avg client base consists of ~15-16 employees. From the 2Q20 transcript:If the momentum in mid-market does continue to play out, I think we could see top-line growth strengthen into FY21. With midmarket currently ~25% of payroll revenue, a further mix shift will likely prove beneficial; management will only be disclosing further details on the impact of the stronger mid-market contribution in Q3.The PEO and Insurance Services segment grew a somewhat disappoinitng ~10% YoY on an organic basis as disruptions in the Oasis acquisition integration weighed on growth. There is room to improve though, and the combined PEO business could see growth closer to ~10% (vs. the 'teens' growth in legacy PEO) once the one-off integration hiccups are cleared.Meanwhile, insurance continues to be weighed down by the weakness in workers' comp premium on lower client activity and lower state insurance fund rates. Though management is guiding toward the trend easing over the next quarters, I am concerned that the combined effect of weaker Oasis and insurance growth would see the PEO/Insurance segment decelerating to a high single digits growth rate longer-term - the PEO & Insurance revenue growth outlook has already been trimmed to 25-30% (from 30%) for FY20.Sources: 2Q20 Results PresentationThe concern here is that management might have simply pushed for too fast a start to selling at-risk insurance than would have been allowed by the acquired sales team. Over the longer-term, Paychex should be able to adjust, but much of the companyâs bullishness on the PEO sector may have to be tempered.Interestingly, the 10-11% total revenue growth guidance for FY2020 remained unchanged despite the lowered segment growth targets in PEO & Insurance and interest on funds. Following the brief exchange below on the call, however, it appears revenue growth is set to fall toward the lower end of the 10-11% range.It is also worth noting that PAYX is investing heavily in its sales and marketing capabilities to drive further growth and efficiency going forward. Ongoing investments, along with the Oasis integration, have weighed on operating margins - FY20 operating margins are set to hit the mid-30s (vs. the high-30s margin reached in 2018). Though management is guiding toward a return to margin expansion in FY21, this may be on the optimistic side as the investment cycle looks likely to continue, particularly if integration difficulties remain.Sources: 2Q20 Results PresentationPAYX currently trades on a ~26x forward earnings multiple, and I see little potential for multiple expansion accounting for the current investment cycle and the slowing growth outlook. With FY21 EPS of $3.31, this would imply an $86.06 target price â more or less in line with current levels.I am unwilling, however, to price PAYX on earnings further into the future despite its strong track record as an earnings compounder on two counts â the lack of visibility into earnings power post-investment cycle and potential macro headwinds. As PAYX is levered to overall economic growth prospects, its earnings outlook would be significantly hampered by the latter. Given the lack of an upside catalyst, the risk/reward does not strike me as appealing at present."

The company offers a wide array of services: from payroll processing and tax administration to regulatory compliance and HR solutions.The payroll processing space is fairly small, with ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) being the only other major competitor. We keep in mind our current P/E multiple (on 2020 earnings) of 32x for ADP when we conduct the valuation for Paychex, in addition to applying a 2x premium due to incremental top-line tailwinds. When we apply the resulting multiple of ~34x to our 2020 EPS estimate of $2.96 (up from $2.92), we reach our target price of $99.Oasis continues to deliver! The largest acquisition in PAYX history, Oasis continues to drive the PEO outperformance, despite some integration issues and possible revenue pressures in the short run. However, Oasis is so significant for Paychex that we don't focus on synergistic headwinds at present and are not even commenting on the inorganic growth. Rather, we already focus on late 2020, when Oasis anniversaries and drives consistent organic upside for the top line.It's not only Oasis, however: During the quarter, PEO and Insurance Services also saw decent growth from the worksite employees served, as well as from increased number of Health and Benefits insurance applicants. Oasis is a big deal, but the organic growth story (pertinent to the recent quarter) was also solid.Insurance Services segment to moderate: We expect this business to slow down, but not as much as anticipated by management (most likely 14% Y/Y, versus 10% Y/Y, in the coming two quarters). Possible deceleration is mainly due to lower workers' compensation insurance rates, although we believe that this may have been a temporary 2019 scenario that is unlikely to spill down into 2020. Further, we understand management's intent to be conservative.Management Solutions vertical remains robust: It is our understanding that the Management Solutions growth will remain around 5% Y/Y in the near term, as revenue growth per client (arguably, one of the most important metrics) is improving, possibly due to pricing increases.Low teens growth in operating income is sustainable, in our view: With operating income rising approximately 11% Y/Y during the quarter, growing from $307 MM during the quarter a year ago to $342 MM, we believe that the low teens growth range (10%-12.5%) should be manageable over the next several quarters. The company updated its guidance (see the presentation from 12/18/2019) by noting that operating income as percent of total revenue shall remain at 36% in FY20. At the same time, we believe that PEO direct insurance costs will be more favorable than during the last two quarters, which translates into a low teens growth range for the operating income, slightly above than implied by guidance.Overall rosy picture for the industry: As we attested before, the overall payroll industry trends continue to support the Paychex story, particularly as long as the unemployment rate remains under 5%. Given the current macroeconomic situation in the United States, we expect such traction to continue at least through 2021, possibly longer.It's a capital return story, after all: We have stated before that for some investors PAYX is similar to a bond, given the attractive yield of ~3%. We expect this yield traction to remain and slowly grow. Furthermore, we believe that share buybacks will be robust as well.We see the following four core risks to our thesis."

The company is set to announce earnings results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 on Wednesday and the expectations are for flat earnings on a quarter over quarter basis. The company earned $0.68 in the first quarter and analysts expect EPS of $0.68 for the second quarter.I rated Paychex bullishly last December and I was neutral in March. The change in the rating was based on the timing due to technical factors. The two things that have remained consistent with the company are the fundamental strength and the bearish sentiment toward the stock.As for the fundamentals, the company has seen earnings grow at an average rate of 13% per year over the last three years. Revenue has increased by an average of 9% per year over this same period. In the first quarter, earnings increased by 6% while revenue was up 15%. Analysts expect earnings for fiscal 2020 to grow by 9% while revenue is expected to increase by 10.3%.The earnings and revenue growth aren't bad, but the really impressive fundamental statistics are the management efficiency measurements. Paychex sports a return on equity of 41.3% and a profit margin of 36.2%. Both of the stats are well above average.The company is currently trading with a trailing P/E ratio of 29 and a forward P/E of 25.4. They are a little higher than average but not terribly high on both counts. The company does pay a dividend and the current yield is 2.9%.When I wrote about Paychex in March, I was concerned about the stock being in overbought territory and the fact that the stock was trading at the upper rail of a channel. The upwardly-sloped channel dated back to early 2016 and helped define the various cycles within the overall trend.If we look at the chart today, the old upper rail looks as though it is now acting as support. The stock broke above the channel in the first quarter and the trend accelerated into the second quarter. The price peaked in June before drifting lower in the summer and dropped to the former upper rail in September.The stock has shifted slightly higher in the last few months and that has been enough to move the weekly stochastic readings from oversold to overbought. Seeing the indicators in overbought territory is a minor concern, but as you can see on the chart, the indicators have a history of staying above the 80 level for extended periods.One of the most impressive things about Paychex and the bullish run is the fact that the stock hasn't closed a week below its 104-week moving average since late 2011. I know I get some grief about using a 104-week moving average, but I like the fact that it represents two years' worth of data. The fact that the stock has been trending higher so consistently that it hasn't closed below the moving average is very impressive. Not many stocks can claim such a distinction.I mentioned earlier in the article that the two things that had been consistent with Paychex were the fundamental strength and the bearish sentiment toward the stock. The analysts' ratings have changed very little in the past year - they are still incredibly pessimistic toward the stock. There were 19 analysts following the stock a year ago with two ""buy"" ratings, 14 ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings. There are now 21 analysts following the stock with two ""buy"" ratings, 16 ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings. This puts the overall buy percentage at 14.3% and that is incredibly low compared to other stocks. I find it incredible that Paychex can have such a low buy percentage given how well the company and the stock have performed over the past year.The short interest ratio is at 7.78 at this time and that is much higher than the average stock. The ratio has bounced around a little over the last six months, but it has been trending higher in the last couple of months. We saw the number of shares sold short drop considerably from mid-September to mid-October, but it jumped back above the 10 million share mark in the most recent report.The put/call ratio is yet a third sentiment indicator that is reflecting bearish sentiment toward Paychex. The ratio is at 1.41 currently with 114,210 puts open and 81,052 calls open. When the company last reported back on October 2, the put/call ratio was extremely low at 0.42. The ratio was at 0.75 ahead of the report last December and it was at 0.45 ahead of the March report. The big jump is a sign of growing pessimism.I still love the fundamental strength of Paychex and I love the fact that analysts, short sellers, and option traders are all bearish on the stock. As a contrarian, it leaves plenty of room for a shift to the bullish camp. A few upgrades could cause a quick jump. If the rally continues, the short sellers can add buying pressure as they scramble to cover.The only thing that I am worried about right now is the overbought reading from the weekly stochastic readings, but as I pointed out earlier, it is a minor concern. The indicators have a history of remaining in overbought territory for extended periods and that's why it is only a minor concern.I am still bullish on Paychex, but like in March, I am just a little worried about the timing. If you are a long-term investor looking for solid growth with a decent dividend, I don't think you can go wrong with the stock. If you are more of a speculator with a shorter investment horizon, you might wait for a small pullback to the $80 area."

I'm staying on the sidelines for now.","Written by Sam KovacsMarkets are getting expensive. For this reason, we proceed with extreme caution when purchasing tech stocks, especially if they seem overvalued. Tech usually does bad during recessions, and overvalued companies also get hurt. Being exposed to overvalued tech stocks at this stage of the cycle would be extremely imprudent. The Shiller PE ratio has historically been a good indicator of markets getting too hot. For the S&P 500 (SPY), its Shiller PE ratio is now above 30x, nearly twice as much as its historical median value of 15.74x.Source: MultplThis is unfortunate since it means that investors will be well served avoiding stocks which would have been great purchases at any other point in the cycle. (You can read: ""Dynamic Sector Allocation For Dividend Investors"")Paychex (PAYX) is such a stock. Its earnings and revenue growth have been great over the cycle, and it has a generous dividend program, but now it looks slightly overvalued relative to its historical values.Source: PaychexPaychex engages in the provision of human capital management solutions for payroll, human resource, insurance, and retirement for small- and medium-sized businesses. Its solutions include payroll services, hiring services, business insurance, time and attendance, employee benefits, finance and payments, human resources services, and startup services.Therefore the company's revenues depend on a good job market and high levels of employment. In a recession, PAYX should be expected to drop by as much as the market and then some to make up for the premium on the share price.Paychex has a dividend yield of 3.06% and trades around $81.06. Based on my M.A.D Assessment, PAYX has a Dividend Strength score of 91 and a Stock Strength score of 72.Those numbers look great, yet this article will present and discuss the factors which show why I believe that dividend investors should avoid PAYX for the time being.Source: Mad-dividends.comI will analyze the merits of Paychex as an income-providing investment, before considering its potential for capital appreciation.Paychex has been increasing its dividend every year for the last nine years. This is an encouraging start, but for me to consider PAYX a strong dividend stock, its dividend needs to be safe and sheltered from any potential downturns. The company also needs to offer a good combination of dividend yield and dividend growth potential.Dividend Safety80% of Paychex's earnings are paid out as dividends. This is a more attractive payout ratio than only 21% of dividend stocks.PAYX pays 65% of its operating cash flow as a dividend, putting it ahead of 16% of dividend stocks.Paychex has a free cash flow payout ratio of 73%, a better ratio than 32% of dividend stocks.Source: Mad-dividends.comBased on these numbers, PAYX's payout ratio seems somewhat high. Yet for the past five years, it has consistently remained around 80% of earnings, 60-70% of operating cash flow, and 65-75% of free cash flow.This is quite impressive considering the dividend has increased by 55% in five years. This tells me that management has a good grasp of its underlying business and has managed to grow dividends so that they match growth in income and cash flows.Furthermore, PAYX can pay its interest 79 times, which is better than 95% of stocks. This level of coverage puts at bay any worry of financial leverage.Looking at the payout and coverage ratios together would suggest that PAYX's dividend is safe. The amount of cash flow that is paid out prevents the company from increasing dividends without continuing to increase the amount of cash flow it generates. For now, this hasn't been an issue. During the last recession, the company stopped increasing the dividend for 11 straight quarters. This could be possible during the next recession as well.Dividend PotentialPaychex's dividend yield of 3.06% is better than 62% of dividend stocks. It is in line with the stock's dividend yield for the past five years.Source: Mad-dividends.comThis last year, the dividend grew 11%, which is in line with its five-year CAGR of 11%. For a stock which yields 3%, this level of dividend growth is very encouraging.Source: Mad-dividends.comAs we saw above, PAYX's growth in dividends has been perfectly correlated with growth in revenues and net income. Over the previous three years, Paychex has seen its revenues grow at a 9% CAGR and net income by a 11% CAGR.Source: Mad-dividends.comThroughout this business cycle, PAYX has generated ever increasing amounts of revenue and net income. Yet because its dividend requires 80% of earnings and 75% of free cash flow, the company needs to continue growing for the dividend to follow suit.I believe this will be the case as long as the employment market remains favorable. However, in a recession, I wouldn't be surprised to see dividend growth stall for at least a year.Dividend SummaryThe combination of the data presented above gives PAYX a dividend strength score of 91/100. The company's dividend program has been very generous to shareholders in the past few years. Business has expanded at a rate which has allowed the company to continue affording these dividend hikes. Yet any hiccup due to a macro downturn could see any further dividend growth suspended. However, it seems unlikely that dividend would be cut; a freeze seems more likely.At first glance, PAYX seems like a stock which dividend investors would want to hold from the middle of a business cycle and sell as we move through the late stages of the cycle. To back up this hunch, I will look at four factors: value, momentum, financial strength and growth.ValueIn the table below, you'll find the ratios we look at when assessing value. You'll find Paychex's ratios/multiples beside the Information Technology sector median.In the last column, you'll see where Paychex is relative to the entire market.For instance, PE better than 31% of stocks means that only 31% of stocks have a higher PE than PAYX.These values would suggest that PAYX is cheaper than 50% of stocks and more expensive than 50% of stocks.Yet a look at the table above makes it apparent that the only value in PAYX is to be found in its dividend.Its price to sales and price to operating cash flow ratios are very high relative to both the sector and the entire market.Source: Mad-dividends.comFurthermore, looking at the chart above, we can see that PAYX is trading above its five-year average PE of 26x. PAYX has been trading in a narrow range of multiples, between 21x and 30x earnings. Every time it has gone over its average of 26x earnings, it has then reversed back to the mean and then below it.If this happens again, the stock could see a decline of 8 to 15%, even factoring in earnings growth of 6-7% for the next year.All these numbers point towards the same direction: Paychex seems expensive at current prices. Not extremely overvalued, but enough that some reversion to the mean could be expected in the next quarter or two.Value Score: 50/100Paychex's price has decreased by -6.48% these last three months, yet is up 2.31% these last six months and 8.98% these last 12 months and now currently sits at $81.06.Source: Mad-dividends.comPAYX has better momentum than 54% of stocks. It has beaten the index over the past 12 months, but has lost steam in the past three months. The price has already started to decline from its top, as the market acknowledges it is priced for perfection.Given that PAYX's value and momentum scores are so close to the median US stock, you can expect it to fall by a similar amount to the market in the case of a recession. Paychex's drop in the last quarter of 2018 was very similar to that of the S&P 500, and during the 2007-2009 recession, the stock lost 52% of its value while the market lost 56% of its value.By no means is Paychex a recession-proof stock. While it shouldn't do worse than the overall market in a recession, it will not be the low volatility blue chip you'd want to hold throughout a recession.Momentum score: 54/100Financial StrengthPAYX's gearing ratio of 2.3 is better than 35% of stocks. Its liabilities have increased by 11% this last year. Operating cash flow can cover 21.0% of its liabilities. These ratios would suggest that Paychex has better financial strength than 63% of stocks. The liability coverage is above average - better than 71% of stocks - which boosts the company's financial strength. As we saw earlier, the stock's interest coverage is exceptional. Overall PAYX has slightly better than average financial strength.Financial Strength Score: 63/100Earnings QualityPaychex's Total Accruals to Assets ratio of -21.5% puts it ahead of 81% of stocks. 146.6% of PAYX's capital expenditure is depreciated each year, which is better than 62% of stocks. Each dollar of PAYX's assets generates $0.4 of revenue, putting it ahead of 44% of stocks. Based on these findings, PAYX has higher earnings quality than 78% of stocks. The large amount of negative accruals and rapid depreciation of CAPEX should be accretive to earnings in upcoming years, placing PAYX in the top quartile of stocks for earnings quality.Earnings Quality Score: 78/100Stock Strength SummaryWhen combining the different factors of the stock profile, we get a stock strength score of 72/100, which is encouraging. PAYX has better-than-average financials, has relative strength and value that are in line with the marketâ¦ but that's the problem. PAYX is the perfect poster stock of a reflection of the market: everything has been going so well so long with the price, the dividend program requires operational perfection from the company.With a dividend strength score of 91 and a stock strength of 72, Paychex is a great stock for dividend investors to place on a watchlist. Purchasing a stock which has richer multiples than most of the market in the late stages of the cycle isn't a good idea though.Patience will be the name of the game here. Current shareholders might want to take some gains, while new investors would be best served by waiting on the sidelines and picking this stock up at the beginning to middle of the next cycle, provided the fundamentals haven't diverged significantly by then.In the next few days we'll be covering some more tech dividend stocks.If you appreciated this analysis, then click on the orange ""follow"" button which is located at the top of the page to receive free notifications the next time we publish an article on interesting dividend stocks."
4271596,95006,2019-06-22T04:59:17-04:00,"This analysis of Paychex stock uses a 10-year time frame and assumes a recession will occur at some point over that period.It analyzes expected returns from sentiment reversion-to-mean, earnings growth, and business returns that weight returns to shareholders more heavily.The analysis also examines the potential opportunity cost of waiting for a better price for the stock.","SourceBack on April 13th, 2018, I wrote an article titled ""How Far Could Paychex Fall?."" In that article, I set out to examine how far Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) stock could fall during an economic downturn. After rereading my original article, I noticed that I was much more constructive on the stock than I had assumed I had been. I only thought the stock was about 5% overvalued at the time and suggested that investors hold on to the stock until it was over $70 per share before rotating out into something more defensive. Here was my summary conclusion at the end of the article:Paychex's stock would eventually cross that $70 threshold a few months later on July 12th, 2018. Here is how one would have done if they rotated out of Paychex at that point and into my suggested defensive alternative Invesco Low Volatility S&P 500 ETF (SPLV). I've included SPY in the chart as a reference point as well.Data by YChartsWhile both the defensive alternative SPLV and Paychex have outperformed the S&P 500, and while SPLV did prove to be more defensive during the late 2018 correction, since the market rebounded in 2019, Paychex has dramatically outperformed.In the year since my Paychex article, I have worked out a better way to analyze the stock than I used in the spring of 2018, and so today, while the stock is making new all-time highs, I'm going to take another look at it and see what sort of returns we might expect over the course of the next 10 years if we were to buy the stock today.One of the major assumptions I make for both approaches is that history is the most reliable guide to the future. My experience has been that 80% of the time, even if we looked at nothing else, a stock will behave in a similar manner as it did the previous cycle or two unless there is a disruption to its core business. For this reason, I don't rely much on predictions of future earnings or sentiment that aren't supported by their existence during past cycles. That doesn't mean that ""this time is different"" isn't true sometimes. It just means that my analysis isn't counting on this time being much different. That said, if I think a stock is currently a ""buy"" based on my 10-year, full-cycle analysis, before I invest, I will examine the forward-looking trends and narratives more carefully to make sure there aren't major changes in the works that could affect the business.The main difference you'll find between my analysis and others' is that: 1) I focus on a clear 10-year time frame and the compound annual rate of growth (CARG) one might expect over that period of time, 2) I assume we will experience a recession during that time period, and I build that into the expected returns, 3) I try to calculate the expected returns based on a full business cycle, 4) I share both a basic shareholder return estimate and a more conservative shareholder return estimate where I lower expected returns for companies with higher debt levels and raise them for companies with higher cash levels, and 5) I provide an ""opportunity risk/reward analysis"" if a stock is not currently a ""buy"" so that we can get an idea of how likely it is the stock will trade low enough to become a ""buy"" over the next 4-5 years if we have a recession.As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the three main drivers of future total returns: 1) Market Sentiment Returns, 2) Full-Cycle Organic Earnings Growth Returns, and 3) Shareholder-Weighted Business Returns. Then, I combine all three of those CARG estimates together to get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CARG estimate. Currently, I consider an expected CARG > 15% a ""buy,"" 12-15% an ""outperform,"" 8-12% a ""market perform,"" 4-8% an ""underperform"" and < 4% a ""sell.""With that, let's get into the analysis.Since I use different approaches for analyzing a stock based on how cyclical its earnings are, historical earnings cyclicality is the first thing I like to examine. Let's take a look at Paychex's historical earnings using a F.A.S.T. Graphs, which is a great tool for this sort of analysis:I break down earnings cyclicality into five basic categories. The first category I call ""secular growth."" This category describes earnings that continue to rise every year even during economic recessions. The next three categories are ""low,"" ""moderate,"" and ""deep."" ""Low"" is usually for businesses which have earnings that have a history of declining in the single digits percentage-wise during downturns but not much farther than that. ""Deep"" I consider earnings that fall more than -50%, and ""moderate"" somewhere in between low and deep. And last, but not least, are businesses whose earnings go negative during cyclical downturns, but recover soon after that, which I call ""highly cyclical.""For businesses that have earnings in the deep or highly cyclical categories, I use an entirely different type of analysis, so it's important to determine at the outset which category a stock falls into. With an earnings decline in 2000 of -9% and earnings declines of -14% in 2008/9, I would describe Paychex earnings to be low to moderately cyclical. For stocks whose earnings fall into this category, it is best to use a 10-year, full-cycle analysis because there can be long periods between downcycles (yet, there are still indeed downcycles).In order to estimate what level of returns we might expect over the next 10 years, let's begin by examining what level of return I could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. In order to estimate that, I'm going to shorten the time frame of the F.A.S.T. Graphs so it starts in mid-2006, a year or two before the last cyclical peak. This time-frame adjustment is especially important for a stock like Paychex because from the year 2000 until 2009 it was going through what I call a ""multiple compression cycle"". This is a cycle where growth stocks go from being valued as high growth stocks to being valued more in line with normal or average growth. When this happens, the PE multiples contract and don't fully recover. In Paychex's case, the multiple went from almost 100 in the year 2000 to about 15 in 2009, even though earnings, as we saw, were mostly steadily growing except during the recessions. If you look at the earlier FAST Graphs, which started in 1999, you'll see the average P/E ratio over that 20-year period is about 30. But since that time frame includes the time when Paychex was valued as a high-growth stock with a P/E near 100, it doesn't make sense to include that time frame in the average because it is very unlikely Paychex will be valued that high again.When we set the graph to a couple of years before the last recession, we get a clearer picture of how Paychex might be valued by the market going forward into the next cycle. In this case, the P/E is a little bit lower, at 24.4, which I think is a better estimate of average future market sentiment over the next cycle looking 10 years into the future. And if Paychex reverts to that P/E, holding all else equal, it would produce a 10-year CARG of -2.14%.If we begin our measurement around the same point we were at last cycle, which I estimate to be about mid-2006, and we adjust the annually compounded EPS growth for the amount of stock that was repurchased over this time period, we can estimate how much CARG from organic earnings we can expect over the next 10 years if the next cycle is similar to the previous one.Data by YChartsThe company had one year over this time period where it bought back some shares, but over the course of 12 years, it hasn't really bought back much at all so share buybacks won't really factor into Paychex's expected earnings growth.If we include a recession expectation at some point over the next 10 years, when I do the math on earnings growth based on the last cycle, I get a 10-year, full-cycle, organic earnings growth CARG estimate of +1.67%.These return estimates are more complicated than the first two, but the idea behind this is to figure out how much the company is making in cash and/or earnings per share while taking into account debt and cash levels, how much of a dividend yield it is paying to shareholders, what percentage of shares it is buying back annually, and how much cash the company is keeping for itself, all on a per-share basis. Once that is complete, I assume any money the business keeps for itself will accrue over a 10-year time period, but I don't assume that it will compound (since I estimated the earnings growth in the last section).For buybacks, if the company is buying back shares when sentiment is below average, I will assume the value of the buybacks will compound over time. If it is buying back when sentiment is higher than average, I will assume the buybacks accrue but do not compound value over the 10-year time period. (This is just a way to weigh the value of buybacks over time for the estimate; it isn't intended to be mathematically precise - which is fine for me, because we never know exactly what price the buybacks will be made over time anyway, so there's no sense in pretending we do). I will assume that dividends paid to shareholders compound their value over time because shareholders can immediately reinvest the dividends in the best investment available.As I noted, this process is intended to estimate how much money the business is likely to make and how much of that money will likely be returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. I limit the expectation of shareholder returns by how much cash is currently being generated and the company's apparent intention of investing that cash itself or returning it to shareholders. If buybacks and dividends are consistently greater than cash flows and earnings, I will assume they are unsustainable through a full cycle that includes a recession, and I limit the shareholder return expectations to actual cash flows and/or earnings estimates I think are reasonable.First, let's revisit those buybacks and see what sort of returns we might expect from them in the future. I'll look at both one-year and three-year time frames.Data by YChartsData by YChartsAs the longer-term chart indicated, we shouldn't expect much in the way of share reductions from Paychex going forward.In terms of shareholder returns from dividends, Paychex currently yields about 2.8%. Let's see if the earnings yield is high enough to cover that.Data by YChartsAt 3.26% the basic earnings yield is indeed enough to cover the dividend with a little to spare. The second graph at the bottom is my more conservative long-term estimate using free cash flow to equity to enterprise value yield. This number produces higher expected returns for businesses with more cash and less debt and lower expected returns for businesses with more debt and less cash. It does a pretty good job of identifying businesses that are borrowing lots of money to buy back shares and/or pay dividends. At the end of last quarter, it stood at 1.4%. This will stand as my conservative shareholder yield estimate.Assuming the money left over after the dividend is paid accrues, but does not compound over the 10 years, and the dividend does compound, I get an expected basic shareholder/business yield of +3.20% and a conservative estimate of +1.40%.Putting all three - market sentiment returns (-2.14%), earnings growth returns (+1.67%), and business/shareholder returns (+1.40% to +3.20%) - together, I estimate a full-cycle 10-year CARG return of +1.13% to +2.93%. That would put Paychex at its current price in the ""sell"" category for me.In order to estimate the opportunity risk/reward, I use F.A.S.T. Graphs' forecasting tool to estimate future price appreciation, including dividends, for the next two years using analysts' estimates. Then I assume we will have a recession after that point. What I want to know is if a recession begins in 2-3 years, whether I will have a reasonable chance to buy Paychex at a significantly lower price compared to where it trades today or if I would likely never get a chance at a lower price.If we attach the current 30.3 P/E ratio to Paychex and use analysts' forecasts out two years, including dividends, we can expect Paychex to gain about $20.07. If we add that to today's price of $87.14, we get an expected price two years from now of $107.21.Now I want to estimate how far the price could fall if in two years we have a recession at that point in time. By combining the optimistic upside, with recession downside, we can estimate whether if we sold Paychex today, and waited to re-enter at a better price, what the likelihood is we'll get a chance to do that if we have a recession that begins at some point over the next two years or so.In order to estimate the potential price decline we might expect from the next recession, I compiled the approximate declines Paychex has experienced the past 35 years. In the table below, I included the year the decline started, how long it took the price to bottom, the duration for the downturn from the peak to the recovery of the peak, and the depth the price fell off its highs.*This was not a full recovery. I reset Paychex parameters after 2002 when it switched from growth stock to income stock.Based on this history, I think it's fair to estimate that Paychex could fall between 45% and 55% during the next recession. If we apply that sort of decline to the optimistic price of $107.21 in two years, we get an expected recession price a few years from now of $48.24-58.97. That entire range is well below where the stock trades today, so I don't see much risk in taking profits here if we have a recession within the next 2-3 years.Paychex has likely attracted investors because of its steady earnings growth. However, at its current price, if the next economic cycle is similar to the last one, buying Paychex here will likely produce very low returns over the next 10 years. If we were to have a recession within the next few years, based on Paychex's history, it is likely that the stock will be available at a better price.I can certainly see the attraction of Paychex stock for investors. It has steady earnings growth and a pretty decent dividend. But a 30+ P/E is quite a high price to pay. Eventually, the economy will sputter, and even if Paychex earnings growth only goes modestly negative, the stock price is likely to fall quite far. I still think it would be wise to rotate into something more defensive like SPLV, which has a more limited downside in a bear market."

Their streak took a brief pause during the Great Financial crisis which I'm not too concerned about considering the risk to the business at the time and the massive amounts of layoffs that were occurring. Prior to the pause Paychex had raised dividends every year since 1996.The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year rolling dividend growth rates since 1994 are shown in the following table.Table and calculations by author; data source Paychex Investor Relations*Dividends and growth rates are based off calendar year payments.**An interactive version of this information can be found here.Despite the pause and low dividend growth coming out of the Great Recession, Paychex has still managed strong, but fluctuating dividend growth. Of the 25 1-year periods starting in 1995, annual dividend growth has ranged from 0.0% to 80.0% with an average of 19.3% and a median of 11.0%.Since dividend growth has seen pauses and periods of slower growth, I want to look at the rolling 10-year periods to see how Paychex has historically performed. Of the 16 rolling 10-year periods, annualized dividend growth has ranged from 6.0% to 30.0% with an average of 16.7% and a median of 12.2%.Image by author; data source Paychex SEC filingsPaychex's payout ratio is higher than I'd like; however, given the steady nature of the business as well as its consistent growth I can tolerate a higher payout ratio. Over the last decade the payout ratio based off net income has averaged 83.2% and over the last 5 years it's 80.4%. The payout ratio based on free cash flow has seen a similar decline with averages of 72.8% and 70.0%, respectively.In order to have long-term investment success, the simplest method is to find high-quality companies that have a history of generating high returns on capital. To identify high-quality companies I like to examine a variety of quantitative factors to determine the strength of the business.Image by author; data source: Paychex SEC filingsSome businesses have struggled to grow their revenues over the last decade; however, Paychex is not one of those and has shown growth every year over the last 9 years with the lowest year-over-year growth rate of 4.3%. Over that time, revenue has grown from $1.95 B to $3.77 B which represents total growth of 93.9% or 7.6% annualized.Operating income has seen a similar improvement growing from $670 M to $1,371 M. That's 104.6% total growth in operating income or 8.3% annualized. Meanwhile, operating cash flow grew from $611 M to $1,272 M which is 108.1% total growth or 8.5% annualized.Free cash flow bested the growth of revenue, operating income and operating cash flow. Free cash flow grew from $538 M to $1,148 M, which represents 113.4% total growth or 8.8% annualized. Image by author; data source: Paychex SEC filingsPaychex's margins have been strong and generally trending higher. Operating cash flow margins improved from 31.4% in FY 2010 to 33.7% in FY 2019. The average over the last decade is 33.1%.Similarly, Paychex's free cash flow margin has improved as well. The free cash flow margin grew from 27.6% to 30.4% over the same period with an average of 29.3%.My preference is to find companies that have free cash flow margins >10%. Paychex has handily beat that level.My profitability metric of choice is the free cash flow return on invested capital, ""FCF ROIC."" The FCF ROIC represents the annual cash return that a business generates based on the capital invested in the business. Investing in businesses that have the ability to earn high returns on capital and re-invest capital at similarly high rates reward investors over the long term. I also look at the FCF ROIC Net which nets out the cash held on the balance sheet from both equity and debt. At a minimum, I want to see the FCF ROIC >10%. Image by author; data source: Paychex SEC filingsPaychex really shines here with a FCF ROIC well above 10% and routinely around 40%. That speaks to the strength of the business model and its stickiness with its customers. Paychex has averaged a 42.1% FCF ROIC over the last decade with a 45.2% average over the last 5 years.I want the businesses that I invest in to allocate capital in a way that makes sense to me. That means if there's cash generated by the business, first and foremost is re-investing back into the business to maintain and grow its reach. Next would be to return any excess cash to the owners of the business via a dividend. Lastly, if there's still remaining cash left over, I would use the cash for strategic acquisitions, expand into adjacent business lines, strengthen the balance sheet or repurchase shares.To understand how Paychex uses its free cash flow, I calculate 3 variations of the metric, defined below:Quality businesses will generate positive FCFaDB more often than not. I'm not concerned about the levels for any given year because the business environment changes and opportunities have deadlines; rather I prefer to look at the longer term trend to get a glimpse at how management likes to allocate capital. If a business has negative FCFaDB, that shortfall must be made up by cash on the balance sheet, asset sales or taking on debt. Image by author; data source: Paychex SEC filingsAs we said earlier, Paychex has managed positive FCF every year over the last decade which has allowed the company to both pay and grow its dividend payment. Cumulatively, Paychex generated $7.99 B in FCF.Paychex has also managed a positive FCFaD every year. Paychex has paid out $5.73 B in dividends in total which puts the FCFaD at $2.26 B in total.With a positive FCFaD, Paychex has been able to repurchase $0.91 B of shares over the last decade with cash generated by the business. That puts the FCFaDB for the entire period at $1.35 B with no negative years of FCFaDB. Image by author; data source: Paychex SEC filingsPaychex's share count declined from 361.5 M to 359.3 M from FY 2010 to FY 2019. It's pretty clear that Paychex hasn't been a serial share repurchaser, with shares outstanding declining just 0.6% over the last decade. Most of the cash spent on share repurchases has gone towards reducing the dilution due to shares issued for acquisitions.As I mentioned above, my preference is to see a management team that first reinvests in the business, then pays and grows the dividend and only if there's remaining cash move to share repurchases.Paychex has normally carried no debt on its balance sheet. However, in FY 2019 the company issued debt to help finance the Oasis Outsourcing acquisition. Even with the debt, the balance sheet is still pristine with a debt to capitalization ratio of 23%. Image by author; data source: Paychex SEC filingsThe entire debt load could be retired with just 0.1 year of FY 2019's free cash flow plus the cash on the balance sheet. It could also be retired with just 0.4 year of FY 2019's FCFaD plus the cash on the balance sheet.The minimum acceptable rate of return, ""MARR,"" analysis is a method you can use to estimate the value of the business. The idea is that you estimate the future growth of earnings and dividends, assign a multiple to those earnings and of course have a margin of safety factored in. If the expected return is less than your hurdle rate, then you wait for the price-to-value relationship to change or look for other opportunities.Analysts expect Paychex to have FY 2020 EPS of $3.10 and FY 2021 EPS of $3.34. They also expect Paychex to obtain 8.4% annual earnings growth over the next 5 years. I assumed that EPS growth would slow to 6.0% per year for the following 5 years. Dividends are assumed to target a 80% payout ratio as per Paychex's history.Historically, Paychex has traded between ~16x and 30x TTM P/E ratio. Currently, Paychex's TTM P/E ratio is 28.9x. According to Morningstar, Paychex's 5-year average P/E ratio is 26.6x. For the MARR analysis, I""ll examine P/E ratios ranging from 15x to 30x.Data by YChartsThe following table shows the potential internal rates of return that an investment in Paychex could provide, given that the assumptions listed above are in the ballpark of future results. Returns include dividends taken in cash and are calculated assuming a purchase price near $84.25, Friday's closing price. Returns are run through the end of calendar 2024, ""5 Year"" and calendar year 2029, ""10 Year.""Alternatively, I calculate what level I would need to purchase shares to generate the returns that I desire from my investments. Once again, the calculations are based off the assumptions above being close to what comes to pass. The target returns that I will use are 10%, my typical minimum investment threshold, and 13%. The 13% is derived from the ~7.3% estimated annualized earnings growth over the next 10 years, plus the 2.94% current dividend yield, plus 2.3% for 25% undervaluation normalizing over 10 years.Another valuation method that I use is dividend yield theory. Dividend yield theory is based on reversion to the mean and assumes that a good proxy for the fair value of established companies is the 5-year average dividend yield.Image by author; data source Yahoo Finance and Paychex Investor Relations.*An interactive version of this chart can be found here.Paychex's shares currently offer investors a 2.94% dividend yield with a 5-year average yield of 3.17%. Dividend yield theory suggests a fair price for Paychex's shares of $78.23.I believe that Paychex firmly fits the bill of being a high-quality business. Consistent growth in revenues has fueled the continued growth in free cash flow and of course the dividend.Paychex's free cash flow profitability is top-notch with margins regularly around 30% and returns on invested capital around 40%.The sector is fragmented which should lead to further consolidation with Paychex likely to win out in the long run as a leader in the technology and infrastructure necessary to be a one-stop outsourcing provider of payroll and HR services to small-to-medium sized businesses.Paychex's payout ratio is higher than I'd like with management targeting to pay out 80% of net income to owners. The elevated payout is great during good times; however, it's likely going to lead to a repeat of the pause in dividend growth whenever the next recession comes which it inevitably will.Dividend yield theory suggests a fair value range between $71 and $87, implying that shares are currently on the upper end of fair value. My fair value range based on the MARR analysis is $69-83.Paychex is a business that I want to eventually add to my portfolio and it's a justifiable nibble at current prices near $84 per share. Of course, that comes with the caveat that multiple contraction is likely to be a hindrance on returns going forward.The price in the market is on the upper end of fair value at this time so I wouldn't want to commit a big chunk of capital to the business. However, I'm very tempted to add a starter position to my portfolio with plans to add on any dips into the mid-to-low $70s."
4270204,104579,2019-06-13T20:08:10-04:00,"Paychex continues to benefit from strong employment numbers and a growing economy.The company would see a large hit on revenue during a recession.Despite being a well run operation, the shares are just short of their 52-week high, making them uncompelling to buy.","SourceI have kept an eye on Paychex's (PAYX) shares for quite some time now and have found them always to be too expensive. While there were some small windows of opportunities, my funds would generally find their way into something else. The company continues to perform well, but a forward P/E of 30x next year's earnings leaves the stock in a vulnerable position. The slightest slowdown in job growth and an uptick in unemployment could lead the stock to see a quick decline. The company offers a strong dividend with several years of consecutive growth, but it is at the low end of its historical yield range. We would love to add shares to our portfolio but only at the right price.Paychex recently reported earnings that beat on the bottom line on in-line revenues.Source: Seeking AlphaWhile posted revenue growth was impressive, it was about half of that when accounting for a recent acquisition. Nonetheless, 7% revenue growth is still attractive and impressive for a relatively stable business with heavy competition. PEO and Insurance Services revenue was accountable for a large part of the gain in the quarter as revenues saw a 65% increase. Once again it was mostly due to the acquisition of Oasis.The company continues to focus on this division as a source for diversified revenue growth.Source: Earnings SlidesAs the segment is of continued focus in the future, we could see future acquisitions. The recent acquisition of Oasis, the largest professional employment organization that was privately held, has helped the company continue to have multiple offerings to its existing clients. This is important as it ensures continued retention within its customer base. Corporations and employers in general are increasingly looking to consolidate the tools they use to manage their workforce. Paychex has recognized that this is important in ensuring they do not look for a better all-in-one offering from a competitor. So continued expansion in HR offerings and other categories could lead to continued client growth across all segments.For the nine months ended 2/28/2019, the company has seen an overall revenue increase of 10%.Source: Earnings SlidesHowever, we see that EBITDA has improved less so and this is due to an operating margin hit. Investors should keep an eye on this going forward as it does seem interesting that margins would take a hit despite increased offerings. Nonetheless, the company saw a decent increase in earnings from interest on cash held for clients. This has been a segment within the company that has befitted from a rise in interest rates which we may now see reverse.The company continues to operate from a position of strength.Source: Earnings SlidesLong being debt-free, the company took advantage of rates and decided to add some debt to the balance sheet. However, overall the company remains in a what is virtually a debt-free net position due to its cash levels. One of the reasons investors liked the company was due to there not being debt. While this level is certainly manageable, it begs the question if management is leading down a new path in which it sees moderate leverage as something that should be had. Time will tell with future acquisitions.Lastly, looking forward, the company expects total revenue growth of 6-7%.Source: Earnings SlidesThe expected growth in earnings of 10-12% is strong, but probably does not warrant such a high P/E.Taking a look at historical valuation can give us an idea of where the shares are in perspective to where they may typically be.Source: MorningstarLooking at the 5-year averages, Paychex's shares currently trade above their average P/S, P/E, P/CF, P/B, PEG and forward P/E ratios. This is a signal that at this time shares are perhaps overvalued. Furthermore, it would be okay if there was significant growth expected but since there isn't, it is concerning. This also comes at a time when upside in the core business may be limited due to the already strong employment numbers. The company primarily makes money from processing payroll, and being paid per each employee.The recent job reports numbers were rather weak. Investors need to watch this going forward as it could signal a slowdown in the area in which Paychex sources revenue from the most.Looking at the average yield for the shares going back the last 24 years, we can identify if investors are getting an above or below average dividend yield.Source: YieldchartWhile the current yield of 2.85% is above the average yield of 2.35%, it is important to note that this is not far from being an in-the-middle average yield. A real sign of undervaluation in the shares would have the yield close to 3.5%, or about a 25% average level of trading time for this yield. Furthermore, with some cash accounts from various places like Wealthfront offering 2.51%, the 2.85% does not get me excited.While Paychex certainly has been performing and offers what I would consider mildly attractive growth, I find the shares to be overpriced at this time. Trading above their own 5-year average valuation levels and at a time when there are potentially more headwinds than tailwinds, investors should proceed with caution. The company has been well operated and managed but the recent taking on of debt may signal a change in methodology. With the job market being very tight, the company is going to have a harder time continuing to grow revenues without competing on price. This could potentially pressure margins even further. In the coming quarter we will see if the metrics continue to be pressured as well as the interest income due to rate declines. Investors would probably do well holding off on investing in Paychex until a pullback occurs."
4296159,104086,2019-10-11T16:01:19-04:00,"Paychex appears to be a wonderful business traded a bit expensively for the moment.The cash-cow business of the company (namely, Management Solutions) has its sustainable competitive advantage primarily thanks to the high switching cost.The cash-calf segment (namely, PEO) delivers double-digit growths, benefiting from the industry tailwind and the company's leading market position.","Source: iqoption.com.Quite often, in the business world, we have seen companies consisting of both cash cow and cash calf. On the one hand, the cash-cow business takes care of generating reliable, repeatable, and predictable cash streams protected by sustainable competitive advantages. On the other hand, the cash calf plays as the growth engine in charge of increasing the company's top line. This way, long-term buy-and-hold investors harvest both economic moat on the defensive side and the growth opportunities on the offensive side.Paychex is a typical case here. The Rochester, NY-based company (PAYX) is the leading provider of integrated human capital management (referred to as ""HCM"") solutions for payroll, human resources, retirement, and insurance services for small- and mid-sized businesses. It has more than 100 offices serving approximately 670,000 payroll and PEO clients through the US and Europe.The company operates two business segments as follow -As described below, Management Solutions, the ""cash cow,"" represented roughly 78% of the total sales in FY2019. PEO/Insurance, the ""cash calf,"" drove the majority of the growth momentum (i.e., 46% YoY in FY2019, 32% YoY in FY2018).Source: 2019 Annual Report.Paychex builds the majority of its economic moat through the installed base of its integrated cloud-based HCM platform. This, along with a strategic focus on the small- to mid-market space as well as the comprehensiveness of HCM services provided, helps the company dominate the category that it operates in.Paychex's clients have the option to select the HCM modules that they need with the ability to easily add more as they grow. This flexibility allows clients to define the solution that best meets their needs throughout different stages, thereby increasing customer loyalty. Service agreements are generally terminable by the clients upon relatively short notice. But HR departments should hesitate to risk operational disruption or spend time and capital on integration and training even though a slightly higher-quality or lower-cost product emerges.The recent client retention rate was around 82%, in line with Paychex's historic best retention rate. The figure is indicative of the sound economic moat around the company's economic castle. But it also displays the characteristic of more bankruptcies and acquisitions specific to small businesses and certainly some room for improvement, especially compared with the 91% retention rate at Automatic Data Processing (ADP).Speaking of competitors, in addition to ADP, the global mass-market player, Paychex also competes with the smaller new entrants in the space, including Paylocity (PCTY), Benefitfocus (BNFT), and Workday (WDAY), while the latter two have yet to break even.As you can imagine, the financial performance of Paychex should be highly correlated with the situation of the job market. But during the great recession, Paychex still generated superior returns on invested capital between 35% and 45%, beating the performance of ADP (see below). The contributing factor here could be that during the recession, more cost-conscious businesses may consider Paychex's products and services to improve efficiency.Source: YCharts; data as of 9/24/2019.At the same time, the company also delivered more than 10% FCF return on total assets, compared to mostly below 5% at ADP. Today, Paychex can produce more than twice the amount of free cash flow on one dollar of assets that its major peers do on average (see below), indicating an enduring competitive position.Source: YCharts; data as of 9/24/2019.Over the past decade, the business maintained its superior FCF margin of above 25% and more annual free cash flow was generated than annual net profit every year (see below), showing quite some resilience in the highly competitive and fragmented in the HCM space.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 9/24/2019.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 10/10/2019.The last decade has seen PEO grow in popularity as a go-to HR outsourcing solution, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Smaller employers can become overwhelmed with modern HR tasks and responsibilities, which have grown in complexity in recent years, especially with compliance. But by partnering with a PEO, small business owners can instead outsource HR and focus all their attention on other areas of the business.The industry almost doubled its size, with a CAGR of roughly 8%. That growth rate is 14 times higher than that of employment in the US economy as a whole.Although the growth rate is going to moderate, we believe that the growth momentum of Paychex's ""cash-calf"" PEO business will continue. Paychex is now the 2nd largest PEO in the US by the number of worksite employees, which increased from 770,000 in 2014 to 1,500,000 in 2019. As for the FY2020, the management set the guidance for a 30% YoY growth in PEO/Insurance compared with 5% in Management Solutions.According to the management's analysis, there are over 10 million addressable businesses in the geographic markets that the company currently serves. Compared to the two-thirds of one million clients using Paychex's products and services, the majority of which, are not even PEO customers, we see the massive runway ahead for growth.In the meantime, the cash-cow side of Paychex enables the business to invest in R&D, sales & marketing, and M&A deals. As a result, the gap against its competitors can hopefully be widened.Some recent acquisitions include Oasis Outsourcing (the largest private PEO in the US) and Lessor Group (a provider of payroll and HCM software solutions in Denmark). Those deals have already contributed considerably to the top line and bottom line at Paychex. But we, as the investors, should understand that more than half of acquisitions do not work to our favor in the long run. M&A should not be regarded as a sustainable growth driver, and investors should keep their eyes on the evolvement of the company's return on tangible assets (see below).Source: GuruFocus; data as of 10/10/2019.On the organic side, we think a low-teens CAGR is possible for Paychex to increase its EPS and FCF per share for the next few years.At the moment, we think that PAYX is a bit overpriced. According to Morningstar below, all prevailing price multiples (e.g., P/E, P/S, P/B, P/CF) are above their respective historical averages.Source: Morningstar; data as of 10/10/2019.The chart below also shows the steadily rising valuation of the stock since 2012 in terms of EV/EBIT.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 10/10/2019.Paychex current has a free cash flow yield (our favorite valuation indicator) of around 4%. Assuming a 10% CAGR in FCFPS, we would preferably demand a 5% FCF yield that could price in more margins of safety.Source: GuruFocus; data as of 10/10/2019.Overall, we believe that Paychex is a great business that consists of both the moaty cash cow and the rapidly-growing cash calf. However, when it comes to valuation, the stock looks a bit expensive at this level. We would bury the name into our watch list and wait patiently for pullbacks and better entry points."
4254819,63883,2019-04-16T20:00:42-04:00,"With low unemployment, Automatic Data Processing and Paychex are likely to benefit going forward.Automatic Data Processing has over four decades of dividend increases, while Paychex has a significantly higher yield right now.Assuming no recession, the future outlook is positive for both companies, although one stock looks particularly attractive.","By Nate ParshWhen investors consider buying individual stocks in a certain industry, they often have to make a choice between two high-quality companies. Whether it is because the industry economics have resulted in a duopoly, or because investors have limited capital available, the choice often comes down to two companies.When it comes to business outsourcing companies, Automatic Data Processing (ADP) has a dividend history that is second-to-none. ADP is a Dividend Aristocrat, an exclusive list of 57 stocks in the S&P 500 Index with 25+ consecutive years of dividend increases. You can see the entire list of 57 Dividend Aristocrats here.Meanwhile, Paychex, Inc. (PAYX) does not have as long of a dividend increase streak as ADP, it offers a significantly higher current yield.With unemployment below 4%, both companies have the potential to perform very well. When looking at ADP and Paychex, investors should consider recent financial results, dividend history, and our expected annual returns over the next five years in order to determine which stock, if any, is attractive today.Automatic Data Processing is the largest provider of payroll services in the United States. The company, which was founded in 1949, offers payroll services, human resources technology, and professional employer organization services, or PEO, to more than 700,000 medium and large businesses. ADP client base is composed of businesses with at least fifty employees. ADP has a current market capitalization of $70 billion, with annual revenues in excess of $13 billion.Paychex offers computerized payroll accounting, benefits, and human resource services to businesses. Whereas ADP tends to focus on large business, Paychex focuses on small and medium-sized business. The company has more than 600,000 clients that generally employ between 10 and 200 employees. Most of Paychex's clients are located in the U.S., but the company does have operations in certain parts of Europe.Paychex is composed of two segments: Management Solutions, which provides employers with payroll and retirement resources, and PEO and Insurance, which offers outsourced human resource services and insurance. The company has a market capitalization of $29 billion, with annual revenues of $3.4 billion.ADP released financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 on 1/30/2019.Source: Automatic Data Processing's Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Results Presentation, slide 4.The company's adjusted earnings per share increased 30% from the prior year to $1.34. This was $0.16 above estimates. Revenues grew 8.4% to $3.5 billion and topped estimates by $76 million. Adjusted EBIT improved 26%.Revenues from Employer Services increased 7% organically. This growth came from a combination of new business bookings, higher numbers of employees on clients' payrolls, and higher average client fund balances. New business bookings were up 1%, while pays per control improved 2.3%. Average client funds balance increased 5% to $25.3 billion. Despite a 50 bps headwind from acquisitions, this segment had a 460 bps improvement in EBIT margins.PEO services experienced a 12% increase in revenues. Excluding zero-margin benefit passthroughs, revenues for this segment improved 15%. Average worksite employees paid grew 9% to 545,000 and was the primary contributor to growth in this segment. Margins improved 70 bps.ADP increased its guidance for adjusted earnings per share for a second time in two quarters. The company now expects a midpoint for adjusted earnings per share of $5.35, up from $5.25 previously. This would result in an 18% gain in adjusted earnings per share if the company is able to deliver on this guidance. This would follow a 22% growth in earnings in fiscal 2018.ADP increased its earnings per share at a rate of 6.6% over the last ten years, but we estimate that the company can grow earnings at a rate of at least 8% due to continued gains in its PEO Services segment. If ADP is able to achieve this growth, then the company could earn $7.86 per share in 2024.Paychex released financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 on 3/27/19.Source: Paychex's Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Results Presentation, slide 9.The company earned $0.89 per share, a 41% increase from the previous year and $0.01 above consensus estimates. Revenue grew 23.5% to $1.07 billion, though this was $3.3 million below expectations. One item investors should be aware of is Paychex's EBITDA margin has decreased 70 bps over the first nine months of the company's fiscal year.Revenues for the Management Solutions segment grew 4% to $802 million. This was primarily due to an increase in the number of clients Paychex serviced during the quarter. This segment benefited from a price increase which allowed higher revenues per check. Revenues from retirement services were higher due to increased asset values.PEO and Insurance services grew 65% to $246 million. Paychex closed on its $1.2 billion purchase of Oasis Outsourcing Acquisition Corp on 12/21/2018. Serving more than 8,400 clients and 1.4 million employees, Oasis was the largest privately-held professional employer organization in the U.S.Paychex was willing to make this the company's largest acquisition in its history because of Oasis's ability to add to revenues. For example, Oasis contributed 48% of the growth to the PEO and Insurance segment during the quarter. Excluding this acquisition, this segment had 17% revenue growth from the previous year. A larger client base as well as an increase in the number of health and benefit applicants also added to growth. Interest on funds held for clients grew 27% to $23 million due to higher average interest rates.Paychex expects to earn $2.85 per share in fiscal 2019, which would be a 16% increase from fiscal 2018. The company expects revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7% and the tax rate to be ~24%, much lower than the company's usual mid-30% tax rate prior to tax reform passed in late 2017.We expect that Paychex can grow earnings per share at its decade long historical rate of 3.7% per year over the next five years due to increases in revenue and the impact of acquisitions. If Paychex continues to grow at this rate, the company could earn $3.42 per share in 2024.Both ADP and Paychex have benefited from low unemployment. More employees leads to a need for more payroll and human resource services. Both companies have also produced high levels of growth in earnings per share and at least high single-digit growth in revenue in recent quarters. An increase in average interest rates also benefited the two companies.That being said, we favor ADP's higher historical earnings growth rate. The company should be able to grow earnings at a higher rate than Paychex over the next five years, which is the primary factor in favoring ADP when it comes to recent financial results.ADP has increased its dividend for 44 consecutive years. It has increased its dividend:The company increased its dividend by 14.5% for the payment made 1/1/2019. ADP should pay out $3.16 per share in 2019. With the company expecting to earn $5.35 per share during this time, ADP's payout ratio is 59%. This matches the company's 10-year average payout ratio of 59%. Even better, ADP has an average payout ratio of 62% over the last five years. The stock currently yields 2%, slightly above the average yield of the S&P 500.Many analysts believe that cash flow is a better measurement for dividend safety. Over the past four quarters, ADP has generated $2.8 billion of cash flow from operating activities and spent $168 million on capital expenditures for free cash flow of approximately $2.6 billion. The company distributed $1.16 billion in dividends during the same time period for a free cash flow dividend payout ratio of 45%.ADP's dividend appears well-covered using either earnings or free cash flow, and we see no risk of a dividend cut in the near future.Paychex has increased its dividend for eight consecutive years, though this is too short of a streak to qualify the company from being included in a dividend growth database like the Dividend Achievers. Paychex paused its dividend growth from 2009 to 2011, before restarting its dividend growth in 2012.Paychex has increased its dividend:Paychex increased its dividend by 12% for the payment made on 5/24/2018. The company should pay out $2.24 in 2019. Using the company's earnings per share guidance of $2.85, Paychex has a payout ratio of 79%. This is a very high payout ratio, but below the five and 10-year average payout ratios of 82% and 84%, respectively. Shares offer a yield of 2.8%, which is above the average yield of the S&P 500.A side-by-side comparison of their respective dividend profiles can be seen in the table below:Paychex generated $1.3 billion of cash flow from operating activities and spent $120 million on capital expenditures over the past four quarters of fiscal 2019 for free cash flow of almost $1.2 billion. The company distributed $805 million in dividends during the same time period for a free cash flow dividend payout ratio of 68%.Using earnings per share, Paychex has an elevated payout ratio. The payout ratio declines to a lower level when free cash flow is used.Both companies have plenty to offer dividend growth investors. ADP's more than four decades of dividend growth proves that it has experienced several different economic cycles and managed to increase its payment to shareholders every year. ADP also has a much lower payout ratio using either earnings per share or free cash flow.Paychex paused its dividend growth but was able to maintain its payments during the last financial crisis. The stock also provides a 40% higher yield than that of ADP.Overall, however, ADP's dividend growth streak and lower payout ratios outweighs Paychex's higher yield. The company's dividend grew during the last recession, giving the edge to ADP in this area.ADP's stock has returned nearly 24% in 2019. This follows a 12% gain in the previous year. Shares of Paychex has performed even better, having increased more than 27% year-to-date after declining more than 4% in 2018. Both stocks have beaten the returns of the S&P 500 so far this year.ADP currently trades at $160 per share. Using the company's guidance for earnings per share for the year, the stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.9. The current valuation is well above our fair value estimate of 18 times earnings. If the stock reverts to this estimate by 2024, total returns would see a reduction of 10.7% annually over this time period.Fortunately, total annual returns also consist of expected earnings per share growth and dividends. Total annual returns for ADP would be as follows:We estimate that shares of ADP will offer a total annual return loss of 0.7% through 2024. We believe fair value for ADP to be $96 per share. The gains in value to start 2019 have greatly reduced our expected total return for the company, and we view fair value at $96.Shares of Paychex trade for $81. Based off of the company's guidance for earnings per share for the year, the stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.4. We have a target of 20 times earnings. Annual returns would be reduced by 7.3% if shares were to revert to this target by 2024.To summarize, expected total annual returns for Paychex would be as follows:We expect that shares of Paychex will offer a total annual return loss of 0.8% through 2024. As with ADP, Paychex's return for the year has absorb all of our expected total return. We see fair value at $57.A side-by-side comparison of the expected returns for ADP and Paychex can be seen in the table below:The increases in share price so far this year have driven the valuations of both stocks to levels usually reserved for stocks favored by growth-oriented investors, not for companies with single-digit growth rates. For these reasons, neither company has an advantage over the other in terms of expected total return.ADP and Paychex are two of the top names in their sector. Both companies have performed well in recent quarters and both should continue to perform well if unemployment remains low.Sure Dividend usually reserves buy recommendations for stocks with at least 10% total return potential. Neither ADP nor Paychex offers even a positive total return estimate at this point, due to their very high valuations.However, if both stocks traded near fair value, we would prefer ADP's potential for earnings growth and streak of dividend increases to Paychex's higher yield."
4251938,102551,2019-03-30T09:19:28-04:00,"Paychex is a leading provider of integrated human capital management solutions for payroll, human resource, retirement, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses.The company is consistently profitable and generates strong free cash flow.It has historically had no long-term debt, but in December, it borrowed $0.8B to assist with the acquisition of Oasis Outsourcing Acquisition Corporation.I am of the opinion we are witnessing another period of âirrational exuberanceâ.I view PAYX as overvalued and would be prepared to add to my position at ~$70 or lower.","I have written several articles at Financial Freedom is a Journey since the beginning of December 2018 in which I have disclosed that I have acquired shares where I deemed them to be fairly valued. For the most part, however, the conclusion I have reached following a company analysis has been to patiently wait on the sidelines for a better valuation.I view myself as an optimist. When it comes to deploying new money in this current environment, however, I am a bit more pragmatic. In my opinion, this is âdÃ©jÃ  vu all over againâ.If you have been investing for several years, I encourage you to recollect general investor sentiment just prior to the âdot.comâ bubble and âThe Financial Crisisâ. During these time frames, stock prices were steadily setting ânew highsâ and people who had never invested before were suddenly making ridiculous amounts of moneyâ¦ on paper.I have the period just prior to the bursting of the âdot.comâ bubble seared into my brain. Clerical employees at the bank with which I was employed were 'day trading' while at work; they would take turns serving âin branchâ clients and placing buy/sell orders on companies about which they knew nothing. Things went well for a bit until... things suddenly didnât go so well.The March 29, 2019 Lyft, Inc. (LYFT) IPO is a classic example of what I view as âirrational exuberanceâ. It goes public at $72, and at market close, the stock is trading in excess of $78. This is a company with a market cap in excess of $26.4B, yet it is unprofitable. In my opinion, and I am not alone in this camp, I think some investors have their âheads in the cloudsâ.Our current period of irrational exuberance might not be to the same degree as just prior to the âdot.comâ bubble. I am, nevertheless, being extremely cautious in this environment.I donât need to look at the broad market to form this opinion. Just looking at the degree to which our investment portfolio has increased in value in recent months leads me to the conclusion that this growth is NOT sustainable.This brings us to the subject of Paychex, Inc. (PAYX). There is no disputing that PAYX has been a great long-term investment. Letâs, however, have a look at its current valuation based on guidance for the remainder of FY2019 and preliminary FY2020 expectations as disclosed on the March 27th Q3 call with analysts.PAYX Q3 2019 results are for the period ending February 28, 2019 and include the results for Oasis Outsourcing Acquisition Corporation for which PAYX announced its intent to acquire on November 26, 2018 and completed December 21, 2018.Source: PAYX â Q3 2019 Earnings Presentation â March 27 2019Details of the Oasis Acquisition were discussed in my December 20, 2018 PAYX article and a recap has been provided in PAYXâs Q3 2019 Earnings Presentation.Source: PAYX â Q3 2019 Earnings Presentation â March 27 2019Total revenue and total service revenue both grew 14% for Q3 to $1.1B and $1B, with the acquisition of Oasis accounting for ~50% of the growth in service revenue. Expenses in Q3 increased ~13% with the acquisition of Oasis contributing ~12% to this growth.It is important to note that total expenses for Q3 2018 included a one-time bonus paid to non-management employees and a one-time charge following the termination of certain licensing agreements. Total expenses, excluding Oasis and these one-time costs in Q3 2018, increased ~9% from Q3 2018; this increase was primarily driven by increased headcount due to investment in the sales force technology resources and operations to support the growth in the business.Interest on funds held for clients increased 27% for Q3 primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. The average balances for interest on funds held for clients were down for Q3 primarily as a result of lower client employees' tax withholdings resulting from tax reform and client base mix; this was partially offset by wage inflation.PAYX stands to benefit from a rising interest rate environment in that it consistently maintains several billion dollars in âfunds held for clientsâ on which it is able to generate investment income.Source: PAYX â Q3 2019 Earnings Presentation â March 27 2019More detail on the nature of these investments can be found in Note F - Funds Held for Clients and Corporate Investments found on page 54 of 82 in PAYXâs FY2018 10-K.Naturally, there is always some interest rate âtipping pointâ at which time further rate increases start to have a detrimental impact on PAYXâs client base and then PAYX suffers. I think we are a few hundred basis points away from this occurring.Despite using part of its cash to pay for the Oasis acquisition, PAYXâs cash position remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $0.886B as at February 28, 2019; this includes long-term restricted cash and long-term corporate investments.Source: PAYX â Q3 2019 Earnings Presentation â March 27 2019Investors familiar with PAYX are used to looking at an impeccable balance sheet in which there is no long-term debt. This changed in Q3 2019 as PAYX resorted to borrowing $0.8B for the Oasis acquisition. In addition, PAYXâs Goodwill and Intangible Assets has also jumped from ~$0.955B as at May 31, 2018 to ~$2.202B as at February 28, 2019.While the balance sheet is no longer âimpeccableâ, there is no need for alarm. PAYX has consistently generated strong free cash flow (~$0.8B in FY2014 and FY2015, ~$0.92B in FY2016, ~$0.87B in FY2017, and ~$1.12B in FY2018) and I have no reason to believe this will change.The following reflects guidance provided when Q2 2019 results were released December 19, 2018.Source: PAYX - Q2 2019 Highlights and Financial ResultsThe following is PAYXâs most recent guidance.Source: PAYX â Q3 2019 Earnings Presentation â March 27 2019Details on PAYXâs historical dividends can be found here and its stock split history can be found here.We see that PAYX recently paid its 4th consecutive $0.56/quarterly dividend and I expect PAYX to announce a dividend increase in the last week of April.PAYXâs dividend compound annual growth rate for 1, 3, 5, and 10 years is 14.29%, 10.88%, 30.16% and 14.51%.In my opinion, PAYX will likely temper its dividend growth while it whittles away at the long-term debt incurred for the purpose of acquiring Oasis. As a result, I am conservatively anticipating the quarterly dividend will be increased by $0.04 (~7%) commencing with the May payment.At $0.60/quarter or $2.40/year, PAYXâs dividend yield would be ~3% on the basis of the March 29, 2019 closing stock price of $80.20.I initiated a PAYX position on July 2, 2009 for our daughterâs Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP), sold shares April 13, 2017 to cover part of her education expenses, and re-acquired shares in a different investment account on March 27, 2018. In all the years I have held PAYX shares, rarely have I seen a dividend yield as low as ~3%.Over the time frame in which I have owned PAYX, I have been more accustomed to seeing a dividend yield closer to 3.5%+. I know this is not an exact science, but if I take my $2.40 projected annual dividend and proceed on the basis of a reversion to the mean (3.5% dividend yield), then a stock price of ~$70 seems more reasonable.PAYXâs historical PE in 2013-2018, based on diluted EPS, has typically been in the mid to upper 20s with the 5-year average being ~26.6.We know that PAYX generated diluted EPS of $2.58 and adjusted diluted EPS of $2.55 in FY2018. The most current guidance calls for a ~4% increase in diluted EPS and an ~11%-12% increase in adjusted diluted EPS for FY2019. On this basis, investors should expect PAYX to generate ~$2.69 (rounded up) in diluted EPS and ~$2.86 in adjusted diluted EPS (using 12% and rounding up).Using the $80.20 March 29, 2019 closing stock price, we get a ~29.8 PE and a ~28.1 adjusted diluted PE.While FY2020âs outlook has yet to be firmed up, I get ~$2.80 in diluted EPS and ~$3.20 in adjusted diluted EPS when I increase managementâs FY2019 guidance by the same percentage growth as for FY2019. On this basis, PAYX is trading at ~28.65 diluted PE and ~25.06 in adjusted diluted PE based on preliminary estimates for FY2020.Some readers may wonder why I am not selling my PAYX shares if I think the valuation is stretched and a pullback is highly probable.First and foremost, I very rarely sell shares in great companies. If anything, I occasionally write short-term out-of-the-money covered calls when I think a companyâs shares are trading at a lofty level; this is merely to skim some additional income. I pick strike prices where the companyâs share price would need to increase quite a bit before reaching my strike price.So far, this has worked out well, although I found myself in a predicament when my Becton Dickinson (BDX) shares were called away because the share price exceeded my $250 strike price (March 15, 2019 expiry). Through a stroke of luck, BDXâs share price plunged March 18th so I repurchased the same number of shares which were called away for just under $244. I then wrote calls with a $260 strike price on March 21, 2019 with a May 17, 2019 expiry.In preparing for this article, I looked at short-term out-of-the-money calls. PAYXâs option premiums are razor thin, and therefore, I am not prepared to employ this conservative option strategy.If anyone is concerned PAYX no longer has an âimpeccableâ balance sheetâ¦ fear not. PAYX generates ample free cash flow annually which should enable it to continue to increase its dividend and to steadily reduce the $0.8B debt taken on for the Oasis acquisition.While PAYX is a great company, I canât say the same for its current valuation. In my opinion, a 10%+ pullback in PAYXâs share price is not out of the realm of possibility; a quick look at a 5-year chart shows that PAYXâs share price has exhibited swings of this magnitude.I do not expect PAYXâs diluted PE to retrace to the low 20s evidenced during 2009-2012, but a retracement to a ~26 PE would give us a ~$70 share price. At this level, I would look to increase my PAYX exposure.I wish you much success on your journey to financial freedom.Thanks for reading!"
4250615,20715,2019-03-22T19:31:52-04:00,"Paychex will report third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings on Wednesday morning.The sentiment toward the stock has been bearish for quite some time, despite the solid fundamental performance.The stock has been trending higher for almost eight years, and the last four years have been defined by a trend channel.","Paychex (PAYX) is set to announce third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings results on Wednesday morning before the market opens. This is the third time I have written an earnings preview on it, and each time the earnings roll around, I am surprised at how bearish the sentiment is toward the stock. Even after gaining 24% since its last earnings report in December, the sentiment toward the stock is still extremely bearish.The chart below shows the two previous instances where I wrote about Paychex. In the article from September, I cautioned readers about buying the stock because it was in overbought territory, and it was hitting the upper rail of its upwardly sloped channel. In the December article, I was bullish because the stock had moved down closer to the lower rail of the channel. We will get to the weekly chart later.Looking at the current situation, it looks more like the September setup than the December one. The sentiment is still bearish, but the stock is overbought, and it is above the upper rail of the trend channel.Diving into the analysis, the fundamentals for Paychex have been attractive, and they remain so. Earnings have grown by an average of 9% per year for the last three years. Earnings grew by 20% in the second quarter and 18% in the first quarter. Analysts expect earnings growth of 21% for 2019 as a whole.Sales have grown at a rate of 6% per year over the last three years, and they grew by 7% in the second quarter after growing by 9% in the second quarter. The overall sales results for 2019 are expected to show growth of 24%.The management efficiency measurements for Paychex are really good. The return on equity is at 42.6%, and the return on assets is 11.02%. The profit margin is at 36.7%, and the operating margin is at 36.9%. It should also be noted that the company doesn't have any long-term debt.The earnings and sales growth rates have been pretty consistent between the three earnings reports that I have covered now, and the management efficiency measurements have been consistent as well. The only thing that I noticed that might be a small cause of concern is that the ROE and profit margin have ticked down a little in the last six months. Even with that, Paychex is well above average in most of the fundamental statistical categories.I mentioned earlier that each time I have started to breakdown Paychex for an earnings preview, I have been surprised at the pessimism toward the stock. Analysts have been constant and haven't changed a bit. There were 19 analysts following the stock in September and December, and there are 19 analysts following it now. There are two ""buy"" ratings, 14 ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings. Those numbers were exactly the same in September and December.The short interest ratio is currently at 6.37. The ratio was higher in September and lower in December. At the end of December, the ratio had dipped down to 2.83 and has jumped back up in the last few months. The jump in the ratio is a combination of more shares sold short and a drop in the average daily trading volume.Paychex doesn't see a great deal of option activity, but the put/call ratio is at 0.45, and that is extremely low and indicates optimism from the options crowd. There are 12,808 puts open and 28,058 calls open. With the average daily trading volume over 1.6 million, the total open interest represents approximately 2.5 days of average volume.Looking at all three sentiment readings, we have bearish analysts, a high short interest ratio, and optimism from the option traders. But the put/call ratio carries less weight due to the low number of shares represented.Paychex has been trending higher since mid-2011 for the most part. A trend channel has formed over the last four years that pretty clearly defines the different cycles within the overall upward trend. When the company was set to announce in September, the stock was up near the upper rail of the channel. At the December earnings report, the stock was down closer to the lower rail. It ended up dipping to the lower rail and slightly below it before taking off.The stock has jumped by over 30% since the December low, and that is better than the 21.4% the S&P has gained since the low in December. I should point out that those percentages are based on the closing price through Thursday (3/21/19).We see that both the weekly stochastics and the 10-week RSI are in overbought territory just as they were in September. The oscillators were close to oversold levels in December, and that is one of the reasons I was more bullish at that time.Here is what I wrote about Paychex in September:I later added the following:I could leave the previous comments alone and not really add anything new. The stock ended up falling 15.6% from the October 2 earnings report through the low in December. It fell for a few days after the December 19 earnings report and then took off. Of course, so did the rest of the market.I really do feel the same way about Paychex that I did in September. I love the fundamentals. The sentiment means there are plenty of doubters on the sidelines than can turn bullish and help the trend continue. However, the overbought levels from the oscillators and the fact that the stock is above the upper rail of the channel make me think now is not the time to buy.If you own the stock, you should probably consider taking some profits off the table. If you don't own the stock and would like to own it, but at a better price, consider selling out of the money puts. Here is what I suggested back in September:I like the same strategy this time around, only I would say that the $70-strike puts would be more appropriate now. The unfortunate thing about the options currently is that the June expiration and September expiration are the only ones available at this time that suit our needs. The June 70-strike puts are trading around $0.60, and the September 70-strike puts are trading around $1.20."
4246145,104122,2019-03-04T11:10:53-05:00,"Paychex offers investors a formidable business with strong operational advantages.The company displays healthy financials, high profitability, and a stable growth trajectory.Paycheck makes a great portfolio addition at a more reasonable valuation.","Source: Google Images Paychex (PAYX) remains a fantastic investment within the consumer defensive payroll processing and insurance space. Stable dividends, continued capital appreciation, and efficient revenue generation remain key operational advantages. The company's stable and recessionary resistant product offerings furnish significant appeal for any all-weather investment portfolio. This article provides a deeper dive into PAYX, discussing fundamental business strengths, growth opportunities, financials, and the stock's current valuation. With $3.4 billion in annual revenues, PAYX is the second largest operator in the U.S payroll processing space. The company demonstrates a considerable array of competitive advantages, including a stable revenue generation model, exceptional management, astronomical profit margins, and encouraging future growth prospects. At its business core, PAYX benefits from operational stability. The company's payroll, human resource, insurance, and retirement management solutions are fundamental elements of everyday businesses, assuring steady and unrelenting demand for the company's various service offerings. PAYX provides payroll processing services to over 200,000 medium and small-sized businesses throughout the United States, demonstrating a low revenue concentration in any single customer. The company's substantial customer network also provides a self-proliferating marketing network as PAYX's commercial customers can facilitate referral business to friends, family members, or business associates. PAYX has historically maintained a client retention ratio upwards of 80%, demonstrating the value, reliability, and cost-effectiveness of the company's service offerings.PAYX operates a consumer defensive business that is subject to unwavering customer demand. Despite fluctuations in the U.S economy, the company's payroll management remain steady and do not experience a precipitous decline. For example, despite unemployment levels rising to a high of 10% during the Great Recession, Paychex's top line revenues were unaffected. Revenue growth only slightly decelerated in 2008-2009 before resuming its expansionary trajectory over the next few years. PAYX also benefits from a number of intrinsic business advantages. Payroll, accounting, and bookkeeping businesses accommodate some of the highest profit margins of any industry due to their limited operational expenditures. PAYX incurs only land leasing, server/electricity, marketing, and employment expenses, drastically curtailing the operational costs of its business. PAYX operates a 3.4 billion dollar annual payroll operation with merely 14,000 employees. The company boasts an astronomical gross margin of 69%, net profit margin of 28%, and free cash flow conversion rate of 33%. PAYX's operational efficiency ensures a high cash flow business that is strategically positioned for future success. Data by YChartsFrom an executive oversight standpoint, PAYX is well positioned. PAYX boasts unparalleled return on invested capital, stable profit margins, secure financials, and strategic growth initiatives. PAYX has fostered an astronomical cash return on invested capital of 51% suggesting overwhelmingly effective capital deployment. I typically look for businesses with a CROCI in the mid- to high teens, but PAYX far surpasses this benchmark percentage, suggesting significant competitive advantages and revenue generation efficiency. PAYX also exhibits a pristine balance sheet; the company has no outstanding debt obligations (a rare characteristic in the U.S' overleveraged corporate environment), significant liquidity reserves of $720 million, and positive shareholder equity. PAYX's healthy financial positioning better enables the company to perform acquisitions, deploy capital, expand into international markets, and outcompete peers. In addition to secure operational and financial characteristics, PAYX demonstrates a stable growth trajectory. The company has tactfully bolstered its service offerings through various business acquisitions. In 2018, PAYX acquired Oasis: the largest privately held employer organization in the United States, conferring more than 8,400 new business clients. Earlier in that year, PAYX also acquired The Lessor Group, an international payroll powerhouse in Northern Europe allowing the company to drive growth in untapped international markets. Historically speaking, PAYX has almost exclusively operated in the U.S market with only a minor presence in Germany. The company's inclination for international growth allows for phenomenal revenue expansion opportunities. Although the U.S market has plateaued in terms of the unemployment rate, PAYX still exhibits a strong growth runway as a result of increased market penetration. PAYX accounts for only a small fraction of the U.S payroll services market. With payroll services amounting to a 40 billion dollar industry in the United States, PAYX encapsulates only 8% of the total market, providing considerable room for revenue and market share expansion. PAYX's intuitive, cost-effective, and comprehensive payroll and bookkeeping solutions will continue to gain market share long into the foreseeable future. PAYX also exhibits strong financial motivations for investment. The company has exhibited sustained capital appreciation and elevated dividend distributions. PAYX has increased its dividend for the past eight years and the current yield of 2.89% provides enticing investment appeal. However, in spite of these attractive investment characteristics, PAYX is slightly overvalued. Based on a discounted cash flow valuation, PAYX's current share price of $77.43 exceeds the future cash flow value in the low $60's suggesting roughly a 20% trading premium. Data by YChartsPAYX operates a competitively advantaged, well managed, and formidable business operation. The stock offers significant appeal as a result of its compelling 2.89% dividend yield and continued capital appreciation. Although I wouldn't recommend investment at 52-week highs, PAYX remains a fantastic stock to add to the portfolio in the event of a decent pullback.

4228829,20715,2018-12-17T17:25:23-05:00,Paychex will report earnings Wednesday morning before the opening bell.The sentiment toward the stock is pessimistic ahead of the report.The stock has been trending steadily higher since 2011.The company currently yields 3.3%.,"Payroll and Human Resource service provider Paychex (PAYX) is set to release its fiscal 2019 second quarter earnings results before the market opens on Wednesday. Analysts expect the company to earn $0.63 per share for the quarter on revenue of $858.3 million.The company earned $0.65 per share in the second quarter of 2018, so the estimate is for a slight dip in earnings compared to the year-ago period. Over the last three years, Paychex has averaged annual earnings growth of 9% per year, and in the first quarter, earnings grew by 18%. Analysts expect overall earnings growth for 2019 to come in 19% higher than 2018.Sales have grown at a steady pace in recent years as well. Over the last three years, they grew at a rate of 7% per year and they grew by 9% in the first quarter. Analysts expect sales growth of 3.8% for the second quarter and 6.8% for 2019.Paychex has really impressive management efficiency and profitability numbers. The return on equity is 43.5% and the return on assets is at 11%. The company's profit margin is at 37.5% and the operating margin is at 37.4%.There were three other fundamental factors that caught my eye and lead me to believe that Paychex will continue to climb. First, the company has no long-term debt. Given the current market environment, I view that as a big plus. Secondly, the company's current P/E ratio is at 26 and the forward P/E is at 21.5. Lastly, the current yield on Paychex is at 3.3% and that can attract investors and keep the stock price from falling too much in a market downturn.The overall fundamental picture for Paychex puts it well above average. The company has solid earnings and sales growth, really strong management efficiency and profitability measures, and an average valuation - all while paying a decent dividend.The weekly chart for Paychex is pretty impressive also. The chart below is for the last three and a half years and it shows how the stock has been very steady. The trend channel defines the different cycles within the long-term trend. The stock did slip slightly in October and that brought it down to the lower rail once again.The good thing about the drop in October is that it moved the stock out of overbought territory and into oversold territory. The 10-week RSI hadn't been in oversold territory since August 2011 before it briefly hit the 30-level two months back. The weekly stochastic readings have hit oversold territory on several occasions in the last three years and in most instances, it has marked a good buying opportunity when those indicators dipped below 20 and then turned higher.In order to show how steady Paychex has been in the last seven and a half years, I have a monthly chart to show you as well. The three blue lines represent a Raff Regression channel, but I am not focused on the channel itself. I used it to show you how little the stock has moved away from the regression line. The stock hasn't strayed very far from that path - it hasn't moved a great deal above it or below it.You can also see how the stock has used the 24-month moving average as support on a few occasions in the last seven years.One of the reasons for the steady climb by Paychex could be the sentiment toward the stock. The short interest ratio is currently at 4.25 and it has been above 3.0 for the past year. It even got as high as 6.75 back in September. Remember that this is a good sign from a contrarian perspective. As the stock price rises and short sellers are forced to cover their positions, it adds buying pressure to the stock.Short sellers aren't the only ones that seem pretty pessimistic on Paychex either. There are currently 19 analysts following the stock and only two have it rated as a ""buy"". Of the other 17, 14 have the stock rated as a ""hold"" and three have it rated as a ""sell"". This leaves more room for upgrades that can lead to jumps in the stock as well.Turning our attention to the options market, the stock has a current put/call ratio of 0.746 and that is a neutral reading. There are 30,833 puts open at this time and 41,317 calls.To recap the sentiment indicators, the short interest ratio is high for a stock that has performed as well as Paychex. The analysts' ratings are extremely skewed to the neutral to bearish side compared to what we normally see for a company with strong fundamentals and a solid upward trend. The put/call ratio is neutral and that isn't a big deal when you look at how bearish the other two indicators are currently.Given the strong fundamentals, the upward trend in the stock, and the bearish sentiment toward the stock, I am bullish on Paychex ahead of its earnings report.The company has beaten its earnings estimates in the last two earnings reports, but it only led to a move higher after the report in June. The stock moved lower after the report in October, but the overall market was moving sharply lower at the time and the stock was in overbought territory at the time. The stock was also at the upper rail of its trend channel.We enter this earnings report with the stock closer to the lower rail of its channel and it's closer to oversold than overbought.I would look to add the stock to your portfolio. I don't think it matters if you add it before or after the earnings report. If the company beats the EPS estimate, it might gap slightly higher, but I think you are better off buying Paychex as a long-term investment than a short-term trade. I would look to hold it as long as the stock stays above the 104-week/24-month moving average."
4239655,50452,2019-02-09T13:43:06-05:00,"Paychex provides a host of business solutions, including payroll processing, insurance, and a suite of HR services.The company has grown modestly over time, but is very profitable with excellent FCF streams. The dividend is growing at a strong rate and yields just over 3%.The company is overvalued based on historical norms, and an operating environment with more to lose than it can offer in the years ahead.We recommend putting Paychex on your watch list. If it can be had for the right valuation, Paychex would make a great addition to any long-term portfolio.","There are certain traits that make a company a strong dividend growth stock, and ultimately a productive long-term investment. We look at profitability, growth, structure of the business model, and other factors to hone in on companies that build wealth for investors over the long term. When we look at Paychex Inc. (PAYX), we see a lot of positive traits that indicate potential for consistent, wealth generating returns over the long term. We review this business model and identify where the company excels as a dividend growth stock. While the foundation for success is present, investors should note that there are near-term headwinds that the company could face. While now may not be the time to buy shares, every dividend growth investor should know who Paychex is.Paychex provides payroll and human resource services to a variety of businesses. The company caters to small and medium sized businesses that may lack the resources to create their own solutions to fit these needs. The company was founded in 1971, and is based in Rochester, NY. The company operates as two segments: Management Services, and PEO (Professional Employer Organization) & Insurance Services. Management Services contributes the vast majority of revenues, primarily driven by the company's payroll management business. The total company brings in more than $3.4 billion in annual revenue.Source: YchartsPaychex has seen very steady but modest growth over the past decade. Revenue has grown at an average rate of 5.05% over the past 10 years, while earnings per share have grown at a rate of 5.16%. The business has done well as increased employment throughout the decade has resulted in more clients and more insurance applicants who all expand the company's client portfolio.When we analyze the operational efficiencies of Paychex, the first area of concern is profitability. We want stable margins and strong cash flow generation. We can see that operating margin has remained stable over time. The chart below shows that margins have arced some, but remain on par with where they were 10 years ago. A company with stable margins is profitable through changes in its operating environment.Source: YchartsPaychex really stands out when we look at the company's conversion rate of turning revenue into cash flow. Approximately $0.33 of every revenue dollar ends up as free cash flow that can be distributed any way the company deems fit. This is more than triple our normal benchmark of 10%, meaning that Paychex is an exceptional cash flow engine.The next metric we look at for perspective is the cash rate of return on capital invested. This metric gauges how effective management is at deploying the resources of a business and generating cash with them. It is also a baseline indicator of the strength of a company's competitive ""moat"". We typically look for a rate of return in the low-teens or higher (13%+) as acceptable, and Paychex again easily exceeds this with a rate of 50.87%. The company's rising CROCI over the years indicates that management has added immense value to the business.Source: YchartsThe last area of review before moving on is the balance sheet. Financial discipline is an important component of a business succeeding as a long-term investment. Companies often take on too much debt/risk, and end up suffering from cash flow problems when the business faces an unexpected headwind.Source: YchartsPaychex maintains a very strong financial footing with its balance sheet. The business currently holds $510 million in cash against just $57 million in total debt. This makes Paychex debt free for right now on a net basis. I say ""for right now"" because the company just took on $800 million in debt as part of its acquisition of Oasis (more on that later). This new debt poses no threat to Paychex's balance sheet, and we expect the company to pay this down rather easily. This debt will show up next quarter because the Oasis deal closed in December.Paychex is rebuilding its reputation as a dividend growth stock after freezing the payout amidst the recession almost a decade ago. The company is currently working on a growth streak that spans eight years. The dividend is paid every quarter and totals an annual sum to investors of $2.24 per share. The dividend's current yield of 3.04% exceeds the yield being offered by 10-year US treasuries (2.63%). This makes Paychex a potentially attractive stock for income focused investors.Source: YchartsThe dividend metrics have all been moving in the right direction as well. Growth has accelerated over the past decade, with a 10-year CAGR of 6.0%. That rate has picked up, resulting in a five-year CAGR of 9.9%. The most recent 12% bump is even higher still. Despite this growth curve, the payout has actually managed to go down. The cash payout ratio was as high as 80% a decade ago, but has fallen to 69% of cash flow. Paychex runs a very capital non-intensive business, so the company is able to afford a higher payout ratio without worry. Investors can expect this dividend to keep its momentum until the macroeconomic tailwinds of high employment and strong economic activity subside. A dividend that yields more than 3% and grows at a double-digit rate is a great compounding tool over time.While Paychex has some very strong fundamentals and a stellar dividend growth record over the past 10 years, the outlook moving forward is a bit less certain. While the company's model is very solid, growth may slow down as the current operating environment is near ""peak level"" for Paychex.Source: YchartsThe current unemployment rate in the US is near generational lows. Any rise in the unemployment rate (likely caused by the next time we have a recession) will have a negative impact on the performance of Paychex. This is likely the largest threat to Paychex because it is all but certain that these negative circumstances will materialize, it's just a matter of time. Unfortunately, we cannot operate in an economic growth phase forever.With that said, Paychex isn't without some tools to drive growth. The company closed on its $1.2 billion acquisition of Oasis in December of 2018. This acquisition gives the company more scale, clients, and improves the company's offerings to its customer base. As we mentioned earlier, Paychex will shrug off the debt from this deal, so future acquisition opportunities remain on the table.Source: Paychex, Inc.The company can also expand into international markets if it so chooses to. The current business operates in the US, and international expansion would require an investment in resources as foreign markets have different rules and regulations, as well as requirements. There is nothing imminent in regards to international markets, but Paychex does have the financial resources to make that jump - either organically, or through M&A. Currently, Paychex services international business through a partnership with FMP Global.Source: YchartsAt just over $74 per share, the stock is trading at the high end of its 52-week range. Analysts are projecting Paychex to earn approximately $2.85 for the full fiscal year 2019. This places the stock at an earnings multiple of 25.96X. This is a slight (8%) premium to the stock's 10-year PE ratio of 23.94X.If we look at valuation from a free cash flow stand point, we can see that as the macroeconomic environment has warmed up, Paychex's stock has appreciated at a faster rate than its cash streams can grow. This results in a lower value proposition over time.Source: YchartsBased on a combination of factors, including a premium earnings multiple, declining FCF yield and a current macro environment with more downside than upside to it, we feel shares of Paychex are overvalued at this level. We feel a more appropriate range (given the above data) would be in the 20X range. This would imply a target price of $57 per share. This isn't a prediction of where the price will go, rather a level at which we would see more reward for a long-term investment than risk.While the fundamentals line up nicely for Paychex, it is apparent that a buying window isn't open at this time. With strong cash flow, a steady business record, a clean balance sheet, and a robust dividend payout, Paychex is a stock that all dividend growth investors should be aware of.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article.Author Disclaimer: Wealth Insights is an investor and investment author.

4233625,63883,2019-01-15T23:57:52-05:00,"Paychex reported solid earnings for the second quarter, as acquisitions have contributed to growth.It has a high yield of 3.3% and a growing dividend.Due to potential reversion of the stock's valuation, we do not expect Paychex to deliver high total returns.","By Nate ParshPaychex, Inc. (PAYX), which is a member of the S&P 500 Index, is a leading provider of computerized payroll accounting, benefits and human resource services.Paychex has a solid dividend yield of 3.3%, but in the past five years, the stock has significantly underperformed industry leader Automatic Data Processing (ADP). Today, Paychex stock has an attractive dividend but a high valuation. As a result, we expect mediocre overall returns for the stock over the next five years.Paychex primarily serves small and medium sized clients, while competitor ADP dominates the large business segment. Paychex currently has more than 600,000 clients. Though it has some overseas business, it operates primarily in the U.S. The company has a market cap of $24 billion and produced $3.4 billion in sales in fiscal year 2018.Paychex released results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 on December 19th (the companyâs fiscal year ends May 31st). It had adjusted earnings per share, or EPS, of $0.65 in the quarter. This was a 20% increase from the previous year and topped estimates by $0.02. Revenue grew 7% to $859 million, $0.66 million above expectations. Paychexâs effective tax rate was 23.8% during the second quarter, down from 34.8% during the previous year.The companyâs Management Solutions division saw revenues increase 5% to $685.4 million. The increase was due to a larger client base during the quarter. Higher asset values helped increase revenues from retirement services. Paychexâs acquisition of Lessor Group, a leading provider of payroll and human capital management software solutions in Denmark, added 1% to growth for Management Solutions.Paychexâs Professional Employer Organization, or PEO, division experienced sales growth of 15%. Total sales during the quarter was $155.2 million. An increase in the client base was the primary driver of growth for this division. Insurance revenue was up due to an increase in health and benefit applicants. Interest on funds held for clients was up by more than 30%. This was attributed to higher average interest rates.It updated its fiscal year 2019 forecast on the conference call.Paychex expects EPS to grow 11-12% for the fiscal year, up from just 11% previously. The company sees strong growth for its PEO and insurance services business during the remainder of its fiscal year. Higher interest rates will likely lead to significant revenue gains on funds held for clients.As stated above, Paychexâs acquisition of Lessor Group contributed a fair amount of growth to the Management Solutions division during the second quarter. Acquiring complementary businesses is something the company has done quite a bit of in recent years. Hoping to bolster its PEO business, Paychex agreed to pay $1.2 billion for Oasis Outsourcing Acquisition Corp. at the end of November.Oasis is the largest privately held professional employer organization in the U.S. It has more than 8,400 clients and is present in all 50 states. This acquisition will allow Paychex to serve more than 1.4 million worksite employees. The company will use cash and new debt to finance this purchase. According to Value Line, Paychex has just $57 million in total debt prior to making this acquisition. It is unlikely that this new debt used to buy Oasis will be much of a burden for the company.While unemployment remains low, Paychex is likely to experience growth. The more people that are employed with its clients means more workers requiring payrolls and other related services. The following chart shows how the companyâs net income and EPS have increased in the past few years.The past five years has seen a double-digit compound annual growth rate for both net income and EPS. Near-full employment has benefited Paychex.We should note that the company's business suffered during the last recession, as EPS results dropped more than 5% per year from 2008 through 2010. Paychex didnât return to 2008âs EPS total until 2013. Despite this decline, EPS increased at a CAGR of 5.2% over the past ten years. We expect the company to earn $2.85 per share for fiscal year 2019, which would represent 16.3% growth from fiscal year 2018.Paychex has increased its dividend for the past eight years. It did freeze growth in 2010 and 2011, but had regularly increased its dividend before the last recession. The dividend increase has been as follows:Investors have come to expect high-single digit dividend increases over the past few years, but the company raised its 12% for the payment made to shareholders last May. This higher-than-usual-sized raise can be taken that Paychex is positive on its future business performance. Shares currently yield 3.3%. This is significantly higher than the 2.1% yield of the S&P 500 and above the 2.7% yield of the 10-Year Treasury Bond.Even with the freeze in 2010 and 2011, dividend growth has surpassed EPS growth. Based off of the current annualized dividend of $2.24 and expected EPS of $2.85 for fiscal year 2019, the payout ratio is 78.9%. This may seem high, but Paychex had an 80%+ dividend payout ratio in each of the past 10 years. The average payout ratio over the past five years is 81.6%.With shares of the company trading ~$67 and expected EPS of $2.85, Paychex stock trades with a price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E, of 23.5. The market has caught on that the company has performed well with low unemployment and has bid shares up accordingly. Due to Paychexâs longer-term growth rate, we have a 2024 target P/E of 20. If shares were to revert to this target P/E, investors would see total returns reduced by 3.2% per year over the next five years.In total, we expect annual returns of 5.3% through 2024 Paychex stock. This forecast is based on an EPS growth rate of 5.2%, dividend yield of 3.3% and multiple reversion of 3.2%.Paychexâs most recent quarterly report showed that the companyâs two divisions are performing well. Acquisitions have played a role in this growth, and the purchase of Oasis should add to the companyâs fortunes going forward. Paychex also has an above-market yield. The payout ratio is high, but below the companyâs average in recent years.That being said, the stock trades with an elevated P/E that is likely to reduce total returns in the coming years. While income investors might be attracted to the stockâs yield, we forecast that that Paychex will offer meager total returns in the coming years."
4209060,20715,2018-09-30T17:21:54-04:00,"Paychex will report earnings on Tuesday morning ahead of the opening bell.The sentiment toward the stock is rather pessimistic and has grown more pessimistic since the last earnings report.The stock has rallied over the last five months, and that has put the stock at the upper rail of a trend channel.","Payroll service provider Paychex (PAYX) has been trending higher for the last three years on the back of solid fundamental performance. The company will release earnings Tuesday morning, and the sentiment toward the stock is rather pessimistic, especially considering how well the stock and the company have performed in recent years.Paychex has averaged earnings growth of 10% per year over the last three years and reported earnings growth of 13% in its most recent quarterly report. The earnings were aided by 9% sales growth last quarter and average annual sales growth of 7% over the past three years.Analysts expect the company to report overall earnings growth of 17% this year with sales growth of 6.5%.The profitability measurements for Paychex are really strong with a return on equity of 44.4% and return on assets of 11.26%. The companyâs profit margin is at 38.3% and the operating margin is 38.1%. One other thing that jumped out about Paychex is that the company doesnât have any long-term debt.The sentiment toward Paychexâ stock really jumped out at me as I couldnât believe how pessimistic the indicators were and how they have grown more pessimistic in the last three months since the last earnings report.The short interest ratio is currently at 6.75, and that is high, especially for a stock that has performed as well as Paychex. The ratio is up from 3.73 at the end of June mainly because the average daily trading volume fell. The number of shares sold short is actually down slightly from 10.3 million shares to 9.9 million shares, but the average daily volume has dropped from 2.75 million shares to 1.47 million shares. With the stock rising approximately 10% since the last earnings report, I am surprised that the number of shares sold short hasn't dropped more. The following table is from Nasdaq.com.Analysts are also rather pessimistic toward Paychex. There are 19 analysts covering the stock and only two rate the stock as a âbuyâ. There are 14 âholdâ ratings and three âsellâ ratings on the stock. In June the numbers were 1/14/4, so there is one more âbuyâ rating and one less âsellâ rating. Either way, the analysts arenât very confident in the stock moving higher and as a contrarian that is something I like to see. It leaves plenty of room for analyst upgrades.The put call ratio for Paychex stands at 0.714 currently and that is in the neutral range. There are currently 19,233 puts open and 26,920 calls open. While the overall reading is neutral, I took note that the ratio is higher than the 0.56 is was at when the company announced earnings back in June.Both the short interest ratio and the put/call ratio are reflective of more pessimism while the slight change in analystsâ ratings isnât a big deal in my opinion. Even with the slight change, there still isnât as much optimism toward Paychex as there should be based on the fundamental performance and the price gains.Looking at the weekly chart for Paychex, we see that the stock has been trending higher for the last three years and the cyclical moves have been confined within a well formed trend channel. The rally that has taken place after the last earnings report has moved the stock up to the upper rail of the channel.The stock has rallied over 29% since the low in April and that was the last time the stock hit the lower rail of the channel. It was also the last time the stock was in oversold territory based on the weekly stochastic readings.We see that the stock is currently in overbought territory based on the weekly stochastic readings and the 10-week RSI, but it has been in overbought territory for several months now without pulling back. The RSI has just moved out of overbought territory this week.Overall I am bullish on Paychex for the long term. The strong fundamentals and the bearish sentiment are the primary drivers behind the bullish stance. However, I would not be looking to buy the stock ahead of the earnings report, but rather I would suggest waiting.There are two main reasons for suggesting investors wait to buy. First, the overbought levels on the RSI and the stochastic readings. Secondly, the stock moved lower on the day of the last three earnings reports. The company beat estimates the last time it reported, but the stock still dropped that day. In the two previous earnings reports the company fell short of earnings estimates and the stock also fell on those occasions.Analysts expect the company to earn $0.65 per share. The estimate has been ratcheted down from $0.67 per share two months ago. Analysts expect revenue to come in at $850.4 million.If you own the stock already, you might consider taking profits on part of your position ahead of the report. I donât expect a big down move after the report based on the slight declines on previous earnings reports. I am more concerned about a possible slide back down to the lower rail of the channel than I am the earnings report itself.If you are looking to add Paychex to your portfolio, I would suggest exercising some patience and waiting for the stock to move out of overbought territory. We could see a slow, steady drop of 10% or so, like we saw from March â17 to August â17. That would likely be enough to get the stock down to that lower rail and present a better buying opportunity.If you want to get paid while you wait, you could sell out of the money puts and collect the premiums. I would suggest going out four to six months at the very least and I would suggest going down to the $67.50 strikes."
4222923,20449,2018-11-16T15:06:43-05:00,Paychex has a growing dividend with a dividend yield > 3%.The company has an asset light business model that requires minimal capital expenditures.Paychex has consistently grown its revenue and diluted EPS for the past five years.Paychex has no long-term debt and generates sufficient cash flow to meet its capital expenditure needs and pay the dividend.Competition from smaller cloud-based payroll and human resource solutions providers is increasing.,"Dividend growth investors primarily seek to purchase the stock of companies with growing but safe dividends. Paychex, Inc. (PAYX) is a company that has growing dividends but little short-term debt and no long-term debt, providing a very safe dividend for small investors. I recently covered another debt-free company with growing dividends in my article âT. Rowe Price Is A Dividend Aristocrat That Should Be On Your Watch List.â Paychex is known for payroll and other human resource function outsourcing. The company has an asset-light business model and requires minimal capital expenditures to grow its businesses allowing it to payout a large percentage of its earnings as dividends. Small investors should keep an eye on this company since it can provide both income and dividend growth. In this article, I discuss the company in context of four criteria for evaluating a dividend growth stock.Source: funscapade.comA dividend growth investor is concerned with at least four criteria when considering a stock to purchase.The dividend yield is one metric that can be used to value a stock before purchase. The current yield is important since a stock with too low a yield may be overvalued. Furthermore, it may not provide sufficient income for a small investor. I generally look for a dividend yield that is preferably > 3% or at least greater than a companyâs average over the past 10-years. I also prefer the stock to have a yield greater than the average of the S&P 500, which is currently ~1.9%. Note that the long-term dividend yield average for the S&P 500 is roughly 2% - 2.1% since the last recession.A dividend growth company should have growing revenue and EPS to support a growing dividend. Both of these metrics should increase annually based on organic growth and acquisitions. Note that revenue and EPS growth rate will likely not be linear due to quarterly fluctuations. It may even be negative for short time periods of economic slow downs or recessions. However, a company that cannot increase revenue or EPS over time will probably have difficulty in supporting long-term dividend growth. If revenue and EPS are not consistently growing over time then a company may need to rely on cash or debt to increase the dividend. Some companies report adjusted EPS but this metric includes one-time adjustments to quarterly earnings. A small investor interested in dividend growth should examine diluted EPS.A dividend growth investor seeks stocks with a growing dividend that increases annually. Many small investors place emphasis on the continuous number of annual increases as an indicator that the company has defensive characteristics and thus can successfully navigate through an economic downturn. A company in the S&P 500 that increases its dividend for 25+ years is referred to as a Dividend Aristocrat and one that does so for 50+ years is referred to as a Dividend King. Similarly, a wider list includes companies that are not necessarily in the S&P 500 but have increased their dividends for 25+ years and are referred to as Dividend Champions. However, it is not necessary to restrict one's potential investment list to only the 53 Dividend Aristocrats or 130 Dividend Champions since there are many other quality companies with shorter streaks of dividend increases.A dividend growth investor desires a safe dividend with a lower probability of a cut. This is often a function of both debt and payout ratio. Too much debt limits the ability to maintain or even raise the dividend due to interest expense. If the interest expense is too high then free cash flow may not be sufficient to pay the dividend. A small investor should check a companyâs liquidity, the amount of long-term debt, total liabilities, and interest coverage. In addition, a high payout ratio means that a larger fraction of EPS is going to pay the dividend and less cash is available for capital expenditures and other activities. In general a small investor desires a payout ratio < 60% - 70%, but this value must be examined in context of the industryâs average.Letâs first review the companyâs business model. Paychex is a U.S. based provider of payroll, human resources, retirement and insurance outsourcing services for small to medium sized businesses. Small business are defined as those with 10 - 50 employees and medium businesses are defined as those with 50 - 1000 employees. Paychex has roughly 650,000 clients. The companyâs model is scalable with minimal capital expenditures. Paychex can add new clients with little incremental cost and also offer new services to existing clients as they grow. Small and medium-sized businesses generally have comparatively less internal HR expertise and rely on outsourcing to grow. The companyâs scale lets it spread costs over a larger client base giving it an advantage in offering new services.The companyâs largest competitor is Automatic Data Processing Inc. (ADP), but this company focuses on medium-sized and larger clients, and thus the two companies overlap in only part of their end markets. Note that Paychexâs competition is increasing for small business customers with the emergence and growth of cloud-based payroll and human resource solutions providers such as Paylocity (PCTY) and Square (SQ).Source: nationalbusinessadvisors.comThe current dividend yield is ~3.3% - 3.4%, which is greater than the average yield for the S&P 500 since the last recession. But it is slightly less than the companyâs average year-end yield since 2009 of ~3.5% - 3.6%. The year-end yield peaked at ~4.25% in 2011. Some small investors may find this dividend yield attractive for income. But note that the current payout ratio is ~84% based on diluted EPS of $0.67 per share in the most recent quarter. Paychex typically has a payout ratio greater than ~70% due to its low requirements for capital expenditures. Note that Paychexâs main competitor, ADP, has a lower current payout ratio of ~68% but this company typically keeps the ratio > ~60%. These values suggest that Paychex is more aggressive than its main competitor in paying out dividends. Although the company's dividend is growing the payout ratio may be larger than desired for some small investors.Paychex recently changed how it reports services revenue. Previously the company reported in two categories of Payroll Services and HRS Services. It now reports revenue in Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Services. However, the majority of revenue is in Management Solutions and in Q1 2019 it generated $687.7M or ~81% of total revenue, whereas PEO and Insurance Services generated ~$158.0M or ~19% of total revenue. These were increases of ~3% and ~39%, respectively, from Q1 2018. The company also generated $17.1M in revenue on funds held for clients, a ~25% increase YoY basis. Total revenue increased ~9% YoY basis. In the past 5-years, total revenue has increased at ~8% CAGR as seen in the chart below.5-Year Total Revenue Growth for PaychexSource: Paychex 2018 Annual ReportNet income increased ~16% to $243.6M and diluted EPS also increased ~16% to $0.67 in Q1 2019. Both values reportedly benefited from U.S. tax reform, which lowered corporate taxes on businesses from 35% to 21%. On an annual basis net income has increased at 11.8% CAGR and EPS has increased at 12.9% CAGR since 2014 as seen in the charts below. Clearly, Paychex is able to generate long-term organic revenue and EPS growth at a time when employment is increasing. However, both revenue and diluted EPS did decrease from 2009 to 2010 during the last recession at a time when employment was decreasing. But both metrics increased again in 2011 as the recovery took hold.5-Year Growth of Net Income and Diluted EPS for PaychexSource: Paychex First Quarter Highlights and Financial Results Fiscal 2019Paychex is targeting total revenue growth of 6% - 7% in 2019. The company is forecasting that Management Solutions revenue will grow at ~4% rate while PEO and Insurance Services will grow at ~18% - 20% rate. The company is also expecting 15% - 20% growth in revenue on funds held for clients. Notably, Paychex will earn more revenue on funds held for clients as interest rates increase.Paychex has increased its regular dividend for seven straight years. It was raised to $2.24 in 2018 from $1.92 in 2017, a ~17% increase. Although seven years is not a long time period in context of dividend growth investing, the company had a longer duration of growing dividends that was interrupted in 2010 when the dividend was held constant when revenue and EPS declined. The company resumed dividend increases in 2011 by raising the dividend ~$0.01 in that year. In the past 10-years the dividend has grown at ~6.5% CAGR but growth has accelerated recently with a rate of ~9.7% CAGR in the past three years. Note that the dividend history was erratic in 2012 and 2013. In addition to the four regular quarterly dividends in 2012, a double dividend was paid in December 2012 and no regular dividends were paid in the first two quarters of 2013. The quarterly regular dividend resumed in July 2013.Paychex had no debt at the end of FY 2017 and FY 2018 providing it with flexibility to raise the dividend and furthermore giving the dividend safety as seen in Table 1. The company had $184.6M in cash and cash equivalents at the end of FY 2017 with no short-term debt or long-term debt. The cash position increased to $358.2M at the end of FY 2018 again with no debt. In Q1 2019, the company reported a cash position of $440.1M but $56.7M in short-term borrowing and no long-term debt.Table 1: Debt Metrics in 2017, 2018, and Q1 2019 for PaychexSource: DP Research and Calculations, Data from Paychex 2018 Annual Report, 10-Q for Q1 2019, and Morningstar.comIn 2017, Paychex did have high current liabilities of $4,725.1M but the majority of this amount is for client fund obligations of $4,272.6M that were matched with $4,301.9M in funds held for clients in current assets. Similarly, in 2018, the company had $5,439.2M in current liabilities but $4,734.9M in client fund obligations that were matched with $4,703.8M in funds held for clients in current assets. In Q1 2019, current liabilities decreased to $4,937.4M but the company had $3,763.8M in client fund obligations that were matched with $3,792.5M in funds held for clients in current assets. This depresses the current ratio, but backing out the client fund obligations gives a current ratio of 0.41 in 2017, 0.51 in 2018, and 0.38 in Q1 2019, meaning that the company has reasonable liquidity.In parallel the client fund obligation values raise the total liabilities-to-equity ratio. But backing out these values since they are matched with current assets gives ratios of 0.31 in 2017, 0.35 in 2018, and 0.38 in Q1 2019. These adjusted values provide a small investor with greater confidence on the safety of the dividend.Lastly, the dividend is covered by FCF. In 2017, Paychex had FCF of $866M and a dividend cost of $662M giving a ratio of 1.31. In 2018, FCF was $1,122M and the dividend cost was $740M giving a ratio of 1.52.Overall, I like Paychex as a dividend growth stock since it has no long-term debt and in addition the company has an asset light business model. But I do not currently view the company as a buy due to too high a payout ratio and increasing competition in some of its end markets. Furthermore, Paychex has frozen its dividend in the past during the last recession when the company experienced both revenue and EPS declines. In addition, the PE (FWD) ratio is ~23 and greater than the current broader market average. Hence, I would like a lower stock price and I view sub-$60 as a point where I would re-evaluate the company for taking a small starter or tracking position.If you liked this article, click on the ""Follow"" button next to my name to see future articles in your feed."
4211832,103231,2018-10-16T08:16:37-04:00,"The current market tension that led to a correction of Paychex's valuation now offers a good entry point for long-term investors.Paychex deserves to be trading at a premium compared to its peers based on its superior ROE and its FCF above the industry.Despite difficulties related to the reform of the Affordable Care Act, and small businesses that are having difficulty hiring, the company has reaffirmed its 2019 forecast.","Image source: Paychex websiteFor the first quarter of 2019, Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ: PAYX) introduced new revenue categories as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606. The company will report on two segments, Management solutions and PEO and insurance services, leaving behind its previous Payroll and Human Resource Services (HRS) segments.The revenues from the Management solutions segment will consist mainly of payroll processing, payroll-related ancillary services, and HR outsourcing solutions, while the segment of PEO and insurance services will offer a combined package of services that includes payroll, employer compliance, HR and employee benefits administration, risk management outsourcing, and the on-site availability of a professionally trained HR representative, among other services.According to CEO Martin Mucci, this new revenue classification better reflects how Paychex's business has evolved to sell more bundled products.Source: Paychex Q1 2019 earnings call slides.The adoption of this new revenue classification seems to come just after some analysts downgraded their recommendation for the company. Paychex has struggled to grow its payroll business in recent quarters, and despite an increase of hiring by its clients, it continues to show signs of weakness. In addition, small companies, which have been a growth catalyst for Paychex in the past, have begun to have difficulties in hiring new staff as unemployment levels reach historically low levels, putting more pressure on this line of business.As a result of these factors, the market sentiment towards Paychex shares has been quite pessimistic in recent months; however, it was not until external factors such as a sector rotation and the increase in interest rates that the stock price began to show red numbers.We believe that the high premium in the shares of Paychex and the current stress environment experienced in the market in general have been the most significant catalysts that have triggered the recent price declines, and not the results or forecasts of the company.Looking at the earnings results of the first quarter of 2019, Paychex again showed the reliability and strength of its business model. The company exceeded expectations both of revenues and EPS, under the skepticism of analysts. First-quarter revenues increased almost 9%, in line with historical growth, reaching $863 million.PAYX data by YChartsLooking closely at growth by segment, we find that Management solutions increased by an estimated 3% Y/Y, reporting $688 million. This increase was driven by growth in the customer bases through the services of HCM, payroll, ASO, retirement, and time and attendance solutions. The acquisition of Lessor contributed less than 1%, with organic growth being the main factor.Revenue from PEO and insurance services increased by 39% to reach $158 million. In contrast, this increase was driven largely by the acquisition of HR Outsourcing Holdings (HROI) from last year, contributing to approximately half of this growth. Additionally, this segment saw a strong increase in demand for PEO's combined services, which is a positive signal for the company.On the cost side, operating expenses for the first quarter increased by 3%. Executives attributed this increase to higher compensation costs, including employee bonuses after the tax cuts, continued investment in professional employer organization technology, as well as the acquisitions and growth of the PEO business. As a result, operating profits were $320 million, or a 37% margin. In contrast, net income increased 16% to reach $244 million as a result of a lower effective tax rate, resulting in a diluted EPS of $0.67, an increase of 16% Y/Y.PAYX Gross Profit (Quarterly) data by YChartsLooking to the future, the executives reaffirmed their expectations for the fiscal year 2019, expecting revenue growth of 6-7%, with an operating margin of 37% and a diluted EPS growth of 11%. The company also expects annual revenue growth of 4% for its Management solutions segment and between 18% and 20% in the PEO and insurance services segment.We estimate that the expectations given by the company are somewhat conservative as a result of the increasing competition it has suffered in recent years. One major competitor in the payroll processing space is Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADP), a company that has seen a slightly higher growth than Paychex.Looking at the balance sheet, Paychex has been characterized by its financial strength, being in the highest rank within the sub-industry of data processing and outsourced services. The company receives a high rating due to a lack of debt and years of generating a positive free cash flow and higher profitability.However, during the last few quarters, there have been some concerns related to the funds maintained for clients, which have gradually decreased, suggesting a future slowdown in its payroll business. During the first quarter of 2019, Paychex reported that funds held for clients were $3.8 billion, compared to $ 4.7 billion at the beginning of the year. Executives attribute this loss primarily to the impact of the tax law reform on customer fundraising, and to other seasonal and cyclical factors that are inherent in the HRS business.Source: Paychex Q1 2019 earnings call slidesAlthough the impact of tax reform on the balance sheet can be considered minimum, this has had a greater effect on the company's cash flow from operations. Executives attribute the decrease in CFO during the quarter to a lower provision for deferred income taxes compared to the prior year. Despite this, Paychex managed to generate a free cash flow above its historical range, again showing management's ability to maintain the performance of the company.PAYX Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe company maintains a plan to actively return capital to shareholders through the repurchase of shares and the payment of dividends. We believe that Paychex's ability to generate a positive free cash flow will sustain this strategy in the long term, making the stock attractive to investors who are looking for a solid company that offers a superior yield.In April 2018, the board of directors approved a dividend increase of 12%, representing a dividend per share of $0.56 quarterly, or $2.24 for fiscal year 2019. We estimate that the company will continue with its trend of increasing the dividend payment as more shares are repurchased, net profit maintains its current growth rate, and management maintains historical levels of free cash flow.Source: Data provided by S&P Capital IQWe estimate that the current market stress has caused a correction in the valuation of many companies in the sub-industry of data processing and outsourced services. In the case of Paychex, we see that the recent fall in the price of its shares offers a good point of entry for long-term investors.PAYX EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsA quick valuation of income-based ratios now shows a more attractive price in relation to Paychexâs projected growth rate. We estimate that the company will easily hold a CAGR close to 7% over the next 5 years, as its financial strength allows it to pursue a growth strategy in the form of acquisitions and other investments that generate both organic and inorganic growth.PAYX Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsAdditionally, we believe that Paychex deserves to be trading at a premium compared to its peers based on its superior ROE and its FCF above the industry. We see that the shares seem attractive from several angles, particularly from the perspective of the P/FCF and the yield of its dividend, especially when comparing these metrics with those of similar companies such as Automatic Data Processing."
4203821,36431,2018-09-04T05:50:53-04:00,"PAYX remains an elite operation.A lower tax rate and solid economic growth have been tailwinds for the company.Valuations are stretched, but could remain that way if the company continues to fire on all cylinders.","Paychex (PAYX) continues to fire on all cylinders, as a lower tax burden has added more fuel to its earnings growth fire. While shares continue to hover around 52-week highs - trading at lofty multiples - this trend might continue if the US economy remains strong.The company's adjusted ROE for fiscal 2018 increased by almost 4% year over year when compared to fiscal 2017's GAAP ROE.Note: I used adjusted ""non-GAAP"" numbers provided by management in the firm's most recent 8-K for all income statement items in the above DuPont analysis. I also calculated adjusted pretax income, aka EBT, by adding ""Investment income, net"" back to operating profit.I decided to use ""non-GAAP"" numbers due to the non-recurring charge the firm took in fiscal 2018 that impacted operating profit, as well as the non-recurring tax-related items related to the initial charge, as well as tax reform in the US. I also decided to reproduce the company's non-GAAP reconciliation below as well:Source: 2018 Q4 8-KBelow I have included the company's GAAP ROE for the 3 years preceding fiscal 2018 for comparison purposes:If we decide to utilize non-GAAP net income for fiscal 2017 as well, then ROE for 2017 would be slightly lower at around 41.32%. That means that year-over-year growth in ""adjusted"" ROE was actually around 5%.Paychex was able to accomplish this by increasing its operating margins (a consistent trend over the past 4 years) in fiscal 2018, which fared well alongside a modest increase in ROE-boosting financial leverage. The amount of sales the company was able to generate from its asset base, as judged by its asset turnover ratio, was relatively static in 2018, however. This isn't a worrying concern, and this was more than offset by higher margins and a lighter tax burden.Another thing to note is the company's interest burden, which isn't actually a burden at all - as the firm's pristine, debt-free balance sheet means that there's no interest expense to worry about. Since the company only generates investment income, its interest burden is actually beneficial in increasing its overall return on equity - unlike many other companies.Paychex is a great business, with high operating margins and the ability to generate above-average returns above-and-beyond its cost of capital. The market knows this well and tends to price shares accordingly. The 5-year average price-to-earnings multiple is 26.64, while the 13-year median multiple is roughly 24 times earnings.The current multiple is even steeper than usual, based on the current price in relation to fiscal 2018's adjusted earnings per share. Analysts expect the company to earn roughly $2.85 in EPS for fiscal 2019 and $3.08 in EPS in 2020 on average, however, putting a price tag of about 25.70 times 2019 estimates and only 23.78 times 2020's estimates, respectively.We can also estimate the rates of growth embedded in the current share price based on a range of discount rates:Assuming a discount rate range of 10% to 12%, then we can assume that there's about 6.30% to 8.23% worth of growth in the bottom line implied by the current price - which is lower than the 11.76% worth of growth analysts are expecting in fiscal 2019 - implying shares could still be undervalued here. If we adjust our discount rate to a higher range of 15% or more than shares are likely fairly valued here at best.Due to its cyclical nature, I like a discount rate range of 12% to 15% personally, and taking this into context, along with the company's earnings multiple based on 2019's estimated earnings, I'd say shares are likely fairly valued here if the company continues to generate double-digit earnings growth - but I also think that there's little to no margin of safety left here, either.The yield is currently at around 3.06% as well, which I'd argue is high for a growth stock. It's also right around the 5-year average of 3%, but lower than the 13-year median yield of 3.34%. To get back to the median yield, shares would have to trade at about $67 a share, or -8.53% lower.For shares to trade back down to the median earnings multiple of 24, based on trailing fiscal 2018 EPS, they would need to fall back to around $61.20 a share, or downside of roughly -16.45%. If we place the same 24 times earnings multiple on 2019's estimates (good for a price of about $68.40), then potential downside would only be about -6.62%.The last time I looked into PAYX shares in October of 2017, they were trading at a similar multiple of roughly 28.46 times earnings. The share price was lower than today, however, at only $64.04 a share. That means that shares have appreciated by over 14%, which illustrates the powerful effects of an above-average operation's ability to return solid share price performance even when starting with an above-average price tag.In my last article, I wrapped things up saying that:I never did pull the trigger back then, despite tax reform becoming a reality. I'm still considering starting a small ""starter"" position here, however, just in case the company continues to fire on all cylinders. Sometimes it's better to ""hold your nose"" and purchase shares of a high price tag company, at least if it truly deserves that price tag.Paychex does have some risks, however.It's a cyclical company that will likely feel the effects of a recession more than many other non-cyclical companies, and it's also heavily exposed to small and mid-sized businesses in the U.S., which have started to show some signs of slowing down. Ideally, I would like to purchase shares in the low $60s range - closer to the 13-year median multiple on trailing EPS. If shares continue to retain their premium multiple, however, I might be waiting a while.Another aspect of PAYX I like a lot, besides its wide moat and double-digit earnings growth, is its dividend growth. The last increase was 12%, and due to the company's healthy earnings and cash flow growth, along with its fortress-like balance sheet, I see no reason why above-average dividend growth can't continue.A starting yield of 3% (which unlike a 10-year treasury, has double-digit growth potential in the form of dividend increases going forward) makes shares a little more attractive than many other high-flying growth stocks in my opinion. This is why I'm still thinking about starting a small position here, with the intention of adding a more substantial amount if shares witness a correction - or perhaps even a bear market during the next recession."
4184480,102551,2018-06-28T10:28:57-04:00,"Paychex recently increased its quarterly dividend to $0.56 after 3 consecutive $0.50 quarterly dividends and reported Q4 and FY2018 results and FY2019 guidance on June 27th.The company has a pristine balance sheet and continues to generate strong free cash flow.I question the extent to which PAYXâs small- and medium-sized clients which conduct international business will be negatively impacted by recently introduced tariffs/retaliatory tariffs.While PAYX might currently be reasonably valued based on FY2019 guidance, I suspect PAYXâs stock price will pullback from current levels.","My wife and I had the good fortune of being able to retire in our early and mid 50s and we certainly have no desire whatsoever to return to the workforce to make up for foolish investment mistakes. As a result, my investment strategy, risk tolerance, and goals and objectives are such that I seek to invest in well-managed companies where wild swings in quarterly and annual results are an anomaly. In addition, I am not a yield chaser and prefer to look at potential overall returns a company can generate as opposed to focusing extensively (exclusively?) on dividend income/dividend yield.Given the above, I strive to invest in companies which consistently show a reasonable compound annual growth rate in various key metrics such as Net Income, Operating Income, Diluted EPS, and Dividend growth.I am a long-term buy and hold type investor and am inclined to just hold investments even if they experience a rapid appreciation in value and crystallization of the gain might be prudent; I am fully aware of the tax implications of frequently buying and selling investments and decided years ago to adopt the Buffett and Munger style of investing where portfolio turnover is kept to a minimum so I donât get bent out of shape if stock prices decline significantly on the condition the decline is not the result of some permanent impairment to the underlying business.My investment style is like âwatching paint dryâ so if your preference is to be an active trader, this article may not be of interest to you. If generating decent long-term investment returns while expending minimal time and effort appeals to you, however, then read on as Paychex (NASDAQ: PAYX) could help you achieve your long-term goals and objectives if management can replicate the companyâs historical performance.This article is a follow-up to my March 27 article for Financial Freedom is a Journey subscribers. In that article I reviewed the companyâs Q3 2018 results which were released March 26. I indicated that shares were attractively valued based on managementâs guidance for FY2018 and retracement in the companyâs stock price to $61.22 on March 26 from the ~$73 12-month high stock price set January 23.In keeping with my disclosure in that article, I acquired 400 shares @ $60.6699/share for the FFJ Portfolio on March 27. Subsequent to my purchase, PAYXâs stock price waffled in the low $60s but then proceeded to run up to a recent ~$70 range.While many readers may not need to contend with foreign exchange conversion rates, my PAYX purchase necessitated the need to convert CDN to USD. At the time, the CDN dollar/US dollar foreign exchange rate of ~1.28:1 was not attractive but I envisioned some headwinds for the CDN dollar in the coming months and suspected it would weaken relative to the USD. As I compose this article, the foreign exchange conversion rate is ~1.327:1. In my opinion, the CDN dollar will likely continue to experience weakness over the next several months.On June 27, PAYX released its Q4 and FY2018 results and provided guidance for FY2019. The stock has pulled back slightly, and therefore, I am taking this opportunity to revisit PAYX to determine whether I should add to my position.PAYXâs mission is to be the leading provider of Human Capital Management (âHCMâ) solutions for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services for small- to medium-sized businesses by being an essential partner with Americaâs businesses.In this regard, it offers a comprehensive portfolio of HCM services and products that allow clients to meet their diverse payroll and HR needs. Its clients can select services on an Ã¡ la carte basis or as part of various product bundles. Using the information gathered in the base payroll processing service, PAYX can offer payroll-related ancillary services and Human Resource Service (âHRSâ) offerings thus enabling it to cover the HCM spectrum.In FY2009, PAYX generated $523.6MM in HRS revenue versus $1.5B in payroll service revenue. As you can see from the following images, HRS revenue has appreciated considerably since FY2009 to the extent where the variance in annual HRS and payroll revenue is only ~$0.3BSource: PAYX Q4 2018 Highlights and Financial ResultsPAYXâs Q4 2018 results can be found here.I like to look back to see how a company has performed relative to previously provided guidance. This is the guidance upon which I relied when I initiated my PAYX position.Source: PAYX Q3 2018 Highlights and Financial ResultsThese are the actual results for FY2018.Source: PAYX Q4 2018 Highlights and Financial ResultsIn my opinion, actual full year financial results should deviate very little from full year guidance provided in Q3 unless there is some catastrophic event which management could not have foreseen. As you can see when you compare projections provided at the end of Q3 and FY2018 actual results, PAYX achieved what management had projected.The following is PAYXâs FY2019 guidance.Source: PAYX Q4 2018 Highlights and Financial ResultsThe reduction in the YoY growth in net income and adjusted net income is the result of the benefit of the one-time revaluation of deferred tax liabilities that was recognized in FY2018 resulting from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. The reduction in the YoY growth has nothing to do with any deterioration in the business.Recently, the US Federal Government has imposed tariffs on foreign imported goods. This has triggered retaliatory measures by foreign countries. While large multi-national corporations will be negatively impacted, I suspect they will find ways to adapt. I am not so confident, however, that small- and medium-sized US businesses which conduct business on an international basis will be able to easily adapt. Since PAYX focuses on small- and medium-sized businesses, I suspect PAYX will be negatively impacted.In my opinion, I think these recently introduced tariffs (and retaliatory tariffs) will be short-lived. We now live in a global economy and to think that a country can operate in isolation is naÃ¯ve and short-sighted. Once US companies and citizens begin to feel the negative monetary impact of these recently imposed tariffs and displeasure over same becomes more widespread, I anticipate removal and/or relaxation of tariffs will occur. I have no idea when this will occur but strongly suspect it will happen before the next US Presidential election.It would not surprise me if PAYX has reached out to many of its clients to determine the extent to which they think they will be impacted by reason of these recently imposed tariffs; I think it would not be unreasonable for PAYX to revise its FY2018 projections as the year progresses. If my hunch is correct, I think PAYXâs stock price will likely be range-bound and to expect a dramatic increase in its stock price is ill-advised.I typically devote a section of my analysis to the assessment of the companyâs credit risk by touching upon the Moodyâs and S&P Global credit ratings. In the case of PAYXâ¦. neither ratings agency assigns a credit rating becauseâ¦ there is no long-term debt!! This greatly appeals to me.PAYX consistently generates strong FCF. Morningstar reports FY2008âFY2017 results for this metric as follows: $0.725B, $0.689B, $0.611B, $0.715B, $0.707B, $0.675B, $0.880B, $0.895B, $1.018B, and $0.960B.The manner in which Morningstar calculates FCF differs slightly from PAYX as PAYX reflects FY2017 FCF of $0.8575B ($0.960B from Morningstar). PAYX reports FY2018 FCF of $0.9022B.PAYXâs consistently strong FCF results appeal to my conservative investment style.At the time of my March 26 article, I projected ~$2.55 in diluted EPS (a 13.5% increase from FY2017) and ~$2.54 in adjusted diluted EPS (a 15.5% increase from FY2017). The stock was trading at $61.22 when I wrote the article thus resulting in a forward P/E of ~24 based on projected diluted and adjusted diluted EPS.PAYX has now reported diluted EPS of $2.58 and adjusted diluted EPS of $2.55 and has forecast a ~3% increase in diluted EPS and an ~11% increase in adjusted diluted EPS for FY2019 relative to FY2018. On this basis, management is projecting ~$2.66 diluted EPS and ~$2.83 adjusted diluted EPS for FY2019.With PAYX trading at $66.89 as at the close of business on June 27, we arrive at a forward diluted P/E of ~25.15 and a forward adjusted diluted P/E of ~23.64.PAYX typically trades in excess of these levels; its P/E based on diluted EPS has generally been in excess of 26 from 2013â2018. During 2008â2012, PAYXâs P/E was in the mid teens to lower 20s.If you have any interest in acquiring shares in this high-quality company, I think you will be waiting an extremely long time for its valuation to retrace to that of the broad index (current S&P 500 P/E of ~20.5). In all the years I have followed PAYX, I do not recollect seeing PAYXâs P/E below that of the S&P 500.On April 27, PAYX announced that its Board of Directors had approved a $0.06 increase in the regular quarterly dividend (a 12% increase); the $0.56/share dividend was distributed on May 24. I was surprised by this early announcement as PAYX has typically increased its dividend in August in recent years.Based on a $2.24 annual dividend and the current $66.89 stock price, we get a ~3.35% dividend yield. While this dividend yield is attractive, I caution Canadian readers to be cognizant of the 15% withholding tax if shares are held in a non-registered account, Tax Free Savings Account, or Registered Education Savings Plan.As previously noted, PAYXâs guidance is for ~$2.66 diluted EPS and ~$2.83 adjusted diluted EPS for FY2019. On this basis, the projected $2.24 annual dividend represents an ~84% payout ratio using projected diluted EPS and ~79% on projected adjusted diluted EPS. These levels are high but are consistent with historical payout ratios. Furthermore, the nature of PAYXâs business and the manner in which the company is operated enables the Board to maintain a high dividend payout ratio without negatively impacting the companyâs ability to grow. In PAYXâs June 27, 2018 Press Release, management indicated that:PAYXâs stock split history can be found here. I tip my hat to PAYX shareholders during the 1986â2000 time frameâ¦ ten 3 for 2 stock splits!While future performance is not guaranteed to be similar to historical performance, I nevertheless would much prefer to invest in a company whose shareholders have been aptly rewarded over an extended period of time than to invest in a company where shareholder returns have lagged the S&P 500.If we look at how PAYX shareholders have fared over various time frames, we see that PAYXâs returns versus those of the S&P 500 vary significantly depending on the time frame analyzed. In my opinion, I think PAYXâs current valuation will present investors with an opportunity to generate reasonable long-term returns. Having said this, I previously noted the possibility of negative repercussions from recently imposed tariffs on some of PAYXâs customers. On this basis, I am inclined to exercise patience and to wait for a pullback in PAYXâs stock price.Source: Tickertech.comIn my March 27 article, I indicated that during the first 9 months of FY2018, PAYX repurchased 1.6 million shares for a total of $94.1 million. For the entire FY2018, PAYX repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for a total of $143.1 million. During both the 9-month and full-year periods in FY2017, PAYX repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166.2 million.Despite share repurchases, the diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding has remained relatively stable at ~362 million (give or take 1 or 2 million shares) since at least FY2009.Unlike many publicly listed companies which have loaded up on inexpensive long-term debt to repurchase shares at what are sometimes lofty valuations, PAYX has repurchased shares using earnings generated from normal business operations. I am comfortable with PAYXâs long-term capital allocation practice and do not expect it to deviate from the following:Source: PAYX Q4 2018 Highlights and Financial ResultsWhile I indicated earlier in this article that I recently initiated a position in PAYX, it is not the first time I have held shares in the company.I acquired shares in PAYX on July 8, 2009 at $24.9399 for our daughterâs Registered Education Savings Plan but sold these shares April 19, 2017 at $58.05 to cover some of her education-related expenses. I fully intended to repurchase these shares in a non-registered account but ended up purchasing shares in another company.I have always been impressed with the company so despite the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude of the negative repercussions from recently imposed tariffs on PAYXâs customer base, I am confident management will be able to navigate its way through what may be some difficult economic conditions over the foreseeable future.PAYXâs pristine balance sheet plays no small role in making me feel the way I do. I think highly leveraged companies with weak free cash flow are likely to experience some extreme challenges in the not too distant future.If PAYX experiences another pullback to the level at which I recently acquired shares, I would be open to increasing my position. Having said this, it goes without saying that I would need to evaluate the benefit of acquiring additional PAYX shares as opposed to shares in other companies which may be more attractively valued.I wish you much success on your journey to financial freedom.Thanks for reading!"
4225495,101421,2018-11-29T14:55:48-05:00,Paychex has agreed to acquire Oasis Outsourcing for $1.2 billion in cash.Oasis is the largest privately-held Professional Employer Organization [PEO] in the U.S.PAYX will gain as-yet undisclosed revenue and cost synergies as well as strategic benefits in the growing PEO market.,"Paychex (PAYX) announced it has agreed to acquire Oasis Outsourcing for $1.2 billion.Oasis Outsourcing operates as a professional employer organization [PEO] to enable companies to outsource various human capital services.PAYX is acquiring the largest privately-held PEO firm in the U.S. and stands to generate revenue and cost synergies as the PEO industry expands in the aftermath of the financial crisis.West Palm Beach, Florida-based Oasis Outsourcing was founded in 1996 to provide outsourced HR services, such as administration and development, employee benefits management, payroll administration, risk management, as well as staffing and recruitment services.Management is headed by President and CEO Mark Perlberg, who has been with the firm since 2003 and was previously President and COO at PRGX.Below is an overview video of the companyâs HR services:Source: Oasis OutsourcingOasisâ primary offerings include:Company partners span the categories of insurance providers, accountancy, and financial partners.Investors in the company include Stone Point Capital and Kelso & Company.According to a market research report by IBIS World, PEO (Professional Employer Organization) gross revenue for 2017 was $170.4 billion and is projected to grow to $177.7 billion in 2023. The PEO industry turned in $1.7 billion in profits for 2017.This represents a CAGR of 9% between 2012 and 2017 and a CAGR of 0.7% between 2018 and 2023.Major competitive vendors that provide PEO services include:Paychex disclosed the acquisition price as $1.2 billion in an all-cash transaction.PAYX will pay for the deal âthrough a combination of cash on Paychexâs balance sheet and borrowings under existing credit facilities or new debt.âManagement expects to âsee a number of revenue and cost synergies as a result of this transaction,â although didnât provide further details about those synergies. Furthermore, the acquisition is expected to have âminimal impact on fiscal year 2019 earnings per share.â Additional information will be provided during managementâs second-quarter earnings call on December 19, 2018.A review of the firmâs most recent 10-filing indicates that as of August 31, 2018, PAYX had $440 million in cash and equivalents and $870 million in total liabilities, excluding client fund obligations.Free cash flow during the three months ended August 31, 2018, was $249.3 million, so it appears the firm has the cash flow to service the additional debt required to close the deal.Paychex is acquiring Oasis to combine its payroll administration capabilities with the U.S.â largest privately owned PEO in Oasis.As Martin Mucci, president and CEO of Paychex said in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, PAYXâs stock price has risen 4.2% vs. the S&P 500 Indexâ rise of 2.1%, as the chart below indicates:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalysts believe that the PAYX stock is largely fully valued, based on their consensus estimates of around $74 vs. the current price of $70. Additionally, the vast majority of analysts have a âHoldâ rating on the stock, as the graphic shows below:Source: Seeking AlphaSo, while I like the acquisition for the potential for revenue cross-selling and cost synergies, management has been tight-lipped about the benefits of the deal as well as the composition of assets it will use to acquire Oasis.The stock has risen 5% since the deal announcement, although the overall stock market has been up which may account for some of the recent rise.In any event, the PEO industry has shown remarkable top-line growth, especially in the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009.From a strategic viewpoint, the combination appears to make sense on paper, combining the complementary capabilities of the two firms to provide small and medium-sized companies with a full suite of outsourced human capital and related administration services."

The numbers, on aggregate, were fine. In Q4, the human resource services segment was up a solid 9% organically, but was weighed down by middling numbers in payroll services (+2% organically).For the full year, net sales were up 7% and operating margins came in at 38% (a slight downgrade from the 39% last year). Cash flow and Free Cash flow continue to be healthy for this company. The company continues to execute behind a solid management cadre.What continues to surprise me, though, is the price investors will pay for this kind of growth. Letâs breakdown the madness. Paychex brought in $933.7M in net income in fiscal 2018.Source: PAYX Q4 Earnings ReleasePAYX also has shareholdersâ equity of $1,955.3M in fiscal 2017 for an outstanding ROE of 47.75%.Source: PAYX Q4 Earnings ReleaseWhile a return on equity of that level deserves a higher valuation, the current price to book is 12.4xSource: YChartsIn essence, this means that if you buy shares of PAYX today, youâre receiving just 3.85% return on your money (47.75% divided by 12.4 P/B).Now, if youâve been a long-time investor in the company, youâre undoubtedly receiving a better return on your initial purchase, but today (7/10/18) 1.276 million shares traded hands. Someone is still going long PAYX at 3.85% return on their money while 10-year treasury yields trade at just a 100 bps discount.But wait, youâre thinking, PAYX is going to continue to grow and Iâll look smart buying at 12.4x book. Well, maybe. In this market, anything is possible. Letâs look at what would have to happen for an investor to earn 10, 20 and 30% return on their money buying PAYX at the current valuationThe previous chart has a few assumptions I should cover. The first is that net income will grow at 11.5% per year. I based this on a few data points. First, in the Q4 earnings call, CFO Efrain Rivera stated, âtotal revenue is expected to grow approximately 6-7%,â which is right in line with the 5-year CAGR. Net income for 2019 is expected to grow 11-12%, higher than the 5-year average of 8.32%.Source: MorningstarFurther, the company seems most bullish on the PEO market which carries lower margins than either the human resource or payroll services. If anything, the above chart is generous.The ROE is what PAYXâs earnings statement will show while the âpurchased ROEâ is the return on cash invested by todayâs purchaser of shares.So, what can we glean from the chart above? Greater fool theory aside, if youâre buying shares today and are hoping for a decent return on your money, you are betting that things will continue to go well for the company for almost a decade without any interruptions.The company will need to continue firing on all cylinders for the next 8.5 years before you start earning 10% on your money. Things need to go perfectly for 15 years for you to earn a 20% annual return on your money.Am I the only one that thinks these valuations are bananas? Is Paychex a good operating company with solid management, undoubtedly yes, but these valuations are in the extreme. Can this investment still make money? Of course, but I wouldnât put my money on it."
4163166,87336,2018-04-16T06:27:51-04:00,"Over the past decade, Paychex has demonstrated the ability to be the cleaner operator.Despite ADP's enviable dividend streak, Paychex earns better returns on shareowner capital.Paychex is valued as though it is a grossly inferior company. It clearly is not.","I'm a sucker for a good entrepreneur story. The idea that someone could start a business in their basement and have it become the next great American company, or that someone could be fed up with their job, cobble together a few dollars and start a project in their off-hours that replaces their income from ""The Man"" is so romantic and inspiring.In my personal taste, one doesn't have to cure cancer for it to be viable or respectable. As Chris Guillebeau has taught us, a perfectly reasonable side income can be had making saddles for chickens.Such was the case in 1971. B. Thomas Golisano took his idea of payroll processing for companies with under 100 employees to his employer Electronic Accounting Systems, Inc. as an idea to expand their business, the ""outside the box"" thinking that corporations always stress. They rejected him twice. So with $3,000 of his own money, he left the company to start Paymaster.He took out loans, borrowed money from friends, and charged credit cards in the beginning. But by 2000, Paychex (PAYX) had surpassed Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK), Bausch & Lomb, and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) to become Rochester, NY's most valuable company. Moreover, in the nearly five decades since its founding, Paychex has delivered steady and almost predictable revenue growth for stakeholders.From those humble beginnings, Paychex now serves ~600,000 clients, providing payroll, insurance, human resources, and retirement options to small and midsize businesses predominantly in the United States.Golisano is not at the helm anymore. He moved to Florida, married Monica Seles, and donates an inordinate amount of time and energy to philanthropy. But what he has left is a company worthy of our consideration.I am a dividend growth investor in my retirement portfolio. And as such, Paychex is a cute story, but the elephant in the room is a simple question: why not just invest in Automatic Data Processing (ADP) instead? It is quite a bit larger than Paychex by market cap ($52 billion vs. $22 billion), has a larger and more diversified client base, and ADP has increased its dividend over three decades longer than PAYX. It would seem to be not much of a contest. Here is my rationale for going the other way.Addressable MarketWhile Paychex makes their bones in the small (10-50 employees) and medium (50-1000) sized business space, ADP has no problem going after those, plus multinational corporations. As a result, ADP is responsible for cutting the payroll check for roughly 1 out of every 6 workers in the United States and 13 million workers worldwide. In addition, they offer wage collection and remittance in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, France, China, India, and the Netherlands, and offer products in more than 110 countries.By contrast, Paychex by design has long been predominantly a U.S. story that has just started writing international pages. Even though they've had a presence in Germany for the past ten years, it has never proven material to earnings. However, with the March announcement of the acquisition of Lessor Group from a Nordic private equity firm, Paychex is getting a 46-year old HR company with presence in Germany, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Though it will only account for 1% payroll revenue initially, the optionality is certainly there to gradually become a bigger piece of the pie.In my view Paychex has the longer runway ahead of it. And though revenue growth is acceptable at both companies, the dwarfing size of ADP means that barring a tie in 2014 Paychex has already exceeded ADP in revenue growth every year since 2013.Margins and ReturnsNot only is Paychex holding their own in growing their top line vs. ADP, they're having to spend less of their money in order to do it. For the last decade now, Paychex has simply been the cheaper operator.As a result, a higher percentage of Paychex's revenue makes it down to the bottom line and by extension, back into the business or available to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Consistently ~$.25 of every dollar of revenue makes it to Paychek's bottom line, verses $.12-.14 for ADP. If revenue growth continues, over time this discrepancy will prove meaningful.What emerges then is that Paychex more than holds its own with ADP in actual returns on shareowners' equity.Moreover, Paychex has been able to do this without taking on any long-term debt. As a result, Paychex consistently dwarfs ADP in its return on assets already in the business and the capital that gets invested in it.With my time horizon, these latter three numbers are the ones I care the most about. As a shareholder, some of the equity will be my own, and time and again Paychex has shown the ability to be a more than sufficient steward of shareholder capital.BusybodiesBack in olden times, activist investors took meaningful positions in dumpster fire situations, with the hopes that any improvement would result in outsize returns. That appears to be passÃ©, as progressively shorter time frames for demanded returns makes it untenable to wait for those situations to positively develop. The new model appears to be taking over mediocre, suboptimal or simply good situations in the hopes that a few minor tweaks can increase performance.Wendy's (WEN), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Darden Restaurants (DRI), Pepsi (PEP), among others, are companies that have felt the hands of activist investors in recent years to varying results - not to mention the fiasco over at Procter & Gamble (PG). Unfortunately ADP is also on this list.This isn't to say that this automatically makes ADP an inferior investment. Pepsi was and is perfectly deserving of investing dollars, and was able to rebuff their encounter with activists - including the idiotic idea of divesting its snack business. However, the risk for ADP is that dealing with well-heeled investors with an eye on the shorter-term will cause management to make decisions that will compromise the long-term health of the business.About that StreakThere is no denying that ADP has the more enviable dividend growth track record. 7 looks terrible next to 43. Paychex floundered in the Great Recession. Exiting founder Golisano and the arriving (September) CEO Martin Mucci made the decision in 2010 to freeze the dividend at the 2009 level. Had this not occurred, Paychex's streak would not be 7 but 30, as they otherwise have increased their dividend every year since establishing one in 1988.Moreover, Paychex's dividend growth rate has come more in line with ADP's venerable record in recent years.Though in the interest of full disclosure, ADP's dividend continues to be better covered by free cash flow. However, any percentage under 75% is perfectly acceptable.There are a couple of industry risks associated with both ADP and Paychex. First, both companies cite the risk of the Affordable Care Act being repealed as having a negative effect on their business. Both companies have spent much manpower and headspace walking current and new clients through the complexities of complying with the new regulations. To have to roll all of that back due to a repeal is an understandable worry.In my view this will not happen. Regardless of party, the political class is predominantly concerned with self-preservation. Campaign and political rhetoric aside, to be on record as voting against health insurance for the most vulnerable of Americans will not be good optics come reelection time. That nothing happens, or that it remains the law of the land with a few tweaks around the edges is exponentially more likely.Second, and more germane, is the volatility that a downturn in the economy would play. ADP and Paychex are at the forefront of both economic expansion and contraction. While it is true that small and medium-sized businesses are responsible for most of the new hires in this country, they also are more volatile. ADP has built-in protection in that the corporation side of their customer demographic is relatively more stable in economic downturns. This is a protection that Paychex does not have (which explains their disparate performances during the Great Recession).Third and most pressing to Paychex is good ol'-fashioned competition. ADP and Paychex are the Coke (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi of the human capital management business. The width of their moats is based on their ability to provide a veritable panoply of products for their clients - payroll, retirement, insurance, etc. - better than the other. Once the tentacles are in, the pain in switching providers is often prohibitive, but not impossible.2017 saw a modest step back in existing revenue retention for Paychex after a company record 2016. Though reliance on bigger clients may skew the numbers towards ADP a tad, and even though retention at ADP has decreased for two years in a row, ADP's existing revenue retention is still ~90%, 9% higher than Paychex's. Tightening the screws on this will undoubtedly lead to even more pressure on ADP.Paychex is not quite breathing down ADP's neck but in my view it has already begun to close in. They are better managers of shareholder capital (though ADP could never be called a slouch). However, their stock prices appear as though the gap between them is much wider.PAYX PE Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsIn practical terms, from Friday's close, if Paychex closed at ADP's TTM PE multiple, the stock price would have been 21% higher. Frankly I don't think there's that much of a gap between the two companies. Over time I would expect it to converge.Automatic Data Processing is perfectly worthy of investment - and for the ""well-seasoned"" investor, the case could be made that it is the more desirable of the two. However, my time horizon is such that chunks of my retirement portfolio must be focused on ""next"" and not ""now"". Paychex is the better operator, the better steward of shareowner capital, and although ADP's dividend track record is easily the more desirable of the two, ""past performance is not a guarantee of future results"". The disclosure will show that I don't have any intention of buying Paychex in the next 72 hours. However, it is only because I don't currently have the cash to do so. It will be in my retirement portfolio when I can remedy that.If you found value here, make sure to follow me to get future updates.

My basic thesis was that if investors would have looked back far enough in history, they would have known that Chicago Bridge & Iron (NYSE:CBI) was a highly cyclical stock and that they could expect sell-offs of the stock up to 80% to happen on occasion.The most pointed critique of the article came from investors who were sitting on gigantic losses in their CBI stock. Several of them noted that my article didn't do them a whole lot of good now, and they wondered where the article had been a year earlier, before CBI's price had dropped.Even though I claim no ability to predict the top of any stock, I have been trying my best in a recent series of articles to examine some of these rapidly rising stocks from a different point of view - a point of view that examines how far they might fall, rather than simply examining how far they might continue to rise.In January and February, I wrote about 11 cyclical industrial stocks asking the question ""How far could they fall?"" if we were to have a market downturn. Beginning in March, I switched over to the service sector and asked the same question, examining Union Pacific (UNP), Costco (COST), FedEx (FDX), S&P Global (SPGI), CSX (CSX), Carnival Corporation (CCL), Southwest Airlines (LUV), and Ross Stores (ROST). In this article, I will examine Paychex Inc. (PAYX) to see what its historical cycles might be able to tell us about its next potential downcycle.This article won't be a comprehensive examination of Paychex. Instead, it will mostly serve as a way to simply examine the value of the stock from a different point of view. Generally speaking, I assume most readers already own or are interested in owning Paychex, and already find the business fundamentals attractive. This article also serves as a sort of preliminary examination on my part to see if Paychex is a stock I might want to buy during the next downturn. Because I employ a medium-term investment strategy, that is the time-frame I focus on in the article. That said, I think even if one is a long-term investor, knowing the history of a stock's price fluctuations can be very useful from a psychological standpoint. It can help an investor be mentally prepared for what is 'normal' for a certain stock, and potentially prevent selling near the bottom. Additionally, I think an article like this can be useful to anyone sitting on cash waiting for a good entry point for the stock.PAYX data by YChartsSince my primary technique for analyzing Paychex involves estimating how far the stock might fall from its peak, the first thing we must consider is whether it is reasonable to think that at some point in the next 3 years Paychex might be close to a peak price. There are several pieces of data I like to look at in order to estimate this. The first is how far the price has risen since the stock's last major downcycle. In the case of Paychex, it has more or less tracked the S&P 500 the past ten years and hasn't seen any sort of alarming price appreciation whatsoever. Normally, might skip analyzing a stock like this, but, since I usually use highly cyclical stocks when I do this sort of analysis, I wanted to at least analyze one stock that appeared 'average' compared to the market on a 10-year basis, and I also wanted to explain a little bit how I adjust for good stocks that have experienced a major shift from growth stock to income stock at some point in the past. Additionally, I don't write about stocks from an income perspective a whole lot, and Paychex has some unique income producing qualities that I think investors who are currently in retirement should examine closely.First, let's look at a longer-term return comparison of Paychex and the SPY:PAYX data by YChartsWhen we go back to 1995 we see much bigger outperformance from Paychex than we have the past ten years. We also see, in the year 2000, Paychex experience what I refer to as a 'supercycle' when I'm writing about more cyclical stocks, but, what is for Paychex, more of a permanent shift from a growth-oriented stock to an income-oriented stock. Since that shift, from January 2002 to January 2018, the total return from Paychex and the SPY has been very similar.PAYX Total Return Price data by YChartsWhat might be interesting for dividend investors, though, is that if we just look at the price performance from January 2002 to January 2018 in the chart below, Paychex underperforms the SPY. This is because Paychex's dividend is considerably higher than that of SPY's.PAYX data by YChartsQuite often I get comments from folks who are dividend investors who prefer to buy individual stocks instead of ETFs. I think Paychex could serve as a higher yielding proxy for the general market, provided one does their homework on the business fundamentals of the company and everything checks out. Paychex's current dividend yield is 3.23% compared to the SPY's 1.84%. Basically, what this means is that Paychex is growing close to the same rate as the general economy, but it is paying out a higher percentage of its profits to shareholders in the form of dividends. For those investors who choose to focus on dividends, this is an ideal stock.Let's take a quick look and see how it is currently valued based on its historic p/e average ratio using F.A.S.T Graphs:Based on a 10-year 'normal' p/e ratio of 23.3, Paychex is only 5% overvalued, however, I think it is important to take into consideration where we are likely at in the economic cycle. Even on this F.A.S.T. Graph, we can see that at the bottom of the Great Recession, Paychex traded around a 15 multiple, and as recently as January of 2018 it traded at a 28 multiple. Given the long run that the market has had and the fact that the Federal Reserve now seems committed to tightening monetary policy over the next couple years. I think it's fair to start considering how far Paychex could fall due to multiple contraction over the medium-term of 3-5 years.Some of the key factors current Paychex shareholders might want to consider are the speed at which the stock price could fall, how deep the plunge could be, and how long they might expect the stock to stay below the price at which it is today. Over the past 35 years, Paychex has had six sell-offs of 35% or more as depicted in the table below:*This was not a full recovery. I reset Paychex parameters after 2002 when it switched from growth stock to income stock.With the exception of the sell-off in 2001, Paychex has been pretty consistent, dropping in the 40-50% range during downturns. What happened during the 2001 decline is one of the main reasons I wanted to write this article. In the past, I've written about how I go about buying cyclical stocks after they have recently experienced a super-cycle. (Check out my article on 3D Systems (DDD) for an example.) When I first looked at Paychex, I thought I was looking at something similar to a super-cycle in 2001, but instead what was actually happening was Paychex was transitioning from a growth stock to an income stock. The long-term historical p/e chart tells the story:PAYX PE Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsFrom the early 1990s through 2001, Paychex was valued as a growth stock with a p/e consistently above 30, briefly peaking over 100. By the time the market bottomed in 2009, Paychex had fully converted to an income stock with a new p/e to reflect the change. Now take look at Paychex historical dividend yield:PAYX Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YChartsBasically, the yield didn't break 1% until 2002 after the price had bottomed. For a long period of time after the Great Recession, the yield was above 4%. And we can see that when times are good, Paychex is willing to significantly increase the dividend, but when times are tougher, they hold it steady. Lately, they've been raising it. The fact that Paychex hasn't raised the dividend every single year no matter what, which would have placed it on a number of popular dividend streak lists, is allowing it to trade at a much better valuation compared to many other dividend growth stocks. If DGI stocks have gotten crowded, Paychex hasn't joined in much.Some dividend investors might think it reflects negatively on Paychex that they haven't insisted on consistency with their dividend increases over the years. I think completely the opposite of that. I think it shows excellent and prudent management that is focused more on their business than on temporary stock gains that could be achieved by appealing to a certain class of investors. It's actually quite refreshing to see.Did I mention that Paychex essentially has no debt? It's almost unbelievable when you consider how levered up many other companies are. Even so, this year Paychex has been punished by the market relative to the S&P 500:SPY data by YChartsIf this trend continues it should create an opportunity. It appears right now, at least, that the market plans to disproportionately punish Paychex during the next downturn. I think once Paychex declines about 35% from its high price of $73.10, and there is a significant spread of say 20% between the SPY's decline from its high price (For example, if SPY fell ~15% off its high, and Paychex fell ~35% off its high.) then I would consider Paychex a good buy. If Paychex doesn't recover to that high of $73.10, I would be targeting a price of $47.52, which should yield well over 4%. That yield should be pretty safe, too. During the Great Recession, Paychex earnings fell 15%. That was the only time earnings had had a significant fall in the history of the company. Its payout ratio is about 78% right now, so even with an earnings decline of 20%, they should easily be able to cover the dividend. Paychex appears to me to be a great income stock for retirees. Its business prospects more or less track those of the country as a whole, but it provides far more income than an S&P 500 index fund. Additionally, the market might punish the stock disproportionately if we have a bear market. If this happens it would create a great opportunity for income investors to get a relatively safe long-term income stream.As for me, since I'm not in retirement yet, and Paychex will likely have a fairly slow recovery time (I think the 6 years we saw after the Great Recession is likely to become the norm in the future.) I probably won't be buying it unless there becomes a really big disconnect between Paychex value and all the other stocks I track. There is a scenario where Paychex might lag the recovery so much that it becomes a great relative value midway through the next economic cycle. But I'll probably be buying Paychex much later in the cycle than I would most of the deeper cyclicals I focus on.As for those who already hold Paychex, it's obviously not the prime time to rotate out of the stock since it has already underperformed the market by 9% this year, but I think PowerShares S&P 500 Low-Volatility ETF (SPLV), even after the decline we've already seen in Paychex, could probably still offer some protection to the downside. What SPLV does is take the least volatile 100 stocks of the S&P 500, rebalance them quarterly, and weight them more heavily toward those stocks that have demonstrated the least volatility over the previous 12 months. SPLV's most recent rebalance and reconstitution occurred near the end of February. This allowed the ETF to factor in the volatility associated with the mini-correction we had at the end of January, which in my estimation makes it more defensive.I think if one rotated out of Paychex here and into SPLV, they would likely be able to rotate back into Paychex and own 15% more shares at no extra cost during the next bear market. The tricky part here is that the market (and Paychex) could still rally between now and then. Current Paychex owners might want to wait for a rally and see if they can get the price back up to around $70 before rotating out. This would probably be my exit point if I was a current Paychex owner and that would likely net 20% more shares using the rotational strategy I noted above. Plus, Paychex isn't a dangerous stock to own during a downturn. If the price never recovers to $70 before the next bear market, it wouldn't be the end of the world to just ride out the storm holding Paychex. To sum everything up: For value investors watching the stock looking for an entry point, I wouldn't consider buying until the price falls below $47.52, and I would also like to see it trading at a discount to the S&P 500. For current shareholders, I would hold and look for a rise in price to around $70 per share, at which point I would rotate into SPLV until we have a bear market, at which point I would rotate back into PAYX.

4115544,36431,2017-10-23T15:03:24-04:00,"Paychex is a leading human capital management firm.It's an above average operation, with a moat that's reflected in the numbers.Valuations aren't great, but rising rates could mean more growth.","Paychex (PAYX) is a leading integrated human capital management firm, specializing in providing services for small to medium-sized businesses. It provides services such as payroll, human resource management, retirement, and insurance services. Its business is also relatively ""sticky"", as the company maintained a client retention ratio of roughly 81% in fiscal 2017, which was slightly down year over year - but still near record levels.It also operates almost exclusively in the U.S. (despite very small operations in Germany). While it appears tax reform could provide an immediate boost to its operations (due to its mostly domestic footprint and relatively high tax rate), lower taxes could also negatively affect interest income. Either way, it's an elite business that could thrive going forward.To better illustrate not only the potential effects of lower domestic taxes but also why I think Paychex is an elite franchise business, I broke down its return on equity into five pieces (using data from its 10-K) in the below DuPont analysis.The firm's currently high tax rate is reflected in its tax burden. Let's get hypothetical here and say that its tax rate falls to 20%, which would greatly alleviate its tax burden, bumping its already impressive return on equity into the 50% range or higher.A lower domestic tax rate could also potentially decrease the amount of interest income the company receives from investing its clients' funds (such as those that are collected but not yet remitted to tax authorities), which is expected to grow by the mid-to-upper teens this fiscal year, because lower taxes means less funds held that can be invested. This might not matter much, however, if rates continue to rise - because Paychex will be able to earn more attractive returns from its invested funds, which are mostly high-quality investment grade securities and other ""cash equivalents."" It should be noted that interest on funds held for clients increased 14% during Q1 of fiscal 2018.While a combination of lower taxes and rising rates could be a very beneficial mixture that improves the firm's underlying fundamentals, it is already a very strong operator as it is. This can be seen by its sequential improvements in its operating margins, which are expected to hit 40% in fiscal 2018. It's also managed to continually improve efficiency over the past three years, as exhibited by its improving asset turnover ratio. These factors have driven Paychex's ROE to an impressive 42.29% in fiscal 2017, despite modestly decreasing leverage over the last three years. As indicated before, if we're heading into a rising rate/lower tax rate environment, I think there's a lot of room to improve the company's ROE even more.Another impressive aspect of Paychex's business is the fact that it utilizes no debt (and relatively few leases). It also isn't very capital intensive. As a result, it gushes cash, as can be seen below.Free cash flow as a percentage of sales is consistently in the mid-twenties and often in the thirties-or-higher range. This means that for every dollar in sales the company does, it's capable of turning roughly $0.25 to $0.30 into free cash flow.Free cash flow has also consistently covered (or is most cases, exceeded) its net income.This indicates that its earnings are of high quality.To wrap things up in this section, I'll argue that Paychex is a very financially healthy firm - with strong profits that are backed up by ample amounts of cash flow. PAYX currently yields over 3% and last increased its dividend by almost 9%. I think its strong balance sheet and strong cash flow profile gives it plenty of opportunity to remain an attractive candidate for dividend growth, in my opinion.PAYX shares maintain a lofty price tag on an earnings basis.Despite a very high price-to-earnings ratio on an absolute basis, this is actually lower than the industry average multiple, according to Morningstar. At 28.46 times earnings, PAYX shares are still pricey versus their own five-year average multiple of only 24.9 times earnings. It's also pricey when stacked up against the 13-year median multiple of only 23.87 times earnings. It appears a sizable amount of optimism regarding the firm's future may already be baked into the share price.I also decided to run a range of discount rates and then determine the implied growth rates baked into PAYX shares, as seen below.I think that this helps put valuations in context of the firm's growth, and due to the imprecise nature of discount rates, I chose to utilize a range of them. According to guidance provided by Paychex, top-line growth of roughly 6% is expected in fiscal 2018. This is expected to produce diluted earnings per share growth of roughly 5% to 6% on a GAAP basis and ""adjusted"" diluted EPS of around 7% to 8%. Using a relatively conservative discount rate of 10% to 12% therefore puts shares in the slightly overvalued range, in my opinion.I'm attracted to Paychex mostly because of the value that can be unlocked if tax reform happens, as well as its positive sensitivity to higher rates and broad growth in jobs and the overall economy - similar to many domestic banks. The thing I like about the company (especially as a ""higher rates"" play) is its unique risk profile compared to most banks, such as its modest use of leverage (the complete opposite of a bank) and relatively transparent balance sheet compared to most banks.While I'm a big fan of Paychex as a business, I'll likely hold off from purchasing PAYX shares in any meaningful amount unless I can get them at 25 times earnings or less. I am considering starting a small position, though, because I think that in a perfect scenario where tax reform actually happens and rates continue to steadily rise, Paychex will not only benefit but also thrive. This appears to be somewhat reflected in the share price already, but perhaps not all of the upside is completely captured in there yet. If tax reform fails, I think shares are overvalued here, but the business will likely still continue to benefit from rising rates.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page by the author's name."

This was followed up with an April 24, 2017 post in which I indicated I sold PAYX shares, which were held in a Registered Education Savings Plan. While I fully intended to reinvest the sale proceeds by re-acquiring PAYX shares, this did not materialize as I ended up acquiring shares in other companies.I still intend to re-acquire PAYX shares at some stage because it is a wonderful company with a great business model. With this in mind, I provide my current thoughts on PAYX.Investing in any company comes with risks. Readers are encouraged to review the âRisk Factorsâ section found under Item 1A in PAYXâs 10-K as at May 31, 2017.On October 3, 2017, PAYX released its Q1 2018 results. It continues to maintain a remarkably pristine balance sheet with virtually no debt other than ~$5B in âClient Fund Obligationsâ which is more than offset by âFunds Held for Clients.âUnlike many other companies I have analyzed, which have grown by acquisition and which have significant âIntangible Assetsâ and âGoodwillâ on their balance sheets, the amounts reflected for the two asset classes are relatively reasonable.The $0.041B uptick in to $0.698B in Goodwill subsequent to PAYXâs May 31, 2017 fiscal year end is attributed to the August 2017 closing of HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (âHROIâ) and all of its operating subsidiaries; HROI is a national professional employer organization that provides HR solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses in more than 35 states.PAYXâs Q1 2018 highlights and financial results can be found here. Select images from this presentation are provided below.Source: PAYX Q1 2018 Highlights and Financial ResultsIn its presentation, PAYX noted that:I thought it would be beneficial to provide the current yearâs and last yearâs outlook for comparison purposes.Source: PAYX Q1 2018 Highlights and Financial ResultsThe National Federation of Independent Business confidence indicators point to small business momentum but regulatory uncertainty could stifle this momentum. If corporate tax reform is implemented, I suspect PAYX would benefit in a reduction from its ~35% current tax rate.PAYX also faces a possible setback depending on the outcome of the Department of Labor's Overtime Rule. If enacted it could have a negative impact on the demand for Human Capital Management solutions. There is also some uncertainty at the client level pertaining to new signings from the Affordable Care Act and the recent hurricanes in Texas and Florida could negatively impact PAYXâs sales results.While rising interest rates will benefit PAYX in that it holds several billion in client funds, it remains to be seen what impact further interest rate increases could have on PAYXâs core client base: small to medium-size businesses.PAYXâs quarterly dividend is currently $0.50 with the next dividend payable November 15, 2017 to shareholders of record as at November 1, 2017. Based on the current stock price of $64.57 we get a ~3.1% dividend yield.If you are a Canadian resident, please be cognizant that owning PAYX in a non-registered account is going to result in a 15% withholding tax haircut so your dividend yield will be ~2.64%.PAYXâs compound annual dividend growth rate for 2008â2017 is reflected below.Readers should keep in mind that dividends are historically paid in August, November, February, and May. In fiscal 2013, however, the dividends that would typically have been paid in February 2013 and May 2013 were accelerated and paid in December 2012. This explains the dramatic changes in growth reflected above.The nature of PAYXâs business and the manner in which the company is operated results in strong free cash flow (even during the Financial Crisis). Despite maintaining a dividend payout ratio in the ~80% range, management has been able to finance growth without the need to take on debt.Source: MorningstarHad you invested $100 in PAYX common stock on May 31, 2012 and reinvested all subsequently received dividends, your 5-year cumulative return would have fared relative to the S&P 500 Index and a Peer Group Index as reflected below.Source: PAYX 2017 10-KManagementâs reasons for changing the members of PAYXâs Peer Group can be found on page 14 of 85 in the 2017 10-K.PAYX reported adjusted diluted EPS of $2.20 in FY2017. The forecast for FY2018 is a 7-8% increase (~$2.35-2.38) as reflected in the Fiscal 2018 versus Fiscal 2017 Outlook section above.The current mean estimate from multiple brokers is $2.38.Source: TD WebBrokerAt the time this article is being composed, PAYX is trading at $64.57. If I use the mid-point of PAYXâs FY2018 forecast ($2.365), PAYX is trading at a forward P/E of ~27.3. This level is too high for my liking.I provide the following historical valuation levels for comparison purposes.Source: MorningstarI originally acquired PAYX in July 2009 at ~$25. Not only was the P/E level at that time much lower than the current level but the FX rate was CDN$1.1705 to USD$1. As I compose this article, the FX rate is ~CDN1.2688 to USD$1.Despite the rate issue described above and the 15% withholding tax hit on dividends received from US companies, I would still consider reacquiring PAYX. My reasoning is that it is a well run business, I like the strong balance sheet, and I see growth potential.I am, however, very reluctant to acquire PAYX shares at the current price and am prepared to exercise patience if I want to acquire shares at ~22 times the mid-point of PAYXâs FY2018 forecast ($2.365).At ~$52/share that would be roughly a $12/share reduction from current levels. This is not totally unrealistic as PAYX retraced to ~$54 in the first half of August 2017. Unfortunately, much was happening at my end during that period of time so I missed my opportunity.I keep hoping for a major market correction. I donât know when it will happen but when it does I hope to go shopping.I wish you much success on your journey to financial freedom.Thanks for reading!Note: I appreciate the time you took to read this article and hope you got something out of it.

4182393,101450,2018-06-18T14:31:25-04:00,"Since 2016, Paychex has reported 6 out of 9 fiscal quarters with total revenue growth of 6 percent or more.Macroeconomic forces like fiscal stimulus from tax reform and higher demand from labor market strength has played a key role in keeping revenue growth rates high.High cash flow generation has allowed Paychex to return large amounts of cash to investors through a large dividend increase and extensive share buybacks.","On June 27th, 2018, Paychex (PAYX) will report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings. Since the beginning of May, shares of the staffing company have only seen 9 negative days staging an intense rebound from near-term lows of $60. Currently, PAYX is testing a resistance level of $70 well above its analyst suggested price of $63.40. In January, prices broke out to $73 on an intra-day trend that fell back to flat on the day. A good earnings report could inspire a similar frenzy as PAYX bullish momentum continues.From FinvizPAYXâs last earnings report marked the end of a drop from drop of more than 10 percent. Prices bottomed out at $60 and trended higher after PAYX reported in-line EPS of $0.63 and revenue of $866.5 million, 8.9 percent higher than a year ago and $12 million more than estimates. The earnings report was not unusual, PAYX has consistently posted high single-digit growth in revenue and in-line or slight beats on EPS since 2014.From WSJUnderstandably, PAYXâs performance and outlook is often tied to trends in the labor market, and lately, jobs reports have been one of the strong pillars of the current economy. The latest Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs report in May said that 223,000 were added and pushed the unemployment down to 3.8 percent. In addition to the job gains, average hourly earnings increased by $0.08 in May which is 2.7 percent higher than a year ago. Overall, PAYX management sees âa healthy small business sectorâ while warning that âthe labor market shows signs of tighteningâ according to statements from the last conference call.PAYX has had the benefit of rising employment due to a loose monetary environment since 2010, but that is about to change. Last week, the Federal Reserve confirmed its hawkish position by increasing the Federal Funds rate by 25 basis points and indicating that there will be several more rate hikes this year. This tightening should clash with the fiscal expansion from the tax act passed in late 2017 and could create a more uncertain labor market in the latter half of 2018.The strength in the labor market showed in the third quarter results. Total revenues grew by just over 9 percent to $866 million with about 3 percent due to acquisitions. Total expenses, though, grew by 17 percent. Management claims that 7 percent of that growth was caused by an exit from certain license agreements, an unusual expense, and 5 percent was caused by a new acquisition. By segments, the payroll service increased by 2 percent to $455 million and human resource services revenues grew 17 percent to $393.3 million.PAYX got a lot of support from its latest acquisition of HR Outsourcing Holdings (HROI) which was purchased for $75.4 million in August 2017. The addition of HROI boosted total revenue by 3 percent mostly in the small- and medium-sized business operations. In the fourth quarter, PAYX should see another boost in revenue after its completion of the Lessor acquisition. Lessor is about twice the size of HROI and will help PAYX advance its operations in Europe (Lessor is based in Denmark).On the whole, macroeconomic factors have looked favorably on PAYX and its aggressive moves. A strong labor market that has lead to record low unemployment numbers. The new tax legislation has not only allowed businesses to expand investment and wage size but also provided PAYX with a tax discount of more than $70 million. PAYXâs cash positions have actually increased by 75.5 percent despite the purchase of Lessor in the first quarter.From Q3 presentation slidesPAYXâs outlook continues to be optimistic, and they have no reason to think otherwise. Given status quo, the addition of Lessor will provide more prospects for growth. However, status quo will change and interest rates will increase quickly, and businesses that have borrowed heavily will be punished by variable rate debt. This will inevitably reduce the amount of money available for expansion into HR products. This labor market tightening could start as early as PAYXâs fiscal second quarter or the fourth quarter of 2018. These risks should not be ignored as an investor.PAYX has been a reliable cash generator in 2018, In the first nine months of the companyâs fiscal year, PAYX generated $988.9 million, 28.5 percent more than the same period in its last fiscal year. The high level of cash generation allows it to finance dividends of $538.7 million and share buybacks worth $94.1 million (both in the first 9 months of 2018).Thatâs the story. As long as PAYX has the cash generated from operations to support luxuries like share buybacks, high dividends, and acquisitions, it can sustain the growth in its bottom line and its share price. Macroeconomic trends currently favor growth for the mid-cap company, but the status quo is not guaranteed as the Federal Reserve should continue to raise rates and the stimulus from the tax legislation should wear off. Shares of PAYX will most likely move on guidance and would probably go higher on management optimism. Look for that sentiment to push the breakout either above or below the $70 resistance level."
4163359,102170,2018-04-16T23:32:57-04:00,"The stock has declined nearly 20% from its 52-week high despite good results providing an investment opportunity.The company is supported by a strong balance sheet and plenty of excess cash flow, with an 81% payout ratio.Paychex is still in growth mode supported by strong demand in its HRS segment, recent acquisitions, cross-selling opportunities and the general health of the U.S. economy.","Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) engages in the provision of payroll, human resource, insurance, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. The company had 605,000 payroll clients at full-year end 2017 and serves its customers in two broad segments: Payroll Services and Human Resources Services. A third source of revenue is interest held on funds for clients. This is somewhat akin to float in the insurance world. The company earns interest on cash when an employer deposits money with Paychex to be disbursed for payroll at a later date. For the time between the deposit and payout in payroll, Paychex earns interest.Revenue and EBITDA growth have been solid over the last three years and is due to a mix of supporting customers through the Affordable Care Act and providing outsourced HR services (through its SaaS platform), insurance services, retirement administration, as well as insurance and 401(k) plans for its small and mid-sized customers. PAYX has leveraged its payroll processing customers to grow the HRS segment. Not only has this segment experienced strong growth, but there is demand for these services, and the margins are stronger than those in the legacy payroll service segment.Growth in the HRS segment continues to perform exceptionally well for the first nine months ended 2/28/18, as there is an increase in the client bases and strong growth in the number of client worksite employees served. EBITDA margins should continue to expand as HRS becomes a greater part of total revenues. 45% EBITDA margin should be an easily attainable margin, and the expectation is for it to continue to expand as operational issues are resolved.One of the main issues was transferring experienced customer service reps to handle another customer segment, leaving many newly trained reps to handle the majority of HR services. This is one of the reasons why the retention rate was 81% at FYE17, down from the record high of 82% at FYE16. Management believes that this issue has been corrected and customer satisfaction and retention should improve, leading to better margins, as it is less expensive to keep clients than to replace them.And there is still room to continue this growth. The HRS segment has been an investment focus for the company. The products and services provide HR flexibility for their customers, and the new technology is convenient and easy to use. There are 500 HR specialists to service over 1 million worksite employees. Additionally, the acquisition of HROI has bolstered revenue growth (it accounted for 2% of YTD 2/28/18 HRS revenue). PAYX is operating in a favorable environment, as outlined in the 4Q17 conference call:Now that PAYX has made HR outsourcing easier to use and access, the change in regulations and laws should provide a growth opportunity to expand this segment.The stock has dropped around 20% from its recent highs. There are several reasons why, ranging from macro-economic to a shift in valuation expectations.PAYX data by YChartsLet's say in late January, early February PAYX and the S&P 500 price action have become almost mirror images. The general market downturn due to Russia meddling, North Korea, and tariff talks with China has found a way to negatively impact PAYX. Bruce Berkowitz of Fairholme Capital Management said, ""When times get very tough, everything is correlated."" These factors might not directly impact PAYX, but it appears the general market correction has pushed the reset button on its valuation. So far, 2018 does not have that smooth sailing environment experienced in 2017 (those were the days).PAYX and Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) have experienced similar fates over the last six months. But boy, Total System Services (NYSE:TSS) has really taken off since December 2017. It had solid operating performance in FY17, and has been rewarded for that growth; however, it has come in since the recent highs in March.PAYX data by YChartsEven with the strong stock performance for TSS, it appears that the stock price was just catching up to its peer group. EPS growth for TSS was supported by $136 million in tax cut benefits. Net Revenue growth is guided to be 7-10% for FY18, and diluted shares are expected to contract -10% to -7%.ADP's 2018 outlook appears favorable for stock price appreciation with good revenue growth, with some margin compression supported by an anticipated reduction in tax rates.Throughout the year, PAYX has been updating its 2018 outlook and should hit those targets.After analyzing the outlook for PAYX and its competitors, the valuation appears in line with that of its competitors, albeit at a lower level than early in the year. The question is, what can drive the valuation higher for PAYX? Taking a macroeconomic view, general improvement in market conditions and general sentiment should lend support to multiple expansion. PAYX would benefit from continued growth in the economy, and the next earnings season could provide further insight. The company has experienced growth in its HRS segment, and as it becomes larger, margins and cash flow should improve, thus it is deserving of a higher multiple.PAYX was a trusted partner in regard to the implementation of the ACA regulation, and the company was rewarded with strong financial performance. I think the next event that could help PAYX service its customers is the lowering of corporate tax rates. It could benefit from customers engaging PAYX for payroll and HR services to navigate the new tax implications, and the lowering of tax rates could positively impact new hirings, thus growing the need for HR services. I am interested to see the impact that the new corporate tax rates have on the PAYX business model, and answers should come in the next conference call.At FYE17, the company had $5 billion in funds held for its clients at an average interest rate of 1%. If that amount stayed static and interest earned increased by 25bps, it would represent a $0.03 increase in earnings per share. That may not seem like much, but the 25bps increase will increase EPS by 2%. A 50bps increase in interest rate will increase EPS by $0.07. The Fed is likely to increase rates a few more times in 2018, and PAYX will benefit from it.Some notable risks include continued disappointment in customer service, leading to a decline in the retention rate. This is entirely possible, as PAYX has struggled with this recently. Management pointed out that this has been a focus, and the company is over the hump as far as kinks in the training of customer service reps go. The new customer service model should benefit its clients, hopefully leading to improved retention and satisfaction. There is always the chance that interest rates do not rise, or rise at a slower pace than is telegraphed by the Fed, and that the interest earned on funds held for clients remains static. Jerome Powell is new to the Fed chair, but he is not unknown and seems to be in line with Janet Yellen, which should provide some comfort and sense of stability. It appears that PAYX and its competitors have been re-valued at a lower level compared to 2017 and early 2018. I think this will be temporary in nature for the company given the favorable environment and growth levers still being quite strong.With revenue growth rates based on recent trends and management guidance, as well as stable margins, the DCF model generated a stock price of $68, or ~11% upside. With a 100bps improvement in GPM and OPM, the target price is $70, which is a ~16% appreciation.PAYX has been managed well and has been highly profitable. Management has been pulling the right levers to improve operational performance by continuing to innovate and make outsourced HR services easier for customers. Potential growth catalysts included changes in the tax code that can lead to growth in new hirings and businesses to seek services from PAYX; given constant change in regulations will lead businesses to outsource their HR services, and increases in interest rates will increase the interest on funds held for clients. As the HRS segment becomes a larger portion of total revenue, there is an opportunity for margins to improve. With the aforementioned growth catalysts, coupled with a favorable dividend payout and continuous share repurchases, a pullback from the recent highs may present a good buying opportunity."
4100378,23757,2017-08-18T18:05:18-04:00,"Paychex will continue to benefit from improving job market and rising rates.Prime age employment gains still have plenty of room to run.Despite relatively well known thesis, Paychex still looks undervalued.","We recently made Paychex (PAYX) the newest holding in our dividend portfolio. We think that the company will continue to benefit from a growing job market and slow but steadily rising interest rates. Even though this isnât a groundbreaking investment thesis, we think itâs still not been fully priced into the stock as weâll show in the valuation section at the end of the article.At first blush, it may seem odd to be buying a stock that benefits from rising payrolls when we are nine years into an economic recovery. After all, one would think we are closer to the end of the economic cycle than to the beginning. However, when it comes to jobs, we believe there is more slack in the economy than many people think. The chart below, taken from the Federal Reserve, shows the prime age (25-54) employment to population ratio.We chose to look at the 25-54 prime age cohort rather than the overall employment to population ratio to avoid the effects of an aging population skewing the data.While employment has recovered from the recession, it is still only about a third to a half of the way back to its pre-recession high. Compared to the all-time high at the height of the tech boom in 1999-2000, we are only a little more than a quarter of the way to full employment.Absent a reflation of the consumer debt bubble or a catastrophic outside event, there is no reason to believe we are not in the midst of a long-term secular employment growth period. Yes, there may be some short, shallow business cycle led recessions along the way that add an element of cyclicality to the employment growth trends. However, we think the future will resemble the post 1982 recession which saw the employment ratio rise from 57% to almost 65% 18 years later at the height of the tech boom. Because of this huge secular employment growth runway, we think Paychex will make an excellent long-term holding.Paychex's second source of revenue is from interest earned on funds held for clients. This refers to money collected by Paychex from employers and not yet remitted to employees or the applicable tax authorities. Interest on funds held for clients accounts for only about 1.6% of the companyâs revenue.However, this revenue carries profit margins close to, if not, 100%. Not only that but any increase in interest rates carries margins of 100%. Paychex needs to literally do nothing to earn millions of dollars more in profits as interest rates rise.Indeed, we can see how rising interest rates have increased the amount Paychex has earned even though the amount of funds held for clients has remained mostly flat.As rates continue their slow rise, Paychex will benefit from increasing revenue that carries a 100% profit margin.While the two long-term growth drivers, increasing employment and higher rates, are well known, we donât think itâs being fully priced into the companyâs stock.The graphic below shows the previous five years' average annual growth rate for net income.(Source: Paychex Investor Presentation)As long as we have similar same job gains growth and slowly rising interest rates, there is no reason to think that Paychex wonât be able to continue to grow net income and thus free cash flow at similar rates. If we build a discounted cash flow model of Paychex using a 10% discount rate, 3% long-term growth rate, trailing 12-month free cash flow of $979M and net corporate cash and investments of $776M, and a short-term 10-year growth rate of 8.3%, we get a fair value of approximately $60 per share.While it shows that Paychex isnât wildly undervalued, it still seems like a good investment. The company has a long growth runway in front of it as the job market still has plenty of room for growth before true full employment is released. Also, if Bill Ackmanâs take on ADP is correct, Paychex has little to worry about for the foreseeable future when it comes to competition. We think Paychex makes a solid investment, and thatâs why weâve chosen to add it to our dividend portfolio."
4088785,102327,2017-07-19T14:41:14-04:00,PAYX has a growing market in employee services solutions.Revenue and profit growth support a growing dividend.At the current market price PAYX sells for a lot less than the NPV of its dividend payments.,"When I am first looking at a company to decide if it will make a good investment for me as a dividend growth investor, I have a list of characteristics I want the company to have. I want a well-supported and growing dividend, and in order for a company to have the ability to do that over the long term, it needs to have growing markets and revenues, growing profits and well-managed debt. Also having a history of regular increases to the dividend tends to indicate a culture at the company that will continue that practice. I like to have the company tell me it has these characteristics (although I will look elsewhere if I have to do so), so first I go to the companyâs website and annual reportOne source I have for new companies to look at is comments on my articles, which is how I found Paychex (PAYX). Paychex describes itself as provider of integrated human capital management solutions. That means they provide solutions for human resources, payroll and benefit management. I like that they have focused on provided mobile and cloud based solutions. So, I first went and looked at the latest annual report on the company website.Right on the second page of the report I find a slide that actually address each of the four characteristics I want in a good investment partner. At the bottom on the right, we see revenues since 2012. $800 million in additional revenue over a five-year period on a base of just $2.2 billion is pretty solid. As pointed out that is a 7% CAGR. The increase in operating income was also pretty solid. In fact I very much like it that the percentage of operating income to revenue increased from about 28% in 2012 to 37% in 2016.Next looking at how PAYX manages debt, I see that it has none. Ordinarily I would think not having any long-term debt might not be the best practice, but given how revenue and profit are increasing I would have to say that I am wrong. Also, although I often donât look at this metric, I see that ROE is pretty good at 40%. Its sounds to me like the management team is doing a pretty good job of growing the company without taking on debt, so I wonât second guess them.Next I see that the payout ratio is 80%. For most companies I would think that is a bit high. But again, the company is growing at a good clip, so I see no reason to second guess the management on this either.Looking through the rest of the annual report, I see they added three new modules to the Paychex Flex platform. Also added was support for new regulations. PAYX also is focusing on supporting companies that provide temporary staffing solutions. PAYX thinks that trends in regulations and business conditions will result in a lot of growth for those businesses. From reading what PAYX had done and what it plans to do, it looks to me like they are investing in the technology and services that their customers are likely to need in the future. And given past history, it looks like management will be able to take advantage of these new opportunities profitably.Looking for a little more history, I have this display of revenue, EPS, and dividends from YChartsÂ®. I see a small slump in revenue and EPS during the Great Recession, but that is to be expected. The quarterly EPS numbers bound around a bit, but are on a general uptrend.Looking at the TTM EPS, other than a slump during 2009, there is a very nice uptrend in the EPS. Based on these data, I see enough to convince me that PAYX has increasing markets and revenue, increasing profits, is managing its debt well, and has a history of raising the dividend every year.On July 13, PAYX announced it was increasing the quarter dividend to $0.50, a 9.1% increase. I will use this latest data in calculating a buy price with DDM below.On June 28, PAYX announced its Q4 earnings results. The EPS was $0.54, which beat expectations by a penny and was 5 cents higher than a year ago. Revenue came in at $798.6 million which beat expectations by just under a million dollars and was 5.9% higher than a year ago. Based on the presentation given, the Paychex Flex platform has had two new modules added and many feature upgrades during the 2017 fiscal year.The slide above indicates that profits, either by net income or EPS, have increased by 8.3%, which is faster than the 7% increase in total revenues.So, it looks to me like 2017 and especially its Q4 were pretty good for PAYX. The performance in this quarter doesnât change my assessment of the company.To figure out a good price, I do a DDM calculation using my Excel- based DDM calculator (pictured below, you can see the web-based calculator I based it on here and read a discussion on how the formulas were developed here). Looking at David Fishâs CCC List (which contains data on companies that have raised their dividend each year for five or more years) I see six years of annual dividend increases.I will use the currently declared dividend of $2 in my calculation. Even though PAYX is growing earnings by more than 8% and the latest dividend increase was just over 9%, I will use the rate that revenues have been expanding, 7%, as a conservative estimate for the dividend growth rate. With a yield below 4%, I will use 3% as my terminal dividend growth rate value.Using these parameters I calculate that the NPV of the predicted future dividend payments will be $72.49. That sets my buy price at anything below $73. Since PAYX is trading at around $56, I want to look at another valuation metric.Looking at its four-year average yield, I see that this is 3.17%. With the current yield at 3.52%, that looks to me like PAYX is undervalued. Using the current dividend and the average yield gives me a price of $63.10. Averaging the two dividend valuation methods together gives me $67.79, which I will round up for a buy price of anything below $68. That makes PAYX a buy at the current market price.With my buy price so much higher than the market price, I donât expect to find any calls with a reasonable strike price and premium worth writing.Given where the stock is currently trading, itâs a good price to just buy outright. However, the August expiration date does offer a reasonable put to write.Using a limit order, an investor should be able to write a put and get a premium of $1.70 using the $57.50 strike price. With a Delta of -0.54 it's worth the price and wait to see if it will give you the shares.PAYX is in a growing market of employee services to small- and mid-sized companies. It has been growing its revenues and profits at an attractive rate that also allows for a nicely growing dividend. At current market prices it is selling for a lot less than the NPV of its future dividends, offering a very good opportunity for a dividend growth investors.Note: I hope you all got something out of this article.

Although Paychex filed an 8-K, it didnât provide any additional details and didnât adjust financial guidance. Therefore, I presume the deal was for a non-material amount.Paychex received its IRS PEO certification To provide peo services under the Small Business Efficiency Act [SBEA].The SBEA provides for strict auditing and reporting standards and specifies who will assume liability for federal taxes.Paychex is bolstering its PEO business ambitions with the deal for HROI. Although it âcurrently serves more than âone-million worksite employees across its suite of HR outsourcing solutions,â Paychex appears to be pushing forward with a strategy to ramp up its PEO business.As Paychex CEO Martin Mucci stated in the deal announcement,Focused on the SMB market as Paychex is, it needs a significant footprint to be able to market truly nationwide service capabilities, and HROI provides additional visibility and market presence.The global market for HR outsourcing is forecasted to grow significantly, according to a report by Technavio, which stated a 12.74% CAGR for the period 2016 - 2020.The report further cites the main driver of this growth as the increased need for cost reduction by firms of all sizes.By acquiring scale with deals such as for HROI, companies such as Paychex can also spread the cost of providing the latest technology solutions over a much larger customer base, further cementing its position in the markets in which it operates.HROI provides its human resource solutions primarily to small- and medium-sized businesses in over 35 states. The company has approximately 140 employees who will come over to Paychex as part of the acquisition.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

4093837,30101,2017-08-02T15:20:02-04:00,Paychex shares surged July 27 but have since retreated lower.Missed the opportunity to sell covered call when the price spiked.Shares appeared to rally after reports that an activist built a position in a competitor ADP.New Idea for income.,"The tough part of investing and portfolio management is knowing when to hold them and when to let them go. Below is a discussion on a missed opportunity in Paychex (PAYX) and the rationale for not being upset at missing it.Paychex shares were suggested as an attractive dividend yielding shares on July 7 on Seeking Alpha with the shares at $56.97 and it was one of the two dividend stocks suggested at Stout Opportunities to look at on July 6 with the shares at $57.07. With the new $0.50 per quarterly dividend, the shares would now yield roughly 3.5%. The shares are currently trading at $56.48 and went ex-dividend for $0.50 on July 28. The missed opportunity was on July 27 when the share spiked to over $61 - see chart:PAYX Price data by YChartsNo news was seen when the share price surged, and the call option premiums did not appear to offer much in the way of time premium. In hindsight, this could be viewed as a missed opportunity for those inclined towards a more active trading style. Later, it was discovered there was a report about an activist potentially building a position in a competitor ADP (NASDAQ:ADP).There was a missed opportunity to sell a $60 strike call option when the share surged above $61.00 on July 27. As a general rule when there is a share price surge it is seen as an opportunity to sell a call option for the time premium, but in this case the spread and volatility made the time premium appear unattractive. This was a judgment call that turned out to be wrong.The risk of selling a covered call with little time premium is the potential of having the shares called away early. For traders, this could be a welcome development. However, for dividend income investors this could be a risk, as the income stream could then be lost and necessitate finding a suitable replacement.Paychex was suggested as an income generating stock, and a recommendation to sell the shares would require finding another stock to replace the income. Given the minimal time premium seen, it was not viewed as attractive. In hindsight, knowing that the shares would decline back under $57, we see it was an opportunity missed.The price swing in the shares now presents an opportunity to sell a put option to add to a position or generate additional income.The September 55.00 strike put is bid at $0.70 that would return 1.27% on the strike price or 10.41% annualized. Should the shares be assigned then,the effective purchase price would be $54.30 or 3.94% lower. This is viewed as an attractive opportunity.Disclosure:Return calculations exclude transaction costs, as each trader may experience different costs; however, transaction costs will reduced the realized return. Positions mentioned are of the time of publication and may change without notice for a variety of reasons.

4111409,23452,2017-10-03T13:49:52-04:00,Strong earnings report from Paychex.Pure Trump tax play as it currently pays 35% corporate tax.Pays out a strong 3.35% dividend.Very conservative investment for the long haul.,"Paychex (PAYX) reported its earnings and this is how it did according to the Associated Press:ROCHESTER, N.Y. - Paychex Inc. on Tuesday reported fiscal first-quarter earnings of $227.8 million.The Rochester, New York-based company said it had net income of 63 cents per share. Earnings, adjusted for pretax gains, came to 62 cents per share.The results topped Wall Street expectations. The average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for earnings of 60 cents per share.The payroll processor and human-resources services provider posted revenue of $816.8 million in the period, also beating Street forecasts. Fourteen analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $815.9 million.Though it is not a bargain, I was able to add Paychex to my clients' portfolios a while back as the company has a lot going for it. Before I explain further here are the Friedrich Chart and Datafile for the company.Though the company usually experiences short-term volatility after it reports, its long-term track record is very conservative as the chart above shows. Our Friedrich Algorithm (which performs some 2,600 calculations in order to generate what we call our Main Street price, analyzing the entire balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement for each of the 17,000 stocks our service analyzes from 36 countries) shows Paychex to be attractively priced right now and the reason I consider Paychex a conservative stock is because it trades around its Main Street price very consistently. Very few companies that we track do that (yellow is the Main Street price and white is the Wall Street Price) as you can see from the chart above. You also will notice that the stock has never been a bargain (green line) or a sell (red Line) in the 10 years of analysis in our chart. Our Main Street price is similar to what an appraiser on Main Street would appraise a business at except our Friedrich Algorithm is designed to do that for companies that trade on Wall Street and another 35 stock markets throughout the world that we track. Why is the stock so rock solid? Well, the simple answer is consistency of results. One of our most powerful ratios is called FROIC and it is defined as:FROIC means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital"" and below is how it is calculated.Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) - (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ (Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)What the FROIC ratio does is tell us how much forward free cash flow the company is generating on Main Street relative to how much total capital it has employed. So, if a company invests $100 in total capital on Main Street and generates $20 in forward free cash flow, it therefore has a FROIC of 20%, which we consider excellent. This is just one of the key ratios (69 in total) that we use to identify how a company is performing on Main Street, as it is our belief that if a company is making a killing on Main Street, that this news will eventually show up on Wall Street's radar.Here are Paychex FROIC results 2009-TTM (trailing twelve months).We consider a result of 20% to be excellent, so Paychex FROIC results speak for themselves. In 2017 the company returned 51 cents for every $1 in invested capital and that is with a 35% tax rate. Imagine what will happen to its results if President Trump can lower its tax rate to 20%. That's right ""To the Moon Alice!"" While we are waiting for the Trump Tax plan to go through, as investors we are getting paid a 3.35% dividend. Paychex pays out 81% of its earnings in dividends and though for other companies I would consider that high, for Paychex since its capital expenditures are so low, I am not worried at all. Going forward, with Paychex we thus have a seriously conservative stock that is very consistent and is trading near its Friedrich Main Street price. It just produced an earnings report, where forward guidance also was good. It is paying its investors well while they wait to see if the Trump Tax plan goes through. If it does then the tax rate for Paychex will go from 35% to 20% overnight and everyone will be smiling all the way to the bank. So for you retirees and conservative dividend investors, Paychex could end up being a golden goose for you. In conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add the FROIC ratio to your own investor tool box in order to help you in your own due diligence.

4086357,30101,2017-07-07T15:03:40-04:00,Paychex has a long history of increasing the dividend.The balance sheet is strong with very little debt.The 3.22% dividend yield is attractive compared to the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield of 2.37%.,"Paychex (PAYX) is worth a look based upon the attractive dividend yield of 3.22% and its history of increasing the dividend. It has a strong balance sheet with little debt. Management gets high marks for its capital allocation and return on assets.Management has shown a preference for returning cash to owners via the payment of a quarterly dividend compared to providing owners cash to those selling shares via share repurchases.Paychex describes itself in an SEC filing as ""a leading provider of integrated human capital management solutions for payroll, human resources, retirement, and insurance services for small to medium sized businesses in the United States."" Its website describes the product offerings along with investor information.The current quarterly dividend is $0.46 for a dividend yield of 3.22%. Long-term investors seeking income may find Paychex's current dividend yield attractive, and for its history of increasing the dividend, this increases the investor's yield on cost. In addition, an increased dividend is a sign of management confidence in future earnings growth. The chart below illustrates the strong record of dividend increases.PAYX Dividend Per Share (Quarterly) data by YChartsRecently, the share price has been under pressure, closing at $56.97. The decline in the share price is seen as a buying opportunity for dividend-minded investors. Year-to-date the stock has vastly underperformed the S&P 500 index, as seen in the chart below. The weakness in the share price might be a reflection of the Federal Reserve interest rate hikes. However, a growing economy should help Paychex if the small and medium-sized businesses can grow and prosper.PAYX data by YChartsThe source data for the images below came from SEC filings. Some key income statement metrics are below.The change in year-over-year earnings-per-share growth has picked up the past three quarters. And net income as a percentage of revenues has been in the range of 23.6% to 28.9% during the past seven quarters.The balance sheet is shown below.There is little debt on the balance sheet. Short-term borrowings were $55.4 million compared to $189.9 million in cash and cash equivalents during the last quarter. This is a strong balance sheet.Key ratios:The management of Paychex has done an outstanding job with attractive return on assets and dividend payout ratio.RiskPaychex has an attractive dividend yield compared to the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield. However, recently the 10-Year Yield has started to move higher, currently at 2.37%. This could make the current dividend yield less attractive and pressure the shares. If the 10-Year Yield is moving higher as a result of economic growth, then long-term investors could be well rewarded for holding the shares and adding shares on any additional weakness. A growing economy would be expected to help increase earnings and dividends.It is possible that investor sentiment shifts and the price-earning multiple contracts. That could pressure the share price. However, the reason for the Paychex idea is dividend-based, not share appreciation-based.PAYX PE Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThe share price has had some wild swings, so investors must be comfortable with the business prospects and the stream of dividend payments.PAYX data by YChartsThe chart below shows the spread between Paychex dividend yield versus the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield. The yield pickup from the shares is currently 87 basis points. It should be noted that a 10-Year Note will have a fixed payment while the dividend of Paychex could increase or decrease.Fundamental Chart data by YChartsBottom linePaychex is owned for its attractive dividend yield at 3.22% that exceeds the 10-Year U.S Treasury Yield of 2.37%. With a history of increasing the dividend, long-term investors might enjoy greater income with each passing year. Options are available on Paychex that investors can explore to generate additional income via the sale of a put option to purchase additional shares at a discount or earn the premium, or covered calls can be sold for income and possible capital appreciation.If dividend income is the goal, then Paychex is worth considering. If capital invested in the shares might be needed in the near future, then it might not be worth the risk.Additional research can be performed by reviewing the Paychex website and their SEC filings."
4041857,23452,2017-02-02T05:27:14-05:00,A comparative quantitative analysis using a unique free cash flow ratio.Explains why both companies can be considered âTrump Playsâ.Shows why both companies are ideal conservative investments for the long-term investor.,"On February 1, 2017, Seeking Alpha's News Editor Niloofer Shaikh reported the following: Automatic Data Processing Beats By $0.06, Misses On Revenue.I am an investor in Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) and Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) as I believe both to be pure Trump plays. Both companies operate similar and unique business models that tend to do very well in inflationary environments, which I believe will soon be upon us. I say this because there should soon be a great demand for the products that will be used in the infrastructure build out that President Trump is planning. Oil pipelines, the Mexican Wall and bridge renovations, among other things, will spur demand for the underlying raw materials that President Trump will probably also insist should come from the US.If the products needed are indeed made in the US, then higher labor costs and limited raw materials will be the norm. This will cause inflation, as it will eliminate cheaper foreign imports from the equation. Interest rates tend to rise substantially in such an environment, as the Federal Reserve does not like it when inflation passes 2% and raises interest rates in order to combat it.Both ADP and Paychex have unique business models that would shine in such a scenario, as one of the most margin-friendly parts of the payroll business are the ""future tax escrow accounts"" that each manages for its clients. Each collects the future tax payments from its clients and then generates interest revenue from the escrow in those accounts, until the taxes need to be paid to the various tax authorities. As interest rates rise, both companies generate more revenue from those escrow accounts. Here is ADP's Escrow information and forecast going forward:Client Funds Extended Investment Strategy Fiscal 2017 ForecastIt may seem like the interest rate revenue being generated from these accounts is small right now, but as interest rates rise, the interest revenue can grow substantially.Earnings AnalysisADP actually had good results for this past quarter as the PowerPoint slide below shows.But what caused the selloff in the company's shares was the 2017 guidance that management gave. Management surprised everyone when it forecast ""Worldwide New Business Bookings"" to be flat versus previous estimates of ""4% to 6%.""That was a real shocker, as it is very rare for ADP to hand out such guidance. During the conference call, management explained that this happened because potential clients put on hold any plans to make any moves until each could see what President Trump's plans were and whether he could implement them or not. So it's ironic that we have a pure Trump play that needed to adjust forward guidance because its customers are concerned about President Trump's plans. It sure proves that uncertainty is abounding, and since Wall Street hates two things more than anything else:1) Uncertainty2) SurprisesWe may just get both in droves going forward with a Trump Administration.Having said that let us now analyze both companies so we can demonstrate why I believe both can be considered very solid conservative investments for the long-term investor.In this article, I will present a real-time quantitative analysis of both companies employing a unique ratio that will demonstrate the power of free cash flow in the investment process and then give an opinion on how an investor should act based on my results.When analyzing almost any company, concentrate on its free cash flow generation, as that is where the rubber hits the road when it comes to finding out the truth. Before I show you the long-term Datafile for ADP. Let us first do a TTM (trailing-twelve month) analysis of its Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow and then compare it to its current price.Here are the two ratios that we will be using in our analysis, and for those new to this type of analysis, one can get a good introduction by reading my analysis of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by clicking here.Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - [((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)]ADPMarket Price Per Share = $95.00Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $30,124,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $26,719,300,000Working Capital = $3,404,900,000Long-Term Debt = $2,007,700,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 455,300,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $95.00 - (($3,404,900,000 - $2,007,700,000)/ 455,300,000)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $95.00 - $3.07 = $91.93Since ADP has less Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we therefore must reward it and use the $91.93 result as the new numerator in all our calculations.Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $91.93Net Income per diluted share = $1,524,600,000/455,300,000 = $3.35Depreciation per diluted share = $390,600,000/455,300,000 = $0.86Capital Spending per diluted share = $-161,600,000/455,300,000 = $-0.35$3.35 + $0.86 + ($-0.35) = $3.86Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $91.93/$3.86 = 23.82Now if you go to my Friedrich Legend (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 23.82 is an average result.We last ran our Datafile for ADP on February 1, 2017, and our Friedrich Algorithm gave a recommendation to our subscribers to hold it.Here is the chart of our Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio results for ADP:The Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Ratio considers a stock a bargain when it trades under 15 times and overbought when it trades over 30 times. Therefore, from the current results in the chart above, ADP comes in as a ""HOLD.""Let us now compare those results to its main competitor Paychex.Here is our Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Analysis for Paychex.PaychexMarket Price Per Share = $58.52Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $4,215,700,000Total Current Liabilities = $3,784,100,000Working Capital = $431,600,000Long-Term Debt = $0Diluted Shares Outstanding = 362,600,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $58.52 - (($431,600,000- $0)/ 362,600,000)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $58.52 - ($1.19) = $57.33Since Paychex has less Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we therefore must reward it and use the $57.33 result as the new numerator in all our calculations.Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $57.33Net Income per diluted share = $778,000,000/362,600,000 = $2.15Depreciation per diluted share = $194,400,000/362,600,000 = $0.54Capital Spending per diluted share = $-96,000,000/362,600,000 = $-0.26$2.15 + $0.54 + ($-0.26) = $2.43Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $57.33/$2.43 =23.5923.59 is considered an average result for this ratio by our Friedrich Investing System and also comes in as a ""HOLD.""Going forward, it is very rare for a company like ADP to give such strange guidance, as it along with Paychex are run as very conservative operations. Both companies' Price to Bernhard Free Cash Flow charts as well as each corresponding Friedrich Datafile and chart show a pattern of consistency that is very rare these days in our opinion.I am not worried at all about ADP's lowered guidance, as I am quite confident that we will see higher interest rates soon, and once that happens, both ADP and Paychex should do very well. Both are ""Holds"" for now but if someone is looking for a safe way to play the Trump agenda, then these two companies should surely be included in your watchlists.In conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor toolbox in order to help you in your own due diligence.

4060476,45851,2017-04-05T13:15:50-04:00,Paychex exceeded Wall Streetâs earnings expectations for its fiscal third quarter - but its stock has fallen by 4% in the year-to-date thanks to revenues falling short.We believe that this is a short-term blip: the company itself anticipates a return to form for its fiscal fourth quarter.Paychexâs revenues are well-situated in the growing HR Services vertical.Paychex should trade closer to other technology companies rather than services firms and argue that it should be trading at a slight premium to its current Price-Sales ratio.,"AnalysisPaychex Beats on Earnings, Lags on RevenuePaychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) recently reported (non-GAAP) fiscal Q3-2017 earnings of $0.55 per share, surpassing Wall Street estimates by a penny. Paychex has now beaten estimates in two of the last three quarters, driven by 7% overall revenue growth in the last nine months. Moreover, Paychex managed to do so while keeping the attendant costs under control, leading to a 10% margin increase.Even so, Paychex failed to meet Wall Street's revenue expectations - indeed, Paychex's 6% revenue growth pace in its fiscal third quarter was slower than its 8% growth pace in the first two quarters of fiscal 2017.Recent Stock Performance and DividendPaychex was having a fairly uneventful 2017 until it reported its fiscal Q3 numbers in late March, with the stock basically trading sideways for most of the first quarter. Its failure to surpass Wall Street's revenue numbers seemed to spook investors and the stock has now dropped by around 4% for the year. This significantly underperforms the 5.4% return of the S&P 500 during this span.Naturally, the silver lining is that a lower stock price has improved Paychex's dividend yield to approximately 3.1%, which is far better than the yield of the S&P 500. It's also around 110-basis points better than the average yield of its peer group.Revenues Still on TrackBy far, Paychex's growth driver has been its Human Resource Services revenue. This segment grew by 12% for Paychex during the period and account for 81% of its overall revenue growth for its fiscal third quarter and nearly three-fourths of its growth in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.That this segment is growing quickly should come as no surprise to astute market observers. More nimble startups like the payroll ""unicorns"" Zenefits and Gusto have been adding HR services to their platforms as well in recent years. It's not surprising: firms are always looking to deleverage their costs and one easy way is to eschew headcount in company Talent teams in favor of cheaper SaaS solutions. In our view, the uncertain business environment brought on by the conflicting economic policies introduced by the Trump administration will only heighten firms' use of outsourced software services.In any case, investors who pared down their positions in Paychex due to its less-than-stellar third quarter may come to regret it: PayChex's guidance anticipates a return to 7% to 8% overall growth for fiscal 2017, implying a catch-up in its fiscal fourth quarter along the 8% to 9% range. What's more, Paychex continues to anticipate 12% to 14% - meaning it foresees no slowdown in this area.One thing that investors should note about Paychex is that it's a bet on rising wages (Paychex earns interest on clients' funds) and improving employment conditions (higher employment means more payroll to service). In that sense, its meandering stock performance in the first quarter of the year simply reflects the fairly steady environment for workers.Lower Taxes WelcomeOne area where Paychex could see a boost is from Trump's corporate tax plan. The company's effective tax rate was about 34% for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 and it anticipates that it will be 35% for the entire year.Even if Trump's tax plan ultimately resolves into a flat 20% tax rate for corporations, this would still be a huge boon to Paychex. To wit, it reported earnings per share of $0.55 in its fiscal third quarter on the back of a 34.2% tax rate. Had its rate been just 22%, its earnings per share would have been around $0.66 per share - a 20% improvement over its reported performance.ConclusionPaychex's forward price-earnings multiple of 24.55-times earnings is relatively high compared to the S&P 500's 18.3-times forward multiple. Even so, it's just about in line with its sector peers - but that considers the services sector as a whole and doesn't include notable players such as Gusto and Zenefits, which have far richer valuations.We don't see why this should be the case: both startups are struggling to achieve the $100 million to $150 million revenue mark and yet, judging from their valuations, investors are willing to pay over 20-times revenues for the companies. In contrast, Paychex is valued at just 6.8-times revenues but has a healthier profile, both in terms of its revenues (and how its revenues are growing) and its ability to sustain itself - that is, its financial strength.We see a severe disconnect there and would argue that Paychex is worth closer to 7.5-time sales, which would imply a price of about $66 per share. Indeed, Paychex is closer to a SaaS company and should have a multiple closer to 30 times, which would imply the same price target (i.e. $66 per share) at the median earnings forecast of $2.24 per share, which is in-line with our own forecast of $2.23 per share.At this price level, Paychex investors can look forward to 12.9% in capital gains. Couple that with its 3.1% dividend yield and investors could be looking at a total return of 16% on the stock - and that doesn't even yet consider the potential impact that a lower tax regime could have. Indeed, under a friendlier tax paradigm, Paychex's valuation could be worth as much as $85 per share."
4009129,99706,2016-09-29T06:30:10-04:00,"Paychex is an impressive secular growth story, more than doubling in five years and posting a 43% increase in its dividend over 5 increases.
        Wednesday saw the stock knocked down 5% post earnings, which is the most heat the stock has felt during that time.
        The company's steady expansion and high margins have typically commanded a premium and this stock does not go on sale too often.
        I assess if this is a good opportunity to add this blue chip on weakness.","Paychex (NASDAQ: PAYX) is one of those stocks that you wish you bought last year every year. It's not an explosive growth tech or pharma story- everyone knows the downsides of those. Rather, its a stock that steadily rises, year after year, with rising earnings and dividends, and management who seemingly know what they are doing to make this happen. In other words, real value creation. It sounds so simple, and yet it is so rare in the market. Many household name blue-chips have become such crowded trades that they now have to resort to financial engineering in the form of buybacks to keep the party going. Paychex, at just under $21B market cap, remains small enough not to be swept up with the P&Gs and Colgate-Palmolives of this world.On a five year basis, this stock has outperformed the SPY by 42% with less volatility, currently sporting a beta of 0.82. Are we too late to the party?It turns out there is a downside to things going so swimmingly for a company, and that is sky-high expectations. We know that earnings are a wild-card and sometimes a stock can get bid up on a loss, but today the truly irrational happened. The company was literally batting 1.000 on earnings as far as the eye could see, not posting one miss since before 2012. Today they announced that net income was up 3%, and revenues were up 9% overall, in line with consensus estimates. Of that 4% in services and 15% in HR/admin services. The only wrinkle in the announcement was that guidance was revised down from 4% earnings growth next year to between 3% and 4%. Investors responded by sending the stock down almost 5% on over 4 times average daily volume.Remember that this stock has no negative news to deal with and has not faced much adversity in 5 years. In fact, you can probably find an article by someone making a great case for adding it when it was at its all time high last week. Let's look at some metrics vs Paychex's two main competitors, which I have identified as Intuit and ADP, to see if anything is out of whack from a metrics perspective. Intuit does have a suite of offerings that compete with Paychex's services even though they are more known for tax software. There are other companies in this space but none of them come close to the size of these three.First, on ROE, Paychex consistently generated the highest of the group until about a year ago when Intuit took over. Whether that spike of Intuit's can be sustained remains to be seen. Paychex has been the most consistent generator of high ROE so they command a premium here.Turning next to the payout ratio, as all three companies in this stable, high margin business are dividend payers, we see Paychex is returning the highest amount of its profits to shareholders. Not necessarily a good thing. It's a little high at 80%, but, this is one metric I think we can give the benefit of the doubt to management on.Is it sustainable in this industry? Competitor ADP is bigger, has been around longer, and has some debt on its balance sheet (unlike Paychex). ADP have been quite active on the buy back from. Paychex also authorized up to $350M of buybacks at the beginning of July, and you have to hope they would save these for when the price drops a little (like now) and not at its all time highs (last week). Limited buybacks are a good tool for the arsenal, since the earnings are not very diversified and rapid margin expansion appears unlikely at this point. Investors have been well served by the slow and steady approach, and this high payout is part of the deal: slow, boring, and consistent.On the earnings growth chart below, you can see that revenues have consistently grown between 4.5 and 9 per cent for 5 years. Intuit's earnings growth has been more volatile, swinging from almost none to 10. ADP has provided roughly the same consistency in earnings growth except for a blip in 2013. That is really the other direct competitor here and there is very little on the horizon at the moment that disrupts either of these incumbents' space. Differentiation must come mainly from service and user experience since I could glean very little substantive difference in product offering from the company websites. Of course, Intuit is a Silicon Valley company and you can picture them targeting these markets harder so that is a risk. As is the ever present threat of disruption to comfortable, high-margin business models in this age of rapid rechnological change.So why choose Paychex? Better track record and less leverage for one thing, but also a rare opportunity to score some stock on sale. If you look at the long term price action, you would have waited a long time, maybe forever, for a ""pullback"", if you're one of those people. This earnings non-event may be a quick ""on sale"" event. If the good economic news continues and the post-election bump occurs, this company could be at $65 or $70 in the next two years.To get an idea of the likelihood of that, I also took a look at the option market to see what kind of moves market makers are pricing in. Paychex is not active enough for weekly options yet so I looked at March 2017. The market is pricing in about a 70% chance of an up to $6 move in either direction right now with an ever so slightly bias to the downside. This drop may represent an opportunity to be a contrarian and scoop up some Paychex under recent highs, or, as I did, write some puts. Wanting to wait always seems sensible, but when quality businesses get knocked down (think American Express and Wal-Mart earlier this year), which often happens after a tepid earnings report, the bargains usually don't last long. I would not buy calls in a slow-moving stock like this but $95, or 1.9%, or 3.8% annualized, could be collected for committing to buy the stock in March 2017 for $50. I probably wouldn't bother with this since its not much of a premium over the current yield of 3.2%, but I am a big advocate of cash secured puts for people who don't want to pony up for a stock today.I think it's too early to call dead money on Paychex. This is not a risk-free stock by any means but its has shown incredible resilience through all economic cycles. And dips today's like have, up until now, continually been met by new highs."
4047594,98656,2017-02-20T12:37:27-05:00,"If President Trump scraps Dodd-Frank, we expect small businesses to flourish.As small businesses grow, we believe that demand for Paychex's services will rise.Furthermore, as the company holds significant funds for clients, the interest it earns on these funds will increase as rates rise.This could allow the company to grow quicker than the market expects, providing significant upside potential.","Although President Trump has been tight-lipped on his infrastructure and corporate tax plans, one bombshell he has dropped is his plan to scrap The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Although opinion is divided on the ramifications of loosening regulations, we agree with the view that it will stimulate small business growth. One of the companies we expect to benefit from this is payroll and human resource outsourcing services provider Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX).The Dodd-Frank was named after its two backers Senator Christopher J. Dodd and U.S. Representative Barney Frank. The 2,300-page act was put in place in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis by the Obama Administration in an attempt to eliminate various risks in America's financial system. Whilst the act covers a wide range of things, we are focusing on the small business lending side of the act.At present, Dodd-Frank makes it tougher for small business owners to borrow money. This is because banks have been issued larger reserve requirements, making it harder for them to lend to start-ups and small to medium-sized businesses. Whilst we support many parts of the act, we believe these tighter regulations have stunted small business growth by decreasing their ability to expand. This ultimately has a negative impact on the small to medium-sized business community and the economy as a whole.Source: PaynetAs you can see on the chart above, the small business lending index is currently below its pre-GFC levels. Whilst it did peak in 2014, since then, it has been trending lower. By comparison, commercial and industrial loans, shown below, have grown over 31% since the GFC.Source: FREDBut thankfully for small businesses, the act is likely to be thrown out in the near future. This week President Trump signed a measure that scraps the Dodd-Frank rule on energy and mining groups. We don't think it will be long until the rule that has strangled small business lending will be scrapped as well. Especially considering Trump's complaints. Recently he stated that:We agree with the view of President Trump and believe that its removal will help small businesses and stimulate economic growth in the United States.It, therefore, comes as no surprise to us that talk of the Dodd-Frank being scrapped coincides with small business optimism reaching a 10-year high. Paychex, a company that generates revenue by taking care of small business payroll and human resource duties, thrives on small to medium business growth. After all, it is far more cost effective for a company to use Paychex than hire someone to handle payroll duties. Because of this, we think that as regulations relax and small businesses prosper, Paychex will be in a strong position to grow.Another catalyst for earnings growth will come from interest rate hikes. Paychex generates income from the interest it earns on money held for clients, so rising interest rates will be a boost to net income. As of the last quarter, the company held $3.242 billion for clients, though it expects to hold an average of $5 billion for clients during FY2017, according to its most recent 10Q. As a result, management has estimated that a 25-basis point change in short-term interest rates would positively impact after-tax earnings by $3.5 million to $4 million.In light of this, we have forecast the following:The current consensus estimate is for fiscal year revenue in the region of $3.16 billion and earnings per share of $2.22. This represents growth of 7% and 6%, respectively. But we think looser regulations will result in stronger growth for the remainder of FY2017.Based on our belief that the Dodd-Frank will be scrapped, we expect growth to be around 9% and 8%, respectively, in FY 2017. This would result in revenue of $3.217 billion and earnings per share of $2.26. In FY2018, we envisage growth accelerating into the double-digits as small business lending increases and rates rise further.Although this growth may not appear strong enough to justify its shares changing hands at 29x earnings, historically, the market has been willing to pay this premium to own its shares on similar levels of growth. This can be seen on the chart below.Based on this price-to-earnings ratio and our forecast of earnings per share of $2.27 in FY 2017, we have a price target of $65.54. Should its shares reach our price target, they will provide a return in excess of 10%, before dividends from the last close price.Following a dip in its share price, we think that now could be an opportune time to open a long position. We feel confident that small businesses are about to get a big lift from President Trump, which we expect will help Paychex grow its top line in the high single to low double-digits for the next few years."
4061309,39141,2017-04-09T21:55:21-04:00,"Paychex continues to deliver good results, with solid growth in human resource services.Shares have dipped from almost $63 per share to $58.From now on, dividends should grow along with earnings/cash flow.","Last year, at about this time, I wrote an article about Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), a provider of HR outsourcing to small and medium-sized businesses in the US. This industry and this company are both favorites of mine: This is a very capital-light industry with decent barriers to entry. The extra cherry on top could be increased job growth under the Trump administration (although last month's job numbers were not so great).Paychex is high on my short list because it is a big name in this industry and has a good record of dividend growth - a record which is getting better each year. In my previous article, I was cautious on Paychex. It just seemed too overvalued and the yield wasn't quite generous enough.Courtesy of Google FinanceSince that last article, shares of Paychex have gone pretty much sideways, from $54 then to just $58 and change today. Not a big change. However, earnings per share increased high single-digits, and management increased that dividend by another 9.5%; always a good sign. This article takes a look at Paychex's fundamentals, and takes another look at its valuation.Solid growth aheadOver the last nine months, total revenue has grown 7%, with operating income up 8% and earnings per share up 7%. Of the company's two business segments, payroll service revenue increased 3%, with human resource services revenue increasing 13%. ('Human resource services,' in this case, refers to retirement, benefits and hiring services and programs, which is growing significantly faster.)Last year, Paychex invested heavily in a new, cloud-based ""human capital management"" platform - one which provided HR, payroll and benefits services to clients. The company announced an expansion of the portfolio of partners offering investment and fiduciary protection to 401k sponsors.Expectations for next year are very good. Management expects service revenue growth between 7% and 8%, with payroll revenue growing by between 3% and 4%, and HR service revenue to grow between 12% and 14%.Paychex is in a good place. Small and medium-sized businesses often find it difficult to provide benefit, HR and insurance services to its employees; so oftentimes, they just outsource these tasks to Paychex. The impetus for this only increased with 'Obamacare' and the ever-increasing regulatory burden on healthcare for employees. With Trump's to-date failure to repeal Obamacare, and the proposed plan seeming to be equally complex, it looks like Paychex's services will be in higher and higher demand.Valuation and financialsLast year, when I reviewed Paychex, I concluded it was a bit overvalued. Let's see where valuations have gone since then. According to data from FAST Graphs, shares of Paychex have averaged 24 times trailing, operating earnings; right now, shares trade at 26.5 times trailing earnings. Shares are more reasonably valued than last time, but are still about 9% overvalued despite the recent dip. Sometimes it isn't always good to buy on the dip.As far as that dividend goes, it is solid and in great shape. The dividend is 71% of free cash flow and 80% of trailing earnings. These ratios are comfortable, but leave little room for dividend growth exceeding growth in earnings and cash flow. That means, mid single-digit earnings growth will probably bring dividend growth of the same amount.ConclusionMuch as I like Paychex, I don't like overpaying, and I don't recommend overpaying for this stock at this time. Paychex is one of those names income investors should put on their watch list. When Paychex comes down to a reasonable valuation, I will be the first to recommend it.If you're interested in Paychex, feel free to follow me here on Seeking Alpha. I've been following this company for a while, and will provide update articles when doing so is both material and relevant."

The reason for this, however, is that before I provide my thoughts on Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), I would provide some color as to my background and investment strategy. This is only my third post on Seeking Alpha and I suspect some readers have come away with the impression that I might be a ""permabear"" which is definitely not the case.I am a Canadian resident who has recently had the good fortune of retiring at 56. After working many years in the Canadian banking industry (which I truly enjoyed 98% of the time), I realized that I had far fewer years of good health and energy than I had already enjoyed.After years of diligently saving and investing, my wife and I have had the good fortune of building a portfolio which generates sufficient dividend income to support our lifestyle. Having said this, we are not yet at the stage where we are spending all our dividend income, and we continue to reinvest the same.The day will soon come, however, where we will need to draw down on the funds within our retirement accounts. In Canada, we have what is known as Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). At some stage of the game, most people convert their RRSPs to Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIFs). Since most Seeking Alpha readers are US residents, I won't go into detail on the terms and conditions of these plans. If you really have the urge to see what we Canadians have to go through, then go here. For all American readers, you probably have enough to worry about your IRAs, 401(k)s, etc.While the vast majority of the Canadian population will wait as long as they can before converting their RRSP to a RRIF, we are in the position where if we don't start withdrawing from our RRSPs well before age 71, we will face a huge tax liability once we convert our plans (try close to 50% tax!). We must, therefore, strategically start withdrawing funds from our RRSPs well before the age of 71. A challenge we have, albeit good, is that the dividend income generated from our stock holdings within our non-registered and registered accounts is sufficient to more than offset the RRSP withdrawals we must start taking early.Another good fortune we have had is that about a year before the economic meltdown, I became increasingly nervous about the stupidity that was going on in the real estate market in the US. While definitely not the wisest thing to do, I literally liquidated every single stock we held in our multiple accounts and sat on cash. It certainly was frustrating for the following year as stock prices kept creeping upwards but when the meltdown happened, I started deploying our cash. This was not done all at once but rather in drips and drabs. I also lucked out when, for the first time in ages, our Canadian dollar was almost at parity with the US dollar and was briefly above parity. That is no longer the case as we now need roughly $1.34 Canadian to purchase $1 US dollar.Some readers might point out that we are being silly having 60-65% of our portfolio in US stocks since we get hit with a 15% withholding tax on all dividends generated from US-based companies (more than 15% on the ADRs we own) held in non-registered accounts (there is no withholding tax on dividends from US companies held within registered accounts), but I just HAD to buy shares in US-listed companies. You see, for those of you who are unfamiliar with the companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), pickings are pretty slim; it doesn't really take long to go down the list of companies based on market cap to go ""Ugh, are you kidding me?"". Once you get past the major banks, the telecoms, and a handful of other companies, there are few companies that meet my investment criteria.Another thing I would like you to consider is that at my stage in life, I will not invest in anything remotely speculative. I see several posts on companies that are far too risky for me. I need to be able to put my head on the pillow at night and get a sound night's sleep.I also see several posts written by people who appear to be far brighter than me. They go into all sorts of technical analysis. This is wonderful because I learn a lot. While I don't mind reviewing 10-Ks, 10-Qs, proxy statements, investor presentations, etc., I just don't have the technical skill, nor the desire, to perform any form of technical analysis that would make members of the SA community proud.Given my profile, this is why we invested in PAYX and intend to hold it for the long term.Company OverviewPaychex, Inc. was founded in 1971, 22 years after Automatic Data processing (NASDAQ:ADP), its largest publicly-traded competitor, was founded. The founder's intent was to make payroll outsourcing easy and affordable for small businesses.Paychex is less than half the size of ADP from a market capitalization perspective ($22.05B vs. $46.35B) as I compose this post on December 22, 2016. Despite being much smaller than ADP, PAYX is still formidable and has grown to more than 12,000 employees serving in excess of 1 million small to medium-sized businesses nationwide as per a December 1, 2016, news release. Another impressive statistic is that it pays one out of every 12 American private sector employees.PAYX's operates from more than 100 locations in 40 states. This is a major difference between PAYX and ADP in that PAYX's business is almost exclusively in the US, whereas ADP has operations in multiple countries.While PAYX has operations in Germany (four locations) and long-lived assets in Germany, the level of business it conducts in Germany is immaterial. It also has a joint-venture arrangement to provide payroll and human resource services in Brazil but, once again, revenue from these operations is not material.Services offered by PAYX consist of:On December 22, 2015, PAYX completed its acquisition of Advance Partners, a leading provider of integrated financial, operational, and strategic services to support independent staffing firms. It offers customizable solutions to the temporary staffing industry, including payroll funding and outsourcing services.PAYX generates revenue from its Payroll Services (NASDAQ:PS) and Human Resources Services (HRS) lines of business.AnalysisThe following analysis has been prepared using PAYX's December 21, 2016, news release and second quarter highlights and financial results FY 2017 presentation as well as data from Morningstar, Inc.Q2 Fiscal 2017 ResultsPS revenue was $440.9 million, a 3% increase from the same period FY 2016. Advance Partners contributed approximately 1% to this growth.HRS revenue was $319.1 million, an increase of 12% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. HRS revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in client base across all major Human Capital Management services, including comprehensive human resource outsourcing services, retirement services, time and attendance, and human resource administration. Advance Partners contributed approximately 2% to the growth of HRS revenue in Q2.Source: PAYX's second quarter highlights and financial results FY 2017 presented December 21, 2016.PAYX benefited from slightly higher interest rates, which resulted in interest earned on funds held for clients increasing 2% to $11.4 million in Q2 relative to Q2 FY 2016. This came about even though average investment balances held for clients were down 1% for the second quarter. Although there was client base growth, the lower average balances were more than offset by the impact of the timing of certain remittances to taxing authorities.PAYX was negatively impacted by a 1.2% increase in the effective income tax rate from 32.9% to 34.1% (same six-month period FY 2016 and FY 2017).Cash and short-term investments as at November 30, 2016, totaled $725.1 million, with normal business operations being the primary source of cash. Short-term borrowings amounted to $103.1 million. Cash flows from operations were $413.4 million for the first six months of FY 2017, which represents a 2% decrease from the same period in FY 2016. This decrease resulted mainly from fluctuations in working capital, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items. Working capital fluctuations contributed $147.0 million of cash outflows for the first six months of FY 2017 compared with $111.5 million of cash outflows for the same period in FY 2016.In the first six months of FY 2017, PAYX repurchased 2.9 million shares of its common stock for a total of $166.2 million. This represents an average purchase price of $57.31/share. During the same six-month period in FY 2016, it repurchased 1.3 million shares for $62.9 million for an average purchase price of $48.38/share.Outlook For Remainder Of Fiscal 2017PAYX provided the following outlook for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2017. This is based upon current market, economic, and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. In addition to what is not reflected below, the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2017 is expected to be approximately 35%, which is slightly higher than that incurred YTD and the previous FY.Source: PAYX's second quarter highlights and financial results FY 2017 presented December 21, 2016.P/E RatioPAYX's historical P/E for 2008 - current is as follows:2008: 16.742009: 22.372010: 22.732011: 20.212012: 20.192013: 28.282014: 26.082015: 26.31Current: ~29.17DividendsDividends have historically been paid to common stock shareholders in August, November, February, and May.

The likelihood of me doing this, however, is remote. I am just happy to sit on our PAYX shares with no worry about our shares being called away if I am off doing something far more enjoyable than monitoring stock prices.ConclusionPAYX is a wonderful business and I highly recommend it as an investment... just not at the current valuation. I am very reluctant to invest any more money in PAYX at current levels and a forward P/E of 27.70 (current price $61.50/$2.22 EPS estimate from 22 brokers).I recognize the new US President has promised job creation, which would be a huge positive for PAYX. In addition, if interest rates trend up, PAYX will generate additional income on client funds held on deposit.I, however, sense an element of euphoria somewhat similar to the high tech bubble in 1999-2000 (although not to quite the same degree). I have witnessed the repercussions when people are willing to pay 30Xs earnings (and more). Some readers may say this time it is different. If this time it is different, so be it. If it is not different, then at least I have not stepped on a landmine.An argument could be made that I should perhaps sell our PAYX shares if I feel they are overvalued. Very valid point considering they are held in a Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP) so the sale of same would attract no capital gains tax; the dividends do attract a 15% withholding tax. I, however, have no interest in parting ways with this company much like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger had no intention of parting ways with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) when it was grossly overvalued in 1998. I don't even intend to sell these shares to fund our daughter's education although I will inevitably have to sell our PAYX holdings as there is a deadline by which I must liquidate the RESP. When this happens, I will just turn around and repurchase the same number of shares in a non-registered account.I will patiently wait to add additional PAYX shares to those currently held and acquired at an average cost of $23.2771. Should PAYX experience a correction, which brings its shares to a more reasonable P/E multiple of 25 (or lower), I would consider buying. Using the consensus projected EPS of $2.22 provided by 22 brokers, I would be prepared to add additional PAYX shares if the price drops to about the $55 level (25 * $2.22).Using a price of $55 and the current annual dividend of $1.84, I end up with a dividend yield 3.35%, which comes closer to the five-year trailing dividend yield of about 3.2%.On a final note, I don't have any intention of posting any more articles until 2017. I would, therefore, like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas. Should you not observe Christmas, I still wish you the very best during the upcoming holiday season.Here's hoping to a wonderful and prosperous 2017!"
3983904,36431,2016-06-23T12:08:44-04:00,"Paychex is like ADP's little brother, but it pays bigger dividends.
        Like ADP, it will benefit from rising rates.
        Valuations are similar, but are they warranted?
        It could be argued that PAYX is a better business than ADP.","After recently writing about Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), I decided to dig into its smaller competitor Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) as well. I liked what I found. Like ADP, I think shares of PAYX are on the right side of a rising rate environment. Unlike ADP, however, I also think Paychex will be better at operating within the possible scenario of lower rates for longer, too.Paychex, the other payroll companyADP is a larger company, but I think Paychex is slowly becoming more of a household name. It generates about 61% of sales from payroll services and the other 39% from human resources. It's also a market leader in selling complementary services - such as retirement and insurance services - to existing payroll clients. It seems to be a virtuous cycle.This is especially true considering it's able to exploit its float. In my ADP article, I pointed out that:Morningstar thinks that a full 1% increase in rates would be needed to boost Paychex's operating margins by just 4%, so it's not as ""rate sensitive"" as ADP, but it still benefits from increasing rates overall. Increased income from its float also drops right down to the bottom line as well.Comparing capital allocation skillsADP owns size-and-scale - it's double the size of Paychex when measuring market caps. I was surprised, therefore, when I found out that Paychex's return on equity was not only superior to ADP's, but it was also achieved with much less leverage (assets/equity).I compared ROE's between the two companies and omitted ROIC because Paychex doesn't have any debt on its balance sheet. From my five step Dupont analysis above, we can conclude that not only does Paychex generate superior return on equity with less leverage, but it's also more efficient at utilizing its assets when looking at both firms' asset turnovers (revenues/assets), too.ADP's balance sheet contains some debt (30.84% debt to capital as of its most recent quarter), and it's also a proponent of buybacks.ADP Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YChartsI think that both of these facts help explain ADP's higher leverage in comparison to Paychex.Buying back shares shrinks the denominator in the leverage ratio equation and in turn magnifies return on equity. The trade off is usually more business risk, but ADP has a strong balance sheet and gushes cash flow, so there isn't too much to worry about here. I'd also say that Paychex is still superior in my opinion, with a stronger balance sheet and less leverage.Speaking of cash flow...Paychex spits out tons of free cash flow. ADP does too, but nowhere near as much.PAYX Free Cash Flow (% of Annual Revenues) data by YChartsThis is another point for PAYX. Turning well over $0.20 of every dollar into free cash flow is very impressive. While Paychex might not have the same illustrious forty-year plus record of dividend increases, I think it will be able to bump its dividend at a suitable rate compared to ADP going forward.Another factor we can consider is the sustainable growth rate, where ADP actually shines through. The sustainable growth rate, loosely defined as the amount a firm can grow without borrowing more money, is defined mathematically as [ROE X (1-payout ratio)]. Paychex maintains a sustainable growth rate of just about 7.58% versus ADP's rate of around 10%.Paychex also boasts higher return on equity, so ADP's leading sustainable growth rate is largely attributed to its lower payout ratio of 60% versus a payout ratio of 80% for Paychex. Still, judging by how cash-rich PAYX is and the lack of debt on its balance sheet, I think it's still a better candidate for above-average dividend growth. It also has a much more attractive starting dividend yield, which is a tad above 3% versus ADP's yield of just 2.34%.ConclusionValuations are relatively comparable between the two firms on a trailing basis, but Paychex actually looks cheaper based on forward earnings.PAYX PE Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsI think Paychex should trade at a premium, though. Its return on equity is much more attractive, it pays a materially higher dividend backed by a stronger balance sheet, and converts twice as much free cash flow from sales as ADP does. Still, like ADP, I think valuations are a little rich right now and it's probably best to put Paychex on the watchlist until we get a dip.In my ADP article, I acknowledged the dampening effect of low rates on the company's margins.ADP Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsUnlike ADP, I think Paychex can continue to operate full throttle even if rates stay lower for longer, and I think that it's less reliant on its float income. It's also been slowly shifting more of its sales towards its human resource services lately, which might provide a better buffer towards lower rates going forward as well. The good news, therefore, is that whether rates stay low, rise, or remain flat - Paychex will continue to mint money.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""+Follow"" button at the top of the page by the author's name."

To boost yield, I need a stock highly likely to provide covered call income. Simple stuff, right?This post presents the dividend stock fundamentals of my most recent 2016 portfolio addition. I already own this stock, and I am up about 10% since July 2015, not including dividends. With dividends added, in I am up 12.3%. I have not sold any calls on Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX).I added PAYX to the 2015 Dividend Machine Model Portfolio in July 2015. That portfolio is long only. Whereas in 2016, I will record actual sales as a result of calls being assigned, but otherwise, the 2016 portfolio is also long only.Paychex 2016 FundamentalsIn the table below, you will see the data I used to evaluate Paychex. Earnings are greater than dividends paid, at $2.04 EPS and $1.68 annual dividend payout. The dividend yield is 3.2%, which is very nice for income investors, and dividend growth over the past five years has averaged more than 6% per year. Even more good news for income investors, the debt-to-equity ratio (D/E) is 0. Paychex has virtually no debt. So far, we have a good dividend stock that would seem to be a safe bet.Notice a couple of things from that table. First look at revenue growth. I am looking for, and believe me it is hard to find, a stock with revenue growth at least 4% year over year (y/y) for the past 3 years. PAYX has doubled its revenue growth 8.70%. Next, look at the failure of PAYX to solicit covered calls. Technically, this is a failure, but like Watsco (NYSE:WSO), I will wait for some volatility to occur and a covered call to come our way.Open interest and put/call ratios are a couple of ways to determine if you think a stock will have a future with covered calls available. Here is a link to a site that writes about call/put activity. This article written in October 2015 points toward the call opportunities of PAYX. I am hoping this opportunity will come up again soon. I see a September $55 call for $.90, but the call expiration date is too far out and the strike price is too low.In the interim, we have a stock paying not just income, but income that is highly likely to continue to grow while we are paid for yield-boosting covered calls and future capital gains.While I do not technically use other factors to make my decisions about adding stocks to my model portfolios, I do like the business. As all employers know, managing your payroll and making sure you do not run afoul of a myriad of regulatory requirements is a daunting task. The need for a professional service to manage this part of running a business will grow. Moreover, Paychex is not a one-trick pony. The company also offers retirement and insurance services.Consider PAYX for the income-producing portion of your stock portfolio.Disclosure: Long PAYX."
3987620,96536,2016-07-11T14:18:32-04:00,"Paychex Inc is a payroll and human resources company with an impressive growth record.
        Shares of PAYX have raced to all time highs, and dividends are a significant percentage of earnings.
        This article explores whether the historical financial trends support this price performance.","Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a payroll company, originally founded in 1971 as Paymaster. Since then, the company has grown to approximately $22B in market capitalization, and does business with over 605,000 customers (source). This kind of growth is always worth investigating.Plus, I recently wrote about investing in ADP. And in the comments of that article, someone mentioned PAYX. I'd seen this company before but was finally prompted to take a closer look. Plus, the stock is trading near all-time highs, and I'm always curious to see the underlying fundamental trends that support this kind of price performance.Before getting into the fundamental data though, here's a long-term price chart of PAYX, so you can see for yourself what kind of total return opportunity this investment has presented in the past.By looking at the strength of the underlying financial trends, we can see if this price performance, and underlying dividend growth, is supported. We'll also be able to get more insight into how PAYX is competing against its incumbent, ADP.PAYX: Fundamentals in FocusWhen considering an investing in a company, I always like to start with top line demand. If there is a steady trend heading up and to the right, then I'm encouraged there's real demand for the services in question. So how does it look in the case of PAYX? Let's take a look at revenue:As you can see, top-line growth has been consistent. For background, it's been historically driven by a combination of organic expansion and acquisition. Over the years, PAYX has gobbled up smaller niche payment processors, adding in excess of 50,000 customers in the process (source). It's likely they'll continue to pursue bolt-on acquisitions to compliment organic growth. For more context on how this revenue breaks down, keep in mind the company generates sales across 2 services areas, though they're technically one segment. This recent investors presentation slide (source) breaks them and their contribution out concisely: Although HRS makes up a smaller portion of sales, it is a much faster growing business area. In the last year, HRS revenue increased 18% vs. 4% for payroll revenue. It seems PAYX is very effectively using its payroll distribution to push additional HR services to its existing client.To the extent PAYX can sell more recurring revenue services to existing client, this high margin growth should be able to continue. The lack of customer acquisition cost on these sales will likely boost earnings too. So let's take a look at how that has been panning out.As you can see, both earnings and margins have risen with revenue. These consistent trends speak to the high quality nature of the business. Intuitively, it makes sense too that there would be consistency in these results because the services provided are relatively essential to businesses. Even when economic times get tough, companies still need payroll services to the degree they still have staff. For these reasons, I'm a little more confident these financial trends are likely to be relatively representative on a forward-looking basis.Another positive sign for PAYX is the quality of the earnings, which are well backed by cash flow. This is encouraging in that it demonstrates the company isn't resorting to any accounting maneuvering to beat estimates. Again, this is another sign of a quality company with an enduring competitive moat. As shareholders though, we need to ask how we're benefiting from this moat. Luckily, in the case of PAYX, it looks like the board has been relatively shareholder friendly. For starters, upwards of 80% of dividends are paid out to shareholders. However, on a cash flow basis this number looks a little more manageable.While the high payout ratio is admirable in that it speaks to the company's dedication to returning cash, the bumpy dividend record is a little alarming. Ideally, I'd like to see the company increase the dividend a manageable amount each year. Inconsistency is a slightly uncomfortable precedent for me. That said, as long as free cash flow can hold up, I'm optimistic we'll see more dividend growth.In addition to dividends, the company has also authorized another $350M in share buybacks over the next year. This will allow them to continue growing the dividend on a per share basis without having to increase the total amount of distributions. While I'm not always a fan of buybacks, PAYX is primarily financing them with free cash flow, so I'm not too worried. Their balance sheet is also debt-free, leaving them lots of financial flexibility.Now, while PAYX seems to have many of the attributes of a high quality dividend growth investing business, it's not a perfect investment. Every investment has risk. And there are a few worth talking about regarding PAYX.Potential Risks of Betting on PAYX:PAYX, like any investment, has some real headwinds. First of all, it's competing against an enemy twice its size. As this industry becomes more and more automated with technology, ADP may have the edge in terms of economies of scale. On the small business front, there are also a variety of cloud-based start-ups trying to bite at market share. But I think the other big risk facing new potential PAYX shareholders, is the risk of overpaying. At this point, prices of PAYX have been going on a bit of a tear. It's hard to buy at all time highs, especially when shares are trading at such a high premium to the S&P 500:On the other hand, it looks like PAYX has always had a premium price tag. So if you want to own this business you may want to set an alert for when it falls 10-20%. I typically don't like to buy at peak valuation, but it looks like that has been the only option with PAYX.Conclusion: Dipping a Toe in PAYI've had a good experience investing in ADP. And from all accounts, PAYX looks like it could be a faster growing compliment. For that reason, I was willing to start a small position in PAYX last month. The price was definitely more than I would have loved to pay. But I wanted to get some exposure and it's already working out well. I will keep monitoring and be ready to dollar cost average at lower prices. This works for me, because I have a long investment timeframe and ability to add to the position on pullbacks. But what do you think? Does PAYX look like an appealing investment to you, or is it too expensive at this price?"
3961411,98366,2016-03-28T13:41:36-04:00,On Wednesday the company will announce its third quarter earnings.We believe the shares are overvalued now and anything short of spectacular will cause a sell-off.We believe the shares could drop as much as 10% if the company fails to deliver.At the right price ($49.00) Paychex is a great investment.,"On February 9 when its share price was just $46.66, we saw a good deal of upside for Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX). We had a six-month target price of $49.44 and an 18-month target price of $53.52. Well, fast-forward to today and the share price closed at $53.99 before the Easter break. With its third quarter earnings due out on Wednesday we have decided to close our position.We have been as delighted as anyone to see the shares climb by almost 16% since we bought in. But we are now fearful that anything short of exceptional for its third quarter results will create heavy selling pressure. We have achieved exactly what we set out to achieve and so moving on to a new undervalued company is fine by us. The only opportunity we now see here could be a short opportunity for those brave enough.Our investment thesis was based around Kauffman Foundation's research which showed that small business activity had been growing in 49 U.S. states. With small to medium-sized businesses being the life-blood of the Paychex business, this was a great catalyst to a strong performance in our opinion. But perhaps not as strong as the market is now expecting.We believe the company is valued fairly at 24 times earnings. The current share price of $53.99 is indicative of full-year earnings coming in at $2.25 per share. Looking at the analyst consensus estimates we find that only the most bullish analyst currently believes the company can produce earnings per share of that level in fiscal 2017. No one thinks it will get anywhere close to that level in fiscal 2016.In fiscal 2017 the highest estimate is $2.26 per share and in fiscal 2016 it is $2.06 per share. Of course 24 times earnings is just our preference for what we feel to be fair. Other investors are very welcome to pay more for the shares than that, but we aren't as comfortable with paying more.As you can see above the price to earnings ratio had a tendency to peak at around 24 times earnings from 2008 through to late 2013. We are not expecting any spectacular earnings growth in the next five years which could justify paying a premium to this level.The boom in small business could cause a surprise, but we feel there is significant downside risk if it doesn't. We would see the shares dropping down around 10% to $49.00 if there is a poor result on Wednesday when the market is expecting 50 cents per share.We still think that Paychex is a great company at the right price. If the company has been able to capture some of the small business boom, then the future could be very prosperous. Building relationships with its customers is key for it to build on its success. By successfully assisting small businesses with their payroll, we have little doubt these companies will stay loyal and grow with them. As these small businesses grow they will have to hire more staff, which then potentially allows Paychex the opportunity to assist with the Human Resources side of the business.In the third quarter we expect the company will produce earnings per share of 50 cents on revenue of $750 million. This will set up the company well to achieve full-year earnings per share of $2.06 as we forecast at the start of February. But sadly those earnings are just not enough to warrant paying a premium for the shares today.We would recommend closing positions in Paychex right now as we just feel it has become too expensive and is at risk of being chopped down substantially on Wednesday after earnings are announced. We would be very happy to be wrong and would love to see the company smash earnings estimate and have the share price skyrocket. But after amassing a 16% return in a market that gives very little, we are locking in our gains now."

(NASDAQ: PAYX) is a human capital management company that offers outsourced payroll processing, human resource and benefits administration services to small- and medium-sized businesses.In its most recent quarter (ending November 2015), the company's earnings grew 9.4% to $189.2 million, as revenue rose 6.8% to $722.4 million. On a diluted per share basis, earnings jumped 10.6% to $0.52.Since the company's services are vital for its clients' business operations, its recurring revenue streams are very consistent compared to other industries. With declining unemployment numbers and steady small business jobs growth, its revenue and earnings growth trends are expected to continue.Consensus estimates for Paychex's upcoming quarterly earnings are $0.50 per share. Over the last year, the company has either come in line or above estimates, while in the previous two quarters, Paychex has beat earnings estimates by 2%. On an annual basis, analysts expect a 10.3% earnings growth for this year to roughly $2.04 per share.The company has maintained an impressive operating margin (38.9%) compared to some of its industry competitors, such as Automatic Data processing, Inc.

(NYSE:NSP) (3%).It has a healthy balance sheet with long-term debt/equity of 0.08 and a current ratio of 1.1.Now, a few details about my valuation process. I use a discounted cash flow model to estimate a company's value. I also make a number of conservative assumptions to ensure that I am looking for real value:According to my valuation process, Paychex is valued at around $76.19 per share. However, as of this writing, the stock price has closed at $52.45 - a 31% discount to its estimated value.For me, a company trading at a 20% or greater discount to its estimated intrinsic value qualifies on a price basis as a potential value play. But the overall quality of this business and the stability of its revenue streams makes this a particularly attractive buy.Back in May of 2014, management was approved to repurchase up to $350 million of common stock through to May of 2017. In the previous two quarters, the company has repurchased 1.3 million shares for $62.5 million. And in December of last year, Paychex completed its acquisition of Advance Partners, a similar service provider to Paychex that primarily targets the temporary staffing industry. Advance Partners will operate under Paychex as a wholly-owned subsidiary.As of this writing, the stock offers a dividend yield of 3.2%. For me, a dividend yield is fairly appealing if it's greater than the highest yield on U.S. Treasury bonds. It's always great to get paid to buy and hold, and this is a decent yield in my book.Note: I choose to think of Seeking Alpha as both a community and a marketplace of ideas.

3787656,50602,2016-01-04T07:30:42-05:00,"A bet on Paychex is a bet on a healthy job market in 2016.
        Headline employment data doesn't tell the whole story, and numbers under the surface paint a fragile picture.
        Paychex's fundamentals and earnings multiple may be in jeopardy if the job market worsens.","In the United States economy and capital markets today, employment is everything. Central banks, governments, and market participants form much of their future financial perspective based on employment data and the trend this data creates. For Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), a small business human resources and payment processing firm, employment trends are vital to the success of its business. Generally speaking, it seems logical - if there are more people working and more businesses forming in the U.S, there becomes a greater demand for Paychex's expertise, which includes tax administration, regulatory compliance, insurance, and other services. From a market perspective, a bet on PAYX can translate to a bet on employment, given the direct relationship between job growth and the benefit to the company's business model.As you can see, as the unemployment rate rose rapidly during the crisis years of '08-'09, Paychex saw its stock tank (along with the overall market), reflecting the gloomier future employment picture. Since the depths of the Great Recession, however, PAYX has staged a strong rebound, and has outperformed the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) in recent months as the unemployment rate continues to fall:Although Paychex rewarded investors in 2015, I'm nervous about its 2016 prospects. Based on more in-depth employment data and patterns that have formed beneath the surface, the overall job picture may not be as rosy as the market may have led some to believe, and this will not bode well for Paychex going forward. This data, as well as increased rumblings of a market that's losing steam, makes me cautious about buying into a company that's so tied to domestic economic strength. Paychex is a well-run business, but macro pressures in 2016 put company fundamentals in danger, which is why I'm choosing to avoid the stock.The Employment MirageThe many lenses with which to view employment numbers have been covered before, but I want to re-hash the situation one more time and put it into context for Paychex and its business. When jobs statistics are released, most people use the unemployment rate as a quick snapshot of how the economy is doing, which drives market sentiment and, in many cases, economic policy. The Federal Reserve uses the unemployment rate as part of its mandate to stabilize markets and cap inflation, factoring the number into its consideration when deciding how to change interest rates. With the unemployment rate sitting at its lowest levels in almost a decade, it would seem that, at least on the surface, the Fed is achieving its mandate and putting people to work.The problem with the current situation is, however, that the unemployment rate has become a poor indication of the overall health of the job market. Many former workers have left the labor force, and jobs that have been created have not been the type of jobs that unemployed people were looking for. Jobs held by people who could only find part-time work have stayed elevated for close to eight years now, 80% higher than pre-recession levels:These people have jobs - pushing the unemployment rate down - but are either over-qualified for them or had a full-time job before the recession hit - and they can't find full-time jobs now.Another popular metric that can be used to show cracks in the job market is the labor force participation rate, which stands at levels not seen since 1977:This data shows the alarming amount of people that have dropped out of the workforce, seemingly because they can't find a job and have given up trying. The unemployment rate only takes into account people who are in the labor force, meaning that when the percentage rate is calculated, it's only trending lower because unemployed people are dropping out of the calculation, not necessarily because they're finding a job. When you look at the economy through data lenses like these, the future doesn't seem as rosy as bulls are touting and pricing in.What this means for Paychex is that its multiple is too high, because investors are over-estimating labor conditions and the impact it will have on the company's performance. PAYX currently sports a multiple of around 26x earnings, implying that investors are paying up for the company's future growth. In recent years, however, earnings have grown by only around 10% per year, meaning the majority of price appreciation in the stock has come from multiple expansion. If earnings don't meet expectations - due to a less-than-stellar jobs report or a decline in new business growth - PAYX's multiple will contract to match new expectations.Paychex's stock may not be the only thing hurt by the realities of the job market - fundamentals may be in danger as well. Right now PAYX earns close to $2 per share, and pays around 80% of these earnings out to shareholders in the form of dividends. With a current yield of 3%, Paychex's dividend may be part of the reason behind the stock's elevated multiple - people want to pay up for yield in a low interest rate environment. What makes me nervous about Paychex right now is if the company were to run into trouble, earnings wouldn't have to fall far for the dividend to be in danger of a cut. Paychex does have enough cash on its balance sheet to cover dividend payments in the short term, but I don't want to have to rely on this cash for the safety of my payout. If unexpected events take a toll on Paychex's profitability or growth, the integrity of the company's dividend may be in jeopardy.Catalysts for Multiple ContractionIf Paychex's earnings multiple is so high, what will bring the stock back in line with its growth projections? The first main factor that will slash PAYX's multiple is a change in market sentiment, which is looking more likely in 2016. From a technical standpoint, markets are starting to flash warning signs, and some are worried that the Fed's era of propping up equity markets has effectively ended. Included in this bearish murmur is the expectation that earnings in Q4 of 2015 will see a modest drop, giving many investors reason to lower their market exposure and sell stocks. If earnings fall as hard as predicted in Q4, sentiment will turn against stocks with high multiples, and the names without earnings growth to match are going to get hit hard. I fear that Paychex may be in the category of stocks with multiples that can't be fully justified, and I think 2016 will be the year prejudice against this category ramps up.ConclusionRight now, I think the market is in a cautious and fragile situation - it won't take much for prices to break in either direction. Headline employment data doesn't tell the full story, and details beneath the surface don't bode well for Paychex's business performance in 2016. I think the dividend is too high to warrant a safe feeling, and I think larger market forces will hurt growth stocks that have seen recent years of multiple expansion. I'm nervous about employment in 2016, and I'm nervous about its effect on Paychex."
3879096,98366,2016-02-09T13:11:11-05:00,Increases in small business activity could help accelerate earnings growth for Paychex.Being the number one small business payroll provider the company is positioned extremely well.A good dividend and low beta could make Paychex a great addition to your portfolio.,"Late last year Kauffman Foundation reported a rise in small business activity in the United States. As a provider of integrated payroll, HR, insurance, and benefits outsourcing solutions to small and medium-sized businesses in the United States, Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) could get a boost from this increased activity.The Kauffman Foundation's research showed that small business activity has been growing in 49 U.S. states. The firm was quoted as saying:Small and medium-sized businesses are the lifeblood of the Paychex business, so we believe this is going to be a major catalyst in 2016. Two quarters into the fiscal year and its biggest segment, the company's Payroll Service Revenue segment, is performing well, and 4.3% ahead of last year. We feel confident that the company will continue this through to the end of the fiscal year and hit $1.7 billion of segment revenue.Source: Company PresentationWe believe the Payroll Services segment will benefit most from a rise in small businesses. The payroll side of a small business is often beyond the ability of a lot of small business owners. So by having great payroll software provided to you, along with one-on-one expert payroll support, we think it will be very appealing to business owners who would prefer to dedicate their time to other tasks.This segment has been growing, as the chart above indicates, at a compound annual growth rate of 3.6% in the last four years. We expect this to increase to above 4% this year and next.As you may have noticed above, while the Payroll Services segment has been growing at a strong rate, the segment's percentage of total service revenue has been dropping. This is encouraging in our opinion, as it clearly shows that other parts of the business are growing at an even quicker rate. Which is the case with the Human Resources segment shown below.This segment has grown from 29% of service revenue in 2011, to 39% of service revenue in 2015. Growing the segment at a compound annual growth rate of almost 15% is a fantastic achievement for the management team, and one that we are extremely impressed by.The relationships that the company builds with its customers is key for continued success. If Paychex can successfully assist small businesses with their payroll, then these businesses will prosper. As they grow they will have to hire more staff, which then potentially allows Paychex the opportunity to assist with the Human Resources side of the business. So, all these small businesses that have just started up may be the catalyst for growth in this segment in a few years.There is still a little more to the company than being the market leading number one payroll service provider in the United States. We shouldn't forget also that the company is America's number one retirement services record-keeper, and has a firm foot in insurance services with more than 140,000 H&R covered lives.Because Paychex has very strong free cash flow generation. In the last quarter the company reported free cash flow of $804 million, with no debt on hand, a very healthy balance sheet, and a dividend yielding 3.5%, we believe it is in a position to expand through acquisition should it see fit. It could also opt to increase it buyback plans which still has $350 million under authorization.We think Paychex is a great investment today, and with its beta of 0.89, a great addition in turbulent markets. We do have concerns about price to earnings ratios being chopped down in the current environment, but with Paychex trading within its usual range we feel it is safe from any PE ratio-related declines. As shown below you can see that it is currently trading close to its long term average.Source: YchartsDue to continued growth within its two major segments we believe the company will produce full year earnings per share of $2.06 on revenue of $2.97 billion. Priced at 24 times earnings this gives us a target price of $49.44. Although this only represents a return of 5.6%, in the years ahead we expect this to produce market-beating returns. Coupled with the 3.5% divided yield this is a worthy low risk investment in our view.Looking to the year ahead, we expect Paychex to begin to see benefit from the rise in small businesses and grow earnings by around 8.5% in fiscal 2017. This would mean earnings per share of $2.23 and an 18-month price target of $53.52. Great returns for the patient investor."
3806326,89805,2016-01-12T17:36:12-05:00,"PAYX has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1988.With a strong brand, mission-critical services, and large base of recurring revenue, PAYX will remain relevant for a long time.Should conservative income investors buy PAYX today?","Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) has paid uninterrupted dividends since going public in 1988. While the company held its dividend flat during the financial crisis, it has otherwise increased its dividend every year since the mid-1990s and currently yields 3.6%.PAYX has a very durable business model that throws off predictable free cash flow. We believe its dividend is very safe and offers at least average growth prospects, making it a good fit for our Conservative Retirees dividend portfolio.Let's take a closer look at the business.Business OverviewPAYX was founded in 1971 and provides a range of payroll, human resource and benefits outsourcing services to over 590,000 small and medium-sized businesses. It offers a wide range of services including payroll processing (e.g. calculate, prepare and delivery employee payroll checks, prepare payroll tax returns, collect and remit client's payroll obligations, etc.), retirement services (e.g. 401(k) plan design, recordkeeping, and plan management services), insurance (e.g. group health insurance, healthcare reform, workers' comp, etc.), and a fully outsourced human resource solution (e.g. on-site personnel, employee handbooks, etc.). Essentially, PAYX helps businesses outsource non-core administrative services in a cost-effective manner so they can focus on their strengths.Approximately 61% of PAYX's revenue is derived from payroll services (includes a growing portfolio of standalone services - expense management, applicant tracking, time and labor), with the remaining 39% from human resource services (e.g. retirement, insurance, human resources).Business AnalysisThe services PAYX provides to businesses are mission-critical - payroll taxes must be correctly calculated and paid on time, insurance policies must conform with healthcare reform, proper records must be kept for 401(k) plans, and more.As a small business owner, you want these jobs done correctly and efficiently. These aren't tasks you want to lose any sleep or energy over. With fewer resources compared to larger companies, outsourcing these administrative tasks, which are constantly evolving as government regulations change, is usually more efficient.With 50-plus years of operating history, a large direct sales force, numerous indirect sales channels (50% of new core payroll clients are referred by existing clients, CPAs, and banks), and substantial market share, PAYX is the trusted brand of choice.PAYX has dominant market share positions in its key businesses. The company is #1 and #2 in payroll services for small and medium-sized businesses, respectively (PAYX pays one in every 15 private sector workers in the U.S.), #1 in retirement services record-keeping (as measured by number of plans), #23 in insurance services with more than 140,000 H&R covered lives, and provides HR services to more than 31,000 clients with over 858,000 worksite employees.As long as customers' administrative needs are being met with quality service at a reasonable price, they have few reasons to switch vendors. Their employees also become familiar with PAYX's software (about 90% of PAYX's mobile app usage comes from its clients' employees who are doing things such as accessing their check stubs and W-2s), raising switching costs. As a result, PAYX's client retention rate reached a new record high (82%) during its most recent fiscal year.PAYX also has evolved to offer clients a larger scope of services compared to many smaller competitors. Going back just 10 years, PAYX's business was 100% payroll services. However, the company now offers an array of human resource services (39% of revenue, which leverage the information gathered in PAYX's base payroll processing service. Human resource services competitors that lack payroll services must depend on vendors like PAYX to power their solutions, putting them at a disadvantage.PAYX's broad product portfolio offers simplification and convenience for customers, but it also helps lower their costs in some cases. For example, PAYX can pool together its customers to increase their purchasing power for insurance products.With no debt and over $900 million in cash on the balance sheet, PAYX also can acquire products to fill gaps, maintain the most fully integrated technology and service available in the marketplace, remain entrenched with its customers, and expand its growth opportunities. For example, PAYX recently acquired Advance Partners, which serves the temporary staffing industry. PAYX previously had no exposure to this market but can now access the 3 million employees it has.Finally, it's worth mentioning that PAYX also earns interest income from investing client funds collected but not yet remitted to applicable tax or regulatory agencies or to client employees. PAYX is a safe dividend stock that would see some benefit if rates ever rise.Despite the scale, regulatory expertise, service breadth, switching costs, and brand advantages enjoyed by PAYX, this is still a fragmented marketplace with fairly low barriers to entry.Key RisksUnlike many other businesses, PAYX is somewhat refreshing in today's macro environment because it has no overseas exposure, is not sensitive to commodity prices, and has no currency risk. It's most sensitive to the U.S. labor market, which has been improving.However, as a technology company, PAYX is at somewhat greater risk of disruption than many other businesses because the pace of change tends to be faster.Investors seem to have two primary concerns with PAYX - the lack of growth available in the company's core payroll services business and competition from new entrants such as Zenefits and Gusto (formerly known as ZenPayroll).Regarding growth, the payroll services market is rather mature. However, it continues growing at a low-single digit pace. More importantly, PAYX has successfully expanded its portfolio to include numerous human resource services. These businesses account for a significant part of PAYX's sales mix (39%) and have consistently grown at about a double-digit pace. Their market shows no signs of slowing down.The company also offers various accounting and financial services (e.g. cloud-based accounting, payment processing, etc.) to businesses but notes in its annual report that ""these services are in their infancy.""The takeaway is that PAYX has expertise in introducing (or acquiring) new products needed by small and medium-sized businesses, and its existing distribution channels are very effective at quickly scaling up new services. We expect the company to continue finding growth opportunities adjacent to the payroll services market. With over 10 million addressable businesses in PAYX's geographic markets, there should be plenty of opportunity for continued growth.New entrants pose a greater concern to us as they have made a strong case for themselves with users. Technology (e.g. the cloud) is accelerating the rate of change in the industry, and start-up costs are increasingly insignificant. Newer software companies typically have products that offer better user experiences, lower costs and greater innovation compared to large incumbents such as PAYX.Zenefits is the most newsworthy rival and was founded in 2013. The company's private market valuation reached more than $4 billion over the summer of 2015, despite expectations of generating up to $100 million in sales this year.Zenefits runs a very different business model than PAYX. It provides free, cloud-based solutions that reduce human resource paperwork and provide a single place to manage payroll, health insurance and other systems. Zenefits makes money by acting as an insurance broker and collecting a commission on the health insurance coverage that businesses purchase from healthcare providers. However, it also launched its own payroll processing service in November 2015, reducing its dependence on partners such as PAYX.Like many startups, Zenefits has hit some bumps that could endanger its future. A Wall Street Journal article from November 2015 noted that the company is ""falling short of its aggressive revenue targets,"" has frozen hiring in certain departments, and has reduced pay for some executives. Regulators also have provided headwinds, arguing that the company is illegal because its free software constitutes a gift, which isn't allowed in the health insurance business.Like many tech startups, Zenefits is not likely profitable and, depending on how growth shakes out in the coming years, might not even survive. Fidelity Investments marked down the value of its investment in Zenefits by 48% during the third quarter of 2015 (it invested in May 2015).On the payroll side, Gusto has emerged as a strong new entrant. Gusto is much cheaper than PAYX and provides a more pleasant user experience. It also recently added human resource services to significantly improve the scope of its offering.PAYX can combat new entrants in several ways. First, it can use its $900 million-plus in cash to acquire them or invest in similar functionality to stay relevant to its customers. Since Gusto and Zenefits emerged several years ago, hundreds of imitators have cropped up that PAYX could pick off.The company also is investing in its software to stay ""good enough"" for customers not to switch. Roughly 80% of PAYX's clients now have an online connection to them - accessing reports, using mobile apps and processing their payroll. Its new Paychex Flex solution also received favorable reviews by PC Magazine. PAYX will continue investing in cloud-based technology and mobility applications to improve the user experience.Perhaps most importantly PAYX has strong brand recognition and trust in the market. Payroll and human resource services must be working correctly 100% of the time. Until Gusto and Zenefits establish a longer track record, many of PAYX's customers are less likely to jump ship. However, they could push for reduced pricing in future contract negotiations.Until we see signs that PAYX is starting to struggle with profitable growth, we believe the highly fragmented nature of the market, secular growth in human resource services outsourcing, and strong brand and sales channels maintained by PAYX will keep the company chugging along.Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25-plus years of dividend data and 10-plus years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend.Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.PAYX's dividend payment appears to be very secure with a Safety Score of 81, even despite the company's relatively high payout ratio.Over the last four quarters, PAYX's dividend has consumed 80% of its earnings and 72% of its free cash flow. These payout ratios are on the higher side of dividend stocks we prefer to invest in and leave the company with less margin of safety and typically lower dividend growth rates. The business needs to be very stable and have a clean balance sheet to justify high payout ratios (PAYX does).Looking at longer-term trends in payout ratios provides additional perspective. As seen below, PAYX's payout ratios have increased from about 50% in 2005 to 70%-80% today. This means that dividend growth outpaced earnings growth, which is not sustainable. Overall, the company's higher payout ratios mean that future dividend growth will need to be driven by earnings growth.Source: Simply Safe DividendsSource: Simply Safe DividendsWhile PAYX's payout ratios are higher than we like, the business is very stable. During the financial crisis, we can see that the company's sales actually grew by 1% in 2009 and only fell by 4% in 2010. The stock also outperformed the S&P 500 by 12% in 2008. Business customers lay off employees during tough economic times, but they still require PAYX's mission-critical services.Source: Simply Safe DividendsSince PAYX primarily delivers its services over the internet, it operates with low fixed cost. The company's scale leverages these costs and allows PAYX to earn very strong returns on invested capital - signs of an economic moat.Source: Simply Safe DividendsNot surprisingly, PAYX throws off substantial free cash flow each year. With a client retention rate in excess of 80%, the company has great visibility.Source: Simply Safe DividendsFinally, PAYX's balance sheet is in excellent condition. The company has no debt and over $900 million in cash and investments. The company has plenty of flexibility to acquire complementary products, return more cash to shareholders, and reinvest for growth.All things considered, PAYX's 3.6% dividend yield appears to be very safe. While the company's payout ratio is higher than we like to see, this risk is mitigated by PAYX's predictable cash flows and pristine balance sheet.Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question, ""how fast is the dividend likely to grow?"" It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher are very good, and 25 or lower are considered weak.PAYX's dividend Growth Score is 65, suggesting that the company's dividend growth potential is above average. PAYX has paid uninterrupted dividends since 1988 and compounded its dividend at a mid-single digit pace over recent time periods.Source: Simply Safe DividendsSince the company's payout ratios are relatively high (70-80%), we believe future dividend growth will align with earnings growth somewhere in the mid- to high-single digit range. PAYX also has the balance sheet (no debt) to continue growing its dividend regardless of economic conditions.PAYX held its dividend flat during the financial crisis but has otherwise increased its dividend each year since the mid-1990s. While it's not close to being a member of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index, it sure has been a reliable dividend payer.ValuationPAYX trades at 23x forward earnings (22x excluding net cash) and offers a dividend yield of 3.6%, which is in line with its five-year average dividend yield of 3.5%.With 6-9% earnings growth potential, the stock could deliver a total return between 9% and 12% per year going forward. While it's not a bargain, PAYX's high quality and consistent fundamentals make it appear to be trading at a reasonable price today.ConclusionPAYX is a sticky, time-tested business that provides mission-critical services for its customers. It shares many traits with some of our favorite blue chip dividend stocks and has an extremely reliable dividend. While we will continue monitoring the competitive landscape, we expect PAYX's strong brand, deep sales channels, broad product portfolio, regulatory expertise, switching costs and flexible balance sheet will keep the company relevant for many years to come."
3741616,92086,2015-12-08T13:44:06-05:00,"Paychex is a rare company with high profit margins and a strong dividend in the HR space.As the employment market continues to improve, Paychex continues to benefit.Outperforming the market by 15% this year, the stock has more room to run.","Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a relatively unknown company that provides HR solutions to small and medium sized businesses such as check payment processing. PAYX has had a good run this year as the stock produced a 17% total return including the dividend. The recent jobs report that posted better than expected growth figures and led to a major market-wide surge on Friday is yet another sign that the overall economy is doing well, especially the employment market.As a company that provides HR services, PAYX benefits directly from higher levels of employment as they have to process more payroll checks. Going into 2016, the company is well positioned to outperform the market indexes, not only because of the strengthening state of the job market but because PAYX has excellent fundamentals as well.The company has strong profit margins of 25% and a very high ROE of 39.86%. This shows that PAYX is both operating efficiently and producing strong cash flow for shareholders. This cash flow is important since the company also pays a decent dividend of 3.13%. In addition to these very nice figures, the company is showing strong growth. For the recently reported Q3 earnings, the company posted 22% YoY quarterly earnings growth and 8.4% revenue growth, both great numbers to go along with the other strong fundamentals of the company. It's rather rare for a company to be growing so well while also paying such a strong dividend. Of course, the question now is valuation.Currently, PAYX is trading at 24 times forward earnings, which makes the stock look fairly priced since the multiple represents a bit of a premium compared to the average P/E of the S&P 500 of 19. But for a company with high margins, top and bottom line growth, a good dividend, and in an industry that is on trend, I see more multiple expansion going into 2016. As uncertainty and volatility are increasing and many experts predict more market stagnation going into the New Year, a stock like PAYX begins to look very attractive.Another good sign for the stock is that management and insiders own 10.77% of the company's outstanding shares. This is a relatively high amount of the float to be owned by insiders, which is usually an indicator that management's interests are well aligned with those of the average shareholder. While it seems like this would always be the case, it actually isn't because many boards and CEOs get paid very high salaries and don't necessarily own large amounts of the company's stock, which often times means they don't care as much as you would think about rewarding shareholders and engaging in investor friendly management.Of course, there are risks whenever a business is trading at a premium, even if that premium is well deserved. While PAYX has been performing well, there is quite a bit of competition in the industry, which this chart clearly shows. As you can see, Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) is the leader with almost triple the market cap of PAYX. But you can also see when comparing their statistics that PAYX is growing the top line at a faster rate than ADP and has better gross margins as well. I also like the position that the company is in because there is a lot more room to grow when you only have a $19 billion market cap compared to $55 billion for ADP.On the whole, PAYX looks to be in an excellent position going into 2016 for a variety of reasons. When you add up the very strong fundamentals from above, with their position in the HR industry and as a dividend payer, I don't see too many stocks that can match these characteristics in the market right now. The main question is the current price and while I already mentioned above that I think the stock warrants more multiple expansion, it is worth it to remember other stocks trading at much higher multiples that are growing at slower rates or with lower margins than PAYX such as Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Disney (NYSE:DIS), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to name a few.That being said, I would wait until the company reports earnings on December 22nd before opening a position. They are expected to report EPS of $0.51 compared to $0.47 for the same period last year. If they beat on earnings, I expect the stock to rally, and if they miss, I wouldn't be surprised if it fell sharply considering the P/E expansion that the stock has already undergone as discussed above. But on the whole, this is a good business that should perform well over the next several quarters, as the employment market continues to strengthen."
3562886,60091,2015-10-10T15:48:40-04:00,Paychex has been able to increase its dividend at a 10% annualized CAGR rate for the past decade.The current dividend payment is more than covered by FCF and future FCF. Paychex is a cash generating machine.The business model is simple in which revenues are recurring and predictable.,"Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a company that dividend investors should be aware of. The company has a very simple business model (a payroll processing king with HR, retirement and insurance as well), with a very strong balance sheet, zero debt, and high FCF. Since 2005, the company has increased its dividend by $0.16/share to the current $0.42/share. Based on my recent analysis, I am expecting the dividend to continue increasing incrementally along with the company's FCF. Thus this article will be dedicated to PAYX's FCF and dividend.Investors who are interested in learning more about PAYX aside from the dividend and FCF should read these great Seeking Alpha articles here, here and here.Source: Shop.RemaxFree Cash Flow Analysis(All numbers in millions except for per share items)In the past three years, PAYX has been able to grow its revenues at a 5.60% annualized CAGR rate. These are not the best growth rates but for a company with a market cap of >$17 billion, it really is not that bad. If we jump to earnings, we can see that they have grown at a 5.85% annualized CAGR rate. Thus PAYX has done a good job at growing their top line without hindering bottom line growth (vice versa). Due to the prudence of management, I am expecting the top and bottom line to continue growing at similar rates.What I find interesting is that cash operating costs to revenues in the past three years has equaled 67%. Usually when I research companies, I find that cash operating costs to revenues are sporadic. They are either lowering as time goes on, increasing, or they are all over the place. PAYX was the first company that I have looked into thus far when it has been a steady 67% for the past three years. The simplicity of their business model and economies of scale is the main reason why their operating expenses have not really increased.What interests me about PAYX is their cash generating ability and decent dividend yield (more on the yield later). PAYX has been able to generate a decent amount of FCF in the past three years (and pretty much throughout its history). If you compare PAYX's FCFPS with its EPS, you can see that PAYX actually has been generating higher FCFPS than its counterpart EPS. This suggests an undervaluation in the share price. I have provided a forward view of PAYX's FCF for the fiscal year of 2016 below.(All numbers in millions except for per share items)As you can see, FCF is expected to continue growing, finishing off 2015. I am expecting it to grow going into 2017-2018 as well. This is due to the economies of scale that PAYX controls. For an example, once a customer signs up for PAYX's system, the likelihood of them switching payment providers is nil. This is because the switching of payment providers is very costly, can become a headache, and a lag in the payment system can upset employees (if they don't get paid due to the payment system being down). Thus because of the former, PAYX has very predictable revenue generation that will most likely not deplete going forward.I have provided the steps I took to get the forward FCF below.Step 1: The first thing I did was go to Yahoo Finance and obtain the Street consensus of expected revenues for 2015.Step 2: I found the operating cash flow. To get this, we first need to estimate OCFM for 2015. Since 2014's OCFM was 32%, I just used 32% as my projected OCFM. Multiplying revenues by 0.32 (OCFM), I obtained the operating cash flow.Step 3: Finding cash operating costs is done by subtracting operating cash flow from revenues.Step 4: Change in working capital is found by taking the net as percent of revenue from 2014 and multiplying it by projected revenues for 2015 and subtracting net receivables, inventories and payables from 2014.Step 5: I estimated capex will be ~$100mm for 2016 based off of historical capex numbers.Step 6: FCF = Operating Cash Flow - Change in working Capital - Capex.Step 7: FCFPS = FCF/Weighted Avg. Shares DilutedThe DividendIn the past 10 years, PAYX has been able to increase its dividend at a 10.13% annualized CAGR rate. This is a very impressive dividend growth rate. Not only have they been able to increase their divided at a solid rate, but they have returned shareholders a decent amount as well in terms of capital gains.Note: If you bought in the depths of 2009, you would have realized a ~160% gain (depending on where you bought), which equates out to a ~32% annualized gain. Remember this is not counting dividends.In 2015, 2014 and 2013, PAYX paid out $551.8mm, $510.6mm and $476.7mm in dividends, respectively. If you take a look at the company's FCF generation for the periods of 2015, 2014 and 2013, you can see that FCF outstrips the current dividend payout. PAYX's forward FCF will continue to pay the dividend going forward.What about the Overvaluation?PAYX is not a cheap stock to buy. It currently sells for 14.26x EV/EBITDA and sports a high 25 P/E ratio. Thus deep value investors should avoid this name. However, dividend investors or long-term investors looking for income may choose to overlook the overvaluation. If you have a time horizon of >10 years, buying PAYX at its current valuation may make sense (depending on your financial goals). If you are looking for an investment that pays a sustainable yield, with even more potential to increase that yield going forward, PAYX may be a good fit for your portfolio.If I was looking for a company like PAYX, I would start off buying in small amount (dripping the dividend as I went). When the market is pessimistic, I would buy on the dips. If there ended up being a decent correction in the stock price (>20%), I would end up buying into PAYX in heavy amounts. Finally, I would continue to keep a long-term horizon in my eyes, holding PAYX as long as its business continues to perform as I have expected it to. If anyone wants any advice going forward, feel free to reach out to me.In ConclusionIf you are looking for a stable income, you may want to look into investing in PAYX. As I stated before, the company is trading for a decent premium (there is a risk with investing in an overvalued security). The overvaluation can be warranted though since PAYX's revenues are predictable, recurring and growing. The company is a cash generating machine with potential to incrementally increase its dividend going forward (remember the company has increased its dividend >10% annually, for the past 10 years). PAYX is a good company to hold if you are looking for stable increasing income. Thus retirees and income investors should invest or continue watching this name (looking for a better entry level). I would be very surprised if PAYX was not around in 10-plus years.Happy investing and good luck!"
3302255,63483,2015-07-04T10:34:32-04:00,"Robust Q4 performance.New offerings are beginning to gain traction and should see widespread adoption over time.Pricing power should remain resilient going forward, augmenting margin expansion.Eventual rate hike would result in a nice boost to operating results.I remain bullish on Paychex.","Earnings ReviewPaychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) recently reported robust Q4 FY15 performance. The company's new offerings are beginning to gain traction and should see widespread adoption over time. Due to its impressive customer retention rates, I submit that pricing power should remain resilient going forward, which would augment further margin expansion. The eventual rate hike would lead to a nice boost to operating results. All in all, I remain bullish on Paychex.Robust Q4 performanceThe top-line grew to $692m (+8% Y/Y) during the fourth quarter, with HRS leading the charge (+16% Y/Y). Margins continue to see slight expansion, with operating income increasing to $252m (+10% Y/Y). As for the bottom line, diluted GAAP EPS rose to $0.44 (+10% Y/Y), aided by the firm's relentless share buybacks. In terms of analyst estimates, the company met expectations.New offerings are beginning to gain traction and should see widespread adoption over timeIn my prior article on PAYX, I highlighted two of the company's new offerings - Paychex Flex and its ACA offering. As a quick reminder, Paychex Flex is essentially a HR SaaS solution while the ACA offering aids insurers to comply with new rules. Management offered some color on the matter during the recent earnings call:The company also made further improvements to enhance Flex's value proposition. Flex now enables clients to simplify the recruiting process by automating certain key functions (job opening, posting and administration). Couple this improved functionality with the fact that the SaaS HRM market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 16.3% over the 2013-2018 period, according to research, I'm confident that Flex will see widespread adoption over time. The company also continues to add to its sales force, growing personnel by 3% during the quarter, which bodes well for future top-line growth.Management had this to say regarding their ACA offering:Not only does management cite an increase in sales, but they also highlight the current low penetration figures. In other words, the market remains largely untapped. With increased regulatory pressure such as the imposition of penalties and growing requirements under the ACA, the company's offering should begin to look very attractive going into FY2016. I think the regulatory environment will only get tougher from here on out and it should act as a nice tailwind for the company's ACA offering in the near term.Pricing power should remain resilient going forward, augmenting margin expansionDuring the quarter, management highlighted that they increased net prices by about 2-4% while posting about 2% client growth. I believe this is a manifestation of the company's sticky relationships with its clients. Payroll, HR and its related segments remain a mission-critical part of running a business, hence these sticky relationships are likely here to stay.Furthermore, evident from the continued roll-out of enhancements to existing offerings, Paychex is clearly focused on client service. This practice is likely to continue and should result in greater customer switching costs over time, allowing pricing power to remain resilient going forward. Hence, I posit that further margin expansion is very possible in the future.Eventual rate hike would result in a nice boost to operating resultsOne part of PAYX's business model is holding funds for its clients before they are paid out. PAYX invests funds primarily in high-quality municipal bonds. In the past few weeks, interest rates have been edging upwards, which allowed the company to realize higher investment income. Many prominent economists and commentators have opined that a rate hike should occur sometime in 2016. Regardless, the Fed has to raise rates eventually, which should provide a nice boost to the firm's interest and investment income.I remain bullish on PaychexPAYX had a strong Q4 that was in-line with my expectations (detailed in my previous article linked above). The company continues to display a client-centric focus, evident from the continuous rolling out of additional enhancements to their existing offerings. Not only does this improve client retention, it also allows the company to retain a significant degree of pricing power, which bodes well from margin expansion. My investment thesis remains unchanged, and I continue to recommend a long position in Paychex."

(NASDAQ:PAYX) is slated to announce Q4 and FY15 earnings Wednesday, July 1, before market opens. The Street is looking for an EPS of $0.44 on revenues of $690.53 million.PAYX has had an extremely successful growth story in the recent fiscal years. As you can see, in the past 5 fiscal years, we have seen large revenue growth in PAYX's largest segments: payroll and human resource services.We believe these trends are attributable to their cutting edge technology, product enhancement investments, and dedication to customer satisfaction/retention.Given large increases in their HRS segment, we wanted to see if and how their business was evolving. As you can see, their payroll service segment has been taking a smaller portion of their total revenue in more recent years, while HRS is growing steadily. The factors that contribute to the increased HRS growth are outsourcing to alternate worksites, as well as a newly hired batch of sales reps who fill the company's capacity - allowing for a more effective workforce contributing to top-line growth.In addition, two new innovative technological investments have made it easy for PAYX's clients to utilize their services intuitively. The first is their new mobile application for smartphones and tablets. The application has contributed to an increase in client base and retention while boosting overall client satisfaction from Q1 FY15 to Q3 FY15. The second innovation is the implementation of Paychex Flex, an HR management software designed to enable managers to have attendance, time, and many other features available on the same system as the standard payroll. Also, the acquisition of NETtime solutions has allowed for simple and streamlined software applications for their new systems. These strategic investments are positioning PAYX well for long-term success.In regards to their bottom-line, we wanted to investigate how their shares outstanding have changed in recent years. This chart above illustrates their shares outstanding (in $M). As is evident, there was a large increase in shares outstanding from FY11-FY13, but since then the number of shares has decreased. We expect it to decrease further. The initial decrease from FY13 is due to a $70M repurchase of 1.7M shares ending in February 28, 2015. Looking forward, management has announced a share buyback program of up to $350M through May 31, 2017. These buybacks will improve the bottom-line, and they illustrate that PAYX is financially healthy enough to invest in themselves.In sum, we have projected a Q4 EPS of .44, in-line with EPS estimates, and a Q4 revenue of $703M, beating revenue estimates."
3731896,24491,2015-12-03T15:04:09-05:00,"Paychex has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage.Paychexâs business model is heavily reliant on both its payroll service and human resources services revenues, both of which contribute to the firm's strong margins.Paychex has returned over 80% net income to its shareholders in the form of dividends paid in recent years.Let's walk through some of Paychex's important investment considerations and uncover the drivers behind its Dividend Cushion ratio.","Retirees know that a dividend cut could be disastrous to their income portfolio as future income is not only reduced but it's also very likely that capital is permanently impaired. The Dividend Cushion ratio is designed to provide the income investor with a trusted and independent opinion of the safety and future growth potential of a firm's dividend. It not only has shown to predict dividend cuts, but the ""cushion"" behind the Dividend Cushion reveals just how much capacity a firm has to continue growing its dividend into the future.Technically speaking, the Dividend Cushion ratio considers the firm's net cash on its balance sheet (cash less debt) and adds that to its forecasted future free cash flows (cash from operations less capital expenditures) and divides that sum by the firm's future expected cash dividend payments over a discrete five-year period. At its core, it tells retirees whether the prized stock in their income portfolio has enough cash to pay out its dividends in the future while considering its debt load. If a firm has a Dividend Cushion ratio above 1, it can cover its dividend, in our view, but if it falls below 1, trouble may be on the horizon.Let's take a walk through an assessment of Paychex's (NASDAQ:PAYX) dividend health in this article.Key Investment Considerationsâ¢ Paychex's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation and ValueRisk ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.â¢ Paychex is a leader in the payroll, human resource and benefits outsourcing industry. With a wide range of services - including payroll processing, retirement services, insurance and a fully outsourced human resource solution - Paychex customizes its offering to the clients' business.â¢ Paychex has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 28.2% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter. These two factors give the firm incredible financial flexibility moving forward. The excess cash makes it a candidate for acquisitions or continued dividend growth.â¢ Paychex has two primary revenue sources: Payroll (67% of sales) and Human Resource Services (~33%). Its payroll services target small businesses with 1-50 employees and mid-market businesses with 50-1,000 employees. Its HRS is a leader in complimentary services sold to payroll clients (retirement, insurance and HR).â¢ Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, Paychex is expecting total service revenue growth of 7%-8% and net income growth between 8%-9%. Operating margin net of certain items is anticipated to be ~38%. Our forecasts are on the generous side for the year.Note: Paychex's dividend yield is above average, offering a 3.1% annual yield at recent price levels. We generally prefer yields above 3%, and we're strongly considering the company for an addition to the Dividend Growth Newsletter portfolio.Dividend StrengthsPaychex's business model is heavily reliant on both its payroll service and human resources services revenues, both of which contribute to the firm's strong margins. Paychex has returned over 80% of net income to its shareholders in the form of dividends paid in recent years. With tremendous balance sheet strength and strong free cash flow generation, Paychex is in an enviable position to grow its dividend and continue returning a large percentage of net income to shareholders in the form of dividends paid.Dividend WeaknessesAccording to its long-term capital strategy, Paychex plans to deploy its free cash flow through dividend payments, organic growth investments, strategic and accretive acquisitions, and share repurchases. The company currently has a stock repurchase plan which authorizes share repurchases up to $350 million through May 2017, which should not have an impact on its dividend growth given its strong balance sheet and free cash flow generating ability. We expect management to continue its history of allocating over 80% of net income to its dividend payout going forward.From the Comments Section: How to Interpret the Dividend Cushion Ratio - A Ranking of RiskA question comes up a lot in the comments section regarding why we use a five-year discrete forecast period. In short, we think it's a great way to rank dividend risk across companies, combining in one metric insight with respect to both leverage and liquidity analysis.As for how to interpret the Dividend Cushion ratio itself, it's a measure of financial risk to the dividend, much like a credit rating is a measure of the default risk of the entity, for example. Said differently, a poor Dividend Cushion ratio of below 1 or negative doesn't imply the company will cut the dividend tomorrow, no more than a junk credit rating implies a company will default tomorrow. That said, the Dividend Cushion ratio does punish companies for outsize debt loads because in times of adverse conditions entities often need to shore up cash and that means the dividend becomes increasingly more risky.We think investors should look at a variety of different metrics in assessing the sustainability of the dividend. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is systematically applied across our coverage, it can be used to compare entities on an apples-to-apples basis. Dividend payers with significant free cash flow generation and substantial net cash on the balance sheet often register the highest Dividend Cushion ratios, as they should. These companies have substantial financial flexibility to keep raising the dividend.Dividend SafetyWe think the safety of Paychex's dividend is good. Please let us explain.First, we measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying dividends well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Dividend Cushion ratio, which we make available on our website. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing net cash a company has on hand (on its balance sheet) plus its expected future free cash flows (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected cash dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends and the expected growth in them.As income investors, however, we'd like to see a ratio much larger than 1 for a couple of reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. For Paychex, this ratio is 2.6, revealing that on its current path the firm should be able to cover its future dividends and growth in them with net cash on hand and future free cash flow.Dividend Cushion Ratio Cash Flow BridgeThe Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge, shown in the graph below, illustrates the components of the Dividend Cushion ratio and highlights in detail the many drivers behind it. Paychex's Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge reveals that the sum of the company's five-year cumulative free cash flow generation, as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital spending, plus its net cash/debt position on the balance sheet, as of the last fiscal year, is greater than the sum of the next five years of expected cash dividends paid.Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is forward-looking and captures the trajectory of the company's free cash flow generation and dividend growth, it reveals whether there will be a cash surplus or a cash shortfall at the end of the five-year period, taking into consideration the leverage on the balance sheet, a key source of risk. On a fundamental basis, we believe companies that have a strong net cash position on the balance sheet and are generating a significant amount of free cash flow are better able to pay and grow their dividend over time.Firms that are buried under a mountain of debt and do not sufficiently cover their dividend with free cash flow are more at risk of a dividend cut or a suspension of growth, all else equal, in our opinion. Generally speaking, the greater the ""blue bar"" to the right is in the positive, the more durable a company's dividend, and the greater the ""blue bar"" to the right is in the negative, the less durable a company's dividend.Dividend Cushion Ratio DeconstructionThe Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction, shown in the graph below, reveals the numerator and denominator of the Dividend Cushion ratio. At the core, the larger the numerator, or the healthier a company's balance sheet and future free cash flow generation, relative to the denominator, or a company's cash dividend obligations, the more durable the dividend. In the context of the Dividend Cushion ratio, Paychex's numerator is larger than its denominator suggesting strong dividend coverage in the future. The Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction image puts sources of free cash in the context of financial obligations next to expected cash dividend payments over the next five years on a side-by-side comparison. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio and many of its components are forward-looking, our dividend evaluation may change upon subsequent updates as future forecasts are altered to reflect new information.Please note that to arrive at the Dividend Cushion score, divide the numerator by the denominator in the graph below. The difference between the numerator and denominator is the firm's ""total cumulative five-year forecasted distributable excess cash after dividends paid, ex buybacks.""Dividend GrowthNow on to the potential growth of Paychex's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity the company has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. To do so, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in the past 10 years, the company has a nice dividend growth rate, and a solid Dividend Cushion ratio, we characterize its future potential dividend growth as excellent, which is the case for Paychex.Because capital preservation also is an important consideration to any income strategy, we use our estimate of the company's fair value range to assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss. In Paychex's case, we currently think shares are fairly valued, meaning the share price falls within our estimate of the fair value range, so the risk of capital loss is medium. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low. Please view our website for information regarding our valuation assumptions of Paychex.Wrapping Things UpThere is plenty to like about Paychex in both its operations and dividend growth potential. The customization of the company's offerings to each client's business is an important reason why it's able to maintain its position as a leader in the payroll, human resource and benefits outsourcing industry. We love the firm's pristine balance sheet and its impressive free cash flow generation, which are the main reasons it stands out to us as one of the better income plays on the market today. Paychex is currently on the watch list for our Dividend Growth Newsletter portfolio.FAQ from the Comments Section: How Do You Assign the Qualitative Assessment that Corresponds to the Dividend Cushion Ratio?The answer rests in the breakpoints, as defined below:Breakpoints: Dividend safety. We measure the safety of a firm's dividend by adding its net cash to our forecast of its future cash flows and divide that sum by our forecast of its future dividend payments. This process results in a ratio called the Dividend Cushion. Scale: Above 2.75 = EXCELLENT; Between 1.25 and 2.75 = GOOD; Between 0.5 and 1.25 = POOR; Below 0.5 = VERY POOR.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

(NASDAQ:PAYX) has generated solid earnings stability and dividend growth over the last ten years, traits that will attract many investors. However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here's an updated look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.PAYX data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - November 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryPAYX Dividend data by YChartsConclusionPaychex Inc. is suitable for the Enterprising Investor, but not the more conservative Defensive Investor, who is concerned with the low current ratio, insufficient earnings growth over the last ten years, as well as the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor, on the other hand, is only concerned by the low current ratio. As a result, the Enterprising Investor should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.42 in 2011 to only an estimated $1.66 for 2015. This demonstrated growth does not support the market's implied estimate of 10.15%. As a result, the ModernGraham valuation model returns an estimate of intrinsic value below the market price at this time, and the company appears to be overvalued by the market."
2992356,63483,2015-03-11T12:31:37-04:00,Positive outlook for the global payroll outsourcing market.Strong prospects for the global human resource outsourcing market.Record client retention levels and continued price increases will lead to a slight expansion in margins.DCF model indicates Paychex is slightly undervalued.,"Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) provides outsourcing solutions to small- and medium-sized businesses. These solutions can be largely classified into four categories - integrated payroll, human resource, insurance and benefits. The positive outlook for the global payroll outsourcing market, coupled with strong prospects for the global human resource outsourcing market will be key drivers of the company's top line. The company recently achieved record client retention levels despite continued price increases, signifying customer loyalty. I expect this to continue and hence the company will enjoy a slight expansion of margins.Positive outlook for global payroll outsourcing marketAccording to a PRNewswire press release, analysts forecast the global payroll outsourcing market to grow at a CAGR of 3.91% over the period of 2013-2018. This growth is mainly driven by businesses looking at their cost structures and finding ways to cut costs in order to maximize profit. Paychex provides small- to medium-sized businesses with payroll processing solutions that they require in order to maximize efficiency. The company's solutions allow clients to process employee payroll checks, accounting records, management reports, tax returns and payroll obligations. Given the comprehensive solutions that the company is able to provide to its clients, Paychex is in a prime position to capitalize on the growth in the global payroll outsourcing market.Strong prospects for the global human resource outsourcing marketAccording to another PRNewswire press release, TechNavio's analysts forecast the global human resources outsourcing market to grow at a CAGR of over 12% in the 2013-2018 period. Similar to the payroll outsourcing market, this growth is driven by business managers taking a hard look at their cost structures and deciding where they can reduce costs without sacrificing productivity. Like payroll, human resource is one aspect of businesses that can be outsourced. Paychex provides comprehensive HR outsourcing solutions allowing its clients to outsource their employer and employee administrative needs. Hence, the company is poised to benefit from the double-digit growth in global HR outsourcing market.Record client retention levels despite continued price increases will allow slight expansion in marginsIn recent years, the company has managed to slowly increase its client retention levels. In FY14, client retention levels reached record-highs, culminating at 82% that year, up from 81% the previous year. The company also revealed that it has increased the prices of its solutions year after year. Thus, it can be deduced that Paychex's clients are very loyal and that the company's solutions continue to add value to its clients. Given this, I expect client retention levels to continue creeping up in the near-term, and the company will enjoy a slight expansion in margins.ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, revenues are projected to grow 8% in FY15, slowing to a steady growth rate of 3% in FY19. The company has offered guidance in the 8% to 10% range, hence my assumptions are conservative to say the least. As a result of the continued price increases by the company, and its client seemingly unperturbed by those increases, I anticipate a slight expansion in margins. Thus, EBITDA margins are expected to grow from 43.2% in FY15, to 44% in FY19. Paychex has also guided capital expenditures within the range of $110m to $120m in this fiscal year, which I have incorporated in my model. The company currently trades at a 14.9x EV/LTM EBITDA multiple. Using this figure, along with a 9% discount rate, the model produces a fair value of $52 for Paychex, indicating that the company is slightly undervalued (7%). My outlook on the company is hence slightly bullish."
3370165,86636,2015-07-29T13:45:15-04:00,"Paychex is an incredibly solid company with may different factors contributing to its success.Y/Y revenues in payroll processing segment are slowing, but robust HR segment growth is the answer.The company's zero debt balance and high switching costs offer a competitive advantage against other payroll processors that target small/medium businesses.Management's proven execution ability and consistent dividend payments further bolster a bullish case for PAYX.","Anyone who has either owned or worked for a small/medium sized business has probably at least heard of Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX): the behemoth within the payroll processing space. Along with Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) and TriNet (NYSE:TNET), Paychex is considered one of the market leaders in the industry. With a name that resembles ""pay checks"", it's quite common for one to think of the company as solely a payroll processor. However, people are generally not aware that PAYX also offers HR, retirement, and insurance services as well.Along with the competitors mentioned above, Paychex creates a one-stop-shop of administrative services that millions of clients require on a weekly basis. Since the market is mostly fragmented past the few main competitors, these giants within the space receive the majority of the market share. So, if they do ultimately the same things, what makes Paychex stand out from ADP and TriNet? For a start, it's their target market. ADP's clients are generally huge companies with many employees like IBM (NYSE:IBM), Ford (NYSE:F), and Xerox (NYSE:XRX). For that reason, ADP is touted as the biggest in the industry. On the other side of the spectrum, Paychex targets small- to medium-sized businesses, of which there are over 28 million in the U.S. alone. TriNet's claim to fame is its HR services, not payroll.Businesses with payroll-intensive needs often stumble upon Paychex one way or another, and end up adding the other ancillary services. For those reasons, PAYX has effectively developed a niche for itself: small- to medium-sized businesses with a full spectrum of administrative needs. It's no doubt all three companies are incredibly well positioned for a bright future. With that being said, in our eyes, Paychex is special. We believe the company is a quality company with superior financial ability, solid managerial execution, favorable macroeconomic conditions, and potential to be a profitable long-term investment.IR homepage + Annual Reports and Proxy Statements can be found through the links provided.Basic Data(1) Proven ability to create consistently strong cash flows year after year. Paychex operates on a subscription-based business model with which a company can customize its subscription based on its needs. The services offered by the company include: payroll, tax services, 401(k)s and employee benefits, HR administration and compliance, and time and labor solutions. That being said, PAYX enjoys handsome revenues with relatively low associated cost of revenue. As shown in the following graph, Paychex's 10-year average gross profit % floats around a very attractive 70%.- In thousandsHistorical Income Statement ExcerptsThe source of Paychex's revenue is reportedly changing. Since 2005, Paychex cited nearly 100% of its revenues based on subscriptions of payroll service. However, according to its most recent investor presentation (as of May 31st, 2015), the company attributes roughly 39% of its yearly revenue to its growing HR service platformâ¦ but more on this later.Along with consistent revenues, Paychex reports growth in yearly net income, as well as EPS, as shown by the graph below. Consistent revenues, different sources of revenue, and annually increasing net income and EPS offer the kind of financial strength that one hopes for in any company.(2) Lack of short- and long-term debt. Paychex has zero debt in an industry where the average debt-to-equity ratio is 13.9x, which gives it a measurable advantage over competitors. With its Software-as-a-Service or ""SaaS"" business model, Paychex is capable of operating with a neutral balance of debt. SaaS companies typically do not accrue debt through their low capex-intensive natures; therefore they have a certain dimension of financial stability that many other companies cannot replicate. That being said, Paychex has the ability to keep a healthy current ratio (always at least 1).Because its business is Internet-based, PAYX operates with a low fixed cost structure while adding an important, but often overlooked advantage: customer convenience. Since the company is all Internet-based, clients have the ability to access the majority of Paychex's services 24/7. The accessibility is a huge competitive advantage against boutique firms that may not have an automated system or be able to offer one with twenty-four hour capabilities.Although this point about debt is quite straightforward, it is very crucial to the overall health of the company. After all, a safe company is often more desirable than a risky one.(3) Record client retention rates and high (tangible and intangible) associated switching costs. According to the 2013 annual report, Paychex reported an 81% level of client retention from its beginning client base; in its words, a ""record level of client retention."" Notably, in 2013, they also received the highest rates of client satisfaction in their history, which they, ""believe is a result of [their] focus on providing high-quality service to [their] customers utilizing leading-edge technology to maximize client retention."" The company notes its dedication to customer satisfaction and acknowledges that in the past it has received less-than-perfect reviews for some of its services.Paychex has a huge advantage that value investors should pay attention to: high switching costs. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has consistently profited from this simple concept since its start. In the face of switching payroll and HR services, a customer faces the burden of (1) learning how to use a completely new user interface, (2) switching all of the internal payroll processes (bank account routing numbers, employee accounts in which money is transferred to, etc.), and (3) the tangible cost of the new software/service from a local brick and mortar payroll service company. When the customer considers all of the tangible and intangible costs involved, they often find the hassle/costs of switching prohibitive.(4) High growth potential within its emerging HR segment. As shown in the pie charts above, Paychex's revenue streams are fundamentally changing y/y. Because it started out as a payroll outsourcing company, the company is often thought as a leader within only that space. However, we can see from the 2014 chart on the left to the 2015 chart on the right that its HR segment is starting to grow at a more robust rate than the already mature payroll processing segment.Macro Trends?The growth in the HR segment, coupled with the record high client retention rates, offers a new horizon for Paychex. It can also be speculated that with higher financial and healthcare related regulatory measures instituted by the Obama administration and the ""Affordable Care Act,"" Paychex has the potential to further increase its growth.The reasoning is as follows:With added regulation from the government in the financial and healthcare sectors, there is more of a hassle for small- to medium- size companies (which also happens to be the target market for Paychex) to operate in congruence with these regulations. Companies will most likely look to outsource these complexities because the opportunity cost of invoking the services of a company such as Paychex is much lower than that of hiring a team of experts. Large companies may opt to employ the latter strategy, as they have many more employees to worry about; however, companies with 1-1,000 employees will most likely seek a service to which they can outsource the looming headache that goes along with said regulations.Note: Companies with 50 or fewer employees will not be financially responsible for healthcare or healthcare-related costs of its employees.(5) A seasoned management team capable of maintaining attractive returns.Paychex's management team is dedicated to raising money for its stockholders. Over the history of the company, PAYX has consistently brought in impressive ROE, ROC, and FCF/S in good times and bad (including the 2008 recession)Paychex has:(6) Solid dividend payout rates on a quarterly basis. Paychex has paid cash dividends since 1988. Dividends are normally paid in August, November, February, and May. The company has been able to increase its cash dividend on a regular basis for the trailing 10+ years (disregarding the anomalous $0.66 payout in 12/2012). In 2013, dividends of $476.7 million were paid to stockholders, representing 84% of net income.In 2012, Paychex's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to $350 million of its common stock expiring on May 31st, 2014. The company reported the purchase total of $249.7 million of common stock (approx. 6.2 million shares) over the 2-year period. In May 2014, the board approved a new stock repurchase program that authorizes the purchase of up to $350 million of common stock (expires May 31st, 2017).(7) Fair valuation given its financial ability and opportunity for healthy growth. It is important to highlight one very important fact: Paychex has sustained incredible financial strength over its lifetime of existence. Revenues have risen nearly every year for the last 10 years while the margin has remained consistently within 3% of 70%. EPS has only decreased on an annual basis 2 out of the last 10 years while FCF/S has remained positive for all of those 10 years.Paychex is a premium company that is selling at a somewhat premium price, but the underlying value of the company lies in its consistency and growth potential. The company is predicting a great potential for growth in its HR segment. On top of the financial stability and upside potential, the current consistent dividend growth should be factored in as well. Stocks of this caliber should be included in portfolios in order to dilute risk. In a recession, a heavy dividend payer such as Paychex can offer some shelter as it has in the past (keeping its steady quarterly dividend of $0.31 throughout 2008 and the following few months). Should the company maintain its forward EPS growth and continually generate positive FCF yields, the management team should be able to create future value for its stockholders. In short, Paychex is a winner.To Recap:Paychex is a quality company with (1) a proven ability to create consistently strong cash flows year after year, (2) lack of short- and long-term debt, (3) record client retention rates and high (tangible and intangible) associated switching costs, (4) high growth potential within its emerging HR segment, (5) seasoned management team capable of maintaining attractive returns, (6) solid dividend payout rates on a quarterly basis, and (7) fair valuation given its financial ability and opportunity for healthy growth."

(NASDAQ:PAYX) is in a strong financial position, with no long-term debt on its books. In addition, some analysts believe the company will continue to improve its margins. The quarterly dividend is consistent, and the yield is fairly high. However, it is critical when analyzing Paychex to consider the company's intrinsic value in relation to its price.In fact, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether a company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here's a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.PAYX data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - February 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryPAYX Dividend data by YChartsConclusionPaychex passes the initial requirements of the Enterprising Investor but not of the more conservative Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio, the insufficient earnings growth over the last ten years, and the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor is only concerned by the low current ratio. As a result, all value investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has seen its EPSmg (normalized earnings) rise from $1.42 in 2011 to only an estimated $1.67 for 2015. This is a weak level of earnings growth, and does not support the market's implied estimate for 10.71% annual growth over the next 7-10 years.In fact, the recent earnings growth has averaged only 3.49% per year, so the market is expecting a very significant shift in earnings in order to justify the current price. The ModernGraham valuation model returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling below the market's price, indicating that the company is overvalued at the present time."

        The stock is breaking out to new 52-week highs.
        Technicals indicate a price target near 55.00.","Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) has a lot going for it. This commercial services company recently expanded its outsourcing capability with three notable value-adds:In addition, their client retention level is 82% (an all-time high), their quarterly dividend has tripled since 2005, and their previous quarter earnings were up 9% while revenue grew 10% (the best in over four years).More importantly, last week, PAYX broke through overhead resistance to new 52-week highs. The move comes after an 11-week price consolidation. Corrections take place in one of two ways - through price (declines) or through time (sideways price consolidation). Of the two, a correction through time is the most powerful. This bullish continuation pattern in PAYX has formed within an uptrend (note the upward price channel on the weekly chart below). In addition, last week's breakout took place after a previous breakout from a bullish cup formation (see rounded line on weekly chart below) that took 45 weeks to form. That is a real nice base. Technicians know, ""the longer the base, the higher the space.""What's great about price patterns is that our risk and rewards are well defined. In this case, our reward target is 55ish, a 14% gain. And we can choose one of two stop loss levels to manage risk - either 47.00 (below previous weekly resistance now turned support) or tighter at 47.50 (a logical support level on a daily basis).We have our entry (right now), our stop loss, and our target. We don't enter a trade without an exit plan. So we have our game plan and will enter this trade because of the robust risk/reward opportunity. If we get stopped out, we don't care.

It pays an above-average dividend (which it has consistently increased), has a pristine balance sheet and generates impressive returns on its invested capital. In many ways, the DRAG framework was created to find companies just like Paychex. However, the stock is currently trading a price not seen since the year 2000, equal to nearly 24 times projected forward earnings. This article examines Paychex to determine whether a technology stock expected to achieve earnings growth of less than 10% per year can possibly be undervalued trading at such a premium multiple.Please click here to read my article which outlines the DRAG analysis framework in more detail.To summarize, the four variables used in a DRAG (dividend and risk-adjusted growth) analysis are as follows (each company is ranked from 0 to 3 in each category): 1) How cyclical is the industry in which Paychex operates? 2) How strong is Paychex's competitive position within this industry? 3) How risky is Paychex's balance sheet? 4) What is Paychex's dividend yield and dividend growth history?The premise is that a company that operates in a non-cyclical industry, with a strong competitive position and a clean balance sheet that pays an attractive dividend, should trade at a higher earnings multiple than a company without these attributes, even if the lower-quality company has higher projected future earnings growth. After adjusting for these variables, it becomes easier to compare companies in different sectors, with different levels of future growth potential.Paychex DRAG Analysis:Over the past decade, Paychex has delivered remarkably consistent results. While the firm's earnings declined slightly in both its fiscal 2009 and 2010, it remained highly profitable in both of these years. With a beta of 0.83 during the last 12 months, the stock's volatility is similarly to comparable companies in the information services industry, according to this academic research website. Intuitively, Paychex's below-average cyclicality makes perfect sense, as its services are required in all economic conditions. The company's results during the last ten years speak for themselves - it seems clear that the payroll and employee services sub-sector is one of the least cyclical industries in which one can invest.Paychex is essentially part of a duopoly in the payroll services industry with Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). However, Paychex's margins and efficiency ratios blow ADP's out of the water. Paychex's ability to consistently generate an above-average return on its capital is particularly noteworthy. The firm has averaged a return on invested capital of more than 34% during the last decade, and its ROIC has not fallen below 34% since 2007. These results speak to the firm's strong competitive position as one of only two key players in its industry. This sustainable competitive advantage is worthy of a near-perfect score in this section of the DRAG analysis.With no long- or short-term debt outstanding, Paychex's balance sheet is flawless. Although the majority of the firm's $4.6 billion cash balance is required to fund its oversized accounts payable balance, investors should have absolutely no concerns about its financial position. Paychex has always maintained a debt-free balance sheet, further reducing the level of cyclicality in the company's results and risk to shareholders.Paychex offers investors an above-average dividend yield, and has paid out more than 80% of its net income to shareholders in every year since 2009. While recent dividend growth has been only modest, income investors should be fairly pleased with a yield of over 3% and the potential for further payout increases over the coming years. And while the firm's payout ratio based on earnings is undoubtedly elevated, it has a history of generating higher free cash flow than net income. Conservative income investors should highlight Paychex as a solid candidate for inclusion in their portfolios.At the present time, Paychex's share price is $47.35. So in this case, the DRAG framework seems to perform admirably. Although this stock trades at nearly 24 times projected forward earnings, while lacking a double-digit earnings growth outlook, the above analysis demonstrates why this premium multiple is completely justified. Paychex maintains a strong competitive position in a non-cyclical industry, possesses a debt-free balance sheet and pays an above-average dividend. Each of these attributes makes the company more valuable to investors. And while Paychex shares are not likely to rise significantly during the coming year, they offer income investors a compelling dividend with less operational or financial risk than the majority of publicly traded American corporations."

On December 19th, they reported Q2 EPS of $0.47 per share vs. the Wall Street consensus estimate of $0.46 per share (9.3% year-over-year increase) and revenue of $676.3M vs. the $673.66M estimate (9.7% year-over-year increase). Both net income and operating income rose 9% to $173M and $270.2M, respectively.Paychex has two major revenue streams in the payroll service and human resource segments. In Q2 2015, payroll service revenue went up 4% to $411.2M. Revenue growth per check and an increasing client base led to the positive performance. The human resources segment represents just under 2/5th's of the business, but saw a 21% jump in revenues from Q2 FY14. A new health insurance offering for professional employer organization (PEO) clients is now already accounting for 7% of the segment's revenue. Retirement services plans and average fund holdings also helped attribute to the HRS quarterly revenue of $254.7M. Fiscal year to date HRS revenues are up 19% to $498.5M.On the flip side, expenses for Paychex continue to grow, rising 10% to $406.1M in the second quarter. Higher sales were of course a factor, but medical costs led to a 6% jump in compensation-related expenses. Costs from their new premium health insurance offering within their own PEO accounted for 4% of total expenses.One of the biggest positives about Paychex is that the company has $0 of short-term or long-term debt, absolutely none. Each quarter they have no problem generating positive free cash, normally in the neighborhood of $100M-$300M per quarter and $500M-$800M annually in recent years. This quarter they saw a 1% pop in cash flow from operations to $404.7M as working capital jumped to $59.9M, but is still relatively low. Cash and corporate investments was a healthy $927.5M at the end of November.By not having to pay large interest payments on long-term debt, Paychex is able to be a shareholder friendly company. Back in May, the board of directors approved a 3-year, $350M share repurchase program. Through the end of November they have bought back $52.5M worth of stock. This leaves about 6.3M shares left over the next 2.5 years at the current share price. Along with a steady buyback program, Paychex also pays out a nice 3.21% dividend. During July of this year they raised the quarterly payout by 9% to $0.38 from $0.35 per share.Paychex didn't change their stance on the outlook of FY15 from where they expected the year to play out back in the summer. Human resource revenues are forecasted to increase 16%-19% and +3%-5% on the payroll services side of the business (net increase of 8%-10% for this year). For the year overall net income growth should be slightly lower from Q2 at 6%-8%.ValuationShares of PAYX trade at a P/E ratio of 23.57x (FY16 estimates ending in May 2016) with 8.6% EPS growth, price to sales ratio of 6.63x, and a price to book ratio of 9.56x. Top line growth of 8%+ this year and 7%+ for FY16 are likely to push annual revenue towards the $3B mark over the next two years. Using the mid-point of this year's EPS guidance ($1.87 per share) the stock does trade at a rich P/E ratio of 25.33x with high single/low double earnings growth. Historically the stock has traded at a P/E ratio of 22.69x. In the last five years, the highest valuation Paychex has traded at was 28.41x late last year.The valuation is a concern for the Wall Street firms that cover the stock too. There are 4 sell ratings, 3 hold ratings, and 3 buy/strong buy ratings with an average analyst price target of $43.10. Following the earnings release, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) kept their hold rating, but raised their price target to $46 from $42 and William Blair reaffirmed their outperform rating.Technical AnalysisPAYX shares rallied to breakout above the $44 resistance level in October and went on to hit $48.20 in early November. Since then the stock has pulled back some to retest the 10-week exponential moving average and is now poised to resume the rally if the stock can move above the bull flag, setting up for a run to the $50 level. Otherwise, if Paychex shares fail to breakout and instead break below the 10-week EMA, the stock could drop down to the prior resistance level at $44 turned current support.Unusual Options ActivityOn March 20th (data provided by LiveVolPro.com), someone purchased 8,500 Jan 2016 $50 calls for $1.30 each (currently trading at $1.60/$1.65). The $1.1M+ trade is a bullish bet that the stock will be above $51.30 on January 2016 options expiration. This is by far the largest open option position in all Paychex options (total open interest of 12,644 contracts). Total call open interest is 46,798 contracts vs. total put open interest of 17,261 contracts.Paychex is currently trading at a premium valuation, but solid earnings beats like they've seen in recent years on a quarterly basis could keep the multiple expansion going. The consistent dividend payouts and steady buyback program are also why investors have stuck behind the stock since the 2009 bottom and have been able to push shares above the dot com bubble highs of $42.66 last year. The demand recently for healthcare reform services (via the Affordable Care Act) has allowed Paychex to penetrate a growing market. An increasing labor market is another positive for the company as U.S. monthly non-farm payrolls has averaged +241K per month in 2014. A +5% U.S. GDP print for Q3 also shows the economic growth of the country, which likely leads to further job openings for small to medium sized businesses (where most job growth comes from). The sizable cash position could mean more acquisitions or investments into new services. They launched Paychex Flex, a streamliner of workforce management, in Q2 and bought Nettime Solutions, a time and attendance cloud data provider, early in the year.As noted above that the stretched valuation could come into play. A string of earnings misses, weak payroll and GDP data, or an overall market correction could result in a sizable drop in the stock, but the two-year weekly chart shows that buyers are likely to step in at the $44 level (not to mention management with their share repurchase program). The enormous holder of 8,500 Jan 2016 $50 calls shouldn't be understated either. They see at least 8% of upside over the next 13 months (11%+ for owners of the stock when factoring in dividends). For those more short-term oriented, you can look to trade the strong Q2 report by looking to trade the bull flag on a technical basis. While longer-term investors can consider a small long position via stock or Jan 2016 calls now and hope to add on a dip to $44 where the forward P/E ratio would be under 22x (below the 5-year average on a P/E ratio basis)."

2776595,74905,2014-12-24T13:11:50-05:00,"Paychex is a leader in payroll and human resource outsourcing for small- to medium-sized business.The company has paid a steady, growing dividend since 1989.With a high return on equity, no debt, and strong management, the company is a solid addition to any portfolio.","IntroductionPaychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a steady, strong company that any dividend investor should get familiar with. It is a leading provider of integrated payroll, human resource, insurance, and benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to mid-sized businesses. The company has a strong dividend, which it has maintained since 1989, and continues to grow its dividend at a relatively consistent rate. The dividend has remained stable through numerous recessions, and with well balanced revenue sources, the company seems as though it can survive any downturn in the economy. It maintains a high return on equity of 35%, has no debt, and maintains a strong cash flow. It has a strong management team with experience that has longevity with the company. It has shown the ability to continue growing at a steady pace, and looks like a good addition to any portfolio. I believe that PAYX is a good dividend investment for investors with an extremely long-term horizon - the type of company investors can buy and hold with reinvesting dividends for decades for phenomenal returns. As a note, all financial data in this article is taken from the most recent quarterly release and accompanying investor presentation, which can be found here.Bull ThesisPAYX derives 65% of its revenue from payroll outsourcing, with the rest coming from human resource outsourcing, which includes insurance and benefits packages for its clients. These are well-balanced revenue sources, and ensure the company won't be too badly damaged should one of its revenue sources suffer a setback. It targets small- to mid-sized businesses, with 1,000 employees or less. This is a niche market, and PAYX is the undisputed leader in this market with over half a million clients and 100 offices nationwide. It also recently introduced Paychex flex, a cloud based solution, that shows that this company is capable of evolving in ever-changing business environments. With strong cash flow, the recent financial presentation presents a few long-term initiatives to employ cash and increase shareholder value, including maintaining its dividend and a stock repurchase program through 2017. It also highlights strategic acquisitions as a major cash deployment strategy, and its past acquisitions have proven to be successful.Financially, the company continues to look strong. It expects to grow net income between 6% and 8% this year. It has maintained an extremely high return on equity of 35%, which means that management has focused its cash employment efforts on increasing shareholder value quite successfully. It also has no debt and maintains a strong cash flow. The company has extremely healthy financials, and should maintain steady growth into the near future. Its dividend history stretches back over 20 years, and the company has grown its dividend fairly consistently over that time. Starting at only $0.03 per quarter, it is now at $0.38. The ability to maintain its dividend over the long term, through numerous economic cycles, bodes well for the company's future.The management at PAYX is experienced and has longevity with the company. The CEO has been in place since 2010, and it has only had three CEOs over its 43-year operating history. The original founder, B. Thomas Golisano, is still a member of the board, and the company has continued his management style: fiscal responsibility, increasing shareholder value, and maintaining steady growth. This is a management team that gives me confidence in the company going forward, and I believe that investors can trust that this team will continue to increase shareholder value into the future.Conclusions & Red FlagsPAYX looks like a solid option for anyone looking to add a dividend stock to their portfolio. It maintains a steady growth rate, constantly increases the dividend, shows fiscal responsibility and has a strong balance sheet, and works hard to increase shareholder value. My biggest current concern with PAYX right now is pricing. According to Yahoo Finance, it has a relatively high PE rate of 27.03, with a PEG of 2.53. With such a high premium, many investors may want to wait for a pullback to invest. That being said, this is a long-term story and investors should buy the company with a decades long horizon. I recommend initiating a small position and buying more shares on pullbacks, with the intent to hold the company long term and reinvest the dividends quarterly."
3035956,63483,2015-03-29T05:01:20-04:00,"Paychex recently posted its Q3 2015 operating results.Payroll revenues grew at low single-digit growth rates, as expected.HR revenues grew at double-digit growth rates, as expected.Margin expansion still likely.Outlook remains bullish, updated projections.","Earnings ReviewPaychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) recently posted its Q3 2015 operating results. Total revenue increased by 9% from $1.87b to $2.04b, while net income increased 7% from $481m to $513m, for the first nine months of fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014.Payroll revenues grew at low single-digit growth rates, as expectedIn an earlier piece on Paychex, I alluded to the fact that as the global payroll outsourcing market was expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.91% throughout 2013-2018, the company would experience similar growth rates. This was due to the fact that corporate America as a whole was experiencing sluggish growth, hence companies are increasingly examining their cost structure and finding ways to streamline operations. The company delivered, with payroll revenues growing 4% from $1.204b to $1.247b. Going forward, I expect this low single-digit growth rate to continue, given that the underlying value proposition of the company's payroll offerings remains sound - companies can outsource their payroll needs to Paychex, and focus on operations. Furthermore, given the fact that the Fed has implied that a rate hike was in order in the near future, perhaps even as early as end-2015, I expect the pressure on corporations to reduce costs to intensify, driving demand for Paychex's offerings.HR revenues grew at double-digit growth rates, as expected.In my aforementioned piece on Paychex, I posited that HR revenues were likely to experience double-digit growth rates. This growth is driven by similar reasons compared to payroll outsourcing, albeit the fact that HR revenues should grow at a way faster rate compared to payrolls as there is generally more opportunities to cut costs in HR departments. Paychex outperformed my expectations, with its HR revenues growing 19% from $644m to $768m for the first nine months of fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014. Going forward, I expect the company to continue outperforming the broader HR outsourcing market, which is growing at a CAGR of 12%. My confidence stems from the fact that Paychex continues to introduce new HR offerings to its clients, which allows this outperformance. The company recently introduced Paychex Flex, which is essentially a SaaS HR offering, clearly capitalizing on the cloud computing trend. Furthermore, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the Affordable Care Act - Paychex has introduced a new full-service insurance offering that provides tremendous value to its clients by helping them navigate the minutiae of said legislation. Hence, I expect the company to continue to outperform the broader HR outsourcing market in the near-term.Margin expansion still likelyAlthough the company did not manage to achieve margin expansion - something that I thought was very likely in my previous article, I remain confident that Paychex can still achieve further operating efficiencies. This is due to the fact that the reason the company was not able to expand its profit margins in the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 was because it incurred additional expenses in order to bring its new healthcare offering to market. Digging through its quarterly report reveals that these expenses amounted to approximately 3% to 4% of revenues. Given the fact that Paychex's business model is highly scalable, these costs can be considered ""start-up"" costs that are unlikely to be recurring. Hence, if we exclude these costs, the company actually achieved slight margin expansion. Hence, I remain confident in the company's ability to achieve further margin expansion going forward. After all, the company's business model is one that requires heavy investment to bring a product or service to market, but once it is on market, the company would only incur a fraction of said costs to provide customer support and other aftermarket services.ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, I have adjusted my revenue projections higher. Initially, I expected revenues to grow at growth rates of 8% to 3% throughout the 5-year projection period. However, due to the fact that the company seems to be expanding its product offerings at a rapid pace, revenues should grow at a faster pace than before. Hence, revenues are now expected to grow at growth rates of 9% to 4% throughout the projection period. EBITDA margins are still projected to gradually increase to 44%, given the fact that the company's business model is one that is capital-light, and that it can continue to add new clients at incrementally lower cost. Since my last article, Paychex has traded at a higher multiple than the previous 14.7x EV/LTM EBITDA. The company now trades at 15.9x EV/LTM EBITDA, possibly due to the fact that it has shown to be able to gain market share, evident from the fact that its revenues - specifically HR revenues, has been growing at a pace faster than the broader market. Using this figure, along with a 9% discount rate, the model produces a fair value of $58 for Paychex, up from $52 as detailed in my prior article. My outlook on the company remains bullish - aggressive investors are advised to add on to their existing positions, or initiate a long position at current prices. Conservative investors would do well to wait for a significant pullback so as to increase their margin of safety before going long the stock."

Investors looking for more insight on small business hiring should reference the Paychex IHS Small Business Index.Regarding management's contribution to growth, the chief executive stated that the company has put several growth initiatives in place. These include expansion into new territories, increased referrals from banks and maintenance of strong CPA relationships.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

We believe that the weak U.S. job market during the quarter ended August 31 may have tempered Paychex's revenue growth in the first quarter. However, it should be able to post growth driven by an increase in its client base.Revisiting the previous quarterIn the fourth quarter fiscal year 2014, Paychex's revenue grew 9% year-on-year, to reach $639 million. This included the impact of change in Professional Employer Organization (PEO) direct cost adjustment. Excluding the impact of change in accounting for PEO direct costs, the total revenue in the fourth quarter increased 5% year-on-year. Growth in client base at Paychex's Payroll and Human Resource Service divisions contributed to the revenue growth. Paychex's operating income, the difference between its revenue and operating expense, grew 8% in the fourth quarter. Net income and earnings per share grew 18% due to the impact of an increase in provision for tax in the fourth quarter fiscal year 2013.During its fourth quarter earnings conference, Paychex provided a guidance of 8-10% growth in total service revenues for the fiscal year 2015. This guidance includes the impact of classification of PEO direct costs as operating expenses.U.S. job environment has been weak despite decline in unemployment ratioOver the three months ended August 31, 2014, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported unemployment ratios of 6.1%, 6.2% and 6.1%, suggesting a reduction in the number of people without a job. However, a deeper look at other numbers, such as job additions, employed-population ratio and participation rates, tell a different story altogether.The number of job additions during the quarter has been subject to many revisions. The June 2014 job additions were reported as 288,000 in the employment summary issued by the BLS in July. However, this was revised to 298,000 in August and then to 267,000 in September. Inconsistent revisions indicate either a weak market or unreliable reporting, both of which are unfavorable for companies like Paychex. The July 2014 job additions were revised marginally upwards from 209,000 to 212,000. The biggest hit came with the job additions for the month of August, which stood at 142,000, compared to the expectations of 225,000 additions. The disappointing August job additions had a negative impact on Paychex's stock price, which declined 0.85% during the week ending September 12, when the report was released.The employed population, which indicates the percentage of the total working age population that is employed, was static at 59% through the quarter ended August 31. This essentially shows that despite job additions, the overall employment in the country has not improved. The important question now is what has been driving the decline in the unemployment ratio? The answer is the increasing number of working age population that is leaving the labor force.The metric ""Not in labor force"" reported by the BLS in its employment summary indicates the number of people who are of working age but have chosen to drop out of the labor force, maybe because of the weak job environment. By the end of August 2014, the number of people who dropped out of the labor force increased 2% year-on year. This part of the population, though effectively unemployed, is not taken into account while calculating the unemployed rate since they are not actively seeking work. The unemployment rate only takes into account the unemployed population that is actively seeking work. Therefore, an increase in the ""Not in labor force"" population, reduces the numerator against which the unemployment rate is calculated, resulting in a smaller value which falsely indicates an improving job environment.The weak job additions and increasing number of people dropping out of the labor force is not a good sign for Paychex's checks per client metric, which indicates the average number of employees Paychex caters to for a client. Paychex generates incremental revenues with the addition of employees at its clients. Considering the sluggish U.S. job environment, we do not expect to see growth in Paychex's checks per client, which may lead to flat revenue growth for its payroll services. However, growth in client base, as seen in the previous fiscal, could bolster revenues.Increase in client base should drive Payroll and HR services revenuesAn increase in the number of clients could drive Paychex's revenues from its Payroll and HR services segments. In the fiscal year 2014, Paychex's Payroll revenue grew 4% driven by 2% increase in its number of payroll clients. Additionally, its HR services revenue increased 12% due to a 13% increase in the number of clients. The global HR outsourcing market is expected to grow at an average rate of 12.34% per year through 2018 due to increase in the number of companies outsourcing their payroll and HR functions in order to reduce costs and maximize efficiency. This should help increase Paychex's client base.Additionally, with the deadline of adherence to provisions of the Affordable Care Act approaching, adoption of Paychex's products catering to the Affordable Care Act should help increase its clients. Separate surveys conducted by Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) and Paychex revealed that only around half of the small, mid and large sized businesses in the U.S. are aware of the impact of the Affordable Care Act and are prepared for them. This leaves a huge market of potential clients who are looking for solutions that will help maintain compliance with the provisions.Disclosure: No positions"

This is best done by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries. What follows is a specific look at how Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.PAYX data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 2/28/2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryPAYX Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Paychex Inc. is suitable for the Enterprising Investor but not the Defensive Investor. The company's current ratio is too low while the PEmg and PB ratios are too high for the Defensive Investor. The Enterprising Investor is willing to accept the low current ratio, though, because the company holds no long-term debt. As a result, Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach based on Benjamin Graham's methods should feel comfortable proceeding with further research into the company as well as other opportunities, including a review of ModernGraham's valuation of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) and 5 Undervalued Companies for the Enterprising Investor. From the valuation side of things, the company appears overvalued after demonstrating very little growth in recent history. The company's EPSmg (normalized earnings) have only grown from $1.41 in 2010 to an estimated $1.56 for 2014. This low level of demonstrated growth does not support the market's current implied estimate of 9.17% earnings growth and leads the ModernGraham valuation model to return an estimate of intrinsic value that falls well below the market price.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Paychex Inc.

1958081,60091,2014-01-21T17:16:30-05:00,,"Investing can be a dangerous and yet rewarding occupation. An investor must make the right decisions on whether or not to invest in a security of a great business at a wrong price, or a great business at the right price. In this article, I will provide reasons why to invest in Paychex in the first portion of the writing. In the second part of this writing, I will provide reasons why not to invest in Paychex. Finally, at the end of the article, I will weigh the pros and the cons together and come to the concluding statement of if I would or would not invest in Paychex for the long haul.Company OverviewPaychex is a leading provider of payroll, human resource, insurance, and retirement benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses. As of May 31, 2013, they serviced approximately 570,000 clients, including approximately 2,000 clients through four offices in Germany. They maintain their corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York, and have more than 100 offices nationwide. Paychex was formed as a Delaware corporation in 1979.Strong Economic MoatAn economic moat is defined as: A way of describing the competitive edge of a company. This protection against competition can be in the form of a strong brand, the inability of customers to switch to a competitor, a cost advantage e.g., through economies of scale, or protection through such things as patents or government regulation. I believe that PAYX has an economic moat for the following reasons. Once PAYX starts providing payroll services to a company, that company will most likely not change their payroll provider to someone else. If PAYX is doing a great job at providing payroll to their customers, then the customers would have no incentive to switch providers. Switching payroll providers would be like everyone switching from using Microsoft software to Linux. People do not like change. Switching payroll providers can also be pretty risky and costly for small businesses to do as well. If a company switches payroll providers they have the chance of messing up payroll for the following weeks in advanced. Missing payroll will have a really negative effect on the employees who work for the small business.Growth in EarningsIn the past 10 years, PAYX has not had a single loss in earnings. Showing signs of continuous growth in EPS is a great sign for continuous optimistic growth. The historical past is not a 100% indication of what the future will look like, especially when it comes to security analysis, but it can help to tell what the future might look like. Using a compound annual growth rate (OTC:CAGR) formula, I have found that earnings have grown 7.62% each year. Looking at PAYX peers you can see that Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) and Insperity (NYSE:NSP) (As of 1/17/2014)are they only companies that have not had negative earnings in the past 10 years. For the record ADP's CAGR for the past 10 years is 8.53% and NSP's CAGR is 12%.(Diluted EPS)Cash Flow, Dividends, and DebtPAYX's majority revenue comes from recurring fees for services performed in the payroll processing. No single client of PAYX has a huge impact on their revenue as well. For example, Dean Foods (NYSE:DF) has 20% of their revenue coming from Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). If DF loses that contract they will be down 20% revenue. For fiscal 2013 PAYX clocked in 675.3 million in free cash flow. PAYX uses this cash to do the following; fund operations, capital investment purchases, business acquisitions, and finally dividend payments.PAYX pays a handsome 1.40 (annual) dividend. This equates out to a nice 3.20%. Dividends are 84% of net income or 466.7 million of 2013s net income. 84% of net income is quite a lot of income paid out to shareholders but, PAYX also has no long term debt at all on its balance sheet. Below you will find a graph that depicts how PAYX has performed as a whole compared to its peers, and the S&P 500.Back in 2008-2010 Paychex and the peer group that Paychex is in have outperformed the market as a whole. As of now Paychex is performing just as good as the market is, but the peer group has been making better stock returns overall. The graph shows a five-year comparison of the total cumulative returns of investing $100 on May 31, 2008, in Paychex common stock, the S&P 500 Index, and a Peer Group Index. All comparisons of stock price performance shown assume reinvestment of dividends.Huge Dividend Payout RatioPAYX pays out 84% of their net income in dividends. I believe that you really need a margin of safety, when looking at the dividend payments a company makes. 50% and below is a great margin of safety in my opinion. Is paying out an 84% of net income in a dividend, really sustainable in the long run? Earning may fluctuate, making an 84% payout ratio impossible to pay in the future. One can only speculate on how the earning may grow, and in my opinion 84% is not a conservative payout ratio. Finally dividends that are received are taxed as income and some long term investors may not want that.Bad Customer ReviewsThis is an actual review and it's just one of the many bad reviews that I found floating across the internet. The average review of PAYX on Yelp.com was 2 stars out of 5 total stars. Seeing how a lot of customers are disappointed with the service they have received from PAYX, makes me hesitant to put money into a business.OvervaluedPAYX has a nice free cash flow, they have been paying a dividend since 2004 which has increased in payout ratio by 192% overall, but they are also an overvalued company at the price that the market has given them at the moment. By having no debt, an astoundingly high net margin, and return on equity, you are not going to get this cash cow for cheap. I have provided a table of PAYX getting compared to its peer competitors below. As you can see PAYX has a higher P/B and PEG ratio than all of its peers. It also has a higher net margin and ROE as well which is a good thing, and may be why the price is high. I believe that this price is too high to buy PAYX at. There is not a good margin of safety in this security at the price the market sets for it as of right now.ConclusionFrom what I have learned from researching PAYX, is that this is an incredible business. There are many reasons why PAYX is an incredible business, but my favorite reasons are, having a higher net margin and ROE than all of their peers, not having a single loss in 10 years, a strong economic moat, and finally not a single penny of debt. This could be a company that you can buy and hold for many years without losing sleep at night. There are also some negative reasons why you might want to wait for Mr. Market to give you a better price. Obviously this is a very overvalued stock at the moment. Buying at a high price can be very dangerous for an investor. You may buy at a record high of a stock thinking the stock will go higher, and it might, or it might not. I will leave you now with a chart of the DJIA from 1928-1954. Remember this chart for it might save you from making irrational unintelligent decisions in the future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2523155,25120,2014-09-26T10:38:02-04:00,Paychex reports solid first quarter results.The outlook for the year looks decent as well.Appeal is limited despite a great track record and 3.5% dividend yield as valuation multiples are quite steep.,"Investors in Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) were very much pleased with the company's first quarter results, which showed notably healthy revenue growth.The solid first quarter earnings report was accompanied by a solid outlook for the rest of the year, comforting investors despite a premium valuation. The strong track record and very appealing 3.5% dividend yield is luring enough investors to avoid a meaningful pullback, although I would not chase the current momentum bandwagon to initiate a position.First Quarter HeadlinesPaychex posted first quarter revenues of $666.8 million, a 8.8% increase compared to the year before. Analysts anticipated a slightly less quick pace of revenue growth, forecasting sales of $662.6 million.Reported net income of $171.3 million rose by 5.2% versus last year, and despite the fact that earnings growth trailed topline sales growth, net margins remain impressive.Diluted earnings per share were up by three cents to $0.47 per share, thereby beating consensus estimates by a penny.Growth Driven By Human Resource ServicesOverall revenue growth was solid, driven by the human resource segment, where revenues were up by 17% to $243.8 million. Payroll service revenues rose by 4% to $412.8 million.CEO Marin Mucci was pleased with the results with sales growth driven by solid demand and good execution. The modest payroll service growth resulted from increased penetration and higher prices. Spectacular growth at the human resources business resulted from the minimum premium health care option being offered for PEO clients, the online SaaS solutions, and again a solid execution overall.The overall 9% revenue growth was decent, although margins were under pressure with operating expenses increasing by 12% overall. Consequently, operating margins fell by 1.5% points to a still impressive 40.1% of sales. Margin pressure was the result of greater investments in product development and technology, aimed at growth going forwards.ValuationPaychex holds an impressive $955 million in cash, equivalents and short- and long-term investments, while not having any debt outstanding. This results in a very comfortable net cash position.With some 365 million shares outstanding, and those shares trading at around $44 per share, equity of the business is valued at some $16 billion. This values operating assets at some $15 billion.On a trailing basis, Paychex has posted revenues of $2.6 billion while posting earnings of around $640 million. Consequently, operating assets are valued at about 5.8 times annual revenues and 23-24 times annual earnings.Steady Grower, Premium ValuationOver the past decade, Paychex has demonstrated steady growth in its operations, expanding the business from $1.4 billion in sales in 2005 to sales of $2.6 billion on a trailing basis. This cumulative 80% revenue growth translates into average growth of around 6% per annum, not bad given that the period included the severe financial crisis, of course.Earnings grew at a similar pace over this period as the company did manage to reduce the outstanding share base by some 5%, adding a little extra to reported earnings per share. Over the past quarter the company bought back just 0.9 million shares, although the company's board has authorized a $350 million repurchase program, which is sufficient to retire some 8 million shares, or 2%-3% of the outstanding share base.Diversified Player, Representing Small And Medium-Sized AmericaPaychex offers payroll, human resources, insurance and benefit outsourcing services to some 580,000 clients that are typically small- or mid-market players. The payroll business makes up roughly two-thirds of total sales, but grows relatively slower compared to the fast-growing human resources services segment.These trends are likely to continue, with the company guiding for overall revenue growth of about 8%-10% as net earnings are projected to be up by 6%-8% compared to last year.At the midpoint of the guidance, the outlook implies that full-year sales for 2015 are anticipated at around $2.75 billion, and as earnings are project5ed to be just above $670 million. Based on this outlook, shares trade at 22-23 times forward earnings.Final ThoughtsThere is a reason why Paychex trades at a premium multiple; actually, there are a few. The company is showing steady growth over time, resulting in predictable cash flows. But perhaps the biggest reason for the enthusiasm is the impressive dividend yield, with Paychex currently paying out a very appealing 3.5% dividend yield to its investors.Over the past decade, shares have traded in a relatively wide $20-$40 trading range, currently exchanging hands just above that range. Of course, the overall growing earnings, the general stock market gains and lower interest rates, which make the divided extra appealing, have all been drivers behind this momentum.As such, I remain cautious on the shares. The company is predictable in a good way, but the current valuation in combination with historical earnings growth leaves little potential for valuation multiple expansion. This is while the dividend yield acts a strong support for the shares.As such, I remain cautious and would hold on to any shares if I had any, but I would not jump the momentum bandwagon to pick up a position at current levels."
1527162,24233,2013-06-28T15:42:18-04:00,,"By Rani ChopraPaychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) shares pulled back Thursday after the company issued earnings which fell short of Wall Street's expectations along with a disappointing forecast for the full year. Earnings for the quarter missed the consensus forecast of 34 cents by 3 cents, coming in at just 31 cents per share. While revenue did rise by 6%, increased costs more than offset the impact of the revenue gain. Paychex went on to forecast revenue for the current year ending May 2014 to come in between $615 million and $620 million, while analysts had been predicting $621 million.After experiencing a steady rise through most of the year, Paychex dropped 5.92% by mid day Thursday before recovering slightly to close down 3.66% on the day.Could we have seen this drop coming? Where there signs?On May 15, Paychex experienced its highest close of the year at $38.65 representing a gain of over 20% year to date. Over the next few weeks, Paychex pulled back closing at $36.66 on June 5th before climbing once again into earnings.This earlier pull back may have been a bit of foreshadowing of things to come. Unexpected or abnormal price movements are often early warning signs of things to come. As negative information or updated analysis begins to hit the street, the ""Smart Money"" or the folks in the know often begin taking defensive action which can adversely impact the stock price. On June 13th, Paycheck triggered a SmartStops Risk Alert, a service which watches for abnormal price movements, placing it in the Elevated Risk State. There have been three follow on risk alerts issues since that initial alert and Paychex remains in the Elevated Risk State today.Source: SmartStops.netThe mid May pullback could have been read as a warning sign, but it also could have been a normal reaction to the recent run up perhaps being a little too far a little too soon. Regardless, to protect your gains while remaining in the game, it may be a good time to deploy stops or purchase protection by buying puts. Risk fluctuates over time, and it appears that the risk is higher than normal right now for Paychex.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1774842,45881,2013-10-25T14:17:55-04:00,,"Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) provides outsourced payroll and human resources services to small and medium size businesses in the United States. PAYX also has operations in Germany and Brazil, but these are currently insignificant (although offer potential future growth). PAYX offer a variety of different products / services designed to reduce the customer's administrative overhead. This overhead can be a significant drain on the growth of small businesses and on the profitability of all businesses so there is a clear market need.PAYX operate on a service model - clients pay every month for the services they subscribe to. Subscription based businesses usually have more predictable revenue streams than business that only generate up-front revenue. Subscription based software businesses are particularly appealing as it is time-consuming and expensive to change software providers (especially when it is for something as important as making sure your employees are paid on time). Obviously you should look for businesses that retain customers positively (by offering a good service) but it is nice to have a negative backup (customers want to avoid the pain of changing).PAYX is the second largest payroll processor in the US behind Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). Both firms have approximately 10% market share in payroll processing (estimate based on the firms' publicly reported client numbers and census data for the number of firms with employees in 2004). The only other national competitor for outsourced payroll is Ceridian (a private company) who appear to have about 2% of the market. PAYX therefore gain the benefits of being a market leader while still having expansion possibilities. ADP's focus is more on medium and larger companies, leaving PAYX facing only small (local payroll processors) and or non-specialized (bookkeepers / accountants) competition.Less than 20% of small (<100 employee) business have outsourced payroll services, so there is still considerable potential market here. The big question in terms of market share / market growth is whether Intuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) QuickBooks software will continue to gain customers (they currently claim over a million users (about 20% of the potential market used above). To some extent Intuit is targeting a different market than PAYX (the DIY approach is most appealing to companies that have an in-house bookkeeper) but there will be some overlap.PAYX has also begun to expand in Germany and Brazil. The German operation is about eight years old accounted for <1% of company revenues in 2013 so it has been little more than an interesting curiosity. However, PAYX are looking to expand the German operations and recently doubled their client base through an acquisition so we may see noticeable growth in the near future. The Brazilian joint venture is very new (launched January '13) so there are no meaningful results yet. There is significant potential though - there are five million small or medium business and the regulatory environment recently became much more complex. At the moment, the overseas operations are merely interesting curiosities, however there is real potential in Brazil as it is a growing and modernizing economy. If PAYX were to achieve the 10% penetration they have in the US this would be another ~50,000 customers (about a 9% growth on the current customer base).PAYX is well placed to benefit from two possible macro-economic trends. The obvious source of potential growth is from increases in employment, especially in small businesses. The US unemployment rate has been falling steadily over the last four years but is still significantly higher than before the 2008 crash. Additionally, the number of small businesses continues to grow in both absolute terms and as a percentage of total jobs. These suggest PAYX's target market will continue to grow for the next few years.The second macro trend that PAYX may benefit from is rising interest rates. PAYX make payments on behalf of some employers. These employers send PAYX the money before PAYX pay the employees. During the time between receiving the money and paying it out PAYX collects interest on it. In 2013 only 1.8% of company revenue ($41m) was from interest on this float. In 2007, when the overnight bank rate was 5.25% (compared to 0.25% at the moment) 7% of revenue ($134m) came from interest on client funds. An increase in interest rates would effectively be free money for PAYX as it does not have any debt so would not face increased interest payments. PAYX currently hold approximately $4B of client funds so if interest rates rise by 1% that would be an extra $40m in profit (about a 7% improvement in the bottom line).The numbers in the following section are from GuruFocus and Paychex investor relations.PAYX have almost doubled revenue over the last 10 year from $1.3B to $2.3B. There was a slight (4%) dip in 2010 due to the effects of the financial crisis but otherwise, we see consistent growth in revenue. Earnings per share have also nearly doubled since 2004 ($0.80 to $1.56) although they only grew at 3% last year.One of the reasons I like software businesses (in addition to being a software guy) is that they can have excellent margins because software is very scalable (once it is written you can sell it multiple times). PAYX's Gross Margin was 72.9% MRQ (it has risen fairly steadily from 64.2% in 2012). Net Margin was 26.8% (up from 23.4% in 2012). Consistent and rising margins are a sign of a good business. Consistent, rising, and high margins are a sign of a great business. PAYX also display a pleasing downward trend in accounts receivable. In 2006 they had an average of 49.7 days sales outstanding. In 2013 it was just 26 days. This suggests some combination of less bad debt and improved collection terms.PAYX have no long term debt and $500m in cash and short term investments (not including client funds which obviously cannot be spent). This is almost one quarter's revenue or two quarters of real expenses (cost of goods sold plus selling general and administrative). This is a nice cushion and is further boosted by another $370m in long term investments.A history of acquisitions mean that PAYX is carrying $533m of goodwill but the balance sheet is strong enough even without this ""asset"". Capital expenditure for fiscal year 2014 is expected to be $100m to $110m which is fairly consistent with the last 3 years and well covered by cash on hand and expected cashflow.PAYX has authorised up to $350m of share repurchases for the upcoming year. During Q1 2.1M shares were repurchased at a cost of $84M (about $40 each). Share repurchases suggest that management are not acquisition crazy and recognize the value of giving pare money back to shareholders. PAYX currently yield 3.25% with a payout ratio of 88% from earnings. The payout ratio is on the high side so the dividend looks somewhat risky. However, PAYX have a good history of earnings growth and plenty of cash at the moment so it should be safe. Net Income is projected to grow 8-9% over 2013-14.PAYX is currently on a slightly expensive P/E of 27. ADP is trading on the same multiple so this suggests investors are bullish on the sector. PAYX's 1 year forward P/E is 23.5 which is better but still on the high side. PEG is 2.5 at the moment which suggests that future growth is completely priced in and possibly that the market is being too optimistic about PAYX.PAYX has a solid balance sheet, a profitable highly cash generative business, and a relatively strong competitive advantage. When you add in a relatively high yield and some attractive macro factors and expansion possibilities it is not surprising that this is a popular stock. I would like to own PAYX but I am not quite convinced I should pay 27x earnings for it. For now, I am putting PAYX on my watchlist for either a price drop or when interest rates look more likely to rise.One thing to note (depending on when you are reading this article) is that PAYX goes ex-dividend on 10/30, so it may be worth waiting till after that date if you are considering a purchase and do not have access to a DRIP (I do not). Doing this means you will get slightly more shares for the same initial investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in PAYX over the next 72 hours.

1521752,50592,2013-06-26T07:23:24-04:00,,"Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) reports earnings on Wednesday, June 26th, which will be an excellent insight on the strength of the economy. Paychex's earnings will be a great gauge on whether or not small businesses are hiring, which is the true catalyst of economic growth. Typically, job growth starts with small businesses, so if PAYX reports strong earnings, job growth should continue.One of Paychex's best strengths is its dividend. Currently Paychex's yield is about 3.5% based on a price of around $37 a share. Year to date the stock is up about 20%. As mentioned previously, the primary driver of the stock is employment growth, but other opportunities still exist. Paychex also offers Human Resources services for companies that are interested in outsourcing those functions. Paychex is also hoping to expand into a more technologically advanced payroll company, leading the way with newer payroll technologies. Paychex has been making acquisitions as well, which should prove beneficial for investors over time.Analysts are currently predicting $1.60 per share earnings for 2013. The company has been performing well, seeing increasing revenues for the previous eight quarters, and net income rising year over year at an average rate of around 7%.In terms of valuation, Paychex trades at a P/E of about 22 and a PEG of over 2. This values the company fully, and could mean that a selloff is due. Although Paychex's history has shown that the company has continually met or beat analysts' expectations, the stock has already appreciated significantly.Signs that hiring may be increasing typically can be predicted, but are difficult to be consistent with accuracy. The obvious choice for signs of increasing employment is the unemployment rate and non-farm payroll reports. A second catalyst for employment may be political certainty. Businesses have blamed political and Government uncertainty on top of increasing regulations as major reasons why hiring has suffered. Once businesses adapt and adjust to the new healthcare reform, stricter regulations, and current market conditions, hiring may be due to increase.Paychex's largest competitor is Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). A new competitor has also emerged, in the likes of Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU). Paychex does diversify its services as a hedge against competitors, and should see growth in its human resources and retirement planning departments.ConclusionPaychex has had a large run this year, making the stock currently fully valued. Although the stock may have a favorable 3-5 year return, rushing into an investment right now seems foolish. It is difficult to predict whether or not Paychex will report strong earnings on Wednesday, so buying the stock solely on trading the earnings report may be risky. However, unemployment rates have dropped in 25 states last month, which may be a sign that a good report is to come.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

If you are looking for a solid company with a stable, healthy dividend and a catalyst for future growth, this provider of payroll services to small- and medium-sized businesses is a good candidate.A Solid Company With Good FundamentalsPaychex is a large-cap ($3.53 billion) company that provides payroll processing, administration, human resources, and payroll tax preparation services to companies in the United States and Germany. In its most recent quarter (despite an economy one might charitably describe as tepid) it reported earnings per share up 8.1% over the previous quarter, growth in top line revenue, growth in net income, and expanding profit margins. The stock has also performed well this year against its peers and against the S&P 500, and is up 19% year to date.DividendPaychex pays an annual dividend of $1.32 per share with a yield of 3.6%. In a large-cap company with a long history of paying and sustaining a significant dividend, this 3.6% yield is stable and by itself justifies consideration of the company for a place in an income portfolio. But Paychex is more than just its healthy dividend.Catalysts for GrowthAs a provider of payroll services to small- and mid-sized employers, Paychex's fortunes are strongly impacted by hiring and employment. To say the economy, and the job market, have struggled recently is an obvious understatement. And yet, in this difficult environment Paychex has still managed to grow both its top and bottom lines, and increase its earnings per share. This strong performance is likely to accelerate if either one of two possible scenarios develop.First, if recent signs of increased hiring in the private sector continue and the unemployment rate drops, Paychex is a likely beneficiary as the small- and mid-sized businesses that drive the economy will require more services. A strengthening employment picture creates a virtuous loop for Paychex - where more hiring feeds the economy, more people can pay for and consume goods and services, and the increased hiring increases demand for the services Paychex provides.Second, it's no secret that employers (particularly small employers) have been saying they are reluctant to hire more workers because of uncertainty over ""Obamacare"" and what it will cost them to comply. As employers navigate these issues over the balance of this year and 2014, this uncertainty will ultimately give way to clarity as the system gets put into place. When these issues clear, hiring and the economy are much more likely to be on a more firm footing and again Paychex will benefit.If neither of the above two catalysts occur - and hiring and the economy continue to struggle as they are now, Paychex has shown that it can still grow and perform well in this poor environment. And while you wait to see if the economy and hiring gain traction as hoped, you earn a nice 3.6% dividend.Cautionary NotePaychex is not cheap. With its current year-to-date run of 19% it is priced at 37.18 and has a PE of 23.22 versus the S&P PE of 18.Disclosure: I am long PAYX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1230091,23479,2013-02-27T14:18:43-05:00,,"Quick TakePaychex Corporation is one of the two major publicly traded payroll processors in the United States. The company generates revenues by processing employee payrolls which includes paper and electronic distribution of employee compensation along with the processing of tax withholdings and other employee contributions. The company primarily competes with much bigger ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), which has a market capitalization of approximately $30 billion compared with Paychexâs market capitalization of $12 billion.Paychex generated approximately $2 billion in revenues and had EBITDA margins of approximately 42% in 2012, and we think that both of these metrics will rise over our forecast period. The company has two primary divisions, payroll processing, which makes up 60% of the firmâs value, and HR outsourcing, which make up over 30% of value.See our complete analysis of Paychex herePayroll Processing Tied With Employment GrowthAs mentioned above, Paychexâs payroll processing division makes up approximately 60% of the firmâs value. The primary driver of this division is the number of employees per client payrolls, as the company gets paid on a per employee basis.We estimate that in FY 2012 the company was processing approximately 9.5 million employee payrolls, as it had 567,000 clients with an average of 17 employees per client. We think that both the average client employees and number of clients will increase over our forecast period to approximately around 19 and 620,000 respectively. The primary rationale for both of these forecasts is that we expect the global economy to improve in the next couple of years which should spur hiring growth and new business creation. In a scenario where the  global economic environment in 2-3 years time worsened and the average employees per payroll client fell to 16 by the end of our forecast period, we would see approximately 10% downside to our price estimate.HR Outsourcing is The Primary Growth DriverWhile Paychexâs payroll division has been a relatively stable revenue source of revenues over the past couple of years, the companyâs HR outsourcing division has been the primary contributor of growth. The divisionâs revenue increased 13% in FY 2012, primarily due to price increases and growth in both clients and client employees.As with the firmâs payroll processing division, Paychexâs HR outsourcing division is also dependent on the number of employeeâs the company serves. In FY 2012, the firm had approximately 615,000 client employees, and we expect this number to grow to approximately 800,000 by the end of our forecast period. The major driver of this growth will likely be the result of Paychex up-selling to existing clients and also a potential economic recovery in the United States, which will increase the number of employees at their existing clients. For sensitivity purposes, if the number of HR outsourcing client employees served stayed flat over our forecast period, we would see approximately 5% downside to our price estimate.We currently have a $35 price estimate for Paychex, which is approximately 10% above the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."

In case you're not already familiar with it, Paychex is the second-by-size payroll processing vendor in the United States. The company provides payroll, human resource and benefits outsourcing solutions for small-to-medium sized businesses. Paychex services more than 567,000 businesses.Paychex is paid on a per-check basis for its main business and its results are closely tied to the health of the US economy and particularly the job market. Since the 2008 financial crisis and the 10% high of the unemployment rate in mid-2009, much of the lost ground has been covered. The economy has started to grow again and the real GDP even surpassed its pre-crisis levels.Unfortunately the unemployment rate has lagged behind and hasn't reached its pre-crisis levels yet. Another indicator that the job market is picking up speed is the rapid fall of the average duration of unemployment. Which means that people are able to find jobs faster than they used to for the last couple of years.As the economy gets stronger and more and more people are hired, Paychex will make more and more money from small and medium businesses that will ramp up their hiring.However you may wonder: ""Isn't PAYX expensive at 21 times its projected 2013 earnings?"". And the answer is no. Given that Paychex has an average 10-year growth rate of 8% that rises up to 15% in post recession periods, I believe that it is just trading at its fair price.One thing that makes Paychex a truly compelling long-term investment is the strong downside protection it enjoys in periods of economic hardship.Changing from one payroll processing vendor to another is a very burdensome task and that fact alone gives reason Paychex and its main competitor, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) great customer captivity. This captivity gives them pricing power over their customers allowing for modest price increases at good times and non-declining prices at recessions.You can see how that applies below. Paychex was hardly hit by the greatest financial crisis after the Second World War!Another bonus for Paychex's shareholders is its $1.32 dividend which currently yields 3.9%. And despite the high payout ratio of more than 80%, this dividend is pretty safe due to Paychex's pricing power and its consistent growth.I suggest you add Paychex to your watch list and be ready to buy when it dips below $30.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Paychex serves more than 567,000 businesses worldwide and almost 82% of these constitute employers having less than 19 employees.The prime reason for the increased revenue this quarter has been a 2.3% rise in the checks per payroll as compared to 1.8% for the same period last year. This is in line with our forecast of an increase in the number of employees per client to increase to about 20 by the end of our forecast period.Another reason behind the rise has been the calendar year-end bonus payments to the employees. Also, the revenue per check has increased modestly owing to price increases partially offset by discounts provided by Paychex to its major clients. The total increment in the revenue has also slightly tempered by one less day of payroll processing in the quarter due to the leap year last year.Human Resources ServicesHuman Resources Services revenue grew by 10% to $188.7 million for the third quarter compared to the same period last year. This division account for over 30% of Paychexâs value and mainly includes revenues from retirement services, insurance services, HR solutions and SaaS-based solutions.Retirement services and HR solutions recorded a growth in the revenue as the number of clients and employees per client increased over the period. Another reason has been a consistent rise in the prices charged by Paychex for the services provided. Paychex has also been looking at the Software as a Service (SaaS) solution as a priority area to combat the competition arising from companies like Intuit. It has so far been successful in improving the client base and increasing the prices for its SaaS based solutions. We are closely looking at this division as it may turn out to be a competitive segment in the days to come.Insurance servicesâ revenue also added up to the total revenue growth as a result of the improvement in the number of health and benefits services applicants and price increases.We currently have a $33.87 price estimate for Paychex, which is ~3% less than the current market price.Disclosure: No positions"

But in reality, earnings are but an accounting measure. Dividends are paid in cash, and cash-flow analysis is the absolute core of dividend investing. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety in our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushionâ¢. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), as well as its dividend under this unique but yet very straightforward framework.Investment Highlightsâ¢ Paychex earns a ValueCreationâ¢ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 138.2% from 129.6% during the next two years.â¢ Paychex is a leader in the payroll, human resource, and benefits outsourcing industry. With a wide range of services - including payroll processing, retirement services, insurance, and a fully outsourced human resource solution - Paychex customizes its offering to the client's business.â¢ Paychex has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 25.1% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter.â¢ The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.â¢ The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 4.2%. We expect the firm to pay out about 82% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends. Though the payout ratio is high, the company boasts an excellent Valuentum Dividend Cushion score.Investment ConsiderationsReturn on Invested CapitalPaychex's Dividend Paychex's dividend yield is solid, offering roughly a 4.2% annual payout at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3% and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio.We think the safety of Paychex's dividend is excellent (please see our definitions at the bottom of this article). We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushionâ¢. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For Paychex, this score is 3.1, revealing that on its current path the firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. We also use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter.Now on to the potential growth of Paychex's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is not the case for Paychex. We rate the firm's potential dividend growth as good as we'd demand at least a high single-digit future annual growth rate in the dividend to rate it excellent. Our estimate of Paychex's future annual dividend growth rate is roughly 4%.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration for dividend growth investors, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In Paychex's case, we currently think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss is medium.All things considered, Paychex stands out to us as one of the better income plays on the market today.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1305231,46731,2013-03-27T16:42:39-04:00,,"An OverviewPaychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) processes payroll and offers human resource and benefit services to companies in the United States and Germany. They collect fees for these services, and also earn interest on funds held for their clients. The most similar publicly-traded company is Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP).Paychex seems fully valued today at around $34/share and 20X earnings, but when I run the numbers it looks like a buy to me. I only buy stocks that offer an attractive total return profile of 9-11% annually over the next 5 years. Obviously you want stocks that will continue to gain after 5 years, but trying to do any analysis more than 5 years out includes more guessing than I am willing to do. I view Paychex as being of the highest quality, so my threshold for buying would be the lower 9% hurdle.So where does Paychex need to be 5 years from now to earn 9% annually? The short answer: $43.50/shareNow, let's take a brief glance at how that number is calculated:Looking forward, we can expect the next full years worth of dividends to get 4% of the return. Given Paychex' history of keeping a somewhat steady payout ratio, and thus raising their dividends in line with earnings, over our next five years we will assume that 4% annual dividend return will hold. That means the stock price will have to make up for the other 5% a year.$34/share * (1.05) ^5 = $43.50/shareWe know what share price we need 5 years from now to earn our 9% annually, now let's figure out what we would expect the share price to be. With a company as stable as Paychex, there is one number we need to know five years from now to figure out a likely stock price: earnings per share. Let's start the process of figuring out what Paychex' 2018 earnings per share number will be.Here is a quick chart of what I view to be the key metrics for Paychex' business. Service Revenue, Average Client Funds Held, Net Income, and Interest Earned were pulled from Paychex 2012, 2011, and 2010 annual reports. The other data points are numbers I calculated from that data, and are not specifically listed by Paychex in their financial statements. 2010 includes one-time expense charge of $18.7 million added back into net income, all non-percentage values listed in million USDAs I noted above, Service Income and Service Income Margin are not numbers given by Paychex. So how did I calculate them?First off, we need to make some assumptions about the Interest Earned on Client Funds Held (CFH), and the effect that has on Net Income. I assumed that Interest Earned on CFH translated 100% to Net Income. This seems a bit simplistic, but most of what Paychex invests these funds into is Municipal Bonds. Listed in their annual report is a benefit to their effective tax rate of 2.7%, 2.2%, and 1.8% for the years 2010, 2011, and 2012 from owning Municipal Bonds. Some quick calculations (which are not shown here) makes their tax rate on Interest Earned on CFH immaterial/negligible.Additionally, I assume that operating expenses are essentially zero for earning this income. This takes more assumptions. However, Paychex and most other companies invest their current assets in these types of funds anyway, and therefore I assume there is zero/immaterial marginal cost to investing Client Funds Held. Lastly, I ignore investment income on Paychex' current assets as it has been trending around 1% of net income, and thus I consider immaterial for my analysis.So:Service Income = Net Income - Interest Earned on CFHandService Income Margin = Service Income / Service RevenueSo what is the point? I feel like knowing the Service Revenue, Service Income Margin, Average Client Funds Held, and the % Earned on CFH in any given year will give you an accurate calculation of Net Income for that year.The ProjectionsSo what are these numbers going to be over the next 5 years? Let's take them one at a time.Service Revenue:Here is the last 10 years of Service Revenue for Paychex, 2002 Service Revenue numbers were used to calculate the 2003 Year-over-Year change but are not listed.(Service Revenue listed in millions of USD)Service Revenue growth comes from a variety of sources. A growing population (more importantly a growing workforce) can lead to more business clients and more employee checks per business client. Existing payroll clients opting to use Paychex for benefits and/or other human resource needs also grows this revenue. Taking market share from competitors or buying smaller competitors also grows this revenue. Additionally, Paychex is able to raise prices at a rate equal to or above inflation given their sticky relationship with their customers.I would peg a realistic Revenue growth estimate for the next five years at 6% per year. This includes a mix of additional revenues from cross-selling services, price increases, market share gains, and growth through acquisitions.Service Income Margin:(Service Revenue and Income listed in millions of USD)Paychex' Service Income Margin has held remarkably stable over the last five years. This speaks to their business model. They have very low overhead, and are able to match increases in business volume with the appropriate level of personnel. The biggest outlier of the last 5 years was fiscal year 2010 which contained the most challenging employment market and still clocked in at 22.65%. For this reason I feel comfortable approximating this margin to be 23% for the next five years.Average Client Funds Held:(CFH listed in millions of USD)With a limited window to look at, I will be content to conservatively estimate that the average Client Funds Held will grow in tandem with, but slightly less than Service Revenue. I will use a growth rate of 5.5%/year over the next five years.% Earned on CFH:(Interest Earned on CFH and CFH listed in millions of USD)This number is the real crapshoot. Paychex holds both short-term and intermediate-term (3-5 years) bonds, so changes in interest rates have an immediate, though somewhat diluted effect. Over the next 5 years I would expect interest rates to head back towards where they were in 2008, but not reach quite reach it. The % earned on CFH would remain below that until the portfolio fully cycled into higher yielding assets. I view my guess as good as any other so I will use 1.15%, 1.25%, 1.5%, 1.8%, 2.2%,and 2.6% for the years 2013-18.Putting all of this into a chart:(all non percentage values listed in millions of USD)Using a share count of 365 million (my estimate) for 2018 gets you $2.31/share of earnings for 2018. Valuing earnings at 20X would get a share price of over $46 for 2018. This would meet my 9% threshold.Alternate ScenariosThere are certainly alternate scenarios that could play out with this stock to consider. In my analysis a full 14% of 2018 Net Income comes from Interest Earned on CFH. A lower available interest rate and/or changes in the climate that affects CFH could bring this number down considerably.Looking at Service Revenue Year-over-Year changes shows that Paychex is resilient to a down-turn in the economy, but certainly not immune from it. A recession could slow or even turn Service Revenue growth negative and greatly undermine my valuation thesis.Another scenario deals with a lower market-place valuation. While I believe 20X earnings to be an appropriate price for Paychex, a lower market valuation in the future could limit your ability to realize gains from owning Paychex.There is also more upside potential in Paychex to consider as well. An acceleration of economic growth and Paychex' growth to a mid 2000's-level would lead to much higher earnings growth than what I have projected. Additionally, wage growth acceleration (which has been quite stagnant) could lead to a double-positive of both faster CFH growth and higher interest rates.ConclusionI consider what I have outlined to be a base-case (and a conservative one at that) scenario for Paychex hinging on a slow-growth US economy over the next five years. The total return prospects of owning Paychex are favorable and meet my 9% annual return threshold. I own Paychex and feel like at $34/share it presents an adequate if not compelling total return prospect over the 5 years.Anything to add?

Paychex has held the No. 2 position in United States human resource and benefit administration client count for over 30 years.A review of fiscal year-end (May 31, 2012) results taken from the company's annual report indicates record performance for Paychex and its 12,400 employees. Paychex delivered a 7% increase in revenue year over year to $2.229 billion. Earnings per share increased 6% to $1.51 from $1.42 in 2011. Most importantly for future growth, client employees served with Paycheck's HR solutions grew 8% to 615,000.Paychex has carved out a niche with small and medium-sized businesses served from over 100 offices across the United States and Germany. Large corporate clients are more likely to be with competitor ADP. This is not a negative for Paychex; instead, Paychex cements its relationship with small businesses using a direct sales force presenting mobile solutions and the latest technology to make payroll, insurance and benefit administration simple. In September 2012, Paychex launched a special 401(k) sales force solely dedicated to building relationships with financial advisors and plan sponsors.Paychex Has a Substantial ""Moat""The ""moat"" for this business is the difficulty and headache involved in a client changing providers. Why is it difficult for an employer, especially a ""mom and pop"" operation, to change paycheck and benefit providers? All year-to-date cumulative information for income, taxes, health insurance deductibles, and 401(k) contributions for each employee are in the hands of the benefit administrator, such as Paychex. In addition, funds are held by the administrator for payment of federal tax withholdings and Social Security contributions. This is private and sensitive information and won't be moved without a compelling reason.Paychex is priced at $32.63 as of the close on Oct. 12, 2012. The stock is up 16.2% over the past 52 weeks, below the 18.9% growth of the S&P 500. It is selling below its 50-day moving average of $33.58.Paychex pays an attractive dividend yielding 3.9% annually. The dividend growth rate is 7.16% on a five-year average. A cautionary note is that the dividend payout ratio is at 84%, higher than the industry average. CompetitorsAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP): The company is the oldest and largest provider in the space of business HR outsourcing including payroll and benefit management solutions, tax, and compliance. The company has a suite of human capital management systems and a worldwide network of service centers. Revenue exceeded $9.9 billion in 2011 with a client count in excess of 600,000.Insperity (NYSE:NSP): The company provides HR support through its Workforce Optimization solution, which encompasses a range of functions including payroll and employee benefits, workers compensation, government compliance, expense management, training, and employee performance goals. Its client count includes over 100,000 small and medium-sized businesses with over 2 million employees served from 56 offices. Revenues in 2011 exceeded $2 billion.Workday: The company provides cloud-based applications for businesses in the United States and internationally. It offers applications for customers to manage business functions that help them optimize their financial and human capital resources. The company was founded in 2005 and went public on Oct. 12, 2012.Source: Yahoo Finance.ConclusionThe business of business outsourcing appears healthy and each of the above companies serves a specialty niche. Investing over the long term in any of these examples is a play on continued business growth. The fact that these companies survived and prospered during the downturn means there may be real upside as the economy improves. Imagine if, over time, 5-10 million new jobs are created how these payroll processing and employee benefit companies will profit.As a retiree with an interest in dividend income, I like each of the three listed above as they all pay dividends -- but particularly PAYX, with its 3.9% yield. I am impressed with the return on equity and operating margin performance of the two largest players, PAYX and ADP. The fact that NSP is a small-cap and has a very attractive PEG ratio 0.70 will cause me to put it on my watch list. You may want to do the same.Disclosure: I am long PAYX, ADP.

Paychex management has been proactive in controlling expenses to increase productivity, and hence margins.Paychex has reiterated FY2013 guidance of 5-6% services revenue growth, and 3-4% in payroll services. The company is still expected to be a beneficiary of a growth in new clients, and revenue per paycheck.The Paychex Next Generation suite and the online reporting service for its clients and CPAs have received good traction and feedback. In the long-run these technological enhancements place the company in a better competitive position.The company has significant liquidity for a possible share buyback program some time in the near future. Management has not announced any plans for a share buyback as yet.In conclusion, Paychex is a profitable company with an attractive dividend payout. An important fact to keep in mind is that companies such as Paychex and Automatic Data Processing grow their earnings from interest income earned on client portfolios. Interest income is earned on excess funds that are kept on reserve by their clients before their employees are paid in the form of paychecks. As per the company's Annual report dated May 31st, 2012, average interest rate earned on client accounts from FY2010-FY2012 was 1.5%. The interest income generated from the client funds was in the range of 5%-7.6% of EBIT. Hence, any increase in interest rates going forward will increase the interest income earned by Paychex.It provides an attractive opportunity for income-oriented investors.Written by Kapitall's Sabina Bhatia.

Investors reacted very timidly on the publication of the results, as shares traded largely unchanged in after hours trading.First Quarter ResultsPaychex reported first quarter revenues of $578.2 million, up 3% compared to last year. On average, analysts expected Paychex to generate revenues of $584.1 million. The company reported a 3% increase in net income to $153.1 million. Earnings per diluted share rose by 2% to $0.42 per share. Earnings beat analysts consensus by a penny.Total expenses rose by 2% to $340.2 million. Continued investments in product development and supporting technology where offset by increased productivity.CEO Martin Mucci commented on the results, ""The first quarter has fiscal 2013 off to a good start with results meeting our expectations. Our client base continued to improve, checks per payroll continued to increase, and our client retention is near a historic high. Growth rates reflect fluctuations in the frequency of payroll processing compared to the same period last year.""Segmental InformationThe company's payroll service division reported revenues of $385.9 million, up 1% on the year. The number of checks per payroll rose by 2.0% over the quarter. As a result of discounting, revenue growth was tempered.The human resource division reported a strong 7% increase in revenues to $182.2 million. Higher checks per payroll, price increases and client growth all boosted revenue growth. Insurance revenues rose by 21% and the retirement services performed good as well.OutlookPaychex leaves its full year fiscal 2013 outlook unchanged. Payroll service revenue growth is expected to come in between 3 and 4%. Human resource revenues are expected to grow between 9 and 11% for the full year. Total revenues are expected to grow by 5 to 6%.Net income is expected to increase by 5 to 7%ValuationPaychex ended its first quarter with $390.9 million in cash, equivalents and short term investments. The company operates without any meaningful debt, for a comfortable net cash position.Based on the outlook, Paychex is expected to generate annual revenues of around $2.3 billion. Net income could come in around $580 million, or $1.60 per share.Currently, the market values the firm at $12.5 billion, or $12 billion for the operating assets of the firm. This values the firm at 5.2 times annual revenues and 21 times annual earnings.Its larger competitor Automatic Data Processing (ADP) trades at 2.7 times annual revenues and 21 times trailing earnings.Currently, Paychex pays a quarterly dividend of $0.32 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 3.7%.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Paychex have risen some 15%. Shares traded between $29-$33 in the first half of the year, but rose to year highs of $34 at the moment.Over the past five years, shares have fallen some 20%. Shares fell to lows of $20 in the beginning of 2009, but have traded between $25 and $35 per share, ever since. Over the same period, Paychex grew its annual revenues from $2.0 billion in 2009, to an expected $2.3 billion for its fiscal 2013. Net income grew from $533 million to an expected $580 million. Earnings per share grew in line with net income.Investors hardly reacted on the first quarter results of Paychex as results were in line with expectations, and the company reiterated its full year outlook. Shares trade at 21 times expected annual earnings, which is a fairly steep valuation. Investors are comforted by the stable 3.7% dividend yield.Investors could hold on to their shares. Don't expect any spectacular performance in the short term, but long term holders receive a decent yield in the meantime.

As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For Paychex, this score is 3.2, revealing that on its current path the firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies. For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) scores a 1.4 on this measure. Also, for firms that have a score below 1 or that have a negative score, the risk of a dividend cut in the future is certainly elevated. In fact, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion caught all dividend cuts in our non-financial coverage universe, except for one, which subsequently raised its dividend above pre-cut levels (meaning it shouldn't have cut it in the first place). The Dividend Cushion also caught the recent cuts by JC Penney (JCP) and SuperValu (NYSE:SVU). Now on to the potential growth of Paychex's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is not the case for Paychex. We rate the firm's future potential dividend growth as good. The company has significant excess capacity, but its recent dividend growth rate hasn't been that great.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In Paychex's case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss is medium. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low. All things considered, we are considering adding the firm to our dividend growth portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

686661,23502,2012-06-27T07:49:11-04:00,,"By Vishnu LekrajPaychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is among the best businesses we cover. The firm has produced returns  on invested capital that have averaged well above 70% during the last 15  years, with the triumvirate of high customer switching costs, solid  scale advantages, and a respected brand image providing a wide economic  moat. We believe the stock is currently undervalued, giving investors an  opportunity to gain a powerful return from a top-tier business.Paychex faced some harsh headwinds during the recent recession, which  slowed its usually stellar performance and sent its stock reeling. The  stock price has since recovered from trough levels, and we believe there  is still more upside. During the recent recovery, poor new business  formation and disappointing new client sales execution hampered the pace  of recovery for the payroll processor. These factors disappointed many  market participants and have held Paychex's stock from recovering more  robustly. The firm's equity currently trades at about 80% of our fair  value estimate; combining this with a healthy 4% dividend yield gives  investors an excellent potential return. We believe the confluence of a  moderately recovering employment market, more robust new business  starts, and a re-tooled sales force will provide a strong catalyst for  further stock price appreciation.Potential for a Robust Investment ReturnA few months before the beginning of the recent recession (December  2007), Paychex's stock price hit a five-year high of around $45.  However, during the heart of the following recessionary period, the  stock lost 55% of its value, falling to a trough of $20. It has since  recovered and now trades around $32. Even with this dramatic recovery,  we still believe there is significant potential for more upside. The  firm carries no debt, produces robust free cash flows, competes in a  large and growing market, and possesses significant competitive  advantages that will allow it to thrive over an extended period. We  believe these factors are a recipe for future stock price appreciation.Our $38 fair value estimate includes assumptions for a moderate  near-term recovery in the firm's operating environment, better new  client sales execution, an extended period of low interest rates for  high-quality paper, and solid long-term top- and bottom-line expansion.We believe a major near-term catalyst for improving results will be  growth in checks per client, as each additional check processed is more  profitable than the last. The scale factor of processing more payrolls  is a key variable for Paychex, as profitability tends to follow the  total level of client employees. Combining this dynamic with moderate  new job growth should lead to good operating margin expansion.We also expect the total number of payroll clients serviced to  increase. Driving some of this expectation is the firm's recent  investment in a retooled sales staff. The other main variable relates to  the pace of new business formation, which has been lackluster to say  the least. With the credit markets tighter than historical levels, it  was tough for new small businesses to form over the last several years.We believe the operating environment has improved for Paychex, and  indications point to solid near-term results. This dynamic also should  serve as a catalyst for stock price appreciation. Adding to the  potential for a good capital return is Paychex's robust dividend. The  annual dividend yield currently stands at 4%, significantly higher than  most high-quality fixed-income investments. This dividend yield also  provides a floor, in our opinion, as investors may find a mid- to  high-single-digit return too appealing to pass up. Combining the  potential for solid capital appreciation with a robust dividend offers  one of the best opportunities to gain an excellent return from a  high-quality business.Unyielding Competitive AdvantagesHigh customer switching costs, inherent scalability, and a respected  brand image are the main drivers of Paychex's steep competitive  advantages, which we believe form a potent combination that will last  for some time to come. Switching from one payroll processing vendor to  another is very difficult, as revamping a critical aspect of a business'  human resources process is an arduous activity. This in-elasticity has  enabled the firm to raise prices annually and expand profits. Strong  scalability also has allowed the firm to be price-competitive without  feeling margin pressure. Capital expenditures are minimal, and  automation helps keep a lean operating structure. The firm's strong  brand also plays a role as clients are hesitant to entrust their  critical HR functions to an unproven competitor. Competition in the  payroll processing industry is minimal, and we foresee no erosion to the  firm's competitive position.One explicit example of Paychex's competitive advantages is its  ability to raise payroll services prices annually. Revenue per client  employee per month has increased every year apart from 2011, when the  firm faced some sales execution issues. These issues seemed to be  resolved, and we expect the usual pricing growth to resume.The cost of rolling over a critical part of a firm's back-office  operations most likely far outweighs any pricing benefit a competitor  could offer. The security of entrusting payroll processes and funds to a  proven and trusted partner is also a very compelling factor working in  Paychex's favor.Growing PaychexIn terms of revenue, Paychex is the second-largest payroll processor behindAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP).  Despite its dominant position, we believe there is a good growth runway  for Paychex, as we estimate it has captured only about 9% of the small  and medium-size business market, a niche we believe will grow at a solid  clip over an extended period.In addition to new client growth, cross-selling also will drive a  material amount of expansion for Paychex. The firm is able to offer a  plethora of ancillary HR services, including 401(k) administration,  benefits administration, and compliance tracking. Paychex also has the  capability to offer a professional employer organization service, with  which the firm is able to take total responsibility for all HR  activities (operationally and legally).Other ancillary HR services have grown from about 11% of total  operating revenue (revenue excluding float) to about 30% of total  operating revenue since fiscal 2000. We believe this percentage will  continue to grow as Paychex is able to more efficiently cross-sell these  ancillary products and clients demand a more all-encompassing HR  outsourcing process. In our opinion, this dynamic is highly positive, as  each additional service sold to a client contributes a material amount  of profitability and also further locks the client into the firm's  grasp. The combination of a growing target market and increasing  cross-sells provides a smooth runway for growth.We Believe This Wide-Moat Business Provides an Advantageous OpportunityLike most employment services firms, Paychex's stock price fell  significantly during the last recession. However, we believe market  participants unduly lumped this stalwart business in with less  formidable players. Despite its employment-related services, Paychex's  results do not fluctuate nearly as much as a typical HR outsourcer.  Instead of relying on the marginal growth in employment (which can vary  enormously during an economic cycle), operations are driven by the  aggregate level of employment (which does not vary greatly during an  economic cycle).In addition, Paychex stumbled slightly during the recent recovery, as  it was unable to execute its sales operations on par with expectations.  Exacerbating this dynamic was a poor market for new business formation  market. These factors have kept the firm's stock price from recovering  to 3-star territory like that of main rival ADP. Accordingly, we believe  investors have an opportunity to gain excellent capital returns and a  robust dividend yield from a wide-moat business that is able to  continually churn out returns on invested capital around 70%.Disclosure: Morningstar licenses its indexes  to certain ETF and ETN providers, including BlackRock, Invesco, Merrill  Lynch, Northern Trust, and Scottrade for use in exchange-traded funds  and notes.

489641,25562,2012-04-10T15:47:50-04:00,,"This article will highlight Paychex Inc., (PAYX), a payroll and human resource firm. PAYX is a wide moat low risk firm that should merit inclusion in any dividend growth portfolio. I will highlight three key points that I believe support my investment thesis.I assigned PAYX the moniker of a wide moat company due to its lack of competitors and the difficulty a new competitor would have in establishing itself. Its main competitor is Automatic Data Processing (ADP) a long-time Warren Buffett holding. ADP and PAYX area virtual duopoly with ADP having a stranglehold on large corporations while Paychex concentrates on small to midsized firms.The first key point I would like to highlight is the consistency of the company's business. Paychex has consistently increased revenue every year with the exception of 2009, which coincided with peak unemployment. As unemployment trends have abated, Paychex revenue has increased as well. It is reasonable to conclude that PAYX offers an investor direct exposure to a firming job market while collecting an above-market-rate dividend while waiting.The second key point is the above mentioned dividend. Paychex currently distributes 32 cents per share in dividends. Based on a current equity price of $31.55 the yield equates to a 4.05% yield. Dividends paid to shareholders were $448.8 million, or 87% of net income for fiscal year-end 2011. While the payout ratio is high it doesn't concern me due to the company's low capital needs and highly predictable business model. When asked on the most recent conference call about the 800 million that is currently on the Paychex balance sheet along with future plans for it, Efrain Rivera CFO, responded. ""So we are attempting to balance one, leaving ourselves with enough ready cash to move quickly because that's an advantage we perceive in the market, with returning -- not leaving too much cash on the balance sheet because the asset returns, obviously, are not great. We have -- I would say, we have a very robust dialogue with the board on that issue. They are the ultimate arbiters as to how cash will be deployed. But as you -- as we've said, as we get closer to $1 billion and we don't have a ready use for the cash, then we have to entertain a number of ways to return cash back to shareholders. And I think our history has indicated we'll do that."" (Source earnings call transcript).The company's low capital needs segues into my third point, which is its debt levels. Paychex has no long-term debt outstanding. With an absence of debt on the balance sheet PAYX can comfortably sustain the current dividend rate and has ample room for future increases once business rebounds.Source Seeking Alpha.comIn summary I find PAYX to offer a compelling value proposition. While not an in vogue pick such as Apple (AAPL) or Google (GOOG), PAYX should add a nice income component to any investor's portfolio. The above-average yield combined with absence of debt and a very consistent revenue model should make Paychex an excellent choice for low-risk dividend-growth investors. As the economy heals and hiring returns to normal levels capital gains will be had as well.Disclosure: I am long PAYX. I am also long GOOG straddles and reverse iron condor."
787451,23407,2012-08-07T15:22:31-04:00,,"Seeking Alpha readers are well aware of how anemic job growth has been. But, despite a nascent recovery in jobs, Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) service revenue reached an all-time high last fiscal year.From 2003-2007, an average of 157k new jobs were created in the U.S. each month. July's 163k reading, the highest in 5 months, follows a spate of below average monthly rates, including a 64k reading in June.But, encouragingly for Paychex, employment has continued higher, albeit at a disappointing pace. The following chart shows the trend in non farm payroll since the trough in early 2010.Overall, the economy has recovered a bit less than half the losses from 2008's peak to its bottom in February 2010. Yet, Paychex service revenue hit the highest in its history as checks per payroll gained for a 9th consecutive quarter.Paychex continues to make most of its money from payroll services. The segment saw its revenue increase by 5% to $1.5 billion in FY12.But, it's seeing faster growth in selling related services to its client base. Human resource services revenue grew 13% in FY12 to $676 million. And, sales of its health and benefits services increased 24% to $52 million as search marketing and CPA referrals drove 23% more applicants.The increased business drove $707 million in cash flow from operations, which helped the company's cash and investments climb to $790 million at quarter end, up from $671 million the prior year. Even more enticing, the company remains debt free.Paychex guidance offers a fair degree of upside, particularly if the economy strengthens on improving housing or additional global stimulus. But, even if it doesn't, the company still expects FY13 sales growth of 3-4% for payroll services and 9-11% for human resource services. Overall, the company expects total service revenue to grow 5-6%. As a result the street is looking for 6% EPS growth in FY13 and another 8% in FY14.Given the company offers economic growth, with the potential for leverage on any improvement, shareholders may find it makes sense to buy shares in August for upside into fall. Over the past 10 years, shares have traded higher 9 times through the 3-month period ending in October.Regardless, a strong balance sheet, good growth prospects and a healthy 3.9% dividend yield make Paychex an intriguing alternative.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in PAYX over the next 72 hours."

After ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), it's well entrenched as the leader in the small business (below 100 employees) segment. Paychex has a lot of positives going for it.Best industry margins -- Paychex has the highest profit per employee compared to its peers and its net profit margin of 24.35% is almost double of ADP's. Paychex keeps a tight lid on expenses, allowing it to gross an average of 38% revenues; even in a terrible 2010, Paychex managed an operating margin of 36% and net margin of 23.5%. In one of its best years -- 2008 Paychex had an operating margin of 40% and net margin of 28%.Generates gobs of cash - Paychex has no long term debt, yields 4% and pays out about 80% of its profits as dividends to shareholders.Steady for a cyclical -- Even as a cyclical, Paychex has never been subject to wide swings; in its worst year in 2010, revenues dropped a mere 4% and net income dropped 10%. It is very nimble and has managed operations beautifully even in the second worst recession in the last 100 years when unemployment hit 9.9%In spite of these positives, I still feel that the stock is overpriced relative to earnings and here are the reasons why:Broker estimates call for earning growth of 7 to 10% for the next two years each. Unless there is a dramatic change in the economy, it should be difficult to achieve anything higher. Paychex, like many other payroll services is totally dependent on employment improving and higher interest rates to make more interest income from the float it keeps. Paradoxically, if interest rates increase, employment takes a dive and if the Fed continues to keep interest rates low to revive unemployment, Paychex makes a negligible return on its investment income. A yield, which used to be 2.1% in 2010, is now down to 1.2% in 2012. In 2008, when Paychex made a whopping $576 M net or 28% of revenue, $132 M of that was interest alone! In 2011 it made a paltry $49 M!There are few growth catalysts and no moats. This is a simple cookie cutter business with a lot of substitutes - CPAs, online payroll services, payroll modules from accounting software such as Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU)'s QuickBooks, banks and self processed payroll. Paychex saw revenue growth from both its insurance and HR divisions of about 10% last year, but these are very small pieces and are not likely to have any impact on the bottom line for the next three to four years. Paychex also rightly acquired an online service to add to its product line, but this too will be a very small part of the overall business.This is not a sticky business - Paychex has a retention rate of 79% and besides price there is very little to distinguish service providers.Earnings growth of 7 to 10% doesn't justify price/earnings multiples of 20. At this price, unless earnings consistently surprise over the next two to three years it's difficult to see the stock not move sideways. Paychex has averaged high PEs of 16 to 20 relative to its 5 year earning CAGR of 2.3%.Paychex did throw up two good entry prices in 2010 and 2011 -- In August 2010 it dipped to $24.97 and again in August 2011 to $25.35 (during the great Washington gridlock and credit downgrade). These are opportunistic entry prices, which offer a lot more than the current dividend yield of 4%.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The article will contain the anatomy of the trade and what an investor can reasonable expect.OverviewPaychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a payroll processing company headquartered in New York. The company has a solid balance sheet as evidenced by the absence of debt and pays a 4.1% dividend (32 cents a share). PAYX has consistently paid quarterly dividend for more than ten years and competes in a stable predictable industry.Chart courtesy of Seeking AlphaTradeThe trade I would like to focus on is the Jan 2013 30 call. The call is currently trading at $3 and is $1.60 in the money. To enter into the trade the investor would have to purchase the stock first and sell a corresponding amount of options against the position. The trade works as follows: 100 shares purchased at $31.6 and 1 (30) strike call is sold against the position.The investor would receive $3 per share for the contract and if held to maturity the contract would be exercised at the end of business January 19 2013. At this point assuming the stock stays above $30 the shares will be sold to satisfy the contract and the proceeds will be deposited into your account. In the interim you will also collect a quarterly dividend of 32 cents per share.The investor would be paid $3 at the time the contract is sold and an additional 96 cents over the life of the contract. This works out to $2.4 total collected which is an 8% gain for an 11 month holding period. The trade offers the investor downside protection to $26.04 which would be in my opinion an excellent price to hold PAYX. I view this as a relatively conservative approach to generating a satisfactory return with limited risk.PAYX Expiration Months: Feb12 | Mar12 | Jun12 | Sep12 | Jan13 | Jan14Option chain courtesy of Options XpressFor the more aggressive trader the same strategy can be applied but at a higher strike price. The Jan 2013 35 call is currently trading at 80 cents. Using the same time frame as above the investor would generate an additional 96 cents in dividends for a total of $1.76 cents.The difference in the two trades is the strike price. At the 35 strike the stock has to appreciate from the current level. Assuming it does, $1.76 is collected plus $3.4 capital gains (35-31.6 purchase price). The trade would generate a very acceptable 13.79% gain. Some downside protection would be lost since the strike price is out of the money. In this example the downside protection would be $29.89 (premium plus dividends).In summary each trade in my opinion offers an acceptable return with some downside protection. I anticipate selling the 35 call in the next few trading days. Thank you for reading and I would appreciate any feedback.Disclosure: I am long PAYX.Additional disclosure: I intend to sell the 35 calls against my position in the next few trading days."
461731,20568,2012-03-27T16:33:01-04:00,,"Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) is scheduled to announce its third quarter fiscal 2012 results on March 28 after the closing bell, and we notice no movement in analyst estimates at this point.Second Quarter OverviewPaychex delivered modest second quarter 2012 results, with earnings of 39 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The quarter's results indicate slow recovery in the small and medium business (BATS:SMB) sector due to deceleration in high unemployment and inflation rates.Paychex' second quarter revenues grew 6.6% year over year, backed by increases of 12.5% in Human Resource Service revenue and 4.8% in Payroll Service revenue.A modest revenue growth and better cost management led to operating margin expansion of 640 basis points year over year. Nevertheless, Paychex seemed a bit cautious about the fiscal 2012 guidance.Keeping in view the current market and economic condition, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate through fiscal 2012, impacting quarterly comparisons for both Payroll Service and Human Resource Service revenues.Moreover, Paychex believes that the favorability in expenses realized in the second quarter may not be realized throughout fiscal 2012 due to the planned investments in its business.Out of the 20 and 23 analysts providing estimates for the third quarter and fiscal 2012, respectively, none made any revision in the last 30 days. Also, no change was noticed in the estimates provided for fiscal 2013.But some analysts prefer to remain cautious based on management's commentary regarding the sluggishness in new small-business formation. Moreover, a few analysts think that aggressive pricing from Automated Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) is stealing customers away from Paychex.The time difference between when the company receives payments from its clients and pays it out to employees typically earns some interest for Paychex. Now, with the government contemplating lower interest rates, this quick income stream of the company will also be restricted.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThere was no change in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter or fiscal 2012 over the past 30 days. We also see that there was no change in estimates over the past 90 days, implying that analysts have stuck to their estimates post second quarter results.RecommendationThe market is losing confidence on the growth of the SMB group. The sector is being hit hard by lackluster demand that comes on the heels of high unemployment and inflation rates. Outsourcing companies like Paychex are highly dependent on the performance of the SMB sector and this is the reason why it may not see much revenue growth.However, we are encouraged by management's positive commentary regarding continued investments in product development and synergies from the recent acquisition. We also believe that cost control will play an important role for Paychex, going forward.Though new business wins in the SMB sector, and stiff competition from Automated Data Processing and Administaff Inc. will remain a constant worry, we believe that Paychex can benefit from the improvement in the U.S. employment situation. Hence, considering the situation and keeping in mind Paychex' consistency in delivering impressive results and zero European exposure, we expect a constructive quarter ahead.Paychex has a Zacks # 3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation.AUTOMATIC DATA (ADP): Free Stock Analysis ReportPAYCHEX INC (PAYX): Free Stock Analysis Report"

314822,20568,2011-12-19T14:54:50-05:00,,"Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)  is scheduled to announce its second quarter fiscal 2012 results on  December 20, and we notice no movement in analyst estimates at this  point.First Quarter OverviewPaychex delivered decent first quarter 2011 results, with earnings of  41 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3 cents. The  quarterâs results indicated an improving client retention rate and  higher checks per client, but lower sale of new units remained an  overhang.Paychexâ first quarter revenues grew 8.6% year over year, backed by  increases of 16.6% in Human Resource Service revenue and 6.0% in Payroll  Service revenue.A modest revenue growth and better cost management led to operating  margin expansion of 340 basis points year over year. Nevertheless,  Paychex seemed to be a bit cautious about the fiscal 2012 guidance.Keeping in view the current market and economic condition, Paychex  believes that checks per client will moderate through fiscal 2012,  impacting quarterly comparisons for both Payroll Service and Human  Resource Service revenues.Moreover, Paychex believes that the favorability in expenses realized  in the first quarter may not be realized throughout fiscal 2012 due to  the planned investments in its business.Out of the 18 and 20 analysts providing estimates for the second  quarter and fiscal 2012, respectively, none made any revision in the  last thirty days. Also, no change was noticed in the estimates provided  for fiscal 2013.But some analysts prefer to remain cautious based on managementâs  commentary regarding the sluggishness in new small-business formation.  Moreover, a few analysts think that aggressive pricing from Automated Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) is stealing customers away from Paychex.The time difference between when the company receives payments from its  clients and pays it out to employees typically earns some interest for  Paychex. Now, with the government contemplating lower interest rates,  this quick income stream of the company will also be restricted.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThere was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second  quarter or fiscal 2012 over the past 30 days. However, the Zacks  Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 inched up a penny to $1.51 in the  past ninety days.RecommendationThe market is losing confidence on the growth of the small and medium  business (BATS:SMB) group. The sector is being hit hard by lackluster demand  that comes on the heels of high unemployment and inflation rates.  Outsourcing companies like Paychex are highly dependent on the  performance of the SMB sector and this is the reason why the company may  not see much revenue growth.However, we are encouraged by managementâs positive commentary  regarding continued investments in product development and synergies  from the recent acquisition. We also believe that cost control will play  an important role for Paychex, going forward.Though new business wins in the SMB sector will remain a constant  worry, we believe that Paychex can benefit from the improvement in the  U.S. employment situation. Hence, considering the situation and keeping  in mind Paychexâ consistency in delivering impressive results and zero  European exposure, we expect a constructive quarter ahead.Paychex has a Zacks # 2 Rank, implying a short-term Buy recommendation.

315350,20568,2011-12-21T13:35:49-05:00,,"Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) reported second-quarter fiscal 2012 earnings of 39 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The quarterâs results indicate slow recovery in the small and medium business (SMB) sector. Paychex is highly dependent on the performance of the SMB sector. The sector is being hit hard by lackluster demand due to high unemployment and inflation rates. Shares decreased 1.62% in after-market trade.RevenuesPaychex reported second-quarter 2012 revenues of $545.7 million, up 6.6% from $512.0 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The upside can be attributed to year-over-year growth in both checks processed per client and the HR services client base.The Payroll Service segment revenue increased 4.8% from the year-ago quarter to $371.7 million, attributable to the contribution from SurePayroll Inc., acquired in February. Excluding the SurePayroll contribution, Payroll revenue would have grown only 3.0%.Continued increase in checks processed per client, as well as revenue per checks, also aided the growth. But the growth was not at par with the historical trend. Moreover, the increase in new unit sales was sluggish, due to the limited number of new companies commencing business during the quarter.The Human Resource Services segment generated $163.3 million in revenues, up 12.5% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was partly based on the contribution from ePlan Services, which was acquired in May. Excluding ePlan, Human Resource Servicesâ revenue growth would have been 10.0%.The number of client employees served and the number of clients grew during the quarter, contributing to the improvement. Moreover, demand for a new product, HR Essentials, also added to the segmentâs revenue growth.Operating ResultsIn the second quarter, Paychex incurred total operating expense of $327.8 million, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter. The rise was mainly due to acquisition-related costs as well as the companyâs continued efforts to train sales personnel, provide better customer service and enhance technological infrastructure.Operating income was $217.9 million, up 6.9% from the year-ago period, attributable to modest revenue growth and better cost management. Operating margin grew 640 basis points year over year to 41.7%.Net income of $140.4 million in the reported quarter reflected a 4.9% increase from $133.9 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income per diluted share was 39 cents compared with 37 cents in the year-ago quarter. There was no one-time item during the quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowPaychex exited the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $96.1 million, down from $113.1 million at the end of the prior quarter. Corporate investments decreased $57.0 million sequentially to $315.0 million.Additionally, interest on funds held for clients decreased 10.8% year over year to $10.7 million as a result of lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by an increase in average investment balances. Paychex has no long-term debt.Cash from operations was $110.0 million compared to $187.2 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditures were $23.9 million compared to $20.2 million in the prior quarter.GuidanceKeeping the current market and economic conditions in view, Paychex believes that checks per client will moderate through fiscal 2012, impacting quarterly comparisons for both Payroll Service and Human Resource Services revenues. Moreover, the favorability in expenses realized in the second quarter may not be realized throughout fiscal 2012 due to the planned investments in its business. Hence, Paychex reaffirmed its full-year guidance.For fiscal 2012, Paychex expects a 5â7% increase in Payroll Service revenues compared to the year-ago quarter. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 12.0% to 15.0%. Total service revenue is likely to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. The company expects a 12â14% decline in interest on funds held for clients and a roughly 2% increase in net investment income.Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal 2012 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment. However, investment of cash generated from operations is expected to continue, increasing investment income. Net operating income is expected in the range of 35â36% of total service revenue. The effective tax rate is expected to be in line with the second quarter and net margin is projected at between 5% and 7%.The guidance for fiscal 2012 includes anticipated results from Paychexâ recent acquisition of SurePayroll Inc. and its ePlan Services. The acquisitions are expected to have an approximately 2% positive impact on revenue, nonetheless resulting in earnings dilution of around 1 cent per share due to amortization on acquired intangible assets and some one-time acquisition costs.Our TakePaychexâ second quarter results were modest, with the bottom line exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by mere a penny. We are also positive on managementâs positive commentary regarding continued investments in product development and synergies from the recent acquisition. We also believe that cost control will remain a catalyst for Paychex, going forward.Though new business wins in the SMB sector and stiff competition from Automated Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) and Administaff Inc. will remain a constant worry, we believe that Paychex can benefit from the improvement in the U.S. employment situation and zero European exposure.Paychex has a Zacks # 2 Rank, implying a short-term Buy recommendation.Disclosure: No positions"
350531,24492,2012-02-08T12:30:55-05:00,,"Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) has been a dividend income stand out for years. Paychex has been a wonderful business for income investors. The stock operates in a mundane but mandatory business segment to comply with state taxation regulations and Internal Revenue Service laws. The company excels at its services. The stock yields a stagnant 4% dividend yield. In this article I will focus on three core reasons to sell Paychex and focus upon better dividend paying stocks.1. Paychex has failed to beat the SP500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) over the past five years and 10 years. In fact, the SP500 beat Paychex by a 2.7% total annualized rate of return over a 10 year period. This is not acceptable for income investors. Paychex did, however, beat the SP500 by a 3.5% total annualized rate of return over a 15-year window.2. Paychex has increased its past two quarterly dividends to 32 cents per share. This is an annual dividend of $1.28 for 2012. The company did not increase the dividend from 2008 through 2010. The dividend payout ratio, in 2008 through 2010, was 84% of net income. Historically the payout ratio has been in the mid 50% range.As employment has suffered in the United States, so has Paychex's ability to attract new clientele. In my opinion, employment growth is not increasing. There was seasonal hiring in the fourth quarter of 2011. If unemployment rates truly decrease, then Paychex could reap financial benefits due to increased revenue.3. Investing requires focusing upon the right sectors. In a time when job losses are significant, investors should minimize their exposure to this sector. Paychex cannot excel if the sector is suffering.Strong Sector Idea:One sector that is very strong is the agency mortgage real estate investment trust. This sector benefits by low Treasury Bond yields. The company borrows money at short-term rates and invests this money in higher yielding Federal Guaranteed agency mortgage backed securities. One of the best performing companies in this sector is American Capital Agency (NASDAQ:AGNC).The company offers a 17% annual dividend yield. American Capital Agency has returned a 27.5% total annualized rate of return for five years compared with Paychex's -.5% return over the same time frame.American Capital is just one idea to replace Paychex in your portfolio. The right sector is essential to outperforming the market and increasing one's net worth.OverviewFounded in 1971, Paychex is a Rochester, New York, based company that provides business services to small and medium enterprises - payroll and tax administration, human resource management, expense reports management, benefits administration, recruitment, and time and labor management. Most of its products are hosted online, easy to access anytime, anywhere, and significantly improve overall productivity. Paychex services over 564,000 clients from 100 offices nationwide.Business StrategyPaychex is a mature company with a stable business model and fairly regular repeat revenue because its solutions typically lock clients in for multiple years with high switching costs. For example, moving from one payroll administrator to another is something a company would rather not do unless there are very compelling reasons. Paychex has diversified over the years from its core payroll business into ancillary solutions such as human resources that make it more deeply entrenched with clients. In 2011 alone, Paychex acquired SurePayroll, Inc., and ePlan Services, Inc., as part of its revenue growth strategy. Moreover, by moving to a hosted online model, what's called ""software-as-a-service"" or SaaS, and by offering mobile access to its product suite, Paychex continues to innovate in line with key industry trends, thereby enhancing its competitiveness.FinancialsPaychex' financial year starts in June. For the twelve month period ended November 30, 2011, Paychex reported total revenue of $2.16 billion, operating income of 829.3 million and net income of 538.8 million, with a very healthy 24.9% net margin. Paychex ended its November 30, 2011, quarter with cash of $96.1 million, total assets of $4.9 billion, zero debt, $1.56 billion in shareholders' equity and $110 million in cash from operating activities. Revenue has been fairly stable over the past five years.DividendsOver the 12 months ended November 30, 2011, Paychex paid $1.25 in dividends (3.9% dividend yield). In its second quarter ended November 30, 2011, Paychex increased its quarterly dividend from 31 cents to 32 cents, on earnings per share of 39 cents, paying out fully 82% of earnings per share as its quarterly dividend. In fiscal 2011, Paychex had earnings per share of $1.42 of which it paid $1.24 or 87.3%, as cash dividend per common share. Such high payouts signify limited upside in near-term dividend increases.SharesAs of February 2012, Paychex shares traded in the $32 range with a fairly tight 52-week range of $25.12 to $33.91, a market cap of $11.6 billion and a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.4x. The below chart shows analysts' growth projections for dividends and earnings. The dividend increases, in my opinion, appear to be overly enthusiastic.Peer GroupPaychex serves small to medium businesses, a market that is fairly fragmented and serviced by local providers and leading national players. Leading national players include industry giant Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), Ceridian and Intuit, and by companies such as AccountantsWorld, CompuPay, Paycom, Payroll People, TimePlus Payroll and others.Automatic Data Processing is the biggest entrant in the payroll processing field. The company is the country's largest provider of business outsourcing solutions. Automatic Data Processing has approximately 570,000 customers. The company has a market cap of $26 billion and yields a 2.8% dividend.ActionPaychex is a conservative company with zero debt and a stable revenue stream. It serves a large market segment - small and medium enterprises - but has significant competition. It has been smart about expanding its product range and driving its grip deeper on each client account, about adopting cloud computing and Saas applications. In addition, Paychex has been developing mobile apps for the iPad2, and by selectively growing through acquisition. Paychex will continue to grow its revenue base over time, albeit slowly. With a stagnant dividend payout, this is a company to sell because Paychex is a good company operating in the wrong sector.I would recommend selling Paychex. Identify stocks that are operating in the economy's strong sectors. These stocks offer higher yielding dividends and capital appreciation. In my opinion, Paychex's 4% dividend yield can clearly be beat with the right stock in the right sector.Disclosure: I am long AGNC."

This can be a wonderful source of investor revenue and with each dividend payment received, investors are able to lower their risk in an investment. Many investors will buy a stock in part because of the dividend and the current yield. The one basic requirement to receive a dividend payout from a company is to be a shareholder on the day of record for the dividend.Investors can read about many dividend capturing strategies, most of them work better on paper than they do in practice. I tried just about everything over the years, and I learned quickly it is better to use a sim account first. I generally hold the position for about three weeks. Now I use a few methods that produce consistent results. With the gains made, I am able to stop out and take a loss with the few that do not work out as planned. Covered call dividend capturing is an easy-to-understand method of making gains with dividend capturing. I use options to partially hedge my carry risk during the time needed to qualify for the dividend. Although much of the gains will come from dividends, it should be noted in my experience, the option decay can provide a return. This is especially true in lower yielding stocks. Paychex, Inc.

The options offer some level of protection from possible down moves in the stock, and provide revenue to cover the times that the options do not fully cover down moves in the stock.

When learning a new trading strategy it is better to use a simulated trading account first. It is easy to make mistakes when starting out on a new strategy and mistakes cost a lot less with a simulated account. After a level of confidence is built, then it may be time to move into a real money account. In this article we will go over an upcoming dividend with Paychex that I may capture with a minimum amount of risk. The criteria that I use is that I must be able to sell a call option in either the front, or first back month that is in the money, and with enough premium that I will not mind getting exercised early (which happens often and can be a good thing if the trades are executed correctly).StrategyIn combination with my buying Paychex stock and after checking company updates, offer to sell the February $32.00 strike call for $0.16 over the intrinsic value. The option may get exercised early for a gain. In almost all cases I will sell the call option first to ensure the stock option leg is complete first. If not, after qualifying for the dividend, I will attempt to close out the trade with a gain of near $0.05 plus the dividend received.It is important to sell the call option hedge at or near the asking price for at least the minimum amount over intrinsic value. I will not want to try putting on the hedge unless the sale of the option (hedge) will provide at least the full $0.16 over intrinsic value. If my shares get called away the day before they trade ex-dividend as a result of the option buyer wanting the dividend I will make about $0.16. Not all that great but not bad for about a week of owning the stock. The most I can make is $0.48 if I hold the covered call through option expiration day and the stock gets called away.My last step (completed before making a trade on the same day) is to check company announcements, and news sources for possible events that may cause the stock price to move.

Though the  quarterâs results indicate an improving client retention rate and higher  checks per client, lower sale of new units remains an overhang. Shares  increased 1.91% in after-market trade.RevenuesPaychex reported first-quarter 2012 revenues of $563.1 million, up 8.6%  from $518.3 million reported in the year-ago quarter. The upside can be  attributed to year-over-year growth in both checks processed per client  and the HR services client base.Payroll Service segment revenue increased 6.0% from the year-ago  quarter to $382.3 million, attributable to the contribution from  SurePayroll Inc., acquired in February. Excluding the SurePayroll  contribution, Payroll revenue would have grown only 4.0%.Continued growth in checks processed per client as well as revenue per  checks also aided the growth. However, the increase in new unit sales  was sluggish, due to the limited number of new companies commencing  business during the quarter.The Human Resource Services segment generated $169.7 million in  revenues, up 16.6% from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was  partly due to the contribution from ePlan Services, which was acquired  in May. Excluding ePlan, Human Resource Servicesâ revenue growth would  have been 14%.The number of client employees served and the number of clients grew  during the quarter, contributing to the improvement. Moreover, demand  for a new product, HR Essentials, also added to the segmentâs revenue  growth.Operating ResultsIn the first quarter, Paychex incurred total operating expense of  $333.4 million, up 5.0% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was  mainly due to acquisition-related costs as well as the companyâs  continued efforts to train sales personnel, provide better customer  service and enhance technological infrastructure.Operating income was $229.7 million, up 14.4% from the year-ago period,  attributable to modest revenue growth and better cost management.  Operating margin grew 340 basis points year over year to 43.9%.Net income of $148.9 million in the reported quarter reflected a 12.9%  increase from $131.9 million in the prior-year quarter.

There was no one-time item during the quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowPaychex exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  $113.1 million, down from $119.0 million at the end of the prior  quarter. The lower cash balance was due to cash used up in investing and  financing activities. Corporate investments increased $27.0 million  sequentially to $372.0 million.Additionally, interest on funds held for clients decreased 8.3% year  over year to $11.1 million as a result of lower average interest rates  earned, partially offset by an increase in average investment balances.

The  quarterâs results indicated an improving client retention rate and  higher checks per client, but lower sale of new units remained an  overhang.Paychexâ fourth quarter revenues grew 5.3% year over year backed by  increases of 8.7% in Human Resources Services revenue and 4.6% in the  Payroll Service revenue. But the reported revenue was below the Zacks  Consensus Estimate.Total operating costs increased 5.4% year over year, reflecting higher  acquisition and training costs, partially offset by a higher utilization  rate and lower headcount.

However, out of the 18  analysts providing estimates for fiscal 2012, one raised the estimate in  the last 7 days while another reduced the estimate in the last 30 days.The nominal change to first quarter estimates point to the fact that  there was no major catalyst during the quarter that could drive results.  Consequently, the analysts are sticking to their estimates projected  post fourth quarter earnings.But some analysts prefer to remain cautious based on managementâs  commentary of not seeing a significant sign of improvement in new  small-business formation. Moreover, a few analysts think that aggressive  pricing from Automated Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) is stealing away customers from Paychex.The time difference between when the company receives payroll from its  clients and pays it out to employees typically earns some interest for  Paychex. Now, with the government contemplating to keep interest rates  low, this quick income stream of the company will also be restricted.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThere was no change to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first  quarter or fiscal 2012 over the past 30 days. However, the Zacks  Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 went down a penny to $1.50 in the  past ninety days.RecommendationThe market is losing confidence on the growth of the small and medium  business (BATS:SMB) group. The sector is being hit hard by lackluster demand  that comes on the heels of high unemployment and inflation rates.  Outsourcing companies like Paychex are highly dependent on the  performance of the SMB sector and this is the reason that the company  may be not see much revenue growth.However, we remain positive on managementâs positive commentary  regarding continued investments in product development and synergies  from the recent acquisition. We also believe that cost control will  remain a catalyst for Paychex, going forward.On the other hand, we are slightly concerned about the growing  competition in the outsourcing space from big players such as Automated  Data Processing Inc. and Administaff Inc., as well as limited margin  expansion due to continuous investments in diverse fields.Paychex has a Zacks # 3 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation."
291609,24604,2011-09-05T05:35:14-04:00,,"What is happening to Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX)? In case you donât already know PAYX provides payroll services, automatic salary check deposit services, automatic payroll tax services, and tax return filing services to over 536,000 small businesses nationwide, through some 100 offices in 36 states and Germany. It has no debt whatsoever, no preferred stock and no defined benefit pension plan, so its financial strength remains very strong. It also pays a nice generous annual dividend of $1.24/share. The economy has been very weak, especially to the small business arena, whose customer base PAYX serves. That, coupled with abnormally low interest rates has cut into interest earned on funds (IEF) held for PAYX clients despite higher balances. At one time those funds added substantially to the bottom line. During fiscal 2007 when PAYX earned $1.35/share on net income of $515.4 million, IEF had contributed over $134 million. As the recession took hold in 2008-9 and interest rates fell drastically, IEF continued to nosedive.And by 2010, net income had dropped to almost $477 million or $1.32/share of which IEFâs contribution had diminished to $55 million. However, in fiscal 2011 net income rebounded to $515.3 million or $1.42/share, while income earned from clients funds continued to fall, decreasing by 13% to $48.1 million. It appears to me that PAYX is relying less and less on IEF to grow profits. Looking at the annual $1.24 dividend, there has not been an increase since September 2008, but at current prices the 4.6% yield is secure and well covered by cash assets of $464 million and operating cash flow of some $715 million. As I have said before, I like to get paid while I am waiting and accumulating. Paychex has a market cap of $9.7 billion, and shares are down 16% since the 1st of this year. The company has a P/E ratio of 18, less than the S&P 500 P/E ratio of 20.2.  Insiders own 10.7%, and Capital World another 7.7%, of the 362 million outstanding shares. Another thought I have had is the possibility of a PAYX buy-out. Mr. Tomas Golisano, born in 1942, founded Paychex in 1971 and is Chairman of the board of the company. He also owns over 10% of the outstanding shares. So who would want to buy a company that has no debt, no preferred stock and no defined benefit pension plan? And why would Tom Golisano want to sell? One buyer pops into my head and that is Warren Buffett. Warren likes  companies whose business model he understands. Being no fool, he also prefers companies that are financially strong, have been around a while, and have brand name recognition. As to why Tom would want to sell PAYX; he is a billionaire philanthropist, with numerous outside interests, one of which is being the owner of the Buffalo Sabres Hockey team. Then there is his 3 failed attempts at being elected Governor of New York. He moved to Florida in 2009, he said âto escape New York Taxes.â All these things lead me to believe he could be ripe to move on and retire.  Anybody else have thoughts along these lines?

In Paychex's (NASDAQ:PAYX) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $30 per share, which is where it is recently closed (our report on Paychex and other companies can be found here).For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more information on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Paychex scores a 6 on our scale (reflecting its fair value and bullish technicals). We'd wait for a pullback below the mid-$20s before adding it to our Best Ideas list.Our Report on Paychex (Click to enlarge)Investment Considerations (Click to enlarge)Investment HighlightsPaychex earns a ValueCreationâ¢ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 130.7% from 123.4% during the next two years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $23, we'd take a closer look.Paychex has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 24.2% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 4.3%. We expect the firm to pay out about 84% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends. The firm remains on our dividend-growth watch list in our Dividend Growth Newsletter.(Click to enlarge)Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Paychex 's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 118.8%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreationâ¢ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Cash Flow Analysis (Click to enlarge)Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Paychex 's free cash flow margin has averaged about 28.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Paychex , cash flow from operations increased about 4% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 55% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Paychex 's shares are worth between $23.00 - $38.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRiskâ¢ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $30 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 21.1 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 6.2% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 0.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 35.2%, which is above Paychex 's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Paychex, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $30 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRiskâ¢ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Paychex . We think the firm is attractive below $23 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $38 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Paychex's fair value at this point in time to be about $30 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Paychex 's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $36 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $30 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.(Click to enlarge)Pro Forma Financial Statements (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

In looking back at PAYX's session-to-session performance following after-hours earnings, we've found the stock is typically a decent next-day mover. It has put up more aggressive percentage closing moves in next-day trading following 16 of the last 25 earnings events that we've tracked. Near term, the stock is mixed, widening twice and reversing direction twice over the last four quarters.   Looking deeper into the performance data, PAYX hasn't recorded too many earnings-driven after-hours upside moves, but when it does it consistently follows that evening trade with more aggressive next-day regular session upside action. PAYX has moved higher in after-hours trade following 10 of the 25 quarters we've tracked, and in six of those events longs were treated to more robust next-day upside moves than those seen in the after-hours.   On the short side, PAYX favors seeing deeper next-day moves into the red following earnings-driven after-hours declines.

Zacks sees FY 2012 coming in at $1.51 even with the current unemployment situation. Until the brutal recession of 2008-09 intervened, PAYX had posted years of positive comparisons and higher dividends. Here are their per-share, split adjusted numbers from FY 1995 through FY 2011.The dividend has not been increased since 2009 due to the recession-induced EPS dip. The payout ratio of about 87.3% is high but very sustainable due to the company's lack of debt and very low capital spending requirements. At Mondayâs close of $29.40 the current yield is an attractive 4.21%.Not only is that near the rate on a 30-year Treasury but itâs arguably, safer. Unlike a fixed income vehicle, longer term holders of PAYX should see a dividend increase in the reasonable future. Simply buying and holding Paychex would probably work out quite well. If youâre approved for, and understand option writing, hereâs an even better way to achieve very attractive returns.

PAYX is set to report its Q3 results after the closing bell tonight, and analysts polled by Thomson Reuters are expecting the company to report a profit of $0.35 per share on revenue of $528 million.  In looking back at PAYX session-to-session performance following after-hours earnings, we've found the stock is typically a decent next-day mover.

(NASDAQ:PAYX)  is scheduled to announce its third quarter fiscal 2011 results on March  24, and we do not see any major variation in analyst estimates at this  point.Second Quarter OverviewPaychex delivered modest second quarter 2011 results, with earnings of  37 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by two cents.  The quarterâs results indicated an improving client retention rate and  selling operations.Paychexâs second quarter revenues increased 3.1% year over year to  $512.0 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $511.0  million. The improvement was attributed to year-over-year growth in both  checks processed per client and the retirement services client base.Payroll Service revenues were down 1.1% from the year-ago quarter, due  to a 2.5% growth in checks processed per client and an increase in  pricing per check.Revenues from the Human Resources Services segment  grew 9.8% from the year-ago quarter driven by the positive impact of the  Healthcare Reform Act passed in the U.S. and increased hiring.Paychex generated operating income of $203.9 million, up 5.6% from the  year-ago quarter and net income of $133.9 million, up 6.4% year over  year. The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  $233.2 million.Paychex witnessed a modest improvement in the quarterâs results on  increasing headcount and price per employee. Despite economic  uncertainties and low interest rates, Paychex provided an encouraging  guidance. Considering improving business trends, the company raised its  guidance for Payroll Services revenue, Investment Income and net  operating margin.GuidanceFor fiscal 2011, Paychex expects Payroll Service revenues to increase  in the range of 1â2% from the year-ago quarter (previously flat year  over year). Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in  the range of 10.0% to 13.0%. Total service revenue is likely to grow in  the range of 3% to 5%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected  to decrease in the range of 12% to 17%, while net investment income is  likely to increase in the range of 29% to 32% (previously 24% to 27%).Interest on funds held for clients and investment income for fiscal  2011 are expected to be impacted by the low interest rate environment.  However, investment income is expected to benefit from the ongoing  investment of cash generated from operations.Net operating income is expected to be 36% (previously 34â35%) of total  service revenue. The effective tax rate is estimated at roughly 35% and  the net margin between 4% and 6%.The guidance for fiscal 2011 does not include any anticipated results  from Paychexâs recent acquisition of SurePayroll Inc. However, earnings  dilution is expected to be approximately 1 cent per share due to  amortization on acquired intangible assets and one-time acquisition  costs.Agreement of AnalystsOut of the nineteen analysts providing estimates for the third quarter,  only one moved upward in the last thirty days. There was no downward  revision for the quarter. Further, there were no upward or downward  estimate revisions for fiscal year 2011 or 2012.The limited number of changes to estimates also point to the fact that  there was no major catalyst during the quarter that could drive results.  Consequently, the analysts are sticking to the estimates projected post  second quarter earnings. But the analysts are positive about Paychexâ  key business indicators such as, checks per client, revenue per check  and client retention.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThere were no changes to analyst estimates for the third quarter or  fiscal year 2011 over the past 30 days. However, the Zacks Consensus  Estimate for the third quarter inched up by a penny over the past ninety  days. Moreover, the Estimate for fiscal 2011 went up to $1.41 from  $1.38 in the past ninety days. We also note that the Zacks Consensus  Estimate for fiscal 2012 has gone up by two cents to $1.51 since the  second quarter.The upside in estimates, though minor, indicates positive investor  sentiment, which might have been backed by an upbeat guidance and  positive fundamentals.RecommendationA recent survey conducted by Paychex indicates that roughly 50% of  small business owners expect to see growth momentum in their businesses  in fiscal 2011, although some of them expressed concern regarding  government regulations. Since small businesses make a major contribution  to the companyâs total revenue, we can expect healthy inputs in the  coming quarters.We also look forward to a positive contribution by Paychexâs Human  Resource Services segment, as there has been a steady increase in  clients over the past few quarters.On the other hand, we are slightly concerned about growing competition in the outsourcing space from big players such as Automated Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) and Administaff Inc. (ASF),  as well as limited margin expansion due to continuous investments in  diverse fields. But we expect the SurePayroll acquisition to provide  Paychex with additional small business market share and revenue growth.Paychex has a Zacks Rank # 2, implying a short-term Buy recommendation."

The quarterâs results indicated an improving client retention rate and higher checks per client.Paychexâs third quarter revenues increased 4.6% year over year, backed by increases of 9.8% in Human Resources Services revenue and 2.3% in the Payroll Service revenue.Paychex generated operating income of $198.9 million, up 18.3% from the year-ago quarter and net income of $130.6 million, up 16.6% year over year. The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $236.0 million.Paychex witnessed a modest improvement in the quarterâs results despite an increasing headcount and price per employee. However, following historical trends Paychex guided to a lackluster fourth quarter.GuidancePaychex expects a weak fourth quarter, given lower contribution from HR Service revenue, which happens to be less predictive and depends much on employee retention or addition and unmatched workersâ compensation.For fiscal 2011, Paychex continues to expect a 1â2% increase in Payroll Service revenues from the year-ago quarter. Human Resource Services revenues are expected to increase in the range of 10.0% to 11.0% (previously 10.0% to 13.0%).Total service revenue is likely to grow in the range of 3% to 5% (reiterated).

However, out of the 22 analysts providing estimates for fiscal year 2011, one reduced the estimate in the same time period.The nominal change to estimates also point to the fact that there was no major catalyst during the quarter that could drive results. Consequently, the analysts are sticking to their estimates projected post third quarter earnings.But some analysts prefer to remain cautious based on managementâs commentary of not seeing a significant sign of improvement in new small-business formation. Moreover, a few analysts think that aggressive pricing from Automated Data Processing Inc. (ADP) is taking away more customers from Paychex.In the short span between the time when Paychex receives payroll from its clients and pays it out to employees, the company earns an interest. Now with the government contemplating to keep interest rates low despite an economic revival, this quick income stream of the company will also be restricted.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThere was no change to analyst estimates for the fourth quarter or fiscal 2011 over the past 30 days.

The quarterâs results  are indicative of an improving client retention rate and the companyâs  efforts to improve selling operations.RevenuesPaychex reported  second-quarter 2011 revenues of $512.0 million, surpassing the Zacks  Consensus Estimate of $511.0 million and up 3.1% from the $496.6 million  reported in the year-ago quarter. The revenue upside can be attributed  to year-over-year growth in both checks processed per client and the  retirement services client base.Payroll Service  segment revenues increased 1.1% from the year-ago quarter to $354.8  million, attributable to a 2.5% growth in checks processed per client  and an increase in pricing per check. However, the Payroll client-base  fell 2.2% from the year-ago quarter. Paychex stated that the improvement  in checks per client was primarily driven by an increase in corporate  hiring and a higher retention rate.The Human Resource  Services segment generated $145.2 million in revenues, up 9.8% from the  prior-year quarter. Both the number of client employees served and the  number of clients grew in the last quarter, contributing to the  increase. The relatively strong performance was on account of the  positive impact of the recently passed Health Care Reform Act in the  U.S., as well as from increased hiring and retirement expenses per  employee.Operating ResultsIn the second  quarter, Paychex incurred total operating expense of $308.1 million, up  1.5% from the year-ago quarter. Total expense increased due to the  companyâs continued effort to train sales personnel, provide better  customer service and enhance technological infrastructure. However, the  increase was partially offset by a higher utilization rate and lower  headcount.Operating income  was $203.9 million, up 5.6% from the year-ago period, attributable to  modest revenue growth and better cost management. Operating margin  increased 90 basis points year over year to 39.8%.Net income of  $133.9 million in the reported quarter increased 6.4% from $125.8  million in the prior-year quarter. Net income per diluted share was 37  cents compared with 35 cents in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowPaychex exited the  second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $233.2 million, down  from $272.9 million at the end of the prior quarter. Corporate  investments increased $53.1 million to $230.3 million. Additionally,  during the second quarter, interest on funds held for clients decreased  11.8% year over year to $12.0 million as a result of lower average  interest rates earned, partially offset by a 3% increase in average  investment balances.Cash from  operations grew from $92.5 million in the prior-year quarter to $124.9  million in the reported quarter. Capital expenditures also increased  $14.5 million to $27.5 million.GuidanceFor fiscal 2011,  Paychex expects Payroll Service revenues to increase in the range of  1%â2% from the year-ago quarter (previously flat year over year).

Considering the  improving business trends, the company raised its guidance for Payroll  Services revenue, Investment Income and net operating margin.Some analysts  believe that there are downside risks to forward earnings estimates,  given the lower contribution from new business that has been impacted by  the fall in small business employment and lower interest rates earned.  Since small businesses make a major contribution to the companyâs total  revenue, we remain unsure about when Paychex could return to  double-digit revenue growth. However, we look forward to a positive  contribution from Paychexâs Human Resource Services segment, as there  has been a steady increase in clients over the past few quarters.However, we remain concerned about escalating competition in the outsourcing space from big players such as Automated Data Processing Inc.

A variety of insurance products are also made available through Paychex Insurance Agency.Strong BrandIn 1971,B.Thomas Golisano started Paychex   with    just   $3,000,    one employee and a great ideaâto make payroll   ou tsourcing easy and affordable for small businesses. Today, Paychex boasts $2 billion in revenue and offers an ever-growing variety of payroll and human resource products from calculating payroll and filing tax payments  to  administering  retirement plans and worker compensation.Mr. Golisano continues to serve as Paychexâs chairman of the board and is the companyâs largest shareholder, owning 10.5% of the companyâs stock.

There are over 11 million businesses in the markets Paychex serves  with  only  a  15%  penetration rate by the industryâproviding plenty of future growth opportunities.The company also is focusing on selling complimentary services to its payroll clients in all markets with growth rates in human resource services outpacing payroll growth.With  over  $11  billion  in  assets  and 51,000  clients,  Paychex  continues  to be a leader in 401(k) recordkeeping by servicing one in every ten 401(k) plans in the country.

Nearly   100,000 small businesses use Paychex for their insurance needs.Profitable BusinessTurbulent  economic  times and high unemployment  have    proven  challenging for Paychexâs operations in   recent   years   as   many   small businesses   have  struggled.                 In addition, low interest rates negatively impact the investment income earned on      funds   held        for      clients    and corporate  investments.  As  a  result, the  companyâs  sales  have  flat-lined over           the       last    three    years    with earnings growing backwards.While management remains cautious on fiscal 2011, first quarter results were encouraging. Total revenues increased 4% to $518 million with net income increasing 7% to $132 million due to modest improvements in economic conditions            and     annual price                  increases.         Despite difficult business   conditions,  Paychexâs operations remain highly profitable. Excellent net profit margins have averaged  more  than  26%  over  the last     five            years,        which        have contributed   to    the    companyâs outstandin g                   35%     r eturn              on shareholdersâ equity averaged over the same period.These high returns are even more impressive when one considers that the company operates with     a           cash-rich          and       debt-free balance sheet. As of 8-31-10, the company boasted more than $700 million       in          corporate                       cash    and investments and no long-term debt.Generous Dividend Yield With    minimal   capital   expenditure needs,       the        company          generates bountiful free cash flows which have averaged  more  than  $600  million annually  over  the  last  three  years despite   the   challenging   economic environment. Paychex has returned most of this cash to shareholders by repurchasing $1 billion of its stock in 2008   and   paying   close   to   $450 million in dividends annually over the last three years.The stock dividend currently  yields  a  generous  4.5%, and management remains intent on maintaining   its         strong   dividend policy.

239725,20944,2010-12-02T14:07:47-05:00,,"Why are analysts and economists surprised when jobless claims stay  high or are higher than âconsensus expectations""? Donât they have  friends or family who own a business, or donât they go to a mall? I am  purposely not putting one number in this column so those who read it  focus on logic - not data, twisted data, statistics, and what-have-you.In the real world, there is an ebb and flow in jobless claims that  reflects the time of year. If you file for unemployment right now, and  were employed the rest of the year, you will be paying a much higher tax  rate on your unemployment check than if you wait until next year and  take a few months to find a job. You may also receive some severance.So  why file now? This means the uptick seen last week is going to  accelerate as we enter 2011.This sounds like âsoftâ logic but it works, and the jobless claims  numbers announced this morning are a harbinger of a very rough January  and beyond. Large company layoffs are rising again as fiscal years  change - October 1 and January 1 being big dates in corporate America.  Recent surveys show that small-business hiring is still stuck in the mud  despite marginally increased optimism among those business owners.States will continue to lay people off to balance budgets. Pressure from  both red and blue politicians will put a lid on health care costs, and  this will induce layoffs. Consumer spending may be up a tiny bit, but the transactions processed by Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are flat to  down, meaning fewer purchases and a ""new frugal"" mentality -- which in turn means fewer  stores and therefore fewer clerks. Foreclosures are accelerating,  inventory is accumulating, and residential home construction will provide  no catalyst; nor will a glutted market for offices, outside of New York.Bottom line: However you trade employment, trade it as if I am right,  and unemployment is set to rise, jobless claims will accelerate in  January, and the Street may be surprised.One company to look at is  Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) - can it really continue to afford to pay a 4.3% dividend with  so little growth in its core business? In the past four quarters it has  earned $485 million; the current dividend of $1.24 a year (based on a  quarterly dividend of $0.31 announced in October) spread out across 362  million shares equals $449 million.  Some say that is appropriate, given  the market it faces. Others would say it is eating its own  children to keep shareholders happy, using cash that could be used to  expand the business in down times. You decide."

The company serves more than half a million businesses around the globe, but experienced declining revenue recently due to small businesses not hiring and in some cases going out of business. However, many economists have become bullish on the labor market as the weather gets warmer and the economic recovery continues ahead, and itâs not just because of the temporary hiring of census workers (so they say). We make no predictions about the labor market, but if you agree with the optimistic outlook on jobs that is permeating much of Wall Street then Paychex would be a smart way to play this trend.The company reported third quarter earnings on Wednesday afternoon that came in 1 cent ahead of consensus expectations with EPS of $.34 excluding one-time charges, which trails last yearâs results by 2 cents per share. However, the stock is indicated slightly lower in after hours trading because revenue of $508 million was just shy of analystsâ expectations, falling 3.9% from a year ago. Their client base declined by 2.1% thus far in fiscal 2010. Given the continued bleed of jobs that occurred over the last year, it is not hard to imagine that comparisons to last year could have been much worse. Despite the decline in fundamentals, we think the stock represents attractive value for investors looking to take advantage of improving employment trends.The stock currently trades at a multiple of cash earnings of only 18.7x, which is well below the historical range for PAYX of 21.0x to 31.1x. Furthermore, price-to-sales over the last ten years has ranged between 6.87x to 10.61x, but currently trades at a discount to that with a current price-to-sales multiple of 5.88x. Management has been pretty successful at protecting the company from the downside considering very difficult operating conditions, and has been able to keep profit margins and ROE relatively consistent throughout the business cycle. Paycheck pays out a substantial portion of its earnings in dividends with a yield of nearly 4%, but with the payout ratio currently as high as 92%, this may be a warning sign if earnings do not improve as expected in the year ahead. The company reaffirmed their outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2010, but analysts are anticipating a better showing in fiscal 2011. Based on the fundamentals, we have believed PAYX to be Undervalued compared to historical valuations for quite some time.One other note to be aware of, Paychex will almost certainly benefit in an environment of rising interest rates. They have absolutely no long term debt, and by nature of their business model have a natural interest free float. Because they collect payroll from employers prior to their actual employee pay date, they are able to invest that money short term in very low risk instruments. The government has kept interest rates extremely low for quite some time, and as the economy continues to recover, inflationary concerns will eventually manifest. Rising rates would give Paychex a better return on their investments and will almost certainly translate to a better bottom line.In conclusion, Paychexâs valuation remains appealing as the stock has fallen out of favor with the market, while fundamentals remain pretty much intact as management minimized the impact of job losses. Potential tailwinds for the company include an improving employment picture (at least perceived), and additionally, general economic improvement will almost certainly demand higher interest rates. Paychex is uniquely positioned to benefit from both of these possibilities, and long term investors will be compensated with a 3.8% yield while they wait for price appreciation.Original post"
195676,20568,2010-03-25T17:09:17-04:00,,"Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) reported third quarter 2010 EPS of 34 cents per share, in-line with the Zacks Consensus estimate.Revenue The company reported third quarter 2010 revenue of $507.8 million, a decrease of 4% from $528.6 million for the same period last year. This can be attributed to the decline in the Payroll service revenue segments, compared to the year-ago quarter. As per revenue segments, Payroll service revenue was $358.3 million in the third quarter, down 6.0% compared to the same period last year, as a result of the weak economic environment, which in turn adversely impacted the companyâs client base and check volume. Human Resource Services generated $135.5 million, up 3.0% from the same period last year. This segment was positively impacted by a 54% increase in health and benefits service revenue, as well as growth in certain Human Resource Services products that support major market services clients.Operating Results In the third quarter, total expense was $339.6 million, up 3.0% compared to the year-ago quarter. This included a litigation expense of $18.7 million. Cost control measures in the form of reduction in headcount were partially offset by increased cost associated with its sales force, customer service and technological infrastructure. This led to an operating income of $168.2 million, a decline of 15% from the year-ago period. Net income for the quarter was $112.0 million or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to $130.8 million or $0.36 per diluted share in the year-ago quarter. Excluding litigation charges of $0.03 per share, the adjusted EPS for the company stood at $0.34 per share.Balance Sheet The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $279.3 million and corporate investments of $115.8 million. This apart, during the third quarter, interest on funds held for clients decreased to $14.0 million as a result of lower average interest rates earned and lower average investment balances. Guidance  For fiscal year 2010, the company expects Payroll service revenue to decline in the range of 5.0% to 7.0%, Human Resource Services revenue to increase in the range of 3.0% to 6.0% and total revenue to decline by 2.0%."
193194,23899,2010-03-11T11:55:06-05:00,,"By Nathan SlaughterMost businesses hate to see rising interest rates, which make it more expensive to borrow money. Not every business, though. The company below welcomes and profits from increases in interest rates.Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) collects payroll for its clients' employees and sits on the money for a while before disbursing it to its rightful owners on payday. During this lag time, the company is free to invest that cash on its own behalf -- much like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A), which puts its insurance ""float"" to good use.Paychex basically gets to invest with free money.Unfortunately, abysmally low interest rates have eaten away at the interest income from these short-term investments. During fiscal 2009, the company's $3.3 billion portfolio of AAA-rated government agency bonds generated a yield of 2.2%, resulting in interest income of about $75 million. That's a steep -43% drop from what it earned in 2008 thanks to an unprecedentedly low federal funds rate of 0.25%.Before the financial crisis hit, rates were sitting at lofty levels above 5.0%. With the economy back on its feet and inflationary pressures looming, rates should begin marching higher in the second half of 2011, potentially doubling that $75 million in interest income to $150 million in just 18 months.That's just icing on the cake for Paychex.Every day, millions of workers receive their wages, either via paycheck or direct deposit. The process may seem simple and straightforward, but there's more to it than meets the eye. Time sheets may need to be validated, payroll taxes have to be calculated and deductions for health care premiums and retirement account contributions must be withheld.Crunching the numbers and making sure employees are promptly and accurately paid can be an expensive and time-consuming undertaking. That's where Paychex comes in. The firm handles these outsourced operations for 540,000 businesses around the world -- reducing expenses, eliminating bookkeeping headaches and giving companies more time to do whatever it is they do best.There's another reason to love Paychex -- it holds the cards in negotiations. These smaller businesses, representing 98% of Paychex's client base, have little negotiating power and are conditioned to annual price increases. There is usually little incentive to switch vendors, which gives Paychex a very sticky customer base.And there's still plenty of business for Paychex to capture. Only 10% of the estimated 11.5 million businesses located where Paychex operates outsource their payroll.As you might expect, the moribund labor market has dampened the firm's growth prospects lately. Last year, the number of clients from new business fell -19%, while the number lost to companies going out of business rose by a similar percentage.Even under these difficult economic conditions, Paychex managed to grow revenue (albeit by just +1%) and produce record operating income, while dishing out 85% of its profits as dividends.Disclosure: No positions"
214932,23469,2010-07-16T14:12:54-04:00,,"My fair value estimate for Paychex is $40.30 per share based on discounted cash-flow analysis. The company has seen a dip in its ability to grow its revenue as of late. They have not seen the double-digit revenue growth they used to see in several years. For my DCF, therefore, I reduced the annual growth on operating income to low levels of 2-3%. Therefore, the estimate is a very low valuation of future growth, which could be much higher. The company can definitely maintain a 2-3% operating income growth given such levels of free cash flow. With little competition and a high economic moat, the company does not face stiff competition and should maintain their current status.RiskRisk is low with Paychex. The company will maintain very well, but they do face the issue of a slow but sustained growth for the time being. They will continue to do well as long as a recovery is sustained. In the long term, Paychex represents an opportunity for a very sustainable and safe company moving forward."
221294,23679,2010-08-19T07:25:54-04:00,,"Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is fairly boring company that is an exciting investment. At face value, they are the result of a consolidation of payroll processing companies that took place over thirty years ago. They are a top player in payroll processing for the small to medium business in the United States, which comprise 99% of their business. This is a double edged sword; the size of their customers enable them to price more aggressively and expand margins, but also represent an added component of uncertainty compared to larger companies.Recently Paychex has expanded their repertoire of offerings to include 401(k), workers comp and HR services to their clients. These services are not only complementary to their current offerings, they are also very cost effective to build using PAYX already existing framework. As a result, these offerings (which have grown to comprise about 25% of Paychex revenues) add to their already impressive margins. images Source: Trefis.comThey represent an intriguing one two punch of highly scalable business combined with similarly high switching costs for their customers. This results in a very solid customer base and the opportunity to expand that customer base with little additional cost. ROIC has been 70% over the last ten years and they pay out a handsome dividend.The projected dividend yield of 4.9% is something that should get any investor excited without being high enough to raise a red flag. Their high payout ratio of 94% would be a concern if it werenât for the nature of their business; the low marginal cost and debt levels associated with acquiring customers enable Paychex to payout the vast majority of their earnings to investors. This also represents an alignment of investor and management interest.Finally, the sustainability of dividends seems very probable when looking at PAYXâs fundamentals. They have grown their dividend at 19% over the last five years as opposed to EPS growth of 6%. However, PAYX exhibits a cash flow coverage ratio of 1.23, perfectly healthy for a dividend paying company. This means that even in todayâs job market, they are able to safely cover their dividends with cash on hand if they hit any rougher waters. Combine this with the fact that they carry no debt, and it seems a safe bet that Paychex will continue to, well, pay.Recent HappeningsIt is no secret that the economic downturn has been hard on businesses. More importantly for Paychex, it has been hard on the small to medium sized business they cater to. This has, in turn, put downward pressure on their earnings and stock price. Downward pressure on their float, or short term holdings in cash, due to low interest rates have also hurt revenues in recent quarters. However, PAYX remains unarguably profitable, and will continue to provide cyclical returns as businesses begin to add employees and interest rates rise.It is my assumption that employment will begin to recover sometime early next year. As a result, I am bullish on Paychex right now. Contrary to popular sentiment, which has kept Paychex near their 52-week low, I think the time to buy is now. Their business model provides for excellent fixed income returns along with an attractive potential increase in stock price.Fundamental ValuationFor Paychex, I calculate an intrinsic value floor of $34 and a ceiling of $48. I base this on the assumption that employment will recover in the medium term and that their client and offering base will continue to grow. The growth rates used vary from a low growth in 2011 to higher normal growth rates of 10% in the subsequent years. The dividend payout is also factored in to the valuation of PAYX. As a result, I give an A- for fundamental valuation to PAYX.Relative ValuationPaychex has fallen from a darling of Wall Street to a more grounded realm. Their PE is far off the five year average and price to sales also represents a significant value to an investor. I will give PAYX a grade of B+ for relative valuation.Ratio AnalysisAs previously mentioned, their cash flow coverage ratio sits at 1.23. Compare this to their biggest competitor, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) at 2.06 and you may not come away impressed. However, their dividend yield is significantly better than ADP at 4.97% to 3.42%, so the increased reward may be worth the risk. Their liquidity ratios have been strikingly constant over the medium term, and I look for them to remain so moving forward. I would like to see a little more cash on hand for Paychex, but with their business model it is easy to see why they prefer to run a leaner ship. I give PAYX a liquidity grade of B.Operating margins have hovered around 38% over the past decade and look to continue to do so. The economic downturn provided downward pressure on margins, but an increase in employment would reverse that trend. The historically low interest rates provide little return on Paychexâs sizeable cash float, and so as those increase the margins look to expand as well. Regardless of the interest rate environment, the fundamental business behind PAYX is sound and unassailable from industry entrants. The only threat to profitability I see is a potential competitive battle with ADP should they ever choose to compete. Right now, I see no reason for them to do so and will give Paychex a profitability grade of A.Paychex has no debt and is therefore very well positioned in regards to leverage. The nature of their business makes this a wise decision, whereas zero debt could be considered a bad decision in other situations.  I give PAYX a grade of A for leverage.Concluding Remarks While this stock certainly is not risk-free and has taken a beating over the last five months, it is a bargain at the current price and provides an attractive dividend. Their business plan provides a sustainable competitive edge over entrants, and the only industry competition is in the form of ADP, who seems to be occupied with the larger business segment. In an environment where it seems every potential investment is wrought of speculation, I believe Paychex provides a safety blanket in the form of a growing dividend and scalable business model.Disclosure: No positions"

227468,20568,2010-09-28T13:43:04-04:00,,"Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX)  reported first-quarter fiscal 2011 earnings of 36 cents per share,  beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by two cents. The quarterâs results  are indicative of an improving client retention rate and the companyâs  constant effort to improve selling operations.Revenues Paychex reported first-quarter 2011 revenues of $518.3 million, up 3.6%  from $500.2 million in the year-earlier quarter and was above the Zacks  Consensus Estimate of $507.0 million. The revenue upside could be  attributed to year-over-year growth in both checks processed per client  and the retirement services client base. Segment-wise, Payroll Service revenues increased 1.8% from the year-ago  quarter to $360.7 million, attributable to a 1.2% growth in checks  processed per client and an increase in pricing per check. Management stated that the improvement in checks per client was  primarily driven by an increase in corporate hiring and a higher  retention rate. However, contributions from new clients were slightly  down from the comparable period last year. Gong forward however, changes  in selling processes are expected to generate new business for Paychex. The Human Resource Services segment generated $145.5 million, up 10.1%  from the prior-year quarter. Both the number of client employees served  and the number of clients grew in the last quarter, contributing to the  quarterâs performance. This stems from the positive impact of the  recently passed Healthcare Reform Act in the U.S., as well as from  increased hiring and retirement expenses per employee.Operating Results In the first quarter, the company incurred a total operating expense of  $317.5 million, up 2.3% from the year-ago quarter. Total expense  increased due to the companyâs continued effort to train sales  personnel, provide better customer service and enhance technological  infrastructure. However, the increase was partially offset by a higher  utilization rate and lower headcount. Operating income was $200.8 million, up 5.7% from the year-ago period,  attributable to higher revenue and better cost management. Net income of $131.9 million in the reported quarter increased 6.7%  from $123.6 million in the prior-year quarter. Net income per diluted  share was 36 cents compared to 34 cents in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash Flow Paychex exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of  $272.9 million, down from $284.3 million at the end of the prior  quarter. Corporate investments increased $94.7 million to $177.2  million. Additionally, during the first quarter, interest on funds held  for clients decreased 11.7% year over year to $12.1 million as a result  of lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by a 1%  increase in average investment balances. Cash from operations saw a climb from $186.6 million in the prior-year  quarter to $194.3 million in the reported quarter. Capital expenditures  also increased $6.5 million to $16.6 million.Guidance For fiscal 2011, Paychex expects Payroll Service revenues to remain  flat year over year and Human Resource Services revenues to increase in  the range of 10.0% to 13.0%. Interest on funds held for clients is  expected to decrease in the range of 12% to 17%, while net investment  income is likely to increase in the range of 24% to 27%. Net operating income is expected to range between 34% and 35% of total  service revenue. The effective tax rate is expected to be roughly 35%.  Moreover, net income is projected to improve marginally from fiscal 2010  levels.Recommendation Paychex witnessed a modest improvement in the quarterâs results based  on increasing headcount and price per employee. However, Paychex  maintained its fiscal 2011 guidance, reflecting uncertainty regarding  economic conditions and low interest rates. Some analysts believe that  there are downside risks to forward earnings estimates, given the lower  contribution from new business that has been impacted by the declines in  small business employment and lower interest rates earned. Since small businesses make a major contribution to the companyâs total  revenue, we remain unsure about when Paychex could return to its normal  double-digit revenue growth. However, we look forward to positive  contribution from Paychexâs Human Resource Services segment, as there  has been a steady increase in clients over the past few quarters. On the other hand, we are somewhat concerned about escalating competition in the outsourcing space from big players such as Automated Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) and Administaff Inc. (ASF), as well as limited margin expansion in the near term due to continuous investment in diverse field. We currently have a short-term Sell recommendation (Zacks #4 Rank) on Paychex Inc."

This dividend achiever has raised dividends for 19 years in a row.Over the past decade this dividend growth stock has delivered an average total return of 3.70% annually.The company has managed to deliver a 12.60% average annual increase in its EPS between 1999 and 2008. Analysts expect Paychex to earn $1.33 share next year, followed by an 8% increase to $1.44/share in the year after that.The Return on Equity has recovered from its 2002-2006 lows and is at a very impressive level at 42%. This is especially positive given the fact that the company remains virtually debt free. Rather than focus on absolute values for this indicator, I generally want to see at least a stable return on equity over time.Annual dividends have increased by an average of 23.50% annually since 1999, which is higher than the growth in EPS.A 24% growth in dividends translates into the dividend payment doubling every three years. If we look at historical data, going as far back as 1990, Paychex has actually managed to double its dividend payment every two and a half years on average.The dividend payout ratio has more than doubled from 35% in 1999 to 81%. The companyâs dividend payment looks unsustainable, given the slow expected growth in earnings over the next few years. This could not only hinder any near term dividend growth, but also could place the dividend in danger of a cut. The solid dividend growth over the past few years did not come from EPS growth but mainly from expansion if the dividend payout ratio. In addition to that the company failed to increase dividends in July, which marked the fifth consecutive quarter of unchanged distributions.A lower payout is always a plus, since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short-term fluctuations in earnings.Currently Paychex is valued at 18.70 times earnings, yields 4.40% and has a dangerously high dividend payout ratio. I view its closest competitor ADP as more attractively valued of the two. ADP is larger, has a more diversified business base, its dividend still has room to grow and is adequately covered by earnings.Disclosure: Long ADP"
120794,21835,2009-02-16T10:19:19-05:00,,"(This article originally appeared on The DIV-Net February 9, 2009.)Linked here is a detailed quantitative analysis of Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Paychex, Inc. provides payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses in the United States.  Fair Value: I consider four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:PAYX is trading at a discount to 1, 2 and 3, above. Since PAYXâs tangible book value is not meaningful, a Graham number can not be calculated. If I exclude the high and low valuations and average the remaining two, PAYX is trading at a 51.9% discount. PAYX earned a Star in this section since it is trading at a fair value.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section I consider five factors, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:PAYX earned all available Stars in this section for the four valuations above [5, is a deduct only]. Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15% means that dividends grew on average in excess of 15% for each consecutive four year period over the last 10 years (1999-2002, 2000-2003, 2001-2004, etc.). I consider this a key metric since dividends will double every five years if they grow by 15%. PAYX has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1988 and has increased its dividend payments for 17 consecutive years. Itâs one year dividend growth rate exceeded its five-year growth rate. This could indicate the growth rate is accelerating.  Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA)? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:PAYX earned both of the available Stars in this section. The NPV MMA Diff. of the $248,717 is in excess of the $7,500 minimum I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as PAYX has. PAYXâs current yield of 4.77% exceeds the 3.42% estimated 20-year average MMA rate.Other: PAYX is a member of the S&P 500 and a member of the Broad Dividend Achieversâ¢ Index. The company has a strong balance sheet and the nature of the business provides for regular cash inflows. With the economic downturn leading many companies to layoff employees, PAYXâs earnings could be adversely affected in the short-term. However, over the long term, the company should benefit from a solid management team, higher retention rates, falling attrition and strong profitability. Risks include economic uncertainty in the small-to medium-sized business segment, pricing and margin pressure from Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP).Conclusion: PAYX earned one Star in the Fair Value section, earned four Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned two Stars in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a net total of seven Stars. Since my scale tops out at five, this quantitatively ranks PAYX as a 5 Star-Strong Buy.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price could increase to $81.45 before payxâs NPV MMA Differential fell to the $7,500 that I like to see. At that price the stock would yield 1.47%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the needed $7,500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 4.3%. This dividend growth rate is substantially below the 17.8% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. PAYX has a risk rating of 1.75 which classifies it as a medium risk stock.PAYX is trading substantially below my calculated buy price of $55.94. I will continue to cautiously add share as PAYXâs price and my allocation allows. For additional information, including PAYXâs dividend history, please refer to its data page.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only. The above quantitative stock analysis, including the Star rating, is mechanically calculated and is based on historical information.

However, the company cut its fiscal-year revenue forecast for a third time and said it expects the economy to continue to be difficult through 2009 and into fiscal 2010. I have been tracking the performance of this leading payroll and personnel services provider to get an insight into the health of the economy. Previous coverage is available here and here. Q3 revenue was down 1% to $528.6 million. Net income decreased 8% to $130.8 million or $0.36 per share as losses in investment income offset gains in other areas. Analysts expected earnings of $0.36 per share on revenue of $536.9 million.Paychex continued to be affected by the difficult economy and a key indicator of the economy, check per client, declined 4.3% in the quarter versus a 2.4% decline in the first nine months of fiscal 2009. However, on the brighter side for Paychex, its cash and corporate investments increased more than $100 million to $570 million.The turmoil in the financial markets and low interest rates have adversely affected the companyâs income on funds held for clients. For Q3, interest on funds held for clients declined 56% to $16.4 million and investment income decreased 70% to $1.1 million, primarily due to lower average interest rates earned offset by higher average investment balances.Payroll service revenue increased 2% to $381.2 million on price increases and growth in ancillary payroll services. Human Resource Services (HRS) revenue grew 9% to $131.0 million on an increased number of clients. However, HRS revenue growth continued to be affected by weakening economic conditions that led to a decline in retirement services and comprehensive human resource outsourcing services revenue. Retirement services revenue growth declined by $3.0 million in the quarter due to the decline in market values. Comprehensive human resource outsourcing services revenue growth was hurt by a lower number of employees per client that led to a decline of $2.9 million in this segmentâs revenue.Year-to-date, total revenue increased 3% to $1.6 billion and net income decreased 5% to $419.7 million. Payroll services revenue increased 4% to $1.1 billion and HRS revenue increased 12% to $390.7 million.Paychex revised its outlook for the full fiscal year 2009 ending May 31, 2009 for the third time. It assumes that the weak economic conditions will continue through the rest of the fiscal year. Total revenue growth is expected to be in the range of 0 to 2%. Net income is expected to decline 7 to 5%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to continue to decline, but in the range of 45% to 40%, and net investment income is expected to decline between 75% and 70%. The stock is currently trading around $26 with a market cap of about $9 billion.Paychex still has the currency to do a SaaS roll-up as I have mentioned before several times. Some 600+ SaaS startups are toiling hard out there, and many of them have been gaining traction. It would not be at all difficult to pull a great portfolio together for Paychex, a healthy, well-performing company with a solid market cap.This segment is part 7 in a running series Jump to part: Aggregator?, Paychex, Weakness, Cheap, Acquisitions, Outlook, SaaS Roll-Up, Please"

They also provide human resource product and services which account for about 24% of their top line revenues of about $2.1 billion. This fiscal yearâs earnings (years end May 31) are likely to show the first ever year-over-year decline in the companyâs history due to the slow US economy and its accompanying decrease in total employee count among their customers. The share price has reflected this interruption in growth by falling about 50% from a 2007 high of $47.10 to yesterdayâs close of $23.62. Paychex reported February quarter results yesterday. They hit their estimate on the button at $0.36 this year versus $0.39 in 2008. FY expectations for the 12 months ending May 31 are now at $1.50 or down about 4.5% from last yearâs figure of $1.57/share. While it represents their first down year ever thatâs not a bad performance in such a poor environment. The company has zero debt. Value Line rates their financial strength as âAâ and notes their stock price stability and earnings predictability are in the 90th and 95th percentiles respectively (with 100th being best). Their dividend yield of 5.25% is better than whatâs available on bank CDs or long term treasuries. At first glance the trailing P/E of 15.8x may not seem cheap. When you look backwards at the historical valuations for Paychex it looks like an absolute bargain. The 10-year median P/E is 41x and prior to this year the lowest multiple in the past 16 years was 2008âs 24.6x. Here are the last six yearâs numbers to illustrate the per share growth that led investors to pay premium prices for Paychex shares: Once the economy shows even a hint of bottoming I expect these shares will revert back to at least an 18 â 20 multiple on what should be higher earnings. With just minor growth forecast for FY 2010 though Iâm going to present a quite conservative way to play that doesnât assume much reversion to the mean over the next nine months.

Your break-even on the trade would be calculated as follows: On the original shares you bought itâs $23.62 less the $2.15 call premium = $21.47 /share. On the second batch of shares itâs the $22.50 strike price less the $2.95 put premium = $19.55 /share. Your overall cost per share would be the average of $21.47 + $19.55 = $20.51 [not counting dividends received]. While I canât guarantee that Paychex shares wonât be below $20.51 through next January 15th I can tell you that theyâve only traded below that price on one day since late 1999. In fact your break-even price would be lower than the lows in any year from 2000 right through 2008. This combination play on this very high quality company offers a best case total return of 35%, a static return of 28% and a margin of safety of over 17% even if Paychex should decline by over $4/share.

But what is even more telling is the gloomy snapshot of the economy Paychex provides. Letâs take a closer look. Paychex Inc. reported Q2 revenue of $524.2 million, up 3% but short of analyst estimates of $533 million. Net income was $140.2 million or $0.39 per share, down 5%. Analysts were expecting earnings of $0.40 per share. Revenue for the first half of the fiscal year was $1.06 billion, versus $1.01 billion last year.The company cited the effect of the credit crisis and weakening economic conditions for its poor performance. Its CEO, Jonathon Judge said:Investment income declined 75%, continuing the declining trend seen in Q1. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 36% to $20 million mainly due to lower interest rates earned on short-term investments.Its liquidity position however continues to remain strong with $479 million in cash and investments with no debt. It increased its margins from 37.5% last year to 38.1%. It increased its sales headcount and is investing in strategic growth areas like health insurance.By segment, Payroll Services revenue grew 4% to $376.1 million mainly due to price increases and growth in the utilization of ancillary payroll services. Human Resource Services (HRS) revenue grew 11% to $128.3 million but was adversely affected by revenue declines within retirement services and workersâ compensation.For fiscal year 2009 that ends May 31, 2009, Paychex has revised its outlook. It now expects revenue to grow in the range of 2% to 4%, down from the earlier range of 6 to 8%. Net income is now expected to fall 7% to 5% compared to the earlier growth forecast of 2% to 4%. Interest on funds held for clients is now expected to fall 45% to 40% versus Q1 projection of 20% to 25% decline.By segment, Payroll Services revenue is expected to grow between 3% and 5%. HRS revenue is expected to grow between 12% and 15%.The stock is currently trading around $26 with a market cap of $9 billion. It hit its 52-week low of $23.22 on November 21.This is the first quarterly result that reflects the shabby state of the American economy. Nowhere more than in payroll does the story look so dismal, yet so transparent.Despite this, I hope the deep recession and layoffs will also bring forth peopleâs ingenuity, and most of all, I hope for entrepreneurship.

(NASDAQ: PAYX), the leading payroll and personnel services provider, reported first quarter results that met earnings estimates but missed revenue estimates (see conference call transcript). In earlierÂ coverage, Â I suggested that it could be a SAAS aggregator.Q1 revenue increased 5% to $534.1 million, driven by service revenue growth and leverage of expenses. Net income decreased 2% to $148.7 million. Diluted EPS, however, was up 3% to $0.41 due to a lower number of weighted average shares outstanding because of the completion of the stock repurchase program in December 2007. Analysts expected profit of 41 cents per share on revenue of $540 million.As we have seen in earlier posts, available here, here, and here,Â the companyâsÂ resultsÂ are good indicators of the health of the economy. Because of the weak economy, losses due to clients going bust have increased, payroll sales from new clients have slowed, and transaction volumes have come down. Investment income declined 75% to $3.1 million due to lower average investment balances, as a result of lower average interest rates and the funding of the stock repurchase program. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 25% to $24.2 million, due primarily to lower average interest rates earned, partially offset by higher average investment balances. Â Paychex had a strong cash balance of $519.1 million at the end of the quarter. Cash flows from operations were $214.6 million versus $253.2 million in Q1 2007, down mainly due to the stock repurchase program.Â Operating income grew 5% while operating income, net of certain items, increased 11% to $197.4 million.Â The strong cash balance could be put to very good use in acquiring a portfolio of SaaS companies that are synergistic and in need for an exit. Paychex should look into this.By segment, Payroll Services revenue increased 5% to $378.5 million while Human Resources Services revenue increased 16% to $131.4 million.For fiscal year 2009, Paychex expects revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%. Net income is expected to grow between 2% and 4%. Operating income, net of certain items, is expected to grow 11% to 13%. Net investment income is expected to decline 50% to 55%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to decline 20% to 25%. By segment, Payroll Services revenue is expected to grow between 5% and 7%. HRS revenue is expected to grow between 18% and 21%.

166349,23353,2009-10-14T04:30:48-04:00,,"The stock of Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) the nationâs leading payroll processor and H.R. services supplier to small businesses, took a swift beating a couple of weeks ago.PAYXâs earnings met estimates but investors were disappointed overall, generating at least one negative analyst comment and pushing the stock 7% lower over a couple of stumbling days for the market generally.One worry about PAYX has been the sustainability of its heavyweight dividend, which results in a chunky 4.3% that is barely covered by earnings.PAYX just announced it will maintain its dividend at the same rate this quarter. That means there was no increase at all in 2009, and doesnât soothe investor jitters about the direction of future dividends.So hereâs another way of looking at it. Show me the money. And when I say money, I mean the real Benjamin Franklins: cash money, not accounting department earnings.For the most recent quarter, PAYXâs dividend outlay totaled 60% of cash flow from operations. This is actually an improvement from higher payout levels for the past two full fiscal years, and not nearly as historically out-of-line as the payout ratio on earnings.During the last business downturn, the 2002 cash payout spiked to 52%, a big jump from the 33% and 40% payouts the prior two years, and not exactly a moon-shot from the current, and improving, 60%. PAYXâs typical recent payout on operating cash flow has been 40% to as much as 48% due to some large dividend increases in 2005-2007.Just like now, PAYX held its dividend steady for 2002. The company then resumed annual increases in October 2003, racking up a 5-year dividend-growth record of over 21% annually, according to Reuters. As noted above, that included some atypically large increases, so itâs reasonable to expect less generous dividend growth going forward, even when business conditions improve.To be fair about the cash flow analysis, the 2002 dividend payout on net income also âspiked,â but at just 57% it looked like cookies and milk compared to where it is now. Still, it was a jump from the roughly 40% net income payout ratio in 2000 and 2001, and PAYX managed through it.Three more reasons for optimism: first, some fundamentals. PAYX has virtually no long-term debt to service, and with relatively low capital expenditures the company actually punched-up far more free cash flow during FYs 2008 and 2009 than during the good years before the current economic downturn. Return on Equity is marvelous at 39% and valuation ratios are still sweet, all based on Morningstar data.Second, we already saw a summer sneakâpeak of this mud-wrestling melee. When PAYX was taking a pounding for its June earnings release, Barronâs stepped into the ring, saying that despite the merciless labor market, the company is well-positioned for a recovery, generates âastonishingâ free cash flow, and its dividend would likely remain âunscathed.âAnd third, a Morningstar analyst just did a deep dive into the newest quarterly numbers, concluding they âpoint to the beginning of a solid recoveryâ in 2010 for this well-managed company that Morningstar gives its highest âWide Moatâ rating for sustainable competitive advantages, as well as its highest âFive Starâ stock rating.Donât get me totally wrong, though. Like many dividend-growth investors, over the long run I want to see a manageable earnings payout ratio; earnings increasing at a clip that supports dividend increases; revenues growing to support earnings; and cash flow that assures me everythingâs backed up by green paper with pictures of presidents on it, not just paperwork from the accounting department.But over a cyclical short-run, a high quality company with a healthy balance sheet can pay dividends from cash flow and still have the resources to run the business. And thatâs a key point. PAYX is not the latest busted business model or some financial zombie buried under a mountain of reserve requirements. No doubt they are in a tough fight, but the cash is flowing and their business metrics seem to be signaling a 2010 recovery.And in addition to the 4.3% cash dividend, if the market decides PAYX isnât a knockout loser after all, the capital returns from this S&P technology-sector company could be worthwhile.Coming off the March bottom, the stock shot past both the S&P 500 and the Technology Sector ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK) for the first two months of the rally, though it has since fallen behind both.And despite its recent troubles, PAYX has rewarded long-term investors. Over the trailing 1-year, 2-year and 5-year periods the stock price has roughly tracked the S&P 500, but lagged the lower-yielding technology sector.The downside? PAYX could send investors a âRochester raspberryâ and cut the dividend next year. How much of that likelihood is already priced into the stock is anyoneâs guess, but thereâs some risk here, certainly.And so, some dividend-growth investors will no doubt want to stick to their discipline and avoid PAYX: its payout ratio on earnings has skyrocketed and it failed to raise its dividend this year. Meanwhile, economic bears who are particularly skeptical about the job market might be more comfortable looking for yield in other sectors.But patient investors willing to take a reasonable risk on a superb company, and pocket a nice dividend while they wait and see? Those investors might not want to show PAYX the back of their hand, as long as PAYX can keep showing them the money.

82886,21445,2008-06-26T17:10:02-04:00,,"Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX)  is expected to report Q4 earnings Thursday, June 26, after market close, with a conference call scheduled for  Friday at 11:00 am ET. The consensus estimate is 38c for EPS and $529.62M for  revenue, according to First Call. Citigroup expects a sequentially flat Q4 of  39c in EPS on a lower $30M float income versus $37M last quarter. Analysts are  usually on top of this company. Over the past 10 quarters, Street estimates have  been within a penny per share of actual bottom-line results. On the March 26  earnings call for Q3, management shared the following forecasts for FY08: It  reaffirmed a 2008 revenue growth outlook of 9% to 11%; it expected growth in  operating income of approximately 15% for FY08; it saw consistent growth in  clients balances for FY08; and it expected average outstanding shares in FY08 to  be approximately 370M. Looking past FY08: Citigroup said investors have  expressed concern to them recently around Paychex's upcoming FY09 guidance.  Citigroup sees these concerns driven predominantly by expectations for broader  slowing economic growth, slowing small business formation, and slowing small  business employment and spending growth. The key issues for the Q4 call: FY09  guidance is most important, and trends in key payroll indicators such as pays  per control and retention. Thomas Weisel would expect FY09 guidance to reflect  stabilizing interest rate assumptions with continued sluggish employment growth  in the small-and-midsized business (BATS:SMB) segment. Weisel expects the FY09  guidance range to imply EPS of somewhere between $1.67 to $1.73 (up 7-11% YoY),  which at the midpoint assumes a 2% Fed Funds rate and relative stability in  rates throughout FY09, payroll growth in the mid to high single digits,  continued margin expansion and a flat share count. Also, Weisel said, while not  expected, the implementation of a share repurchase program is certainly possible  given that the company has no specific need to build cash balances given their  $408M in cash and investments, no debt, and given its strong and consistent free  cash flow generation and its ability to borrow as needed."
84249,20521,2008-07-09T07:19:19-04:00,,"Paychex (NASDAQ: PAYX) reported its Q4 and fiscal year 2008 results on June 26. Net income in 2008 grew 12% to $576 million or $1.56 EPS, and revenue grew 10% to cross the $2 billion milestone. It took Paychex over 30 years to get to the first billion, and only five years to reach the second.In a major development, Paychex has enhanced its MMS product line so that these products can be delivered via the web through a software-as-a-service [SaaS] model. Last year, I suggested Paychex could be a SaaS aggregator. Now that the company is finally thinking more along the SaaS lines rather than as a Business Process Outsourcing [BPO], it will be interesting to see how the story develops.Let us now take a look at Q4 results. Revenue grew 7% to $510.2 million while net income grew 12% to $135.5 million, or $0.38 EPS. Analysts had estimated EPS of $0.38 on revenue of $529.1 million. Despite being affected negatively by the weak economy and declining interest rates, Paychex put in a strong performance by reducing expenses by 2% to $321.4 million. By segment, 2008 Payroll Services revenue grew 8% to $1.5 billion and Human Resources Services revenue grew 19% to $0.5 billion to meet the lower end of its earlier forecast. For Q4, Payroll Services revenue was up by 6% to $365.5 million and Human Resources Services revenue grew 15% to $122.4 million.The results of Paychex and Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) are often good indicators of the health of the economy, as I have discussed in earlier posts available here and here. Paychex reported that clients who are going out of business or who no longer have employees increased 11% y-o-y; the phenomenon has spread throughout the United States. The company normally plans for such situations, but in 2008 there were more than 3,000 unexpected failures. Even the number of clients who shifted to non-processing status increased by more than 3,000. There were fewer recruits and new business starts.Taking into account these factors, Paychex gave a conservative outlook for fiscal year 2009. It expects revenue growth in the range of 7% to 9%, or $2.21 to $2.25 billion. Net income growth is expected to be in the range of 2% to 4%, or $587.7 to $599.2 million. Payroll Services revenue growth is expected between 7% and 8% and Human Resources Services revenue growth between 19% and 22%. Analysts expect profit of $611.9 million on revenue of $2.24 billion.Paychex is currently trading around $31, which is close to its 52-week low, and has a market cap of around $11 billion. I think it is a very good company with a great business model, and this may be a good opportunity to buy the stock.Disclosure: None"
81470,21835,2008-06-16T07:47:06-04:00,,"Linked here is a PDF copy of my detailed analysis of Paychex Inc (NASDAQ:PAYX)(alt.1, alt.2). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Paychex, Inc. provides payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions for small- to medium-sized businesses in the United States.Fair Value: I consider four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description: PAYX is trading at a discount to all but #4 above. If I exclude the high and low valuation, and average the remaining two valuations, PAYX is trading at an astounding 30.7% discount. A Star is added since PAYX is trading at a fair value.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section I consider five factors, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description: PAYX earned two Stars in this section for #2 and #3 above. PAYX has paid a dividend since 1988 and has increased its dividend for the last 18 years (calendar year). Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account [MMA]? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description: 1.) NPV MMA Diff. and 2.) Years to >MMA. PAYX earned both Stars available in this section. If PAYX grows its dividend at 17.6% per year, it will only take 3 years to equal the long-term average money market rate of 4.61%. PAYX's NPV MMA Diff is an eye-popping $72,195. Other: PAYX is a member of the S&P 500, is an Achiever, but is not an Aristocrat. The company has a strong balance sheet and generates a steady stream of cash. Risks to PAYX include the highly competitive nature of the outsourcing industry, low barriers of entry and the threat of alternative products. ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), the industry leader, is promoting a payroll and tax software solution using Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) small business software. This could potentially affect Paychex's growth in the small office market.Conclusion: PAYX earned a Star in the Fair Value section, earned two Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned two Stars in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a net total of 5 Stars. This rates PAYX as a 5 Star-Strong Buy. I don't think PAYX can sustain a 17% dividend growth rate in the near-term. Using my [D4L-PreScreen.xls] model I have determined that the growth rate can fall to 10.8% and PAYX will still generate the $10,000 NPV MMA Diff that I am looking for. Entering the 10.8% dividend growth rate into my [20-Year-DCF.xls] model and setting the EPS growth rate to 10.8%, the calculated fair-value of PAYX is $35.13, slightly above Friday's $33.65 closing price.Historically, PAYX raises its dividend in August with a July declaration date. Based on the above analysis, I am comfortable adding to my PAYX position, as my allocation and valuation allows, but I will likely wait until after the next dividend declaration.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only.

Since then, Paychex has grown steadily and its market cap has appreciated from $12.3 Billion to $15.62 Billion. I will look at it in more detail in this post.Paychex is a leading provider of payroll and benefits outsourcing solutions in the SME market with annual revenue of $1.9 billion and net income of $514 million in fiscal 2007. Its biggest rival is ADP, which I will cover soon. Based in New York, the company has more than 100 offices with 11,700 employees and 561,000 payroll clients. Paychex takes care of a vital but simple business process for its clients, and has thus positioned itself as an essential piece of the workflow at numerous companies. Paychex offers human resource outsourcing services through its core products, Paychex Premier Human Resources and Professional Employer Organization [PEO]. It offers payroll services through its two core product lines, Core Payroll and Major Market Services [MMS].Core Payroll services are also offered through Paychex Online. The site offers interactive, self-service products including Paychex Online Payroll, Internet Time Sheet, and Paychex Online Reports.MMS is for companies with complex needs. Most MMS clients use the Preview software for passing on the payroll information. Preview software and the database for payroll and HR reside on the clientsâ end. Paychex handles the software maintenance and also provides associated products and services. Paychex also offers an Internet-based human resource management system, HR Online, for managing payroll, reports, and employee records and benefits.In September 2007, Paychex acquired Hawthorne Benefit Technologies and BeneTrac, its online employee benefits management and administration system.On the financial front, Paychex reported a y-o-y increase of 10% in revenue to $507.1 million for Q1 fiscal 2008. Net income was $151.1 million, or $0.40 diluted earnings per share. Payroll service revenue increased 8% y-o-y to $361.5 million mainly due to client base growth, higher check volume, and price increases. Human Resource Services revenue saw a 20% y-o-y increase to $113.3 million due to increase in client base in retirement services, comprehensive human resource outsourcing services, and workersâ compensation insurance client base. Its regular quarterly dividend increased 43% to $0.30 per share from $0.21 per share.Following the announcement of the $1 billion repurchase plan in July, Paychex repurchased 11.2 million shares for a total of $500 million through September 26, 2007. It expects to complete the repurchase plan in 2007. Its stock is trading around $42 after hitting a 52-week high of $47.14 in early August.There are a number of Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) companies that could, conceivably, find their exits in the arms of Paychex. This includes on-demand payroll vendor PayCycle, Benefits vendor Benefitstreet, expense management vendor Concur, or talent management vendor SuccessFactors. This would require, however, that PayChex starts to think of itself as a SaaS company, as opposed to a BPO company, which has been its primary positioning thus far.It would be really interesting to watch whether BPO vendors can make this switch to SaaS. If they do, the software industry will experience quite a big change!"
50723,20869,2007-10-22T04:59:13-04:00,,"A Dividends Matter reader has suggested that we have a look at Paychex Inc, Nasdaq:(NASDAQ:PAYX). Is this a worthy candidate for our portfolio of superior dividend yielding stocks?Letâs find out!Company Profile:From Yahoo FinanceMarket capitalization is $15.77B.Company Fundamentals:Management has delivered an excellent return on invested capital [ROIC] over the last 10 years. The lowest ROIC in any given year was an amazing 25.2%! The 5 year average ROIC is 26.8%. In the early part of the 10 year period, management was delivering over 30% ROIC. So it has slipped a bit but still an amazing number.Return on equity is almost an exact match. And you can see the consistency. The 10 year average ROE is 29.57%. The 5 year average ROE is just slightly lower at 27.3%.Equity growth rate has slowed down from the earlier years. The 9 year rate is 20.44%. The 5 year rate drops to 15.55%. The 3 year rate picks up to 17.35% and last yearâs equity growth rate stayed there at 17.42%. Excellent year to year growth rates.Earnings per share growth rate has been a bit more consistent, but follows the same pattern. The 9 year rate is 17.75%. The 5 year rate drops to 14.5%. The 3 year rate picks up to 18.68% and last yearâs EPS growth rate was 15.57%.Sales growth rate has been quite consistent. The 9 year rate is 8.21%. The 5 year rate bumps up to 14.63%. The 3 year rate hangs there at 13.64%. And last yearâs cash flow growth rate dips to 12.68%.These are all solid fundamentals in my opinion.Dividend Fundamentals:The current dividend yield is 2.87%. I consider that above average by comparing it to the dividend yields of the S&P 500 index (1.91%) and the DJIA (2.36%).The dividend growth rate has been excellent over the years. Now, it has come down from its lofty rates of 50% growth rates back in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Although the 9 year rate is 22.92%, the 5 year rate drops to a more reasonable 12.82%. The 3 year rate picks up to 18.97% and last yearâs dividend growth rate was a whopping 29.51%! However, you can see there were a few lean years with just low, single digit increases from 2002 to 2004.Dividend payout ratio has remained fairly consistent over the last 6 years in the 55% range. Last yearâs dividend payout ratio was 56%.Cash flow growth rates have been fairly consistent with the 5 year rate coming in at 14.85% and last yearâs rate of 14.81%.Although the dividend growth rate has been choppy, management has consistently raised the dividend. I like to see commitment to yearly dividend growth!Valuation Models:Time to get down and dirty with some number crunching. What is a fair price to pay for this consistent dividend raiser?Looking at the historically high dividend yields over the last 10 years, I see that the 10 year average high dividend yield is 1.6%. The 5 year average high dividend yield comes in at 2.02%. With the current dividend yield at 2.87%, you know this stock is selling at a discount.If I demand the 5 year rate, then my average high dividend yield model price works out to $59.45. At the current price of $41.88, Mr. Market is selling this stock at a discount of 29.55%!Mr. Benjamin Graham would vehemently disagree! The Graham number works out to a mere $12.95! That implies a premium of 223%! What a difference from our average high dividend yield model price.For my discounted present value method, I used the following inputs:With this information, my model price works out to $58.04 or a discount of 27.84%. This is consistent with my average high dividend yield model price.Check my dividend analysis of PAYX.Here is the 1 year stock price chart: Conclusion:PAYX has delivered amazing ROIC over the last 10 years. All the fundamental growth rates look solid. And this stock appears to be selling at a discount!I like this one and will add it to my portfolio of superior dividend yielding stocks.

The company has posted 17 straight years of revenue and earnings growth. In FQ1'08, sales were up 10% to $507 million as the company earned $0.40/share. Payroll revenues rose 8% for FQ1'08 and should rise 9-10% overall this year. Human resource services offer even more potential - revenues rose 20% this past quarter to $113.3M, with 20%-23% growth expected for 2008. Same-city clientele growth â mostly through positive word-of-mouth â portends a profitable future. Paychex has no debt, regularly raises dividends (75% of this year's income will go to investors) and buys back shares (a new $1 billion buyback is planned for 2008.) But shares have recently faltered from a high of $46 to $41 because of the buyback's impact on investment income, Fed rate cuts diminishing profits from client funds held for payroll, an FQ1'08 miss of some overeager analyst projections, and a slightly lowered 2008 profit projection (from 15% growth to 13%.) But 13% growth denotes $1.58/EPS, up from F2007's $1.41/EPS, and Barron's thinks the 26 P/E is reasonable considering Paychex's growth prospects. Barron's sees PAYX recovering to $46 by 2008 and even $50 by mid-2009.

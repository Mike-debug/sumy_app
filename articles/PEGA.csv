4383969,103480,2020-11-02T08:40:54-05:00,"Pegasystems reported a strong third quarter, with continued buildup of ACV, especially in cloud.
        The company now estimates that it is 60% underway with its cloud transition, and expects to be a nearly pure cloud company by early 2023.
        As Pegasystems' scale in the cloud has increased, so has its gross margin.
        Pegasystems' diversified base of corporate and public sector clients, plus its >$80 billion TAM, make it a worthwhile hold.","So far in the third quarter earnings season, it has been a bloody quarter for so-called ""legacy"" technology companies, especially those that are playing catch-up in the cloud. Look at SAP (SAP) - the German software giant best known for its ERP systems has sunk ~30% after it reported a slowdown in revenue growth owing to a slow pandemic recovery and unfavorable currency movements. Pegasystems (PEGA), another legacy software company that specializes in CRM and BPM (business process management) tools that is perhaps less-well known, has largely avoided sharing SAP's fate. The company just reported third-quarter results that show its cloud transition is still humming, as well as sales momentum that hasn't been overly hampered by the coronavirus.Pegasystems, in fact, benefits from the fact that it specializes in process automation tools that help businesses streamline and simplify portions of their workflow. Amid a pandemic that has thrown a wrench in the way we work, Pegasystems has reported that many of its clients are taking the opportunity to re-examine their work processes, which in many cases has led to a software-led redesign that has benefited Pegasystems sales.As a refresher to investors, Pegasystems believes its combined market opportunity in both CRM and BPM is an eye-popping $80 billion, which means the company is only just shy of ~1.5% penetrated into this market its current ~$1 billion annualized revenue run rate.Figure 1. Pegasystems TAMSource: Pegasystems Q3 earnings deckPegasystems may not be the newest and hottest SaaS play on the block, but right now with the market taking a risk-off attitude and with many high-growth tech stocks trading at valuations that have made news pundits whisper about a 2000s-style bubble, increasing your exposure to older and more profit/value-oriented software stocks may be a smart move for 2021.These are the bullish catalysts that can propel Pegasystems' stock higher:While I'm not as confidently bullish in Pegasystems as when the stock was trading in the sub-$100 levels earlier this year, Pegasystems still does represent good value. Its current market cap of $9.35 billion and enterprise value of $9.40 billion represents a 7.6x EV/FY21 revenue multiple versus Wall Street's $1.24 billion revenue consensus for FY21 (+18% y/y; data from Yahoo Finance). For a company growing ACV at >20% y/y and cloud ACV at >50% y/y, I think there's still room for upside. Let's now dig into Pegasystems' latest earnings in greater detail. The Q3 earnings summary is shown below:Figure 2. Pegasystems Q3 earnings Source: Pegasystems Q3 earnings releaseNow, at face value, Pegasystems' results appeared disappointing. The company's total revenue $226.0 million grew only 4% y/y, decelerated sharply from 11% y/y growth in Q2 (and before that, revenue had been growing at a 25% y/y pace in Q1), and missed Wall Street's mark of $249.9 million (+15% y/y) by a wide mark.However, the market is putting less stock in Pegasystems' near-term results because of the haziness caused by the cloud transition. As you can see above, the main culprit behind the revenue slowdown was a steep -31% y/y decline in software license revenue, while Pegasystems Cloud revenues grew 56% y/y. This is two points faster than Pegasystems' Q2 cloud growth rate of 54% y/y. What happens when a company flips its business from license to cloud is that lumpy revenue streams that used to get booked upfront are now spread over a longer period of time. Optically, Pegasystems' quarterly financials won't present a clean picture of its underlying fundamentals until the company gets closer to its early 2023 milestone of completing its cloud transition. Ironically - the better and faster that Pegasystems is at shifting its revenue base into the cloud, the more its near-term revenue will be negatively impacted. Instead, what investors should focus on is Pegasystems' continued buildup of ACV. Pegasystems ended Q3 with $777 million of ACV, up 21% y/y - matching the ACV growth rates in Q2 and Q1. Cloud ACV (meaning products that Pegasystems customers are choosing to host in Pegasystems' cloud, versus their own infrastructure), meanwhile, grew 57% y/y to $232 million - a point stronger than 56% y/y growth last quarter. And when we take a step back and look at Pegasystems' nominal ACV trends, we find that Pegasystems tacked on $30 million in annual business sequentially versus Q2 - which is more than the $27 million it added in Q2, and $24 million it added in Q1. Figure 3. Pegasystems ACV trendsSource: Pegasystems Q3 earnings deckOne major area of interest for investors is how the pandemic is impacting Pegasystems' sales - especially with the damage that COVID-19, especially in Europe, has done to SAP. The question astutely came up in the Q&A portion of Pegasystems' earnings call, and CFO Ken Stillwell answered (though a little less eloquently) that the company is as of right now not hearing of any negative customer impact from a supposed second wave. Per his remarks on the call:It's worth noting as well that Pegasystems counted among its customers a very high-profile public sector client: the U.S. census. The company's software was used to track digital responses to the 2020 census; Pegasystems' traction with federal engagements is a signal of its broad applicability across both commercial and public sector customers. Another positive indicator to watch is Pegasystems' margin profile. Though overall profitability is, again, impacted by the cloud transition, when we isolate gross margins for the cloud product alone, Pegasystems reported a huge improvement. In Q3'19, when Pegasystems' cloud business was only roughly half of its present size, its gross margin was only 49% - this quarter, cloud gross margins notched 64%, a 15-point improvement. The company cited the technical efficiencies that are gained through scale as the primary driver for the improvement. There is still head room for improvement, however, as Pegasystems noted its ultimate cloud gross margin target is in the mid-70s. Pegasystems continues to execute well in its cloud transition, which is more than halfway complete. Juggling large end-markets in CRM and BPM, and building up a steady ACV base alongside improving cloud gross margins, Pegasystems is a dark horse in the software sector that may prove a prescient play for a more cautious, risk-averse market."
4362457,103480,2020-07-30T14:40:14-04:00,"Shares of Pegasystems rallied ~10% after a strong second-quarter earnings release.
        Q2 revenues decelerated from the prior quarter as expected, but still came in above expectations.
        Most notably, Pegasystems' cloud ACV retained its 21% y/y growth rate, suggesting that a large part of Q2 deceleration was due to cloud shift.
        Pegasystems' end markets in CRM and BPM remain vast enough to guarantee a long growth runway.","Pegasystems (PEGA), the legacy software company with a hand in both CRM (customer relationship management) and BPM (business process management), has continued to prove itself as one of the most reliable value stocks in the software sector. Showing continued strength in its goal of converting toward a primarily cloud-based company, Pegasystems exhibited strength in its Q2 results - with total ACV continuing to grow in the low 20s, while cloud revenue growth rates are soaring above 50% y/y. Despite limited immediate post-market reactions, Pegasystems soared ~10% the day after reporting these results, marking one of its best one-day performances in recent memory:There were a couple key items for investors to watch heading into both this earnings quarter as well as the rest of the fiscal year. These are the items that will be driving the stock in the medium to long term:All of these indicators read positive in Q2, affirming the bullish thesis for Pegasystems. Recall that Pegasystems is addressing a massive >$80 billion combined TAM across both CRM and BPM, and that despite its lesser-known status among non-IT professionals in the software sector, Pegasystems counts among the largest blue-chip companies as well as public institutions in the world as its clients. Continue to stay long here.Let's now dive into the meat of Pegasystems' quarterly update. The financials are shown below:Figure 1. Pegasystems Q2 resultsSource: Pegasystems Q2 shareholder letterPegasystems' revenues grew 11% y/y to $227.4 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $225.8 million (+10% y/y) by a one-point margin. Now, at first glance, the first fact that you may pick up on is that Pegasystems' revenues decelerated sharply from 25% y/y in Q1.However, in the revenue breakout by category, what you'll note is that one of the items dragging down Q2 growth is consulting (-12% y/y), which had been flat at +1% y/y in Q1. This decline is actually favorable for Pegasystems - as you can see in the table above, Pegasystems essentially performs consulting/onboarding for its clients at cost, and consulting is actually a drag on Pegasystems' gross margins. As software companies grow larger and strike partnerships with resellers, they typically aim to offload a lot of this lower-margin work to third-party vendors (often referred to as ISVs) that specialize in this type of work.You'll note that one of the benefits is that Pegasystems' GAAP gross margins rose to 66.3% in the quarter (68.6% on a pro forma basis, excluding stock comp), up a sharp 410bps from 62.5% in the year-ago quarter (+370bps pro forma).Key to note as well is that Pegasystems' cloud revenue grew 54% y/y (barely decelerating from Q1's 54% y/y growth pace) and encompassed 21.5% of the overall revenue mix, up from just 15.4% in the year-ago quarter. This rapid revenue mix shift to cloud is another non-threatening driver behind the revenue growth deceleration - moving customers from perpetual licenses over to recurring cloud subscriptions essentially ""robs"" from near-term revenues in favor of spreading out the bills over the recurring future stream of payments. Pegasystems noted that over 90% of new client onboards were cloud deals, with the remainder as perpetual licenses - indicating growing customer acceptance of the cloud model.We like the fact that Pegasystems' ACV (annual contract value, representing the sum of its recurring revenue) still continued to grow at 21% y/y to $738 million, on par with Q1's 21% y/y growth pace and adding a net-new $27 million ACV in the quarter.Figure 2. Pegasystems ACVSource: Pegasystems Q2 shareholder letterAnother key metric that investors should watch is Pegasystems' backlog - healthy software companies continue to build up deferred revenue/backlog as an indicator of future revenue growth. Pegasystems' total backlog in Q2 increased $63 million sequentially, indicating that the company's overall deal pipeline is healthy. Pegasystems' management commented on the earnings call that growing backlog in the middle quarters of the financial year, especially at this quarter's 30% y/y pace, is unusual as most heavy deal activity centers around the fourth quarter of the year.Figure 3. Pegasystems backlog Source: Pegasystems Q2 shareholder letterAlso important is the fact that Pegasystems' CFO Ken Stillwell continued to note that the coronavirus has had a negligible impact on Pegasystems' overall sales momentum, and he even suggested that some customers are taking the pandemic as an opportunity to rewire their IT stacks and invest in a solid, flexible BPM for the future. Per his remarks on the Q2 earnings call:CEO Alan Trefler also highlighted some major public sector wins in the year-to-date. As seasoned software investors know from other companies like Salesforce.com (CRM) and Microsoft (MSFT), landing high-profile public institutions is a signal of a successful software company, and government contracts can sometimes provide some of the most lucrative billings possible in the industry. In the year to date, Pegasystems has won some notable clients in Europe, including the German state of Bavaria (the second-largest in Germany with 13 million residents, or roughly equivalent to Pennsylvania or Illinois) as well as the British taxing equivalent of the IRS.On the profitability front - we've already discussed the lift to gross margins driven by the intentional withdrawal out of consulting activities. Operating margins benefited too, especially from the fact that Pega's sales teams are working remotely instead of traveling to clients. Pro forma operating margins in the quarter rose to -11.3%, up 440bps from -15.7% in the year-ago quarter. A reminder here that cloud is a near-term headwind for operating margins as well, as it robs from lucrative upfront perpetual license revenue streams - but Pegasystems is scaling toward profitability very quickly, and consensus is calling for pro forma EPS to break even both for the current full year ($0.14 consensus) and FY21 ($0.49 consensus), versus -$0.44 in the prior year. This is a company that's gaining operating leverage very quickly, and management has a near-term goal of hitting the so-called ""Rule of 40"".Stay the course on Pegasystems. There are a load of positive indicators in Q2, including robust cloud revenue growth accompanied by strong ACV/backlog growth, as well as notable public sector wins plus expanding margins."
4361015,103480,2020-07-27T11:07:15-04:00,"Pegasystems, an enterprise software vendor focusing on business process automation and CRM software, has largely been an ignored software stock.
        The company has executed a successful shift to the cloud and now has >75% recurring revenue.
        Unlike many SaaS peers, Pegasystems is dramatically improving its profitability with an eye toward hitting the Rule of 40.
        Shares are trading cheaply at ~6x FY21 revenues.","It's getting harder and harder these days to find true value in the software sector. Investors have dumped shares of retail, travel, financial, and energy stocks all year and re-invested everything back into tech stocks, sending valuations soaring sky-high to levels some would say they haven't seen since the dot-com bubble. Amid a field of very expensive SaaS counterparts, however, Pegasystems (PEGA) stands out as an older software name that - despite having enjoyed respectable ~24% gains since the beginning of the year - still hasn't gotten the same frenzied attention as most of its peers.The key pieces of the Pegasystems bullish thesis, in my view, can be summarized as follows:Similarly-growing comps, meanwhile, trade at substantially richer valuations. Here's a look at where other similarly-growing (high-teens growth) software stocks are currently trading:Stay long here and be patient for substantial upside. One of Pegasystems' main objectives over the past few years has to move its customer base onto a modern, cloud-based consumption model. As of Q1, 78% of Pegasystems' revenue is based on recurring/subscription-based deals, though cloud itself is a smaller part of that overall total (though fast-growing, at +57% y/y in Q1). The company's ACV, or annual contract value, has also reached $711 million as of the end of 1Q20, up 21% y/y:Figure 1. Pegasystems revenue mixSource: Pegasystems Q1 earnings letterAnd looking at the quarterly trends in ACV growth shows that ever since Pegasystems began focusing on recurring revenues a few years back, the company has continued to build up strong ACV each quarter. Cloud is the fastest-growing segment of Pegasystems' ACV - meaning more customers are shifting toward accessing Pegasystems' software through the internet rather than owning a term license and running the software locally.Figure 2. Pegasystems quarterly recurring revenue trendsSource: Pegasystems investor presentationTo emphasize its seriousness in expanding its cloud presence, Pegasystems has created a new C-suite level leadership position to oversee the company's go-to-market and overall corporate strategy, filling the position with an executive from Microsoft (MSFT) who was responsible for growing its Microsoft Dynamics cloud apps business.Pegasystems' increased recurring revenue mix not only helps to shelter its business from near-term shocks like the coronavirus, but also gives it a high degree of revenue visibility. The company noted in its Q1 earnings call that it has 90% visibility into its FY20 revenue guidance. Let's now dive into Pegasystems' most recent first-quarter results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 3. Pegasystems Q1 earnings resultsSource: Pegasystems Q1 earnings letterPegasystems' revenues zoomed up 25% y/y to $265.6 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $256.0 million (+20% y/y) by a solid five-point margin - considering the coronavirus impact in the month of March, that five-point beat is truly impressive. As noted in the prior section, growth in cloud ACV was one of the biggest contributors to Pegasystems' success.Ken Stillwell, Pegasystems' CFO, even noted that the company faced very little impact from the coronavirus:Wall Street consensus for Pegasystems, meanwhile, is calling for just 11% y/y growth in Q2 and 17% y/y growth in the full year FY20 - given the 25% y/y growth pace in Q1, I'd say Pegasystems has a very low bar to cross.We note as well that Pegasystems managed to slim down its operating losses (which are largely a result of the company shifting revenue from upfront licenses to recurring revenue streams) to a near-breakeven -9% margin, seven points better than -16% in the year-ago quarter. The company has benefited, like many of its peers in the enterprise software sector, from travel bans on its sales teams and the cancellations of costly customer events - though Pegasystems has commented that its sales teams are still 100% operational remotely and still handling new client engagements. A lot about Pegasystems stands out especially with most of the tech sector trading at absurd multiples. This is a company playing in an incredibly large >$80 billion market, with respectable >20% y/y revenue growth and impressive cloud conversion results. Patient investors should buy in and wait for the stock's valuation multiple to right-size."
4305746,52852,2019-11-12T12:42:58-05:00,"PEGA is undergoing a business model transition from up-front to recurring revenues.As a result, financials are difficult to understand and investors must trust management guidance.However, aggressive insider selling makes it difficult to own shares.PEGA remains a ""show me"" story until insiders start putting ""money where their mouth is"".","Did you read that recent story calling out McDonald's (MCD) new CEO, Chris Kempczinski, for not owning a single share of McDonalds? A few days after the negative press, Chris bought $500K of MCD shares. Yeah, very awkward. It is hard to look shareholders' in the eyes and say ""trust me"" when you have little skin in the game.One reason I like Pegasystems (PEGA) is because its CEO, Alan Trefler, owns over 50% of PEGA's stock. Alan is a very smart guy and a great technologist, but the stock's problem right now isn't that anyone doubts its technology. The problem is that its transition from an up-front to a recurring revenue model is making its financials very difficult to understand.Yes, it is true that we've seen many perpetual-to-recurring transitions play out in the public market before, for example Adobe (ADBE) and PTC (PTC). I've been involved with both transitions and I can tell you that each one comes with some degree of ""trust me"" from management. Understanding each transition requires a lot of management hand holding and a lot of modeling assumptions on the investor's part.The same is true for PEGA's transition. In PEGA's case, consensus 2019 revenue calls for +3.8% sales growth and a -3.2% operating margin (source: FactSet). However, management tells us that ACV is the best indicator of the company's growth and that metric has been growing around 20% a year. I find this metric reasonable, but I also keep in mind that this is a non-GAAP metric that is both opaque and not audited. According to my notes from the September 2019 Deutsche Bank Technology Conference, PEGA's CEO indicated that they could hit the Rule of 40 by 2022. This means sales growth plus profit margins could hit 40% by 2022, implying a very valuable business indeed. As of 2019, PEGA is more like ""Rule of 0.6"", so investors must have a certain amount of faith in management's guidance and ability to execute.PEGA is a high quality company and I try to give it the benefit of the doubt, but insiders' aggressive selling of the stock is eroding my trust in their guidance. As a professional investor and self-proclaimed ""educator of the public"", it is my duty to call them out on it.Investors who have followed PEGA for a while knows that PEGA's CFO, Ken Stillwell, is the key driver of the model transition narrative and guidance. Thus, it is especially worrying to see Ken aggressively reduce exposure to the stock since March 2019.(Source: FactSet)To double check that the above ""Historical Position in Pegasystems"" chart is correct for the company's CFO, I went directly to the source: the Form 4. Shown below, as of 11/1/2019, the CFO held 6,568 shares of PEGA after exercising options and selling 1,000 shares in the open market.(Source: FactSet SEC filing)There is nothing wrong with selling some of your stock awards, but it becomes concerning when executives are selling more than they are getting over time. In the Form 4 below, PEGA's CFO held 13,169 shares of PEGA on 3/4/2019.(Source: FactSet SEC filing)In other words, PEGA's CFO reduced his holding of PEGA by 50% in a very short period of time. As of the most recently filings, PEGA's CFO owns less than $500K of PEGA. I don't know about you, but if I had insider information and really felt confident that PEGA could reach the Rule of 40 by 2022, I would hold on to as much stock as I can!Unfortunately, PEGA's CFO isn't the only one selling shares.The chart below shows that PEGA's head of engineering, Mike Pyle, has been aggressively reducing shares since around November 2017. Coincidentally or not, that was just ahead of PEGA's more aggressive approach to transitioning to the recurring model, which resulted in 2018 revenue growth of 6.1%, half the growth rate of 2017.(Source: FactSet)PEGA Director, Rich Jones, has also been aggressively selling shares since May 2017. From May 2017 to now, this director sold ~110K shares worth ~$8M at current price levels.(Source: FactSet)In conclusion, although I would very much like to believe in PEGA's model transition story, in final analysis, it is difficult to see progress in its audited financials and key insiders are aggressively reducing their holding of PEGA shares. Until I can see it in the numbers, or until insiders start demonstrating more confidence in the stock, I will be sitting out on this one."

4232217,98236,2019-01-08T22:47:04-05:00,"Pega remains in a dusty corner of the enterprise software space from the point of view of investors.On the other hand, some of the numbers reported last quarter suggest a powerful growth story, not really portrayed by the headline numbers.The company has a technology that combines sales force automation with Business Process Engineering to provide users with functional capabilities not readily available elsewhere.The company has been able to start to leverage its technologies into a rather substantial increase in bookings growth.That said, the transition from traditional consumption paradigms of on-premise and subscription to the cloud has obscured the operational growth of the company, affording patient investors with a decent valuation at which to enter the shares.","It has been about a year since I last wrote about Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) - and I doubt that many people have either noticed or pined for me to take up the keyboard and compose a screed on the subject. And in looking back on some metrics, I find it hard to take exception to the lack of interest regarding this name. In the last year, the shares have gone up and down and wound up about where they started - although that isn’t much worse than the software index as a whole which is up 8% since the start of last year. But unlike the average software company which has seen substantial growth in reported numbers over the past year, Pega looks set to report just mid-single digit top-line growth and a substantial profit decline over that same span. And so far as it goes, if one were to believe the First Call consensus - and I do not - this current year, i.e. 2019, is supposed to feature more of the same with further mid-single digit growth and no improvement in margins.So why bother with the name? There are plenty of more exciting software companies when it comes to growth; as I commented to a fellow investor over the weekend, a few quarters of 70% growth can fix almost any valuation problem one can conjure. Pega is not a 70% growth vehicle, but neither is it doomed to single-digit growth. And I am not recommending the shares because the valuation is low - although that certainly helps. Pega shares are not going to be for some readers - they are the proverbial dusty corner with only 5 analysts covering the name. And so long as the current CEO remains, the company will not get sold - although should he choose to retire, Pega would be almost certainly sold at a premium valuation within months. And, as explained below, the headline numbers are still at levels that will not get the company to screen well - and that remains a significant component of the investment process, at least for institutions.But the art of analysis, as opposed to the “science,” consists of trying to look behind numbers and discern trends and in the case of Pega, try to evaluate when the company’s operational performance will be reflected in headline numbers and a different valuation paradigm. At the start of last year, I had hoped that such an evolution would be at hand; that didn’t turn out to be the case - but despite that detour, the company actually has had a more than respectable performance in terms of the metrics that should interest investors - in particular the strong growth of its ACV (Annual Contract Value). In particular, the company has seen its total ACV grow by 20% this year and its product ACV grow by 36%. That latter metric is more like the results seen by a hyper-growth company, rather than an investment such as this stuck far away in a dusty corner. In addition, the company’s Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO), which is a new caption coming into use by many software vendors to illuminate future committed revenue streams, grew by 10% sequentially to greater than $500 million. Some of that growth is the timing of the remaining perpetual deals that Pega books, and part of it can be maintenance renewals. But it is still a decent leading indicator and represents the success of the company’s selling motion. Well, more than half of the RPO balance relates to future cloud revenue commitments and the cloud RPO for Pega actually grew by more than 23% in Q3 compared to Q2 levels.Given the overall growth in ACV, the growth in cloud RPO and the absolute growth in recognized cloud revenues (67% in the quarter and 60% through 9 months), I think it is fair to categorize Q3 as a period of blow-out results, obscured by a transition to the cloud that is substantially greater than had been forecast by the company.Over the course of years, many companies of this vintage (Pega was founded in 1983) have made the transition from on-premise revenue to subscriptions to cloud. Some of them such as PTC Inc. (PTC) and Aspen Tech (AZPN) have wound up being fabulous investments even when lacking massive top-line growth characteristics. (Neither PTC nor Aspen has shown material revenue or earnings growth in the past several years and in the case of PTC, much of its modest growth has been inorganic. Nonetheless, PTC shares appreciated 20% over the past year while Aspen, despite a substantial oil and gas vertical exposure, has seen its shares appreciate 15%. Other significant names that have gone through a similar transition such as Autodesk (ADSK) and of course Adobe (ADBE) really do have substantial growth opportunities, and their valuations have escalated meaningfully.Pega is in the midst of a similar transition, but with the advantage that it has technology that is market leading in a strong business segment. Obviously, that hasn’t been enough to see the shares show any kind of appreciation. But hope, as the saying goes, or as Alexander Pope once put it, springs eternal. I feel reasonably confident that the First Call consensus numbers for the current year will be handily beaten both with regards to revenue growth and reported earnings.In addition to the somewhat opaque financials whose headlines can mislead investors, Pega has a rather unusual niche in its market space. Overall, Pega is often described as a CRM company, and depending on one’s definition that is the case. As readers are probably aware, there are a plethora of competitors in the space, starting with Salesforce (CRM), including all of the stack vendors with Microsoft (MSFT) showing some specific strength, and nowadays including hyper-growth contenders such as HubSpot (HUBS). A couple of years ago, integrated predictive analytics might have been a differentiator - and perhaps Pega still has a lead in this component of a CRM solution - but Salesforce has Einstein and everybody is going to have some form of integrated AI with not all that much differentiation.Gartner even has a category called “cool vendors” which sounds a bit much. There isn’t all that much room left for independent vendors, and while the outlook for HUBS, CRM and MSFT remains strong, I would never recommend Pega shares because of the company’s participation in the space. Gartner describes the company as a leader in its CRM MQ analysis and to some extent, it does offer a very unique set of solutions.So, what does Pega have that has led the company to a period of substantial growth recrudescence? Firstly, it has a strong quality mantra compared to some of its rivals. Its releases aren’t buggy, its SFA capabilities are probably more extensive than any of its rivals'. At the moment, the Decision Hub platform is considered the class of the industry. It does all of the things now, that AI is supposed to do including prescriptive, next step guidance. It has what is described as a forecasting widget that provides insights into forecasting accuracy - one of the banes of the existence of almost any sales executive. That lead may not likely persist indefinitely - but at the moment it is a benefit that Pega can offer.But the real advantages the company has are two-fold. It is one of the few companies that provides its users with a common data model and single platform code base for options across on-premise, multiple clouds and hybrid deployments. I have commented about this advantage in writing about Cloudera (CLDR) in its niche and it is a palpable capability that is appreciated by most users who simply do not want to have to deal with vendor lock-in.The other major advantage offered by Pega is that its solution, unique in the space, combines business process modeling, automation and typical sales force automation capabilities on a single platform. This allows the company to successfully compete for larger and more complex deployments. It has been very successful in the financial services vertical where customers are trying to help end-users decide on proper insurance coverage or on an appropriate mortgage. Most end-users are not quite ready for digital transformations that rely exclusively on a self-service paradigm, and are looking for customer service representatives to guide them through a process to a beneficial outcome.Pega addresses a subset of the market for CRM although it addresses more than the market for BPM, but does so with a set of solutions that offer substantially greater benefits for users. Not all users want to go through the wrenching process of re-engineering their processes along with using those reformed processes to deploy a digital transformation strategy. It is not the easiest thing for an enterprise to undertake and choosing to go with a relatively smaller vendor such as Pega to accomplish a relatively substantial undertaking is a tough decision to make. But it is relatively clear at this point that most enterprises will have to go through their own digital epiphanies over the coming few years. Their own customers simply will not be willing to continue to consume services without having access to technology that allows them more choices and more self-service. And when those epiphanies arrive, Pega is there with the least painful set of solutions available and the best record of success. That is really why the company has been successful in significantly re-accelerating its growth.Along with a few other software vendors, Pega, in its most recent release, offers low code and no-code versions of its product. At some point, the no-code paradigm, as it improves, is going to be a requirement for most software vendors. At the moment, however, it appears that Pega, and competitor Appian (APPN) are pioneers in offering this capability in their niche - and there appears to be a fair level of enthusiasm for using low-code capabilities in Pega’s Cloud Choice offering.Rather than looking at Pega’s well-known CRM competitors, it is more relevant, I believe to consider the competitors it has in the Business Process Management (BPM) space which is really where the heart of the company’s technology. While Pega has a variety of CRM solutions, it is not going to compete for projects that are focused on simply automating the sales process by providing templates and analysis of sales activity. Potential clients for Pega are those who need to fix their workflows to deal with digital transformation requirements while they also implement a sophisticated CRM process. And potential clients are going to be those who accept that complexity is part of what a buyer signs up for in implementing Pega. I have linked here to the latest Gartner evaluation of the space. As has been the case for many years, Pega is considered to have the most effective set of tools in this space in every one of the use cases that were considered by Gartner. Appian and Software AG are basically tied for 2nd. Forrester has ranked Pega as the leader in what it calls the “digital decisioning space.” Most recently, a consultant called Ovum has named Pega as the leader in robotic process automation. I think it is fair to suggest that Pega has a lead in terms of its functional capabilities; that doesn’t always translate one for one into revenue growth leadership.Pega has developed something called a Situational Layer Cake, which is designed so that users can reuse common policies and procedures in multiple applications. This is considered by some to be a substantial capability that distinguishes the company offering.In the BPM space, Pega's major competitors these days are IBM (IBM), Software AG (OTCQX:STWRY), and Appian. There are many other competitors in the space who focus on the mid-market. At this point, most of Pega’s emphasis is on deepening its relationships with Fortune 500 clients - although it does have something called PegaExpress designed for smaller implementations and offering a ""no-code"" capability.The company most investors will focus on as an analog to Pega is Appian, which has been valued highly because of its low-code development engine. These days, APPN has an EV/S that is about double that of Pega, although its headline growth is just 15%. Its product revenue growth was most recently reported at 42%, however. Appian is a company that is transitioning from a professional services revenue model to one based primarily on subscription. At this point, just a bit more than half of its revenues come from subscription, and that pushes its “real” valuation to extraordinary levels.Pega’s other largest competitors have been around for a long time. They are multi-product companies and BPM is one of just many of their offerings. As the Garner evaluation suggests, Pega has functional advantages of different kinds compared to all of them. Earlier in the article, I linked to an article that evaluates the space, Pega and its leadership role. The article is well worth reading by any investor with an interest in the shares.Pega’s future direction at this time is essentially more of the same. The crucial improvements the company needs to develop will be those that make the software easier to adopt. Pega has been a leader in embracing DevOps capabilities to improve deployment but still has a long way to go. It continues to release more AI features as well as robotics and automation functionality. Pega’s future success is unlikely to be limited by technology - its challenges are to find more implementation partners and to make it easier and quicker for its customers to implement its solutions.One of the problems in evaluating Pega is that the headline numbers that are typically used to analyze a company are in a state of flux and really do not accurately depict what is going on in terms of the operational performance. That has limited the upside Pega shares have been able to deliver - or better said - the shares have been stuck in neutral for 18 months while many investors have seen far better performance from hyper-growth holdings with much higher valuation. The company hasn’t provided a specific guide as to when the build-up in cloud commitments it has sold will start to overtake the negative influences of the transition to ratable revenue sources.Just for the record, so far through 9 months, Pega has seen a decline in term licenses as well as a decline in perpetual licenses. Cloud revenues, as reported, have risen by 60% and their percentage and dollar growth rate are accelerating - but they are still just 9% of total revenues. Maintenance revenues are still rising - Pega’s applications are sticky and even modest increases in the base will keep maintenance revenues growing. Consulting revenues have been flat - Pega is attempting, with some degree of urgency, to attempt to recruit more SI partners and is throwing assignments their way. Overall, this is an economy that has seen a shortage of high-skill SI consultants and it is difficult to find new partners. It is one of the risks of the company strategy.The overall mix of these revenue streams has meant that reported revenues have been essentially flat on a year-to-date basis, although they were up last quarter. Pega does not really provide short-term revenue guidance. At the moment, the First Call consensus calls for revenue growth of 5.5% in the quarter to be reported in late February. I would not be surprised to see the company grow at a faster cadence than the consensus forecast - mainly because I expect there was a significant end of year budget flush which is likely to have brought along a large perpetual deal or three for Pega.Last quarter, the company missed the consensus EPS target by a moderate amount - again, the company does not really provide anything like quarterly earnings guidance which typically winds up being a guess. The company has ramped sales and marketing head-count noticeably and the success of the company’s selling motion is increasing commission expenses as well. GAAP sales and marketing expense rose by 40%, mainly reflecting new hires and higher commissions. Research and development expense is also rising, but just by 13% last quarter on a GAAP basis. The strong growth in sales and marketing expense drove reported GAAP earnings to a loss and led to a minimal level of reported non-GAAP EPS.Overall, Pega’s reported performance show trends that do not accord with the reality of its business. The CFO said that the switch to cloud had penalized the top line by more than $40 million year to date, compared to the initial expectation for a cloud bookings percentage of 30%. That mix switch has had the impact of reducing reported revenue by about 7% of reported revenues. Presumably, most of this revenue would have been profit, and the EPS impact of the mix swing is probably in the range of at least $.50. In addition, Pega had a large maintenance renewal - $35 million - that was recognized last year. That alone would have contributed another 500 bps to reported revenue growth.Overall, the cloud now represents 51% of bookings but just 11% of revenues last quarter, which suggests that magnitude of the impact of the transition. I would expect that over time, Pega will do away with perpetual licenses which have now declined to just 10% of revenues, and simply offer subscription and cloud consumption models.Unfortunately, Pega has not really provided a completely transparent set of assumptions that investors and analysts might use to specifically equate the company’s growth to expectations on an apples-to-apples basis. Overall, absent this transition, and absent the impact of the one-time maintenance renewal anomaly, I think Pega would be seeing mid-high teens growth this year. Based on the company’s business momentum, my guess is that growth percentages will rise, but exactly how much revenue growth might be reported in this current year is difficult to project at this point and will be strongly dependent on the ratio of cloud to other bookings - a metric that is simply impossible to forecast.Pega is still generating cash, paying dividends and buying back stock. But free cash flow has been constrained by the transition as well. The $50+ million increase in remaining performance obligations that the company reported on a sequential basis this past quarter will be generating cash flow over several years, although about half of it is contracted to be paid by users over the coming year.The CFO, at least thus far, hasn’t chosen to provide all of the tools that an analyst might need to either project cash flow or to recast earnings on a steady state basis. I imagine that the company will show more than 5% growth on a reported basis next year (the current First Call consensus estimate), simply the level of 1-year cloud RPO has reached $88 million which compares to reported cloud revenue of $58 million through the 1st nine months of this year. The cloud RPO actually doubled in the quarter, another indicator of just how strong cloud bookings actually were.I haven’t discussed Pega valuation metrics in any detail, simply because they do not present an accurate picture of the company’s business momentum, The EV/S is, as mentioned quite a bit below the average for a mid-teens growth rate, at about 3.7X. On the other hand, the company has a constrained free cash flow margin that results in a relation to growth a bit less than the average based on reported numbers.I am not able to suggest with any certainty that the company management will provide sufficient visibility into bookings strength so that investors become convinced of the business momentum I have deduced from the numbers. And until that happens, I don’t imagine that Pega shares will dramatically outperform the IGV. But for investors willing to look into a dusty corner, evaluate technology and look behind headlines, the upside of Pega shares is substantial. I like this kind of a bet, although it may well require more patience than might be the case for some of the hyper-growth names in my coverage universe."
4200254,103480,2018-08-18T05:21:18-04:00,"Pegasystems reported a strong Q2 earnings quarter, despite missing analyst expectations.A faster-than-expected shift into cloud bookings proved to be a headwind on revenue growth, but overall revenues turned positive this quarter (versus -8% y/y last quarter).ACV, meanwhile, accelerated to 20% y/y growth, up sequentially from just 15% y/y in Q1.The company has disclosed significant amounts of revenue that have been committed, but will not be recognized until the next few years.In addition, more than half of the company's new bookings were cloud deals.","Pegasystems (PEGA) reported Q2 results earlier in August, and from the looks of this quarter, it looks like Pegasystems is becoming much healthier with regard to its cloud transition than it was last quarter. Recall that back in Q1, Pegasystems reported a faster-than-expected transition to the cloud, which ate into the company's near-term revenues and caused a -8% y/y top-line decline accompanied by a large drop in profitability.This quarter, Pegasystems not only managed to increase its growth rate in ACV (annual contract value), which indicates the growth in its recurring revenue base versus perpetual deals - but the company also managed to turn around its negative revenue comps to positive single-digit growth. This trend might suggest that, despite strong cloud transition metrics, Pegasystems will still be able to produce positive y/y comps going forward.Not only that, but shares of Pegasystems are about 10% cheaper from last quarter - so in my view, Pegasystems' value proposition looks a lot better for investors.PEGA data by YChartsI would still wait and see if Pegasystems' shares see any further pressure before dipping my toes in, but the company is certainly approaching a buy point.Let's dive into deeper detail on Pegasystems' cloud transition - which, for Wall Street, is probably the most important aspect of the company's Q2 results.The primary measure of Pegasystems' shift to recurring revenue is the growth in its ACV. Ultimately, the larger Pegasystems' ACV becomes, the more of its revenues are ""locked in"" on an annual basis.This quarter, as shown in the chart below, Pegasystems' ACV grew 20% y/y to $515 million. Term and cloud ACV (the higher-margin portion of Pegasystems' business), meanwhile, grew 31% y/y to $251 million.Figure 1. Pegasystems ACV growthSource: Pegasystems investor relationsPegasystems' annual revenue run rate is just shy of $1 billion, so this means that just over half of Pegasystems' revenues is already locked in. Note that ACV growth this quarter also represents an acceleration from last quarter, where total ACV grew 14% y/y to $494 million.Alan Trefler, Pegasystems' CEO, also noted that this quarter was the first time that cloud bookings (at 54% mix of total bookings) comprised more than half of total bookings in the quarter:It's true that this larger mix of cloud bookings has a negative near-term impact - as we'll discuss shortly, Pegasystems missed Wall Street's estimates in Q2. But in return, Pegasystems is building a strong pipeline of revenues in the future, for multiple years out.The following table gives a good illustration of how much committed revenue Pegasystems has built into its pipeline:Figure 2. Pegasystems forward-looking revenue pipelineSource: Pegasystems investor relationsI've previously noted that Pegasystems faces plenty of competition in both CRM and BPM from the likes of Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM), and others. However, it seems that Pegasystems is able to hold its own, with its growing ACV complemented by large customer wins such as FedEx (FDX) and Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD). A new offering called Pega Infinity, launched at this year's PegaWorld, will further cement the company's market share.Here's a glance at Pegasystems' full Q2 results:Figure 3. Pegasystems Q2 earningsSource: Pegasystems investor relationsTotal revenues grew 6% y/y to $196.8 million, reversing a trend of -8% y/y from last quarter. Note that Pegasystems broadly missed Wall Street expectations of $217.3 million (+16% y/y), but the company certainly has a good explanation for why - a much larger-than-expected mix of cloud bookings.Looking at the bookings mix from the other way (perpetual deals) also helps to explain the shortfall in revenues. Pegasystems had guided to higher revenues in Q2 because it had expected cloud bookings to be 30% cloud, not 54% (it did a bad job of predicting the customer mix, but investors looking for long-term growth should be pleasantly surprised). Perpetual license deals, as a result, dropped to just 14% of total bookings in the first half of 2018 (versus 57% in 1H17) - so these large upfront one-time deals essentially got cut out of this quarter's revenue base, hurting the y/y comp. Here's some further color from Pegasystems' CFO:Pegasystems' operating losses more than doubled in the quarter, as increases in sales and marketing ramped to support the cloud transition - but essentially, Pegasystems is investing upfront into deals that will pay out over longer periods of time, so this trend shouldn't be too worrying. Wall Street had expected pro forma EPS of $0.19 versus the company's result of breakeven, but again, we should be more patient with a company in transition mode. Pegasystems is probably one or two years out from generating a steady-state level of profits, so for now, we should concentrate primarily on the company's cloud transition progress.Pegasystems' Q2 cloud metrics are incredibly encouraging, especially given the fact that the company was able to produce positive y/y revenue growth after exiting Q1 with -8% y/y growth. Looking purely at Pegasystems' revenue and earnings miss is misleading, as the shortfall to expectations was caused by a favorable shift to cloud bookings. In my view, Pegasystems is a much more attractive investment now than last quarter, when shares were trading in the mid-$60s. Continue to monitor the shares for an entry point."
4173460,103480,2018-05-13T12:30:57-04:00,"Pegasystems reported a mixed Q1, beating on revenues but missing bottom-line estimates.Revenues declined -8% y/y as the company's shift to recurring revenues ate into the company's short-term billings.Earnings margins also took a hit, as the company ramped up sales spending amidst declining revenues.Though Pegasystems' cloud ACV is still growing, it's questionable if the company has room in the crowded CRM market for the long term.","Pegasystems (PEGA), the legacy vendor of CRM and BPM software solutions, has just reported a mixed Q1 to kick off the fiscal year. The chief focus for the company this year will be its continued transition to the cloud. As competitors are moving to cloud-based, subscription-style services in the style of Salesforce.com (CRM), Pegasystems too has been modifying its business model off the legacy on-prem method and toward a fully recurring revenue base.The cloud transition, as seen by other companies that are undertaking it, is not an easy one. Spreading out revenues over a longer subscription term that used to provide a large upfront one-time license fee has made Pegasystem's near-term results extremely choppy, just like Autodesk (ADSK), which is undergoing a similar phase in its transition. This quarter, despite a beat to Wall Street's expectations, Pegasystems' revenue dipped -8% y/y.Still, however, investors reacted positively to the quarter, sending shares of Pegasystems up 3% in response. Shares are racing toward all-time highs as the stock has already rallied nearly 40% in the year-to-date period:PEGA data by YChartsAt Pegasystems' current market cap of $5.06 billion and enterprise value of $4.81 billion (netting out $255 million cash on the balance sheet), the stock currently trades at a 5.1x EV/FY18 revenue multiple, based on the company's FY18 guidance of $950 million for the year. That could be considered a value stock in software, where the average SaaS company trades between 6-7x forward revenues. However, with the uncertainties surrounding Pegasystems' cloud transition, there's a fair amount of risk baked into that seemingly low valuation.In addition, while Pegasystems is reinventing itself in the cloud, there's no guarantee that it can get over its image as a legacy provider. CRM is an incredibly crowded space, and Salesforce commands the lion's share of the market alongside other large-cap incumbents like Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT). On the BPM side, Pegasystems has fierce competition in new IPO Appian (APPN), which is billing itself as a low-code BPM software platform requiring little technical skills. Given how competitive its field has become, on top of execution risk stemming from a 360-degree cloud transition, I'd stay on the sidelines for this one.While Pegasystems beat analysts' expectations on the top line, results in Q1 took a sharp turn for the worst relative to Pegasystems' results exiting Q4:Figure 1. Pegasystems Q1 resultsSource: Pegasystems investor relationsTotal revenues declined -8% y/y to $235.2 million, driven primarily by the push for cloud billings acting as a near-term headwind against current quarter revenues. The company also pointed to a large $35 million license renewal in the comparison period (1Q17) as one of the reasons for the revenue decline, but it's still no justification for failing to find replacement revenues in the current quarter. Analysts had expected $232.4 million in revenues or -9% y/y, indicating a modest one-point beat to consensus expectations.What's alarming, however, is that Pegasystems had grown at 20% y/y in Q4, surpassing analysts' estimates for 4% growth. Of course, some of the gap between Q4 and Q1 results is due to Pegasystems' adoption of the ASC 606 accounting standard, but the difference in optics is still unsettling. Q4 had made us believe that Pegasystems could achieve its cloud transition without impacting its near-term revenues by too much, but Q4's results had been deceivingly optimistic.Pegasystems' target FY18 revenues of $950 million implies 13% y/y over FY17 revenues of $840.6 million. When the company is kicking off Q1 with an -8% y/y decline, we have to wonder if Pegasystems' goal is attainable. Unlike other SaaS companies that continually beat forecasts and raise their guidance ranges, Pegasystems has a spotty earnings record and is very liable to miss its targets. Probably anticipating this line of thinking, CEO Alan Trefler noted the following on the earnings call:Of course, we know that the revenue decline was in part strategic - we had just hoped that license declines wouldn't be that drastic. In answer to an analysts' question during the Q&A portion of Pegasystems' earnings call, CFO Kenneth Stillwell noted that approximately 80% of the bookings made in Q1 were recurring revenue bookings.By all regards, that's a fantastic figure. All cloud metrics surprised to the upside this quarter, as shown in the chart below:Figure 2. Pegasystems ACV growthSource: Pegasystems investor relationsTotal ACV (the annual contract value of all of Pegasystems' sources of recurring revenue) grew 15% y/y to $494 million. The company called out that its growth in cloud ACV was twice the rate of its license (on-prem ACV), with cloud revenues in the quarter growing at 50% y/y.At least in the near term, however, cloud progress comes at the expense of this quarter's profitability. Gross margin fell sharply to 67.8% in the quarter, down 560 bps from 73.4% in the year-ago Q1. In theory, the company's transition to cloud and recurring revenue streams should bring improved margins in the long term, but we've yet to see those advances in Pegasystems' actual results.Further margin deteriorations occurred on the opex side. Sales and marketing costs jumped 27% y/y to $88.4 million to support the 8% revenue decline. Again, the assumption here is that a renewed sales push for cloud revenues will bring long-term benefits in the future, but in the interim, it causes mayhem in Pegasystems' earnings. GAAP operating income contracted heavily to just $7.9 million, representing a tiny 3% operating margin, down from $65.9 million and a 26% operating margin in 1Q17.Pro forma net income, too, sank 63% y/y to just $20.3 million, translating to pro forma EPS of $0.24. This was sharply below analysts' expectations of $0.31.I believe Pegasystems' shares are fairly valued at 5x forward revenues, especially in the context of a cloud transition on uneasy footing and revenue growth that jumps from double-digit growth in one quarter to -8% declines in the next. With its results so unpredictable, Pegasystems is a risky play especially as it advances toward all-time highs.It will likely take several quarters for Pegasystems to stabilize its growth and establish a more normal revenue pattern from its shift into a larger recurring revenue base. Q4 had investors hoping that the company was embarking on a renewed growth push, but Q1 has now nullified those hopes. Until the company shows that it can sustain growth for several consecutive quarters, I'd stay on the sidelines."
4156568,103480,2018-03-15T03:07:53-04:00,"Pegasystems posted a huge revenue surprise in the fourth quarter, growing 20% y/y after dipping slightly in the negative last quarter.The company has seen revenue headwinds recently as it continues to transition to a cloud subscription sales model.In spite of this, Pegasystems is pointing to 13% y/y growth in FY18, a slight acceleration over 12% growth in FY17.Pro forma earnings are also expected to expand 40% y/y, showing the company's heightened profitability due to the cloud transition.Pegasystems also increased its ACV 15% y/y to $469.5 million, driven by an increase in cloud contracts.","Thus far, the month of March has been a bit of a comeback month for previously ill-fated tech stocks. The market has seen bouts of volatility over the past few weeks on a macro basis, with talks of steel tariffs, trade wars, and the exits of Cohn and Tillerson from the White House shaking stocks off their recovery course from the February correction. Despite broader market turmoil, however, ""legacy"" tech stocks have held in well - including and especially Pegasystems (PEGA), the software vendor that has a dual specialty in both CRM (customer relationship management) and BPM (business process management) software.Pegasystems was a penalty box stock last quarter, with Q3 results having badly missed Wall Street's estimates. It goes to show, though, that in the enterprise software world, the timing of major deal closings can mean the difference between night and day. The revenue that might have missed one quarter's books can slip into the next. And it seems that's exactly what happened with Pegasystems, which compensated for a huge revenue miss in Q3 with a correspondingly huge beat this quarter.Even better yet, on the company's earnings call, CEO Alan Trefler noted that the company also ended the year with the ""largest license and cloud backlog we've had in the company's history, increasing 23% or $120 million."" The gains made this quarter aren't just one-offs - it's a bona fide win for billings in the quarter.Naturally, the stock rallied in tandem with good results. Since reporting earnings in the tail end of February, the stock is up 10% (versus about flat for the broader market), and since the beginning of the year, Pegasystems has rallied nearly 30%.PEGA data by YChartsYet despite the recent strength, shares still look appropriately valued. Taking Pegasystems' last closing price of ~$62, the company has a market cap of $4.83 billion and an enterprise value of $4.60 billion, netting out its $223 million of balance sheet cash. Versus the company's FY18 guidance of $950 million (implying +13% y/y growth, and also a huge upside to consensus expectations at $892 million or 6% y/y growth), Pegasystems has an EV/FY18 revenue multiple of 4.8x.That's certainly not unreasonable for a company that posts profitable GAAP net income (one of the few companies in the software sector to do so), while also posting positive free cash flow and modest growth in the mid-teens. Pegasystems' undemanding valuation suggests that the stock still has some catching up to do next to much richer-valued peers. While Pegasystems is no longer exactly a high growth stock that can achieve 7-8x revenue multiples, its return to modest growth at least merits it consideration in a tech portfolio. Watch for near-term pullbacks to add a position in the stock.Growth is something that has eluded Pegasystems for quite some time. The 30-year old company has been left in the dust by peers in both CRM and BPM (especially by the likes of Salesforce.com (CRM) in the former category) and is a bit late to the cloud transition game. But the company has indicated full focus on transitioning customers to cloud subscriptions now, and the company is seeing an uptick in growth in response.See the company's Q4 results summary below:Figure 1. Pegasystems Q4 results snapshotSource: Pegasystems investor relationsAs shown above, Pegasystems posted knockout 20% y/y growth to $239.5 million in revenues for the quarter, a huge positive upset against analysts who had penciled in a consensus target of $208.4 million, or 4.4% growth, for the quarter.To be fair, analysts were simply extrapolating off the data they had. Pegasystems actually declined by 2% y/y in Q3, so their 4.4% growth assumption in Q4 was already somewhat optimistic. The fact that Pegasystems blew analysts away with a 15-point beat margin and reversed course from a decline to 20% growth certainly has a huge impact on how traders and investors are thinking about the stock. No longer is Pegasystems an out-of-date software vendor struggling to catch up in the cloud - it now seems like the company can hold its own.What's especially impressive is the fact that the transition to cloud typically acts as a headwind to revenues, as we are currently seeing with the likes of Autodesk (ADSK). Autodesk has seen negative y/y revenue comps for quite some time, though the company did see modest growth in the past two quarters. This is typically because transitioning from upfront license deals to longer subscription deals spreads the revenue out more evenly across future quarters, instead of maximizing near-term revenue. Though this appears to have hurt Pegasystems in the past, it seems that's no longer the case.The company's CFO attributed the huge revenue beat to three ""whales"" (self-defined as a deal over $10 million in committed spend). For the full year 2017, the company only had four ""whales"" (with three landing in Q4), as compared to five in 2016.Note also that Pegasystems' ACV has grown 15% y/y to $469.5 million, or about half of its FY18 guidance. This essentially means that half of Pegasystems' 2018 revenues have already been locked in and contracted, setting a solid foundation for growth.Figure 2. Pegasystems ACVSource: Pegasystems investor relationsAnother tidbit picked up from the earnings call - Pegasystems is looking to be more acquisitive going forward, as the company becomes more serious about growth. Management is mulling over an equity raise to finance these acquisitions (the $223 million of balance sheet cash is hardly sufficient) - and while this move may be short-term dilutive, acquisitions are probably the fastest way for Pegasystems to break into newer markets as its ""legacy"" offerings saturate.Earnings, too, showed a meaningful bump - helped, of course, by the three ""whale"" deals, as it typically doesn't require much more in incremental cost to bring in a large client than a small one. GAAP operating income nearly doubled to $20.0 million (an 8% margin, a meaningful expansion from 6% operating margin in 4Q16), with efficiencies captured across all components of Pegasystems' operating spend.On the net income front, GAAP earnings aren't as meaningful due to the impacts of the new tax legislation, but pro forma EPS of $0.27 handily beat consensus of $0.15 as well as growing 35% y/y.What you're getting with Pegasystems is atypical of the software sector: a comeback story. With this quarter's earnings, Pegasystems has shown that it hasn't become an outdated technology, as evidenced by the three new large clients it has signed on. Its return to double-digit growth - no less, 20% growth - has signaled to investors that its contraction phase might be ending. With a cheery outlook pointing to 13% revenue growth and 40% pro forma earnings growth, it's easy to see why Pegasystems has rallied so much in the past month.Keep a close eye on how this stock trades in the coming weeks. If you can snag Pegasystems under $60, you'd land a fantastic deal. Pegasystems' return to growth as well as its strong cash flows ($158 million in OCF, or nearly a 20% OCF margin in FY17) merit it at least a 5.5x EV/FY18 revenue multiple, implying a $70 price target."
4141876,98236,2018-01-31T16:19:00-05:00,"Pegasystems shares have been parked in neutral since it released third quarter results.As a result, its valuation is not as extended as that of many other vendors.The company is in the midst of transition from a more traditional hybrid software model to one based primarily on the cloud.The company enjoys a strong and under-appreciated competitive position in two strong enterprise IT market segments.The company's expense management is leading to the potential for greater longer-term operating margins.","“At Long Last Love” is one of those great American standards from Cole Porter. It was first performed for his 1938 musical, “You Never Know.” OK, I'm a bit long in the tooth, but I never heard it performed until I heard the version recorded by Frank Sinatra in the early 1960s. It has been sung by many different performers over the years and has brought pleasure to millions. Probably the most famous line in the song talks about whether or not the performer sees Granada or only Asbury Park. People were beating up on New Jersey long before this decade.In the case of this article, I have incorporated another line from the lyrics, which plaintively asks as to whether this is “the real turtle soup, or simply the mock?"" This writer is not particularly fond of either - I will take a Lobster Pan Roast from the Oyster Bar any day of the week compared to turtle soup. But the question is whether or not Pegasystems (PEGA) is worth looking at after a couple of supposedly busted quarters. Netting it out, I think this is a worthwhile time a and a worthwhile entry price into the name. Pega has typically reported very lumpy quarters, both good and bad. And often large deals of the kind to move the needle are consummated at the end of the calendar year. Last quarter, based on the sparse results seen thus far from earnings releases, was a pretty reasonable time to sell large enterprise software deals.Pega, with its hybrid everything, in terms of both consumption models and these days solution offerings as well, can be a bit difficult for many investors to understand. A few weeks ago, a writer on this site panned the company and its stock. I have my own ways of valuing companies in this space. The author of that article uses other techniques that perhaps serve him well.Pega shares often beat to their own drummer, so to speak, and the share price performance this past year has been no exception. The shares initially gained about 65% through June and then, in the wake of a couple of earnings reports that were not well received, they have fallen around 20%. They have participated in January’s rally to some extent, having gained about 7% this past month.For those unfamiliar with this company, it has been around for many years. Perhaps surprisingly, it still has solutions that address many of the problems users have fought against through the years. It was founded 35 years ago by Alan Trefler and perhaps surprisingly he still has a majority shareholding in the company, and remains deeply engaged as CEO. Not to put too fine a point on the matter, but it is almost inevitable than whenever Mr. Trefler chooses to step down as company CEO, and to relinquish control of the business, the company will be snapped up by one of a host of potential acquirers. There are no signs of that happening in the near term and Mr. Trefler, who is just 62, appears to be in excellent shape. But the potential is always there for Mr. Trefler, worth over $2 billion, to become a full-time philanthropist.The company has made some acquisitions through the years, but most of its growth has been organic. While many readers doubtless aren’t concerned about that, one thing that Pega’s strategy has accomplished is to present users with a unified codebase. It is a major differentiator for the company.Pega is a company that over the years has combined what is called a rules-based engine together with the creation of rather sophisticated applications. The software is perhaps more admired by developers than line of business managers. Most of the applications for which Pega tools are used to build are in the CRM space and its larger customers tend to be those with massive call centers and large customer-facing CSRs. Nowadays, like many companies, Pega solutions use lots of AI tools. The solutions are designed to work without data scientists. AI is still in its infancy, but I have written in the past that it is one reason why users have been willing to invest a bit more in IT at this point than has been true during similar periods of a business cycle.Pega users can choose to use Pega Cloud that's based on AWS infrastructure. They can use their own private cloud. And Pega can be used on most clouds of other application vendors. Indeed, it offers what it calls a cloud choice guarantee, which is a significant differentiator. Gartner evaluates Pega in its analysis of Business Process Management suites. I have linked to the study which shows Pega as the clear leader for the 11th year in a row. Most of the players in this space are not particularly well known, although both Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) have offerings. Appian (APPN), which is a relatively recent IPO, also is a competitor, although its valuation is in another universe compared to Pega.Pega also is a leader in Gartner’s evaluation of vendors which offer customer engagement center software. Pega ranks No. 2 in this space, well below Salesforce.com (CRM) in terms of its ability to execute and tied in terms of its vision. Gartner includes companies such as Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT), SAP (SAP) and Zendesk (ZEN) in its analysis. I think most end-users, such as this writer, would recognize how very different these offerings are. Pega offers a product called Customer Decision Hub. This is a technology somewhat similar to, but perhaps more useful than the current incarnation of the Einstein offering of Salesforce.Over time, it is likely that this technology (AI) will be a major demand driver for Pega, although that will be a process more than a pivot point. At this point, the company gets the highest scores in the Gartner survey for modeling and predicting customer behavior and communicating these conclusion, as next-action prompts to field agents. Its customers give it the best cost-to-value rating of all the solutions assessed by Gartner.Pega has been a successful company through the years and it is nearing a run rate of $1 billion/year in annual revenues. It is profitable, and it generates cash. But I think given the reviews to which I have linked and the growth rates of the business segments in which it operates, it is fair to suggest that Pega should have grown faster and has the potential to achieve far greater growth than forecast by consensus views.Part of the current issues relate to its transition to the cloud and to a higher proportion of ratable revenue sources - but this company has rarely achieved its full sales potential. Part of the opportunity is that with the company’s strong product portfolio coupled with a positive environment for IT spending, the ability to over attain expectations is considerable.Pega has never been an easy company to follow simply because it has offered both perpetual and subscription licenses of various kinds for many years. At this point, it is also undergoing a transition to offering on-demand consumption models in the cloud that further adds to the complexity of deciphering the income statement. Indeed, that has meant that looking at the unadorned income statement frequently misleads investors with regards to the company’s actual business strength and its expense management. The headline numbers with regard to Q3 look mediocre at best, with revenue comparisons year-on-year showing a small decline, paced by a rather noticeable decline in software license revenues. Management acknowledged that some significant software deals slipped, and that led to a disappointing revenue quarter. Operating expenses rose modestly. And on a GAAP basis, the company went from a profit to a loss. The non-GAAP presentation was a bit better due to stock-based comp. But even on that basis, the actual reported EPS was down substantially year-on-year.As it happens, the unadorned numbers give a completely misleading view of the business that would lead investors to an inaccurate conclusion. Many years ago, I told the CFO of this company to present a bookings proxy rather than to go through the contortions it does in presenting its results. These days, the company reports all the data necessary to develop relevant sales performance data but still doesn’t do all that well in presenting its story, and it has yet to furnish investors with a bookings proxy that would be relevant to many in forming specific expectations.I'm not going to detain readers with trying to contrast Pega with another Massachusetts-based vendor PTC Corp. (PTC) that's going through a somewhat similar transition. PTC shares have shown strong relative performance even though the reality is that Pega has enjoyed more rapid growth in product revenue bookings. The issues of the cloud transition and its optics were in sharp focus last quarter where Pega’s reported headline miss and its dramatically changed revenue mix was partially a function of a more rapid transition to recurring revenue sources and away from perpetual. In the quarter, recurring revenue arrangements were 79% of reported revenues compared to a prior company forecast of 50%/50%. Losing something like 25% of reported license revenue to mix swing, which is essentially what's happening, is a phenomenon that has not been entirely understood by Pega shareholders and many commentators, partially because of the company’s inability to effectively communicate with regard to the dimensions of this transition with investors and analysts. While the 79% metric is likely to prove to be an outlier so far as 2017 results are concerned, it does suggest that the trend is accelerating and will likely reach to a greater level sooner than many may have modeled.To an extent, that mix swing is a function of Pega’s increasing revenue generation from the CRM space compared to the BPM space. In this past quarter, the mix swing probably cost the company $20 million in reported revenues at 95% gross margins. And because of the kind of transactions Pega sold, this difference doesn’t show up in CFFO either. What has been visible is the company’s deal count, which has risen by 40% last quarter, and the number of new name accounts. Last quarter, the company closed no “whale” transactions which hurt comparisons as well compared to the prior year, when it did close one such transaction which boosted perpetual license revenues by more than $10 million.This swing is going to remain significant in 2018 and perhaps it will do so at an equivalent rate to the ultimate mix swing in 2017. At this point, the company has adopted a strategy of selling cloud first. Perpetual license models still remain available but not terribly surprisingly not many new customers are interested in anything other than cloud. Cloud was still only 20% of bookings in the latest reported quarter, but that percentage is likely to reach 50% or more at some point in 2018. The revenue impact for this company will be noticeable, but not as noticeable as other companies that did not offer subscription-based pricing in the past.Recently, the company CFO appeared at a Needham growth conference. Part of the Q&A focused on the tradeoff between growth and margins. At the moment, the company is forecast to report 8% growth in 2017 and 10% growth in 2018. EBITDA margins for last year expected to have been in the high teens. The CFO said he was a believer in the “rule of 40” in which the combination of growth plus EBITDA margins ought to be 40%. The inference one might reasonably draw is that net of the model transition, Pega is focused on achieving a CAGR of 20%. That's not an expectation that's shared by most investors or analysts at this point and is a significant opportunity for the company. Underneath reported numbers there is evidence that Pega actually can produce 20% top line growth and achieve some operating leverage. But one has to search far beneath reported numbers to see how that might happen. Overall, last quarter the company’s license and cloud revenue backlog has grown by 29% year on year. Some of this shows up on the deferred line on the balance sheet but much of it consists of contractual commitments from users that are not recorded on the balance sheet. The company’s backlog actually increased by almost 6% sequentially, an usually strong result for a Q3 when bookings are typically at a seasonal nadir.The company’s term license and cloud annual contract value rose about 23% year-on-year and a bit more than 5% sequentially, again an unusually strong result for that metric in a summer quarter. Overall, I think it is fair to say that sales performance, as reported, was quite strong and probably above specific internal performance expectations. A proxy product revenue bookings number would show a year-on-year increase of more than 25%, suggesting that the company is experiencing accelerating growth.Given the robust growth in bookings it is not all that surprising that operating expenses are climbing, but they are climbing much more slowly than revenue bookings. On a GAAP basis, sales and marketing expense rose by less than 5% year-on-year, while research and development costs rose by 8% and general and administrative costs rose by 12%. Overall, while the sales and marketing expense ratio is not at unusual or elevated levels at a bit under 40% of revenues, research and development spend at 23% of revenues is probably higher than ratios for other software companies of this size. Stock based comp at 7% of revenues is far less than similar ratios at many other software companies although it has risen noticeably in 2017 compared to year earlier levels.The company’s cash flow from operations rose substantially in the first nine months of the fiscal year. There are many seasonal factors in cash flow, particularly including accounts receivable balances and even the balance of deferred revenues which in actual dollars tends to rise substantially due to annual maintenance bookings at the end of the year. But, for what it is worth, over the course of the first nine months of the year, operating cash flow increased dramatically (more than 5X) with much of the increase stemming from the change in net assets and liabilities. Stock-based comp was 34% of CFFO this year and was more than 100% of last year’s CFFO for nine months. These trends have been persistent throughout the year and more or less continued in the last quarter.As I mentioned earlier, an article on this site panning the shares a few weeks ago suggests that the company’s problems relate to competitive issues and those of scale. I think that is a gross over-simplification and is a case of looking for reasons to justify a recommendation rather than trying to understand the nature of the competitive environment before making a recommendation.I think there's little doubt that Pega would do better than it has if it weren’t competing in whole or in part with Salesforce. Most line of business buyers - the ones who actually make decisions regarding call center automation projects - are obviously not focused on technical virtuosity per se and trying to sell Pega’s specific benefits is not always easy given’s CRM’s mindshare dominance. And there is an enormous difference between a packaged app that can be customized, and which is based on templates such as what Salesforce offers, and a set of tools that allow a user to build their own solution with significant input from consultants, either third party or employed by Pega. Packaged software almost is always going to start out in a pole position in a competitive evaluation and it can be a struggle for Pega to figure out how to sell to line-of-business executives.In point of fact, as the CFO suggested in the recent Needham growth stock conference, Pega’s strategy is not to displace or compete directly with Salesforce and with the sales automation paradigm as it has evolved. At this point, that would be a strategy doomed to frustration. Pega has taken steps to improve its overall sales coverage and to hire less technical sales reps who have some background in the CRM space. The company also is trying to advance a marketing message to focus on specific verticals and specific apps. That said, Pega does have its reference customers such as Sprint and Cisco which have been able to implement projects based on Pega technology in months rather than years that have seemingly have wrought dramatic improvement for those customers. Changing an engineering-oriented company to one with a marketing focus, especially given the background and predilection of the CEO, will be no easy matter, and one that's likely to be a process with some disappointments along the way.The competitive issues that Pega has in competing with Appian are a bit more straightforward. Appian since its IPO has become a rather well-known Pega competitor but they have competed for 15 years or so. Much of Appian’s business is in the government vertical, not a focus of Pega. Most recently, Appian has started to offer a low-code product that's somewhat similar to that offered by Pega. According to Pega’s commercial, its no-code solution goes live 6.4X faster than coded apps. The Gartner study, while certainly placing Appian in the leader’s quadrant, also suggests that its reference customers rate the overall value of the Appian platform lower than those of the market leader (Pega). Gartner also says that Appian’s machine learning capabilities are more limited and unproven compared to those of “more-visionary” vendors - again Pega. Appian is about 25% of the size of Pega and it is quite unprofitable. There's little reason to believe that Pega will have serious problems in maintaining its competitive position within the BPM space.Appian has a rather fantastic valuation for a company with its growth rate (about 12X revenues, actually) and its share-price run since mid-December has been startling, to say the least. But it really doesn’t do BPM any better than Pega, at the least, and given Gartner’s commentary about difficulties in managing complex contractual negotiations with Appian, there's no reason to think it offers potential buyers a superior purchasing experience.Because Pega partially sat out the tech rally of the past year, its shares are far more reasonably valued than many of its peers. This is so, even though the company’s headline numbers, particularly in Q3, significantly understated the economic value of the company’s sales activity. At the moment, Pega has 83.3 million fully diluted shares outstanding on a non-GAAP basis. The company has a market cap of about $4.2 billion. With about $200 million of net cash, its enterprise valuation is $4 billion. While only five analysts report their estimates to First Call, their consensus revenues estimate for the current fiscal year are in the $890 million range which seems a reasonable forecast given the company’s stated emphasis on maximizing cloud transactions this year. That yields an EV/S of a bit less than 4.5X. Overall, that ratio is probably a bit on the low side, depending on what growth rate assumption makes sense. It is far below the EV/S ratios of the company’s principal competitors, Appian or CRM. I think as its cloud transition continues, it is more likely than not that its growth rate and valuation will tend to converge with its two rivals. The analyst consensus non-GAAP EPS estimate for next year is just EPS of $.79. Just how much that number is impacted by the transition to cloud is hard to determine. The company’s cost remediation strategies are seemingly working effectively. There's no particular reason why this company can’t achieve greater sales productivity or a lower general and administrative spend ratio. It is all a question of the inflection point in the transition which the CFO has said ought to be at some time in this current year. But using the current EPS estimates, Pega has a forward PE of about 40X, and given how a subscription model works, the P/E for 2019 may be no more than 25X. That's a ratio well below peer companies, and particularly for peer companies in transition.As mentioned earlier, the company’s CFFO has accelerated materially in the first nine months of the year. That said, much of the rise in cash flow came from the balance sheet and specifically from improvements in “other assets and liabilities.” This is not something that's repeatable year-after-year. Pega may achieve CFFO of greater than $150 million this year, with free cash flow just a little less than that. But until deferred revenues start to swell at outsized rates because of the transition, Pega will not specifically be a cash flow story. The company does pay a minimal dividend which consumes about $10 million/year in cash. It has a modest share repurchase plan in place, but it is not of a magnitude that will significantly move the meter in terms of anticipated EPS. There has been no indication if or when Pega will move to a more shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy.I think Pega shares represent an excellent value or GARP name in the enterprise IT space at this time. I sadly sold my own position earlier in 2017 and missed a good part of the appreciation seen earlier last year. I'm looking to return the name to my portfolio at some point, sooner rather than later, despite missing part of last year’s share price appreciation. I think the company is likely to have achieved some success in closing whales in what was apparently a strong software quarter for many vendors. I would not be surprised if one or two of those whales proved to be perpetual deals that might lead to a substantial revenue upside.At this point, the analyst consensus forecast for 2018 is quite prudent, most likely reflecting the optics of the company’s transition to cloud. The company also may provide conservative guidance simply because they are unable to determine the cadence of the mix shift and how that will impact reported revenues and EPS. That's a good set-up for potential share price appreciation. I think many observers still do not appreciate the benefits of the Pega solution and its strong competitive position. I expect the shares to produce significant positive alpha over the course of this year."
4131327,24157,2017-12-12T11:47:59-05:00,"This firm’s profits, ROIC, and margins have all fallen in recent years as competition has flooded the market.A disconnect between revenue and profits comes from rapidly declining margins.The expectations embedded in the current stock price imply that the firm will immediately begin growing profits and for many years into the future.","After nearly 30 years of operating in a relatively stable industry, this firm's profits, ROIC, and margins have all fallen in recent years as competition has flooded the market. However, the stock's valuation has not adjusted to reflect new competitive pressures or the rapidly deteriorating fundamentals. This week's Danger Zone pick is Pegasystems Inc. (PEGA).Since 2013, PEGA's revenue has grown 14% compounded annually. Over the same time, its after-tax profit (NOPAT) has fallen 11% compounded annually to $33 million in 2016 and $25 million over the last twelve months, per Figure 1. The disconnect between revenue and profits comes from rapidly declining margins. The company's NOPAT margin fell from 9% in 2013 to 3% TTM. Declining margins and inefficient capital use have knocked PEGA's return on invested capital (ROIC) down from a once impressive 22% in 2013 to 9% TTM.Figure 1: PEGA's NOPAT & Revenue Since 2013Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsPegasystems' executive compensation plan fails to properly align executives' interests with shareholders' interests. The misalignment helps drives the profit decline shown in Figure 1 and enables executives to earn large bonuses while shareholder value is destroyed. Executives' annual bonuses are tied to many different metrics, most of which fail to measure shareholder value creation. The metrics used include revenue, license signings or bookings, operating income, and qualitative goals approved by the board of directors. Long-term equity incentives are awarded via stock options and restricted stock units. Equity awards are given within the context of each executive's total compensation based on the value associated with their job.The bottom line is that executives are incentivized to achieve revenue growth, at any cost, and as they earn nice bonuses, PEGA's economic earnings have fallen from $32 million in 2013 to $5 million TTM.We've demonstrated through numerous case studies that ROIC, not revenue, bookings, or license signings, is the primary driver of shareholder value creation. A recent white paper published by Ernst & Young also validates the importance of ROIC (see here: Getting ROIC Right) and the superiority of our data analytics. Without major changes to this compensation plan (e.g. emphasizing ROIC), investors should expect further value destruction.Pegasystems is among a long list of firms that use non-GAAP metrics, such as non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP net income, to present rising ""profits"" while economic earnings decline. Our research digs deeper so our clients see through the illusory numbers. Below are some of the items Pegasystems removes to calculate its non-GAAP net income:These adjustments have a large impact on the disparity between GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, and economic earnings. Over the TTM period and 2016, PEGA removed $50 million (over 100% of TTM GAAP net income) and $41 million (over 150% of 2016 GAAP net income), respectively, in stock-based compensation expense to calculate non-GAAP net income. Combined with other adjustments, PEGA reported TTM non-GAAP net income of $64 million. Per Figure 2, GAAP net income was $49 million and economic earnings were $5 million TTM.Figure 2: PEGA's Non-GAAP Metrics Mask Declining Economic EarningsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsPegasystems operates in the highly competitive industry of customer relationship management, or CRM. Its software provides marketing, sales, services, and operational applications to businesses. This industry consists of a few large providers, and numerous smaller firms competing in niche areas. The biggest competition comes from household names such as salesforce (CRM), SAP, Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and International Business Machines (IBM). Other competitors include Infor, NetSuite (acquired by Oracle in 2016), SugarCRM, Insightly, and Zoho.One defining characteristic of the large competitors (excluding salesforce) is high ROIC and NOPAT margins. Per Figure 3, PEGA's ROIC and NOPAT margin rank near the bottom of this group. The only competitor with lower margins is Salesforce, a previous Danger Zone pick, which has taken the ""Amazon approach"" and foregone profitability to grow market share. With lower margins and less resources to subsidize losses, Pegasystems is at a competitive disadvantage.The firms at the top of Figure 3 have the ability to pour large amounts of capital into their CRM systems and remain profitable via their other cash generating business lines. PEGA's late transition from traditional licensing deals to more recent ""software-as-a-service"" deals gave competition a leg up that will be difficult to overcome.Figure 3: Pegasystems' NOPAT Margin Lags PeersSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsAny bull of PEGA must believe it can achieve what numerous other software companies have been unable to do: transition from a perpetual license/maintenance business model into a subscription/recurring revenue model. Unfortunately for investors, PEGA's transition coincides with the falling profits noted in Figure 1 above. Since 2013, term licenses and cloud revenue have increased from 15% of revenue to 23% in 2016. The growth in these areas has come at the expense of perpetual licenses and services and training.Figure 4: PEGA's Expenses Outpacing Revenue GrowthSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsAs the transition continues, PEGA must differentiate itself from the litany of large CRM providers, which Forrester notes, ""can just about tick every box"" when it comes to features. Furthermore, PEGA's is attacking the industry from a smaller market share than the four main providers. Per IDC, Salesforce's market share sits at nearly 18%, Oracle around 9%, and SAP around 7%. Older reports from Gartner list Microsoft as the fourth largest CRM provider, Adobe fifth, and IBM sixth.The challenges in gaining market share, particularly in an industry led by Salesforce (serial acquirer, willing to operate at a loss) are the heavy spending required to advertise, promote, and convince clients of the value of your platform. Such spending can be seen in PEGA's operating expense growth. Per Figure 4 above, research & development, general & administrative, selling & marketing, and cost of revenues have all grown faster than revenue since 2013. Despite heavy spending, Forrester noted in its analysis in late 2016 that Pegasystems customers complained about a lack of trained resources and Gartner found in 2017 that it ""remains a challenge to integrate Pegasystems with real-time data sources.""Perhaps most alarming to any bull case is that PEGA's valuation doesn't reflect the challenges the company will face moving forward. Instead, the expectations embedded in the current stock price imply that PEGA will immediately begin growing profits and for many years into the future.PEGA has risen 41% year-to-date, while the S&P is up 18% over the same time. Shares have fallen 10% in the past month though as earnings missed both top and bottom line expectations. This recent drop could be just the beginning as investors realize the disconnect between the company's current financial performance and the significantly higher profits implied by the stock price.Figure 5 shows PEGA and its application software peers compared on the basis of ROIC and enterprise value divided by invested capital (a cleaner version of price to book). As you can see, ROIC explains 66% of the changes in valuation for PEGA's peers.Figure 5: ROIC Explains 66% of Valuation for Application Software PeersSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsPEGA stands out as an outlier in Figure 5 and trades at a significant premium to its peers. If the stock were to trade a parity with the peer group, it would be $15/share - 69% below the current stock price. Given the firm's subpar and declining fundamentals, it should be clear PEGA does not deserve such a premium valuation.Our discounted cash flow model quantifies the expectations baked into that premium valuation. To justify its current price of $50/share, PEGA must achieve 6% NOPAT margins (double the 3% TTM margin) and grow NOPAT by 20% compounded annually for the next 15 years. This scenario seems overly optimistic given that PEGA's NOPAT has fallen 11% compounded annually over the past four years.Even if we assume PEGA can slow expense growth and achieve a 6% NOPAT margin and grow NOPAT by 14% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is still worth only $17/share today - a 66% downside.Each of these scenarios also assumes PEGA is able to grow revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or investing in fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create optimistic scenarios that demonstrate just how high expectations embedded in the current valuation really are. For reference, PEGA's invested capital has grown $22 million on average (3% of 2016 revenue) each year for the past five years.The largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call ""stupid money risk,"" which means an acquirer comes in and pays for PEGA at the current, or higher, share price despite the stock being overvalued. Pegasystems' CEO's disinterest in being acquired would make a takeover less likely.He noted in 2010 he would ""rather eat sand"" when asked whether he would entertain a takeover by a large vendor like IBM. Then in late 2016, via leaked emails, it was released that Salesforce could be interested in acquiring Pegasystems. Via a public announcement and other comments, the CEO noted that Pegasystems is ""not remotely interested."" A spokeswoman noted that Pegasystems aims to grow the company ""on our own terms"" as well.Given the CEO's stance, his position as majority shareholder, and PEGA's lofty valuation, competitors would be better suited to use their competitive advantage to out compete PEGA rather than imprudently allocate capital and destroy substantial shareholder value in an acquisition.However, we can still model just how expensive PEGA remains even after assuming an acquirer can achieve significant synergies.To begin, Pegasystems has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, PEGA is worth less than its current share price.Figures 6 and 7 show what we think Microsoft (MSFT) should pay for PEGA to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. MSFT competes with PEGA with its Microsoft Dynamics platform and purchasing PEGA could not only eliminate a smaller competitor but also bring new technologies, such as PEGA's predictive engagement, in house. However, there are limits on how much MSFT would pay for PEGA to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows (or lack thereof) being acquired.Each implied price is based on a 'goal ROIC' assuming different levels of revenue growth. In both scenarios, the estimated revenue growth rate is 8% in year one and 10% in year two, which is the consensus estimate of PEGA's revenue growth for the next two years. For the subsequent years, we use 10% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of next year's expectations. We use 15% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with MSFT would create revenue synergies thorough increased exposure to MSFT's larger market share.We conservatively assume that MSFT can grow PEGA's revenue and NOPAT without spending anything on working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also assume PEGA immediately achieves a 12.5% NOPAT margin, which is the average of MSFT's and PEGA's current NOPAT margin. For reference, PEGA's TTM NOPAT margin is 3%, so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best-case scenario.Figure 6: Implied Acquisition Prices for MSFT To Achieve 7% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 6 shows the 'goal ROIC' for MSFT as its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or 7%. Even if PEGA can grow revenue by 13% compounded annually with a 12.5% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is worth much less than its current price of $50/share. It's worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 7% ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal MSFT's WACC.Figure 7: Implied Acquisition Prices for MSFT To Achieve 26% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 7 shows the next 'goal ROIC' of 26%, which is MSFT's current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to MSFT shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most MSFT should pay for PEGA is $8/share (85% downside to current valuation). Even assuming this best-case scenario, MSFT would destroy over $3 billion by purchasing PEGA at its current valuation. Any scenario assuming less than 13% compound annual growth in revenue would result in further capital destruction for MSFT.Expectations for PEGA's earnings have been significantly cut throughout 2017. 2017 EPS expectations have fallen 34% since the beginning of the year. Similarly, 2018 EPS expectations have fallen 45% since the end of 2016. Despite the cuts in consensus estimates, PEGA continues to miss lowered expectations while the stock rises. The company has reported EPS below consensus in three of the past four quarters. In two of those quarters, the stock reacted as one would expect.While expectations have been lowered, the stock still reflects overly optimistic profit growth, as highlighted above. If PEGA fails to meet a lowered bar again, the stock could fall, as investors realize the company's software is struggling to gain market share in a highly competitive market. Competitor success could also weigh on Pegasystems shares. If Microsoft, Oracle, or even Salesforce continue to report impressive gains in their CRM business, investors could rotate out of PEGA and into more ""growth oriented"" tech names.While we don't attempt to predict exactly when the market will recognize the disconnect between expectations and reality, we know the impact of failing to meet expectations can be dangerous to investors' portfolios. After a large rise in price throughout 2017, PEGA represents an unfavorable risk/reward tradeoff.Over the past 12 months, five thousand insider shares have been purchased and 360 thousand have been sold for a net effect of 355 thousand insider shares sold. These sales represent less than 1% of shares outstanding.Short interest is currently 1.5 million shares, which equates to 2% of shares outstanding and two days to cover. There has been a jump in short interest this year, as the number of shares sold short has nearly doubled since June 2017. Growing short interest would seem to imply we're not the only ones who recognize the issues facing PEGA and its lofty valuation.Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform forensic accounting with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill fiduciary duties.

4124844,103480,2017-11-14T15:21:00-05:00,"Pegasystems has been victim of bad optics recently, as its transition to subscription revenues has hurt revenue comps.The company's Q3 revenue missed consensus badly, but largely due to the timing of last year's large license deals. The stock has sold off in response, creating a buying opportunity.Pegasystem faces a lot of concerns about its ability to compete in CRM, and while this is valid, not enough credit is given for its market-leading strength in BPM.Of the two, BPM (business process management software) is the more greenfield opportunity, given the saturation in CRM and success of large competitors like Salesforce.As the company continues to ease into its cloud transition, it should see better y/y comps and generate more enthusiasm for its prospects.","It's been a bad month for Pegasystems (NASDAQ: PEGA), with investors running for the exits after a huge top-line miss in Q3. For an enterprise software company, there's probably nothing worse. Pegasystems sold off from all-time highs near $65 and now trades nearly 20% lower, in the low $50s.Still, though, shares are up a good amount this year (see the YTD chart below), reflecting investors' confidence in Pegasystems' fundamental profile. Trading at just 4.5x EV/FY17 revenues, however, Pegasystems appears undervalued - especially as it's one of the few enterprise software companies to post GAAP net earnings (GAAP earnings have doubled year to date), and as its operating cash flows have quadrupled.PEGA data by YChartsBears might argue that the low revenue multiple is deserved - after all, Pegasystems has only grown its revenues in the low single digits year to date, and revenue growth actually turned negative in Q3. A cursory look at the company might yield the conclusion that Pegasystems is a tech company in decline; when in reality, it's just undergoing its transition toward subscription-based revenues.Pegasystems is an old software company, founded in the 1980s. It's still weaning itself off the ""old way"" of doing things: charging large upfront perpetual license fees and making annual revenues from maintenance contracts and software upgrades. The company, in fact, calls large license deals in excess of $10 million ""whales"" - and Q3's optical y/y decline was largely due to the fact that 3Q16 had a ""whale"" while 3Q17 did not.As the company moves more toward subscription revenues (which Wall Street values much more than one-time license deals, due to their recurring nature) which give the company a longer and more profitable growth trajectory, ""whales"" will become less common. Right now the company is up against difficult y/y comps because license deals are still impacting the prior year's numbers, but going forward, the tough comps will fade.Pegasystems isn't the only company undergoing the cloud transition. Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK), another decades-old software company in the computer-aided design space, is also working through its own transition to the subscription model, and like Pegasystems its y/y revenue comps are showing optical declines. Companies that have been able to pull this off - like Adobe (NYSE: ADBE), whose revenue is now nearly 100% subscriptions - are richly rewarded by investors.Yes, Q3 could have been better. But there are plenty of reasons to justify that, given the faster-than-expected shift toward subscription revenues and away from one-time ""whales,"" the quarter wasn't as bad as it seemed. And though Pegasystems has come under a lot of flack for its lower momentum versus CRM leader Salesforce.com (CRM), Pegasystems is an undisputed leader in its other major product line, business process management (BPM) software. Given these fundamental drivers, the post-Q3 selloff appears overdone and should be seen as a buying opportunity.In Q3, Pegasystems posted revenue of $179.8 million (-2% y/y) versus 3Q16 revenue of $182.8 million, deeply below analyst consensus of $200.1 million (+6% y/y).Figure 1. Pegasystems Q3 resultsSource: Pegasystems earnings press releaseOn the earnings call, CEO Alan Trefler noted that the underperformance in revenues was due to a lack of execution ""in closing some key Q3 deals."" This statement is open to interpretation - the deals could very well have been pushed to Q4, in which case the underperformance in Q3 was partially driven by deal timing, which doesn't have any long-run impacts. The major reason for revenue underperformance and the y/y decline, however, was driven by the company's accelerated transition to the subscription model - more on that in the next section.The top-line news also masks the favorable earnings trends that Pegasystems has seen year to date. Though Q3 swung to a small GAAP loss (and pro forma EPS of $0.05 was under consensus of $0.17), year-to-date, Pegasystems' GAAP net income has increased 101% - nearly double.Though Pegasystems trades at a ~66x P/E multiple on consensus FY18 P/E of $0.79 (according to Yahoo Finance), its 101% growth rate suggests that the PEG ratio is below 1 (0.65x), implying that Pegasystems is undervalued relative to its earnings growth.Pegasystems has also achieved fantastic cash flow results year to date. In the nine months through September 2017, it has generated $113.9 million in operating cash flow - up nearly 6x from the prior year-to-date period's OCF of just $20.6 million.The key sound bites from this earnings quarter: while investors might have preferred to see a couple more deals stuffed into Q3 revenues, a combination of deal cycle elongation (possibly) and subscription transitioning (definitely) is what caused the miss in revenues, and neither of these is indicative of longer-term deterioration in performance. The company will, more than likely, return to high single-digit or low double-digit revenue growth in Q4. Indeed, Pegasystems' latest guidance calls for $860 million in FY17 total revenues, still up 15% y/y (see chart below) and implying acceleration in Q4. In addition, the news of the one-off revenue miss has masked the fact that year-to-date, Pegasystems has managed to achieve a doubling of its GAAP net income and a much larger improvement in its cash flow results.Figure 2. Pegasystems guidance updateSource: Q3 investor deckLet's now dive further into the subscription transition and how that's impacted the company's Q3 results.To understand what the company is counting as recurring revenue versus one-time revenues, we have to distinguish between subscriptions, term licenses, and perpetual licenses.Subscriptions are classic SaaS contracts - generally priced per user, and paid on a monthly or annual basis. Term licenses are similar to subscriptions, but they cover a certain number of years that customers commit to upfront, and term license revenues are recognized ratably over the time period. Both of these revenue streams count as ""recurring revenue."" On the other side of the equation, we have perpetual licenses - the ""whales"" over $10 million as well as other smaller deals that give customers the right to use Pegasystems' software in perpetuity and are paid upfront.Going into 2017, Pegasystems had forecasted a ratio of recurring revenue to perpetual licenses of 50/50. In actuality, year to date through Q3, Pegasystems' ratio was 62/38, meaning that Pegasystems has shifted its revenue base into recurring streams at a faster pace than it originally anticipated.On the earnings call, the company's CFO added an additional kicker: every 1% mix shift away from the original 50/50 plan toward subscriptions reduces FY17 revenue by approximately $3 million. The movement toward a recurring subscription base is what Wall Street wants to see - subscriptions bring in more revenue over the long term and are more profitable on a per-customer basis - but it comes with some short-term pain. Year to date, had the company stuck to its 50-50 mix, revenues would have been $36 million higher ($637 million in YTD revenue, implying +16% y/y growth rather than +9% y/y growth). But overall, the accelerated movement toward subscriptions is a positive long-term development.The fact that 3Q16 contained a ""whale"" in excess of $10 million, and that 3Q17 contained no ""whales"" and fewer upfront deals in general, contributed heavily to 3Q17's optical y/y decline and the revenue miss. Q3, in fact, had the largest departure from the 50/50 ideal mix of recurring revenue: Q3's ratio of recurring revenue to perpetual licenses was 79/21, which management described on the earnings call as ""amazing.""Yes, the business missed in the short term, but long-term the growth picture is still very much intact. In his prepared remarks, Pegasystems' CFO stated the following:He also notes that cloud and term deals bear higher costs than perpetual licenses deals despite bringing in less in single-quarter revenue, hurting the results in the short term but actually setting the company up nicely for the long term.Overall, Pegasystems has amassed an ACV (annual contract value) of $449 million, up 17% y/y. This is revenue that Pegasystems already has locked in at the beginning of the fiscal year and doesn't have to chase. Companies that don't have any recurring revenue start every year from scratch; for Pegasystems, it begins the year with nearly half a billion in revenues and the rest of the new business it brings in is purely incremental.Figure 3. Pegasystems ACV growthSource: Q3 investor deckAside from the Q3 revenue decline (which, as we've discussed, is mostly optics), the other bearish factor weighing on Pegasystems' shares is the question over how defensible its positioning is within the CRM space.Yes, Salesforce.com is all the rage in CRM. No company can compete with its years-long reign in the space. Forbes estimates Salesforce's market share at 22%, with Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) and SAP (NYSE: SAP) as the runners-up, and Pegasystems is a distant laggard. The CRM space is also littered with competition from startups and private companies - SageCRM, Zoho, Agile CRM, you name it. There are dozens of competitors in the space.Yet, investors who are quick to blame Pegasystems' lack of a grip on the CRM market as the driver behind its earnings miss forget that Pegasystems is the undisputed leader in the business process management space, which is the more greenfield opportunity.Almost every serious company now uses a CRM system to increase efficiency in its sales force. The CRM game is now about stealing market share and convincing clients to switch to your platform; it's no longer about signing up customers for the first time. BPM, on the other hand, is a largely untapped arena, as it encompasses a wide variety of activities that automate and drive efficiencies within everyday business processes.Customers can use the Pega Platform - Pegasystems' PaaS offering that underpins its BPM capabilities - to design a check-the-box workflow that improves routine business processes and routes tasks to individuals in a chain. While CRM is a large part of Pegasystems' current business, it's only one of the vast capabilities of the Pega Platform (shown below, taken from the company's 10-K). The Pega Platform enhances Pegasystems' addressable market much beyond the crowded CRM space.Figure 4. Pega Platform capabilitiesSource: Pegasystems 10-KPega's market positioning in BPM, ""work management,"" and ""digital automation"" functions - all of which generally revolve around the idea that businesses can speed up everyday tasks and save on costs by using software to drive more of its internal processes - is clearly recognized by the market.As shown in the slide below, taken from the company's Q3 investor deck, Pegasystems is indeed considered behind Salesforce in CRM. It is, however, the highest-rated platform in a variety of BPM-related categories, as judged by leading industry analysts Gartner and Forrester Research:Figure 5. Pegasystems competitive positioningThe orange dot represents Pegasystems, and in the 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Intelligent Business Process Management Suites (first chart from left), it's the highest-rated vendor, with only recent IPO Appian (NASDAQ: APPN) as its closest comp.As an aside: Appian grew revenues at 45% y/y in its most recent earnings quarter and is one of the best-performing IPOs of 2017, with shares up 55% since going public. With the BPM space still vague and not yet littered with incumbents, there's plenty of business for both of the leaders in the space.Going forward, it's likely BPM will anchor Pegasystems' growth more than its CRM offerings, and in this space, it's a recognized leader with a solid grip on the market.After the stock's recent decline, Pegasystems trades at only a 4.5x EV/FY17 revenue multiple, based on its guidance for $860 million in FY17 revenues.While it's true that Pegasystems' growth rate pales in comparison to other cloud peers like Salesforce (growing at 26% y/y as of its most recent quarter), it makes up for it by posting positive GAAP earnings and having much higher profit margins. Versus a basket of software peers that are within its approximate revenue range, Pegasystems trades at a much lower revenue multiple:CRM EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsPEGA EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsPegasystems' slower growth does merit a valuation discount, but it shouldn't be as drastic as to peg the company at 4.5x revenues. A more reasonable multiple would be 5.75x (where the company traded recently this summer, as seen in the chart above), implying a price target of $66 and 27% upside from current levels.Technology investors dole out vengeful punishment for missed revenue growth expectations, which is the one sacred goal that must be achieved at all costs. Often, investors will sell on the news without taking a close look into why revenue fell short of expectations.In Pegasystems' case, the company's transition to the subscription-based sales model (which Wall Street has encouraged) has driven its revenue miss. The company's ratio of recurring revenue to perpetual license clocked in at 79/21 for Q3 and stands at 62/38 year to date, well ahead of Pegasystems' original plan of 50/50. This is a positive long-term development, though as noted in the earnings call, each point off from the 50/50 mix costs Pegasystems $3 million in current year revenues.With the subscription transition well underway and a firm footing in an expansionary BPM market, Pegasystems is well poised to succeed in the future. As the company heads into fiscal 2018, the ""whales"" will disappear from Pegasystems' y/y comps, setting up the company for growth. The one-time revenue decline seen in Q3 was largely due to optics, and will most likely never happen again.Stay long on Pegasystems. It's still growing its top line while expanding its margins and growing GAAP profits at 2x year over year - this is a company that has a long rally ahead of it."
4102188,21815,2017-08-28T00:44:27-04:00,"Shares of Pegasystems have pulled away from those of its main competitor in the last 12 months.Most performance metrics struggle to explain this, even if industry experts are raving about its platform.On the other hand, there is no slowdown in growth in Q2, so the little sell-off after the presentation of the figures provides an opportunity if you believe the story.","Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) is an online CRM (customer relationship manager) that must be doing something right because is up against a much bigger and formidable competitor like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), as well as other much bigger companies like SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).It can be instructive to look at the relative performance. First, the stock price development over the last five years suggests Pegasystems is outperforming Salesforce, although all of this happened just in the last twelve months.This is somewhat surprising in the light of the fact that Salesforce has been growing revenues at a substantially higher pace, at least over the past five years:And the following is also surprising (these are GAAP figures):You might not notice in the graph, but gross profit did roughly double at Pegasystems in those five years. (GAAP) margins give a mixed picture, though:So basically, shares of Pegasystems have outperformed those of Salesforce in the last year despite the business not clearly outperforming that of Salesforce, which is itself regarded as a market leader.If Pegasystems has a competitive advantage - and investors seem to think it does, considering its superior stock performance versus that of Salesforce - it's a little odd that revenues at the latter are growing considerably faster.Revenues are actually a fairly complex issue at Pegasystems. Not only are quarterly revenues lumpy due to the occasional big order, there is also a shift from perennial licenses to a SaaS model which, while good long term, cost the company $12 million in the short term ($3 million for every percentage point shift).Which is why investors look at stuff like bookings, backlog and AVS (annual contract value), but even then the picture that emerges is one of solid (15-20%) but not spectacular growth.The ever-thoughtful SA contributor Bert Hochfeld seems to blame this on a lack of marketing effort, despite the company spending 38% of revenues on sales and marketing. But Pegasystems gets totally outspent by Salesforce, which is much bigger and spends even more of its revenue on sales and marketing.Hochfeld expects a pick-up in revenue growth (apart from the distorting effect of a shift to ratables), and he could well have a point, as management argued during the Q2CC that it has gone ""whale hunting"" with several big customers (in excess of $10 million) in the process of signing up.We're not entirely convinced by the argument that the company is still relatively unknown, hence the slower growth compared to Salesforce. Pegasystems is hardly an unknown quantity, and it's been around for decades. It might not be known to the larger public, but industry insiders should be well aware of it.In fact, the company itself touts how well it is recognized. PegaWorld had 4,000 attendees from 49 countries and more than 560 companies, for starters:The company's platform is gathering raving customer reviews and recognition from industry analysts like Forrester, which designated Pegasystems as:Founder and CEO Alan Trefler noted on the call that the company was named:Forrester also gave the company top ranking for DPA (digital process automation) against 12 competitors, and gave its solutions the highest possible scores in 20 out of 30 criteria.Gartner also rated its mobile solutions very highly, and Chartis named Pegasystems':Then, there's further industry accolades from Chartis:All these accolades from industry analysts, and the company is still relatively unknown? We're not entirely convinced by that argument. In fact, management itself seems to be quite happy with the demand for Pegasystems' solutions:CRM involves automating and ""informating"" (making as much relevant info available in real time) sales, service and marketing processes. But today's platforms go further, using machine learning approaches to improve processes, for instance. Here is Pegasystems management describing ""workforce intelligence,"" which:If Pegasystems does have a competitive advantage, here are some of the elements.Needless to say, this is just for illustrative purposes. We don't remotely pretend that we are able to evaluate Pegasystems' solutions with respect to those of the competition.We agree with Hochfeld that the sell-off after the Q2 results presents a bit of an opportunity, as the decline in revenue growth was mostly optical.If the company catches any of these whales it is chasing, things could look quite different in the second half. Still, the shares are not all that cheap, but then again, few are in this market - and certainly few SaaS companies.EPS is expected to rise from $0.97 in 2017 to $1.18 in 2018, a steep multiple over 50 but not unusual for a company like this.The company's increasing cash flow generation has earned it a higher multiple, especially against sales, but that measure has been rising quite a bit.Insofar as the shares in Pegasystems have fallen back on something which can be described as an optical illusion (growth hasn't really slowed down), this offers an opportunity.However, shares are still anything but cheap, and over the last year, the shares have outperformed those of its main competitor by a wide margin, so we wouldn't expect any big immediate payoff.On the other hand, a substantial rise is still in the cards if Pegasystems does manage to land those whales it has been chasing."
4100083,98236,2017-08-18T12:13:01-04:00,"Pega's earnings release last week was viewed by some as somewhat disappointing.The company did niss consensus headline expectations in terms of revenues and earnings although it was able to reduce opex expense ratios.The company reported a seasonally strong quarter for bookings and particularly for backlog. Backlog and ACV rose by far above trend percentages.The company achieved unusually strong cash flow for the period.The company has an outsize pipeline of what it describes as ""whale"" deals teed up to close in the last two quarters of this year and it reported that it had achieved record sales and bookings in July.","Pega reported it Q2 earnings about a week ago. The headlines say that the company missed on both EPS and on revenue. The headlines are OK - they are just measuring the wrong things. Pega, by most objective standards, actually had a decent enough quarter, particularly when considered in the context of rising ratable percentages of revenue and the movement of a particularly large transaction from Q2 to Q1. Pega's backlog and ACV metrics, which most investors find useful in measuring this company, showed what can be best described as outsized gains year over year. Much of the balance of the article will be focused on explaining just that point.Not terribly surprisingly, in the wake of the quarterly earnings announcement, the shares declined by as much as 10% although as I write this, the shares are off about 6% from where they had been. It has been about 8 months since I last wrote about the shares. Back then, the shares had reached $36 and at that price and looking forward, it was relatively easy to write a purchase recommendation.And now, with the shares up 50% year to date and more than 120% over the past year-how easy it to rate the shares a buy? The growth rate has actually accelerated from what it had been and from what had been projected at the start of the year. Operating margins are improving. The company’s competitive positioning has improved. That said, I think it requires a bit more thorough analysis to rate the shares a buy at this point that was the case at the start of the year. Overall, Pega's business is strong and improving and its share price has reflected that. But I believe, as I will try to point out in this article, that the shares are still a buy. And it is relatively straightforward to suggest that investors take a look at this name and take advantage of its recent pullback.I have written about several tech names that have had great runs over the past year. There are many reasons why tech shares have shown substantial appreciation-most of them relates to the fundamental trends and not bubbles. But that is a debate i do not choose to join in this article. There will be some readers who may feel I don't try to sort valuations appropriately. But the fact is that in this slow-growth economy with so many transitions in so many other business sectors, the growth acceleration in the IT space is probably more unique than realized.I have no particular emotional affection for any of the names about which I write. So I am not blinded to the potential that valuation has gotten ahead of itself. Having run a hedge fund and sold research to many large hedge funds, I am as inclined to be as negative as positive. And I do not pretend to know just how high momentum growth shares can reach. Like many investors, I wind up trading my positions from time to time and I have done so with Pega shares. And I have no expectation whatsoever, that Pega shares are going to rise another 120% over the next year. But as I will try to explain in the balance of this article, the company actually has done better in terms of growth and profitability than had been anticipated by most, at least in their published research, and I think that trend is likely to continue over the coming years. That is really the purpose behind writing an article such as this.Pega is not perhaps the most popular of names about which to write on this site and so far as that goes, it has only 5 brokerage analysts who write on the name and report their ratings and projections to First Call. Indeed, it has been more than 2-years since anyone else has chosen to write about the company on this particular site. That is probably a good thing for prospective investors in the sense that there are many potential investors who might like the metrics and the business model of this company, but who are yet to discover the name. Inevitably, part of the reason the shares get relatively little attention is that half of the outstanding shares are still owned by the founder and CEO, Alan Trefler. With Mr. Trefler owning 53% of the shares, and institutions owning another 44% of the shares, retail investors own just 3% of the outstanding stock or about 2 million shares. Even amongst institutions, owning Pega shares was and remains something of a cult.The company, over the years, has done a few things to make its shares more broadly attractive to investors including a split 3 years ago and it does pay a minimal dividend. But no income investor is going to buy Pega shares and the payout, in place apparently so that the shares are eligible to be included in some institutional portfolios, is unlikely to be increased while Mr. Trefler runs the business. After all, his dividend income alone exceeds $8 million annually.Pega’s headline numbers do look like they were disappointing. The headline numbers presented here are all non-GAAP. GAAP comparisons do reflect a material one-time event from the earlier period and are not useful for comparative purposes. Revenue growth for the quarter slowed to 4% and reported revenues declined sequentially. The company’s non-GAAP EPS fell quite sharply in the period on a sequential basis and fell from year earlier levels as well.I think it is also relevant to mention that calculated bookings during the quarter fell from year earlier results which was not terribly surprising given the movement of a large deal from Q2 to Q1 and the robust growth of bookings seen in Q1. Last quarter, total revenue grew by 26%, far above growth guidance, and backlog rose by 45%, one of the larger increases in that metric that Pega has ever reported. Simply put, the company had a spike in perpetual license transactions in Q1 when they increased by 176%, and that spike was more or less reversed in Q2 when perpetual license revenues fell by 42% although some of that was made up by the growth in term licenses revenues which grew by 63% in Q2. In the years since I have covered this company, it has proven to be more or less impossible to forecast the timing of the large deals that substantially impact bookings numbers as well as reported revenues on a quarter to quarter basis.The fact is that bookings for the last 6 months remain well above the level necessary to achieve the current First Call consensus revenue consensus and are at an abnormal level of 49% of the revenues the company has projected for the full year. Further, and of unknown importance at this point, the CFO said during the course of the conference call that Pega had achieved the strongest July and the 2nd strongest 1st month to a quarter in the company’s history. Overall, bookings growth has exceeded 20% on a year-to-date basis, and that is a rate that is more than enough to support upsides to current projections for the next couple of quarters.Pega has a variety of contractual arrangements including cloud, term license and perpetual license that it offers its customers as alternatives to acquire solutions from the company. There is really no way to forecast the mix between the different sources of revenue. For many years now, most analysts and shareholders have been far more interested in bookings and backlog than in reported non-GAAP revenues.Last quarter, as mentioned, term license revenue increased by 63% and total recurring revenue grew by 21%. That was offset by a concomitant fall in perpetual license revenues of 42%. Overall, that lead to the apparently unsatisfactory revenue performance during the quarter. But the fact is that Pega significantly over-attained its primary sales performance metrics. The company saw an increase of 36% in the value of its term license and cloud backlog compared to the year earlier period. The sequential change in backlog was small but still positive, a bit better than normal seasonal trends that have more often than not seen a consumption of backlog in Q2.The company presented a new metric-or an old metric presented in a different way that is perhaps most useful in determining the outlook for future growth and cash flows. Annual Contract Value (ACV) as now presented by Pega is made up of two parts; the term license and cloud contract value divided by committed contract years and the current level of quarterly maintenance revenue multiplied by 4. That metric grew by 15% year on year and it represents a bit more than 50% of this year’s expected revenue.The company constrained expense growth materially in Q2. Overall, GAAP operating expenses rose by 6% year on year and 3% sequentially. Most of the expense growth was in research and development where spend grew 11% year on year but fell marginally on a sequential basis. The company’s margin story remains very much intact.Were Pega’s business attainments less than the company had forecast or analysts had projected? On a headline basis, inevitably that seems to be the case. But considered objectively and holistically, Pega had a relatively strong quarter and given the way management provides guidance, the company is on track to exceed its current level of expectations. The July results were simply lagniappe in terms of short-term attainment.Pega is a small company in a land of giants. Indeed, but for the CEO/founder’s controlling interest in the business, it seems highly likely that the company would have been long since consolidated. It is considered to be a vendor of CRM solutions and to an extent, it competes against the traditional CRM vendors such as Salesforce (CRM) and the CRM solutions sold by Oracle (ORCL) and by SAP (SAP). But it really doesn’t sell standard out of the box CRM solutions - if it did, its days would have surely told by this point.I think in writing an article such as this, which is somewhat constrained in terms of length and reader endurance for my poor sallies at maintaining interest, I don’t provide the best possible explanation for this company’s long-term success. But Pega has always been about building applications that rely on rules based engines. In the real world, the company sells a platform-currently Pega 7-that is mainly used to help to develop applications used by users to automate their sales processes and call centers. I have provided a few links here to both Pega and non-Pega sources that might provide readers with some insight into the technology behind the solutions that Pega sells. I have always been told that Pega has a superior rules-based engine-that goes back a decade or so at this point. And the tellers were individuals who have a significant background in the industry and in particular backgrounds running projects using both Pega and non-Pega software. So, I think it is reasonable to believe, that even after all of this time, Pega’s secret sauce is the combination of their rules based engine and platform as a foundation that has enabled developers to build many other applications in the broadly defined CRM space.It isn’t terribly surprising that Pega has developed some advanced implementations of AI. In some ways, rules-based engines and AI are meant to live with each other. The deep learning that is enabled by AI is one of the elements that can help a user build specific business rules.I think all readers have had their share of frustration in using a call center and in trying to get customer service reps to make decisions. I have occasionally asked CSR’s about their level of empowerment. That is the kind of capability that using Pega can implement for users. I will let Mr. Trefler try to convey the essence of the special sauce in this quote from the company’s latest conference call, “Now having made the right decision, having used AI, what’s really key here is to have end-to-end automation, and this is where we feel we have unique capabilities in CRM because we continue to enhance our platform, our heritage to extend that advantage and to understand, make sure people understand that all Pega applications whether built by us or a client or a partner, obtain the powerful benefits of this market-leading platform.” Excising the part of the quote that is a commercial, that is really the essence of the company’s capability.The company bought a company a year ago called OpenSpan. This company offers a capability that is called robotics although it has nothing to do with clunky machines or R2D2. The kind of robotics that Pega offers is basically the ability to automate business processes and to move data entry into a more digitized vernacular. Again, the use of robotics within an application that has been built on a foundation of AI and a rules engine can dramatically speed up really annoying things with which most readers are familiar such as the time it takes to apply for an insurance policy or setting up an account over the phone. In a way, this is the evolution of Pega’s business process automation capability, updated and relabeled and using current technology. BPM has been a mainstay for Pega and I imagine this (robotics) capability will also be an important business generator.Does Pega have advantages compared to Sales Force? I would be surprised if on some objective scale that Pega was not ahead in terms of technology. Again, back to the CEO commentary, “And so, we were thrilled last month to be recognized by Forrester, one of the two industry analyst firms that are at the top of the heap, there as the top ranked sales automation offering, among 10 vendors evaluated against 35 criteria. We received very high marks from customers that they interviewed…and were recognized for having smart AI (an interesting turn of phrase-sort of like having smart smarts) and analytics.” Does Pega really provide users with a 321% return through building apps using Pega 7? I am inclined to doubt that. Does Pega 7 provide outsize returns to users? I think it must-simply because Pega has to compete against giants on some basis other than price, simply to stay alive.Pega is less than 1/10th the size of CRM. Almost certainly, Pega has to be able to demonstrate some level of technology advantage just to maintain its position in what is a terribly competitive market space. While Einstein is certainly the future for CRM and is already developing traction, Pega, simply because of its rules based engine history, embraced AI a bit earlier and is in a position to attract large users who are prioritizing the use of AI in their IT investing. It is the basic reason why Pega probably is gaining market share in its space and why it is likely to continue to do so in the foreseeable future.I think the obvious question in evaluating this company is why it hasn’t been able to achieve hyper-growth status. The company talks about its aspiration to grow top-line by 15%+ while CRM, for example, is still growing its top line at 20%-25%. The sub-headline metrics probably suggest that this year, at least, Pega is likely to exceed 15% top-line growth. On the other hand, the analyst consensus for revenues as published by First Call is forecasting very modest growth of less than 10% in the September quarter, 13% for this year and 11% for next year.Some of those prudent expectations are a function of the ongoing transition from perpetual to a ratable model of product acquisition. On the call, the company said that each percentage point of a greater ratable mix would reduce revenues by about $12 million/year. So far this year, the ratable mix has run about 54% compared to the company’s initial guidance of 50% and that mix, if it continues, will account for 150 basis points of reduced growth.I think the answer regarding expectations for, and prior performance, that has seen somewhat moderate growth is a bit more complex. Pega spends plenty of money these days on sales and marketing. Last quarter, it spent 38% of revenue on a GAAP basis on sales and marketing expense, and that was down from 39% in the prior year. That is a ratio that ought to be great enough to get the message out. But at this point, it is outspent both absolutely and even relatively by Salesforce.com. Salesforce spent no less than 15X as much on sales and marketing and actually spent 46% of revenues on that expense, both metrics on a GAAP basis. It is hard to be heard if you are living next to one of the greater brass bands of all times.Further, what Pega sells is really a set of business transformation solutions. I think that at this point, the technology involved in providing management with a tool to monitor specific sales activity and to generate reports regarding the impact of sales activity on sales is very well known and is basically somewhat commoditized.Pega’s solutions tend to be more complex and more transformative. As a result, the TCO on a seat basis is higher than just a core CRM solution. And anything that is transformative tends to have far longer sales and implementation cycle. While there are occasions when a Pega solution goes live quickly, most often it can take 12-18 months before a user is reaping returns.Will Pega be able to step up its game and develop a faster cadence of revenue growth? I think the odds are real that it will because the value it supplies users and the multiple ratings regarding that value is a compelling story. There are plenty of business transformation opportunities for this company to sell and the advent of AI and its rather rapid adoption are opening up opportunities for this company. Next year, Pega is supposed to generate revenue of $943 billion and the parts of Salesforce that are direct competitors for Pega solutions have run-rate revenues of more than $5 billion. So, just stealing a point or two of market share from Salesforce and some similar amount from Oracle and from SAP would have a material impact on Pega’s growth. The opportunity is certainly there; I think there is a reasonable, although not a perfect opportunity for this company to achieve growth acceleration.While certainly a case can be made that Pega has a reasonable opportunity to achieve hyper-growth status, I think its valuation is relatively reasonable even if that doesn’t come to pass. As of this writing, and based on the current outstanding share count of 83 million, Pega has a market capitalization of $4.5 billion. The company has a current cash balance of $180 million and that leaves the enterprise value at $4.4 billion. The current consensus revenue forecast for the next 12 months is about $900 million and that yields an EV/S of a bit less than 5X. That is probably reasonably in-line for the current growth level and reflects no revenue growth upside potential.The First Call consensus for EPS shows somewhat more rapid growth as the company has committed to increase operating expenses at a slower cadence than revenues. In that regard, there is certainly substantial runway as GAAP operating expense was almost 65% of revenues last quarter, essentially equivalent to that metric for the prior year. The company’s research and development spending, at 20% of revenue is a relatively high expense ratio for a company of this size.The forecast EPS for the next 12 months comes to $1.10 and that produces a P/E of a bit less than 50X. The after-tax effect of non-GAAP measures is relatively small. Last quarter, after -taxes, non-GAAP earnings exceeded GAAP earning by just $.01. For the last 6 months. GAAP earnings were significantly benefitted by a large, one-time tax benefit. That said, stock based comp is a significant component of reported earnings-probably in-line with the average for It vendors at this point. The company has been profitable on a GAAP basis.The company’s EPS forecast as reported by the consensus has dropped in the last quarter almost entirely as a function of the stronger percentage of ratable revenue which, by itself accounts for more than all of the decrease in estimates. I think that regardless of the decrease, the company's P/E, in the low 50X range is probably typical of many other software vendors with growth rates in the mid-teens percent.The company achieved a very substantial increase in operating cash flow for the quarter that driven by a substantial drop in receivables, that far exceeded the normal seasonality. The company doesn’t forecast operating cash flow. That said, it would be surprising to see that metric dramatically exceed the company’s non-GAAP earnings to any great extent over the course of a full year. I think that CFFO for the full year is most likely to be around $100 million. The company has had no material capex so free cash flow is likely to be at levels comparable to CFFO. The company, based on those estimates, would have a free cash flow yield of around 2.3%. I would expect to see the company’s free cash flow yield increase at a similar cadence to reported non-GAAP revenues.Pega has a reasonable, although not exceptional relative valuation using 15% top line growth coupled with moderate margin expansion as an expectation. I think that the company’s current sales momentum, coupled with the overall strong level of current IT spending, is likely to push revenue growth to well above 15% for this year and into 2018 as well. Management said that the pipeline includes several 8 figure transactions-although the CFO said that the pipeline is more skewed to ratable than perpetual license deals. But it doesn’t take more than one or two of what the comment call whales to drive revenue growth significantly above the current consensus forecast.Pega is a company that is walking in a land mainly populated by giants red of tooth and claw. It has been successful because it has a set of solutions that seemingly produce substantially greater value for users than what I might describe as “plain old “ CRM. While I do not put total stock in surveys developed by 3rd party market research analysts, I have heard from other sources that this company offers solutions that provide superior returns to users. While no one would accuse Pega of running the most visible of marketing efforts, I think the effort ought to be strong enough to produce the kind of growth that will impress investors and analysts. As mentioned, Pega is not likely to appreciate another 120% over the coming months but I think its potential is underrated by its current share price."
4032908,98236,2016-12-27T15:06:23-05:00,"Pega is a mid-sized software vendor that gets little attention despite its record of growth and its ability to compete successfully against many better known competitors.It has compiled a record of proxy booking growth that would be the envy of many better-known and more highly valued competitors and peers.The company, unbeknownst to many investors, has continued to broaden and deepen its competitive moat.While certainly not cheap using traditional valuation metrics, the company is actually outgrowing just about all of the other participants in the CPM/CRM space.The CEO of this company is highly idiosyncratic and that rules out chances for this company to get consolidated or to reach a better level of valuation.","Pega - An Inexpensive LuxuryEvery time I want to write about Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA), I find myself challenged as to how to make an article about what it does interesting to a broad readership. Then, again, maybe it doesn't matter that much if the shares just reprise their record for 2016. In these days of big data and artificial intelligence, what Pega does may seem a bit dated...dowdy to some. But if one looks carefully, Pega is a company that sells users some of the benefits they can realize from big data and AI at a price and in a fashion that is feasible to deploy.Since Pega shares are not well covered, I thought that it might be appropriate for those interested in the name to provide my own perspective on the company's outlook for 2017. The shares have appreciated significantly this year; its principle business metric, derived bookings have escalated faster than the share price. I regard the growth in calculated bookings as the most appropriate metric to consider in evaluating the valuation of this company. On that basis, as will be seen, the shares, despite their over-performance this year, continue to remain quite attractive.The Pega solution set is a cheap luxury compared to some of the more transformational projects that software companies are now selling. Rules-based business process engineering sounds about as exciting to write down as it is in practice. And some of improvements that companies derive from using this software seem just so basic in retrospect - it really is a matter of elementary commonsense. But that is really the reason why this company has managed to remain successful over the course of many years. It offers a way for companies to improve the productivity of their call centers and to enhance the customer experience without turning the internal operations of a business upside down.In some ways, Pega can seem a little quirky to investors. It is still run by and controlled by its founder, Alan Trefler. Mr. Trefler, who celebrated his 60th birthday this year, is an erstwhile chess champion, is an expert in furniture restoration and has a passion for ping pong. He is also determined to keep his company independent and while happy to talk about his business, is hard to pin down when it comes to guidance.As a result, it can frequently happen that Pega has quarters that are above or below analyst expectations - but analyst expectations with regard to quarters are not set with reference to any company-provided metrics. The shares, whatever else might happen to them, are therefore going to be more volatile than might otherwise be the case. Further, while the company does provide investors the tools they need to calculate a bookings proxy, it neither broadcasts those figures nor discusses them specifically during calls. The fact that the calculated bookings proxy for license and cloud revenue doubled last quarter might be considered a relevant statistic; one will search in vain to find it either mentioned in the earnings release or commented about during the conference call. That is why Pega shares, at least to those of us looking at such things, seem so permanently cheap, although I caution readers that it is not feasible to believe that Pega will have another quarter in the near future in which it doubles its derived bookings proxy. (To be fair, the company did speak about two $10 million + transactions that show up in the calculated bookings proxy but one has to dig further to get the context of those kinds of orders.)On the other hand, this company has probably done more to develop certain components of CRM technology than is recognized by investors. It bought Chordiant back in 2010 because it looked to develop a leadership position in business analytics. It has offered AI capabilities through its customer data hub for many years. It really has been able to offer much of the benefits from deep learning to its clients for the past several years. Without over-stressing the point, the company has lots of very specific and functional technology that has been dramatically under-marketed for years. But that is part of Mr. Trefler's quirkiness which cuts both ways for investors.I think it is reasonably fair to suggest that this company would be unlikely to exist in its current form without the leadership of Mr. Trefler. It might have gone out of business, it might have become a far more significant factor in the CRM world and it would almost certainly not still be independent. Given the technology that it has and its ability to keep driving its moat, it is going to be able to continue to outgrow the CRM space indefinitely, in my opinion. And the space in which it competes, called by some as BPM, is very large indeed with TAMs forecast to be between $30 billion and $40 billion.But while Mr. Trefler has kept this company in the forefront of any discussion about the future of BPM, he has clearly led an effort that has under-sold and under-marketed the solution. It is all well and good to complain about competition from ""Frankenstack"" offerings as he did during the last conference call, but the fact is this company still generates less than a billion of revenue despite the attributes of its solution and the size of the available market.I can only wonder just how large Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) might be if it had the set of solutions to sell that this company has been offering. Larger than $10 billion I feel sure. Investing in this company's shares, and I do so, from time to time, can be frustrating because while it has a better mousetrap - and one that evolved logically over the years, it has been unable to consistently produce the kind of financial performance that has attracted investors or that has led to huge valuation metrics. The shares have appreciated 60% over the past five years. The company has grown its revenues by 86% over that period and transitioned significantly to a recurring revenue business model. The company has consistently achieved 15-20% growth in product revenues and it seems likely to continue that record even net of the currency headwind and the business model transition through which it is now passing.Almost all other software vendors have chosen to radically diversify and have done much of that through acquisitions over the years. Pega has done one acquisition of some note, Chordiant, which was something of a competitor at the time. Since then, it has made a few minor acquisitions to enhance its capabilities in mobile and analytics. It paid $46 million to acquire OpenSpan, described as a company providing robotic automation for customer service workers by automating routine desktop tasks. The company had deployed its software to 200,000 desktops at the time it was bought and it is clearly accretive to the suite of Pega offerings.Pega shares have had a substantial run this year and are up by 33%. The shares had a bit of a swoon when Q2 results were reported and the CEO forecast that Brexit would have a substantial impact on business in the EU. It hasn't, other than currency impacts; the company won some deals of note and its key metric, which is software bookings grew substantially in Q3 and eventually helped the shares to reach current levels. That has far outstripped the IGV for the period which is up less than 7%. Since I last wrote about the name at the end of February, the shares have appreciated by 50%. The focus of this article is going to be on the current valuation of the company's shares and its ability to continue to offer solutions that are adequately differentiated in order to maintain 15-20% growth.A few numbers to considerPega is one of very few mature mid-size software vendors still around. There are a few others such as PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC). Most of its peers, in terms of size, are the newer super stars of the software world or have long since been swallowed by larger vendors. So, it is not as easy to find a list of comparables as might seem to be the case. The company is very minimally covered with five analysts posting numbers.Of the five analysts who cover the name, four provide ratings, one of which is a strong buy, one of which is a plain buy and the other two ratings are holds. Not too surprisingly with those ratings, the average price target is $37. The company is forecast to generate a bit more than $780 million of revenues this year with EPS of $.95. The company has a current market capitalization of $2.8 billion. After paying for the acquisition, the company had a cash balance of $130 million, leaving the enterprise value at $2.7 billion. Like all older software vendors, this company is in the midst of a transition to cloud. It offers solutions totally hosted in its cloud and it also offers its solutions on third-party clouds such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), hybrid, and traditional on-premise. Over time, the first three deployment options are going to come to predominate Pega's business; in the meanwhile, it makes some of the reported comparisons look a bit unusual for a company still enjoying significant growth.So far this year, the company has achieved 15% growth as reported with license and cloud growth of 18%. These numbers were impacted by 300 bps by dollar strength through the first nine months; revenue growth will see a further headwind in Q4 and at least through the first part of 2017. In Q3, the company closed two $10 million + deals (it describes them as whales but as the business itself grows, they are more like dolphins).Those deals were subscription-based and four of four large deals in North America, the largest deal in EMEA and the two largest deals in APJ were all subscription-based. It is hard to quantify what the growth rate for this company actually is, given the progression of revenues toward multi-year subscription models. There are going to be puts and takes because while product revenue growth of all flavors is showing accelerating trends, both maintenance and professional services revenues are going to decelerate. The current consensus forecast for reported revenue growth in 2017 is just 12%. They may not turn out to be such a bad forecast given the strong FX headwinds and the deceleration of consulting revenues.But I think that 12% significantly understates the long-term sustainable growth rate for Pega, which should be closer to 20%. And as the company passes through the trough of its revenue transition, operating margins should begin to climb. I think that the company ought to achieve rising margins next year, even absent the one-time benefit of margins from consulting. So, I think EPS growth will likely be more in the 10-15% range compared to the current consensus forecast of 6%. As mentioned earlier, I think that the calculated bookings proxy is by far the most important growth metric one ought to consider in evaluating the operational performance of this company. The bookings proxy grew by just less than 100% last quarter and that is against decent performance in 2015. The real growth of this company compares to other faster growing SaaS names quite favorably when looking at the bookings proxy, which matches results far more accurately than does the exercise of comparing reported revenues.This company calculates a backlog figure that includes both the value of deferred revenues as well as non-balance sheet commitments. That metric, which has typically declined in Q3, showed an increase of 6% sequentially and a bit more than 10% year on year.Pega deals have traditionally driven lots of consulting revenues and there has not been a noticeable deceleration in the growth of those revenues despite the growth of the company's cloud business. That will inevitably happen as time goes on. This year, consulting revenues have risen consistently with the combined product revenues primarily as a result of circumstances surrounding specific revenue recognition mileposts for two very large deals booked in past years.Next year, growth from professional services revenues is forecast to grow far more slowly that the other two revenue streams. On the other hand, because professional services and cloud service revenues are included in the same caption, that metric, now about 32% of total revenues is likely to grow at rates consistent with total corporate revenues. Consulting revenues so far this year have been 26% of revenues; the balance of services revenues relates to users acquiring Pega solutions through the cloud. Maintenance revenue growth this year has been around 9%, again, a consequence of the growth of cloud revenues.The company has shown no real leverage at scale to date and I am not terribly sure when to expect any significant improvements in opex metrics. Last quarter, sales and marketing spend rose 26% year on year, perhaps reflecting the commission expense from the two whale deals that closed but did not greatly contribute to revenue. The other expense categories did not see much greater expense discipline, given that they were favorably impacted by dollar appreciation. Research and development spending rose by 15% year on year and general and administrative expenses, perhaps reflecting the merger of OpenSpan, rose 22%.From time to time over the years, this company has talked about operating leverage. But so far, it really has been mainly talk. It reported non-GAAP margins of 11% back in 2010. It is reporting non-GAAP margins of 13% or so through nine months this year. In a way, the company has both over-spent and under-spent on sales and marketing. It has spent far too much to significantly drive operating margins; on the other hand, it hasn't spent enough to achieve hyper-growth. It is a conundrum faced by all companies with lots of technology trying to optimize the balance between growth and profitability. The result here has been an under-followed and less well-known name.The company has not generated a significant level of CFFO so far in 2016. Presumably, that is a function of the cash costs of its acquisition of OpenSpan. The major drivers in cash flow, net income, depreciation and stock-based compensation were unchanged year over year; the major change in cash flow was related to balance sheet items. Stock-based comp has risen 20% year to date but it is still at reasonably low levels. It was 5.5% of revenues through nine months.That competitive moatThere are observers who believe that CRM has been moving towards commodity status the past several years and at some level that is hard to dispute. Most basic CRM functionality is, what it always has been, a replacement for customized excel spreadsheets. The customization features go quite deep, the user interface has gotten better and report writing and analytics have improved tremendously but the heart of a CRM deployment is automating a basic spread sheet.That has never really been the flavor of CRM that Pega has tried to sell. Pega is all about providing its users with tools that allow them to build their own customer engagement platforms. Yes, it sounds like hype but my friends in the SI world tell me it works. The fact is that call centers need lots of process to have a chance of functioning appropriately for users. And most organizations can readily use an automated sales process that is based on rules.The marketing automation world is very crowded these days and it would be difficult to say that Pega's vision is all that different than that proposed by CRM (the company). The difference is primarily a function of Pega's rules engine, its BPM antecedents and its implementation expertise. From time to time, some of Pega's customers become poster children for the breadth of the company's solutions offerings and its ability to actually get real results at a user. Last quarter, the company called out its success at Rabobank, one of the larger financial institutions in the Netherlands. The solution that was developed is an interesting use of a rules-based engine to provide a decisioning tool that short-cuts lots of administrative procedures. It is not the kind of engagement that the other CRM vendors including Salesforce, IBM (NYSE:IBM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Dynamics would be able to do effectively. It is a solution encompassing AI, deep learning and a very standardized, rules-based procedure.Pega has expanded the scope of its technology in recent years in that it offers users a full suite of CRM tools, some of which are similar to those offered by its more mainstream competitors. There is no getting away from the fact that much of what CRM does for users is, as Mr. Trefler says, ""equivalent to an automated rolodex"". The special sauce that this company has offered is what is layered on top of that automated rolodex in terms of process, rules and analytics. That is the reason the company has survived despite a marketing effort that is invisible to many and despite the fact that its competitors are many times its size with far greater momentum in the market. The fact is that from a standpoint of technology, Pega probably has the most differentiated solution in the business and its level of differentiation has continued to grow. Its recent acquisition of OpenSpan simply serves to emphasize the differentiation it offers customers.ValuationPega shares had a significant rise in November when they appreciated by 18%, significantly besting most enterprise software names. Over the past month, the shares have rested at new levels. As mentioned earlier, this company really doesn't provide much in the way of specific guidance and without specific guidance, analysts do not tend to adjust their estimates significantly during the course of a year. And given the likelihood that most of the large deals the company transacts going forward are likely to be either subscription or cloud, it doesn't make sense for revenue expectations to move up sharply.The company's EV/S valuation is currently just a bit greater than 3X based on consensus expectations for 2017 revenue which seem reasonable to me. The P/E based on consensus expectations are probably lower than what is likely is around 36X. The earnings contribution from stock-based compensation is running at an annual rate of about $.50/share. Non-GAAP margins for this company are about 13% which is up from the prior year because of the increase in stock-based comp. There is a huge runway for the company to grow operating margins and as its transition to a recurring revenue model continues, it seems highly likely that sales and marketing expense, currently at 37% of revenues can see a vast improvement. The company is likely to continue to spend a relatively elevated 21% of its revenues on a GAAP basis on research and development as long as Mr. Trefler continues to run the business.As mentioned above, the CFFO through nine months has been significantly influenced by balance sheet items that are not normally expected to impact that metric over the course of a full year. Excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities which are really not something that can be projected, CFFO is going to be about $60 million above GAAP net income. This year, GAAP net income is likely to be about $35-40 million which would produce CFFO of about $100 million and free cash flow in the range of $80-85 million although I imagine the amount actually reported will be less. But in any event, no one ought to be buying these shares based either on the company's P/E ratio or its free cash flow yield.I believe that Pega share valuation will basically correlate with a bookings proxy that while not reported by the company, can be readily calculated by looking at the change in backlog and adding it to reported cloud and license revenues. The bookings proxy came to $144 million in Q4 last year which was up from $111 million the prior year (2014). The bookings proxy in Q3 this year was $108 million compared to $55 million in 2015. I do not believe that it is feasible to forecast a bookings proxy number as I have commented in another article relating to another company recently. Nor do I think it terribly likely that the company is going to be able to double product bookings in Q4; the comparison is just too strong for that to be feasible.I think, however, that if calculated bookings can grow at a 25% rate, approximately comparable to the rate Salesforce is growing its calculated bookings number, Pega shares can continue to outperform both indexes and peer companies in the software space and will continue to produce positive alpha. And that is my best guess as to what is most likely to happen when the company reports its results sometime in February."

Major tailwinds that will benefit the company's operating results include double-digit growth outlooks for the enterprise CRM and BPM markets. Due to the company's highly scalable and capital-light business model, further margin expansion is possible. Pega's large and diverse customer base dampens the company's exposure to any one industry, sector or country. Its global presence means that FX headwinds will persist going forward.Major tailwinds within enterprise CRM and BPM marketsAccording to research, the global CRM market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15.5% over the 2013-2018 period. This growth is driven by the trend of businesses looking to collect, analyze and gain actionable insights regarding its customers from the data they collect, allowing them to make better financial and business decisions. The global BPM market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.9% over the 2014-2019 period. This growth is driven by corporations looking to manage their business processes better in order to lower costs and increase overall efficiency.Pegasystems addresses the needs of these markets through its Pega 7 platform. The company differentiates itself from large competitors such as IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) by unifying the entirety of its offerings on a single platform, whereas the aforementioned competitors have kept the majority of its product line (mostly from bolt-on acquisitions) separate. In other words, customers can access the company's CRM, BPM and other related software conveniently on one unified platform without any compatibility issues, which tend to arise when one uses software made by different vendors. Without a doubt, this presents an enticing value proposition to the company's existing and prospective clients. Hence, I am of the belief that the company would surely be a major beneficiary of the growth within the enterprise CRM and BPM markets going forward.Further margin expansion possible thanks to a highly scalable and capital-light business modelAs mentioned earlier, Pegasystems offers its suite of products through its Pega platform. Being a company that offers primarily software-based products, Pega's business model is highly scalable and capital-light, evident from its minimal capital expenditures and investment in working capital, as a percentage of sales, throughout most of its operating history. In addition, the company incurs incrementally lower cost when adding additional customers to its platform. For the reasons above, I believe that further margin expansion is a very likely possibility in the near term.Large and diverse customer base dampens the company's exposure to any one sector, industry, or countryThe company offers its products and services to a myriad of sectors, including the financial services, healthcare, insurance, communications, media, life sciences, manufacturing and the public sector. Therefore, this dampens the adverse impact on the company when any one sector experiences a downturn.Furthermore, the company sells to a growing client base that includes companies listed on the Global 2000. As a result, the company is not dependent on any one customer for a significant portion of its revenue, thereby lowering the potential adverse impacts to operating results stemming from customer desertion.In a geographical context, Pegasystems markets its products and services globally, where it derives only 55% of its revenue from the U.S., 6% from other Americas, 16% from the UK, 15% from other EMEA countries, and 8% from APAC (per fiscal 2014 data). Hence, any recession experienced by one region will have a relatively small impact on the company's overall operating results. As a result, expect the company's revenues, profits and cash flows to be stable going forward.Global presence means FX headwinds will persist going forwardDespite the merits of a global presence, it is not entirely a boon given that having operations worldwide exposes the company to foreign currency risk stemming from fluctuations within the FX market. The major recent development within said market is of course the strengthening of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis other major currencies. This recent price appreciation can be attributed to the diverging monetary policy stance adopted by the Fed compared to its central banking peers. Although recent FOMC meetings have stemmed the strengthening of the greenback somewhat, the fact remains that the dollar is still trading at elevated levels relative to the same period a year ago, according to CNBC data. Given that the Fed has not entirely ruled out a late-2015 rate hike, expect further appreciation to occur as capital continues to flow into the U.S. in anticipation of rising yields. Considering its significant international operations, expect Pegasystems to continue experiencing FX headwinds going forward.ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, company revenues are expected to grow at growth rates of 13% to 7% throughout the five-year projection period. This growth is supported by major tailwinds such as the double-digit growth outlooks for the CRM and BPM markets, which Pegasystems serves. Relative to historical rates, these projections are a tad low as they incorporate the adverse impact of FX headwinds. EBITDA margins are expected to gradually expand to 17% by the end of the projection period, supported by the highly scalable and capital-light business model that the company employs. The company currently trades at 19.3x LTM EBITDA. Using this figure, along with a 12% discount rate (due to the company size, offset slightly by the large and diverse customer base lending to stable and recurring cash flows), the model produces a fair value of $31 for Pegasystems, indicating that the company is trading at approximately a 40% discount to fair value as implied by the DCF model. My outlook on the company is hence bullish - investors are advised to initiate a long position at current levels."

1859901,41741,2013-11-24T16:55:44-05:00,,"Shares of Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) have been on a steady path higher over the past year. So far this year, shares are up an impressive 116%, and are set to continue their run higher as the company continues to make a name for itself in automating business processes for corporations. In this particular niche, Pegasystems is number two in the market, behind only IBM (NYSE:IBM). In the past eight years, the company has grown revenues 24% annually. Over the next five years, the company is forecast to grow earnings at a 25% annual clip.PegaRULES!The company's PegaRULES Process Commander (PRPC) software provides a unified platform that enables customers to build enterprise applications in a fraction of the time it would take using the disjointed architectures offered by other software providers. This allows organizations to build, deploy, and change enterprise applications easily and quickly. It also eliminates the time and expense required to create lengthy policy manuals and system specifications by unifying business rules with business processes. The software delivers multi-channel, cross silo capabilities that bridge front and back-office, and is often used to rejuvenate legacy technology.The PRPC applications are able to be deployed via the Pega Cloud or on premise. The company then utilizes frameworks that allow customers to customize their software to fit their unique needs. The integration of the PRPC and frameworks allows Pegasystems to target Business Process Management (BPM), Customer Relationship Market (CRM), Dynamic Case Management (DCM), and Decision Management software markets.Another quarter, another big beatPegasystems crushed expectations in 3Q with a $0.16 beat on EPS. Revenues came in $5.47 million higher than expectations. Overall, revenues grew 22% Y/Y. This was driven by a 56.8% jump in licensing revenue. Pegasystems has beaten estimates in each of the last four quarters by a wide margin.So far this year, the company has delivered operating cash flow of $83.4 million. This is 187% higher than last year. Overall, net income for the first nine months of 2013 was $22.5 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the first nine months of 2012.The other notable move last quarter was Pegasystems' acquisition of Antenna Software in October. This puts Pegasystems in the fast-growing mobility market. In order for Pegasystems to compete, its applications must be prepared for multiple mobile platforms and more than 250 different screen sizes. The goal for any company is to deliver business software to any channel and with the Antenna acquisition, Pegasystems is one step closer to that goal. According to the company, a few key benefits to this acquisition include:Product innovation and partnerships drive market share gainsEven with the stock on a tear of late, there could still be further room to the upside. This comes as the company just released Pega 7. This is the latest major version upgrade of the company's unified model-driven platform. This new version should greatly improve ease-of-use for its customers as well as increase market share.And thanks to this product innovation and superior products, Pegasystems has managed to partner with every major global system integrator and IT consulting firm. These strategic partnerships help boost sales and allow Pegasystems to be a core product offering. Its major partners include Accenture, Capgemini, Cognizant Technology, Infosys Technologies, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Wipro. These industry leading partners, such as the management consulting leader, Accenture, and top accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, have given Pegasystems a new level of clout and ""street cred"" when it comes to growing its market share.These market share gains were evident at the first Pega Developer Conference that was held last month in Hyderabad, India. This conference was oversold with over 1,700 attendees from 52 organizations to learn about Pega 7 software. On the company's earnings call, CEO Alan Trefler highlighted two responses heard at the event (emphasis ours).Broadening its horizons increases its addressable marketPegasystems has thrust itself into the heart of a $30 billion market opportunity. Pega 7 and its solution frameworks allow the combination of Business Process Management, case management and various vertical application segments. Pegasystems is one of the few companies offer a combined solution and company's IT departments are realizing that they need to adapt to this changing market. According to CEO Alan Trefler:Thanks to this new combined solutions offering, Pegasystems is able to service many different industries. The company is seeing strong customer demand in:Overall, across all segments, the combination of business process automation, cross-channel customer experience, dynamic case management and verticals solutions really helps organizations improve agility and responsiveness. This is the core of what Pegasystems' software can accomplish.Competition remains the greatest threatThe threat to Pegasystems' business is competition. The company competes with IBM, Oracle, SAP, Tibco Software, EMC, OpenText, Salesforce, Microsoft and many other software vendors in one way or another. Some of those are very large and resource-heavy (in terms of cash and ability to borrow) companies. In any case, CEO Alan Trefler summed up why he sees his company as more innovative than the larger competitors.Further debunking the worry of competitive pressures is Gartner's latest Magic Quadrant for the CRM Customer Engagement Center. In this Magic Quadrant, Pegasysems is behind only salesforce.com when it comes to the completeness of vision. Pegasystems is only one of three companies that's considered a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant. Pegasystems also outranks Oracle on both ability to execute and completeness of vision.Gartner goes on to say that ""in the CRM space overall, Pegasystems has the best ability to model and predict a customer's behavior, create a workflow to support that customer, and to then associate the best action to execute with (and for) the customer."" To help counter the competitive pressures, Pegasystems has invested a combined $197.2 million in R&D over the past three years. The company has a 740 employees working on R&D efforts.The valuation is very appealing, suggesting 50% upsideIn looking at shares of Pegasystems, we see several things we like. License backlog continues to grow. It has grown from $226 million last year to $268 million as of the end of September. The company's cash balance has grown at an even faster rate. In the past year, total cash has increased 69% to $188 million. Total cash per share is now $4.97. Pegasystems has no debt.In looking at earnings, shares trades at 32x next year's earnings. With the company continuing to beat estimates, and the potential for the company to beat next year's EPS, we think its forward P/E is actually lower.Next year, the consensus is for EPS to come in at $1.50. We think this is low and forecast EPS to come in at $1.60 based on the company's strengths discussed above and its pattern of beating estimates. EPS of $1.60 puts its forward multiple at 30x. This is very reasonable considering the growth potential ahead for the company.On the other hand, EPS could come in even higher with margin improvement. Current gross margin is 69% and operating margin is 12%. There is definite room for margin expansion heading into next year. In the base case, if we assume that next year's (2014) EPS comes in at $1.60, and we get no multiple expansion (45x current p/e), that's still nearly 50% upside to $70.Prime beneficiary of the Affordable Care ActWe see Pegasystems as a key component to solving the issues related to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. We all know that a main issue with the program has been the website and getting insured persons signed up. Pegasystems has successfully allowed Fallon Community Health Plan to implement and meet the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. According to the company (emphasis ours):Susan Taylor, Pegasystems' VP further added:As more health plans become aware of Pegasystems' solutions for implementation of the Affordable Care Act, we see Pegasystems signing up more health plans and growing its top- and bottom-lines. More health plan signups would cause us to raise our EPS estimate of $1.60 next year and provide further upside for shares.Bottom linePegasystems is an undiscovered gem in the software space. Even though it has a market cap of $1.8 billion, there are only 4 analysts covering the stock. We think the lack of coverage keeps many institutions out of the stock. They simply are not aware of the company and its potential. Even we were surprised that there have only even been 2 articles on Seeking Alpha about Pegasystems.Part of the explanation could be that 54% of the company is held by insiders. Average daily volume is only about 100k. The largest shareholder is Founder and CEO Alan Trefler. His 19.8 million share stake makes him a near billionaire. Most notable is that he is not on an automatic sell program and is holding onto his stake. Another billionaire that is invested in the company is Ken Fisher. His firm, Fisher Asset Management, has a 2% stake.Overall, it's tough to argue with the results Pegasystems has posted and with a strong balance sheet and plenty of tailwinds ahead, we see shares continuing their up and to the right trajectory.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

508251,23407,2012-04-18T17:29:24-04:00,,"Across enterprises, IT executives are being asked to shift from building static user friendly databases with reporting to dynamic problem solving for C-level practices. The change isn't subtle or easily addressed given legacy information silos were often deployed without a focus on integration.Those haphazardly deployed databases, and their linear nature, are creating disruptive changes in how IT departments approach spending - particularly as those departments increasingly report to CFOs. Going forward, forcing C-level practices into pre-defined databases just won't meet the needs of companies increasingly interested in flexible and creative practice management. As a result, the process is increasingly merging - if not reluctantly - with practiceThis disruption is creating a lot of opportunity for software companies, such as Pegasystems (PEGA), which competes with Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) in process management and Salesforce (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT) and SAP (SAP) in customer relationship management.Shifting IT trends are creating opportunities to win and expand accounts.Pegasystem's model is built on winning business by offering case by case solutions and expanding those relationships over time. With more companies focused on unifying process with practice, the company is competing for more deals and inking more licenses than at any point in its history.Those opportunities cut across business intelligence, automation, performance and decision making - specific areas expected to enjoy double digit spending growth this year. Case oriented solutions, which provide a gateway to larger, more lucrative relationships, are also in vogue.Typically, Pegasystems customers have centered around financial services, healthcare and insurance companies, which have critical process environments. Call center conversations need to be managed and optimized, transactions need to be accurate and timely and rate quotes need to happen more quickly and easily. And, all of it needs to feed into better decisions and strategic planning.Process and practice sales are increasingly global, supporting maintenance and service revenue.These needs aren't limited by geography either, which has meant international demand for Pegasystem's software has grown. Overseas sales have climbed to 48% of overall revenue, up from 34% in 2009, thanks to both changing needs and a larger sales force.Those license agreements are increasingly term contracts, which offer revenue clarity by smoothing quarterly fluctuations. Exiting last quarter, Pegasystem's term license payments due jumped to $161.4 million from $90.9 million. And the company will recognize $37.7 million of such contracts in 2012.Of course, as more licenses are sold, maintenance and services revenue increases. In 2011, revenue from those two segments increased 40% and 21%, respectively.Typical of its competitors, Pegasystems enjoys strong margins too. Higher sales and 60% margins have the street expecting a 34% jump in EPS to $1.19 in 2012. For comparison, the company earned $0.57 in 2010. The higher cash flow has helped keep the company debt free and allowed it to amass nearly $3 per share in cash and equivalents.Given the ongoing trend for integrated - dare I say hybrid - process and practice solutions, the company is likely to outpace street estimates. If it does, sellers sitting on seven days worth of average volume short will be forced to cover, sending shares higher.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in PEGA over the next 72 hours."
3938706,98236,2016-02-28T22:31:02-05:00,"Pegasystems reported another conspicuous upsides when it released Q4 results Thursday evening.The company increased revenue and EPS guidance compared to consensus levels for 2016 as well.In addition to decent headline results, the growth in bookings and backlog was quite significant as well.The company is making a strong foray into the CRM space that has a significant potential upside.As a result of better financial performance and guidance and a significant share price pull back, valuations have significantly compressed over the last couple of months.","IntroductionSome weeks ago, I wrote an article for Seeking Alpha regarding the opportunities and the outlook for Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA). Last week, the company reported the results for its fiscal Q4 and for the year that ended 12/31/15. I might comment that the company could stand to use a little of its Pega Express methodology to deal with year-end reporting. That said, the report was another beat and the guidance was a decided raise. At this writing, the market is rewarding the shares modestly. The shares were up about 7% in today's trading. Pega is one of the more overlooked names in the enterprise IT space. There are probably many reasons for the company being relegated to a dusty corner including, perhaps, the control ownership by the company's founder, Alan Trefler and its small absolute size compared to some of the competitors in the space such as Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) as well as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) As I commented in my earlier report, there is no reason to believe that the CEO will not stick around for the foreseeable future. Whenever he does choose to go, I feel reasonably certain that the company will not be independent for more than 2 years. But despite that caveat, Pega shares have sold for much higher valuations in earlier times even with Mr. Trefler's control position. They still can, I believe.The Results and the GuidanceObviously readers can look up the results Pega released on Thursday evening, but it might be more convenient to read them in the context of a commentary on the quarter. Pega revenues grew by 21% in the quarter and 15% for the year. The results for the quarter exceeded expectations (Pega does not and never has supplied quarterly guidance) by more than $12 million, and for the year, the results were more than $30 million above initial guidance. The company also exceeded EPS expectations generating $.37 compared to an expectation of $.35. The company's cloud revenue increased by almost 80% for the year, although at $30 million for 2015, cloud revenues are still less than 10% of total product revenues. Because of a very large perpetual license transaction that was recognized in Q4, the cloud proportion of total product revenues in the quarter changed little compared to the year-earlier period despite actual cloud revenues doubling from Q4-2014.Pega's stock-based comp increased significantly last year and the increase added about $.14 to the non-GAAP earnings total. Overall, stock-based comp at $30 million for the year was 38% of reported non-GAAP EPS and a bit less than 50% of the $62.5 million of cash flow. Pega's cash flow in 2015 is less as a proportion of non-GAAP profits than results for some other ""pure"" cloud enterprise software companies. This primarily reflects its historical base of on-premise license revenue which is billed when it is installed. In general, the cloud companies are able to achieve a greater relationship of cash flow to earnings because they have converted most of their users to annual billings and they have gotten some of their customers to accept billing one year in advance. As cloud revenues eventually increase for Pega as a proportion of the total, I would expect cash flow to achieve a comparable relationship to non-GAAP earnings as is normal for similarly situated companies.Pega also has a policy of paying commissions upfront before any revenues have been collected, which is unusual in the world of many subscription revenue software companies. In a year in which backlog grew by more than $55 million and almost all of that growth came from off-balance sheet bookings, the impact on cash flow and reported earnings was not insubstantial. I would be surprised if the EPS impact for 2015 was not in the range of $.10, but the company doesn't disclose the number specifically, so it is impossible to be more specific than that. In the prior year, where the backlog grew just $17 million, the earnings hit would have been much less substantial.Like other companies that offer subscription and cloud revenue arrangements, backlog is an important metric and perhaps more so than the headline numbers. At the end of the year, license and cloud revenue backlog was up 15% to $420 million with a bit less than half of that scheduled to roll into revenue in 2016. Like many companies in this space, most of the increase in backlog came from off balance sheet commitments which make up 85% of the total backlog. Pega has been reporting this way for many years since it has always offered a subscription alternative to its users. Large, multi-year deals have become the norm rather than the exception in the software industry. There are some readers who feel that off balance sheet deferred revenue can be contrived. In Pega's case, both its 10-Ks and Qs have reported the data regarding off balance sheet deferred revenues for years and those results and data have obviously been audited.The results of the quarter were bolstered by a significant perpetual license deal of the kind that the company describes as a ""whale."" Management suggested that the ""whale"" transaction may have been with Scotiabank (NYSE:BNS) and said that it was one of three that had taken place during the course of 2015.Although Pega does supply some guidance, that guidance lacks more than a little something in granularity. The company is forecasting that revenues will rise by 15% to $780 million in 2016. It is forecasting non-GAAP EPS for the period of $.95. And it is forecasting that revenues will be back-end loaded with 1st half revenues of $360 million. That is normal seasonality for this company. The company has forecast that stock-based comp will increase another 16% next year to about $35 million.Some Commentary on the CommentaryPega printed a nice quarter in the midst of a sea of uncertainty with reasonable performance in all of its geos. Overall, it seems apparent that the market for enterprise IT sales was mixed. There were companies such as CRM, Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and SAP for whom Q4 was their absolute best ever. There were companies that had good quarters, but not quite records and others such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Tableau (NYSE:DATA) and Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK) which saw very weak results. One question that readers might have is why Pega is being successful when so many other enterprise IT vendors are having a hard time.One factor I believe is simply momentum. I believe that momentum plays a significant role in selling IT products and services. Success breeds success as the saying goes. Those companies with reasonable sales momentum seemed to do well in the quarter. Pega had decent sales momentum coming into the quarter and that carried through during the period. I think that Pega has been building momentum for the past couple of years after having what might be described as a mid-life crisis in the period before that.I also think it is much easier to sell customer relationship management and associated analytics to companies these days than many other types of solutions. Self-evidently, the reason for that is that users believe that improving customer experiences and being able to expand cross-sells and being able to analyze the behavior of their customers visiting the web or automated call centers generate revenues to pay back the cost of the software and services that they are buying. One might say that some of Pega's core technology has always been used by its customers to improve customer relationships, That being said, however, most CIOs would not have thought of the company as a potential vendor offering competitive CRM solutions. I think one factor in the company's 2015 success that certainly carried into Q4 was Pega's renewed and focused attention to the CRM space.A little more than 5 years ago, Pega acquired a ""pure"" CRM company with embedded analytics called Chordiant. Chordiant was a systemically dysfunctional company when it was bought by Pega; it was being run on an ad hoc basis by its CFO, and as the saying goes, it had missed its numbers for as many quarters as I have had hot dinners. Well not exactly - but that is because I've had loads of hot dinners. In any event, it apparently took Pega until last year, when it released Pega 7, before it totally integrated CRM capabilities into its stack. Pega has been known as having BPM solutions. Now it is finally becoming known as a CRM vendor as well. According to the CEO, the result has been very strong - but then again this is a CEO who might be selling Pega capabilities on his deathbed. But the numbers would suggest that there has been a significant acceleration in Pega's growth and it is probably a function of being able to sell something other than a rules-based BPM engine. I am not in a position to evaluate Pega CRM feature/function against the other players in the space. It has usually been the case that Pega has enjoyed great technology and a much less great sales execution capability.I doubt that CRM or Oracle or SAP have anything to worry about from Pega in the near future - although Pega has actually published a whitepaper comparing its CRM capabilities to those of Salesforce. No prizes for guessing who came out on top in that evaluation. Pega's revenues could double and it would still be not much more than a pimple on the behind of the entire space. But I do think Mr. Trefler's commentary and emphasis is pregnant. One thing I can say without too much fear of contradiction is that Chordiant had perhaps the best analytics for CRM in the market when it was acquired. It had bought one of the pioneers in that space and it soon turned out that the company could sell analytics more easily than it could sell its core product. Nowadays, users are as much interested in the analytics that they can get with CRM as the CRM solution itself, and if that is the case, I expect that Pega will be able to sell its CRM solutions more readily than might be imagined within what is notionally a very crowded market space.As should be evident at this point, particularly in the wake of Salesforce announcing that it had won two 9 figure transactions just in its last quarter, there are some awfully large CRM opportunities both in the US and internationally. I don't suggest that there is any real chance of Pega snagging anything like a 9 figure deal next year or anytime in the foreseeable future. Its product footprint is still far too small for that to be a possibility. But I do believe that it isn't unreasonable to forecast that with a viable CRM product deeply embedded within Pega 7, and with a market that is in love with analytics, this company has a reasonable chance to exceed its targets this year.Another item that is worth commenting about, I believe is the lack of operating leverage at Pega over the most recent past. Sales & marketing expense grew by more by 29% last quarter and by more than 17% for the year as a whole. S&M spend rose to 35.5% of revenues in 2015 from 34.9% in 2014. That was made up for by the decline in G&A spending which contracted by 2% for the year in absolute dollars and is now 5.2% of revenues compared to 6.3% of revenues in 2014.As I commented upon earlier, some of the noticeably higher S&M in Q4 is a function of paying sales commissions on bookings rather than ratably, as revenues are recognized. Mr. Trefler suggested that this was the case and it should be noted that almost inevitably, the kind of deals that made it into Pega's unbooked backlog bucket would almost certainly have thrust the particular salesmen and perhaps the district and the regional managers and their staffs into the territory of commission accelerators. In addition, Mr. Trefler commented that the company had done lots of hiring in the S&M category in 2015 and that he expected to continue that course in 2016. He talked about hiring more than 60 direct sales heads last year. At a run rate, these days 60 sales heads is going to increase S&M spend by something above $10 million and to a greater or lesser extent, that expense kicks in at least 6 months before new sales hires become productive. In addition to those direct costs, hiring that many sales people is going to necessitate hiring indirect sales and marketing support staff as well. With those kinds of expenses, there is no way that a 15% revenue increase can possibly lead to improved operating profit margins. But there will be leverage, I believe, just now where it can be readily perceived by investors. The leverage, of course, will come from the unbilled backlog where the commission costs have already been expensed but the revenues are yet to come. So long as unbilled backlog grows rapidly, it is going to be difficult for investors to see the potential earnings leverage for this company's income statement because the reported revenue growth is trailing the level of product bookings growth.In addition, Mr. Trefler spoke about increasing marketing and embarking on Pega's first ever media campaign. Mr. Trefler didn't disclose any specific figure for those expense categories for 2016 other than to imply that the figures would be noticeable. It is hard, very often, to see any kind of one-for-one correlation between investing in advertising for solution sets similar to those that Pega sells and an acceleration in product revenue growth rates. There may be a correlation, but it probably is something that happens over years. In any event, it is relatively plain to see that as the company transitions to a higher proportion of cloud revenues which have lower gross margins than software license revenues and as the company tries to up its profile amongst the broad CIO community, there is not going to be much leverage in reported earnings for at least the next couple of years, in my opinion. While many readers are often dubious when companies, especially growth companies, maintain high expense growth, I think that concern would be overdone in this case. Pega sees that it has a significant business opportunity and it will never be able to capitalize on that opportunity without more sales staff and a higher profile.I would make one final point. Like some other software vendors, Pega is deliberately reducing the amount of internal consulting assignments that it handles in an effort to develop a larger eco-system that feeds it more sales leads. This is pretty much SOP amongst many fast growing software vendors. The issues are multiple but they include the inability to hire and manage consulting additions at a rate fast enough to ensure that users go live within agreed time spans. In addition, Pega needs the recommendation of third party consultants who have experience with the company's solution set and can provide the best testimonials as to the benefits of an installation. So, for another two or three years, the company's revenue growth will seem significantly less than is really the case as license deals migrate to the cloud and as the company deemphasizes its consulting practice.Valuation and Investment ThesisWhile Pega shares are not quite cheap, I do think they qualify for status in terms of growth at a reasonable price. EV/S based on 2016 guidance is just below 2X and the P/E on the company's forward earnings projection is 26X. I do believe that it is important to note again, that earnings are dampened in comparison to most other vendors by the practice of paying commissions before revenue has been recognized. Cash flow for this company is roughly equivalent to non-GAAP EPS. Pega still gets most of its product revenues from license, so the opportunity to increase cash flow through annual billings that many cloud vendors have is not a factor for this company. The company pays a dividend and it would not be implausible to see the dividend increased. That being said, however, this is not and is unlikely to be a company that has a significant yield. At the moment, based on the current dividend, the yield is a paltry 0.5%.Pega remains very underfollowed which is not surprising given its insider ownership and its relatively small size. Of the 5 followers, the average rating is a relatively average 2.0 although most of the data from Thomson/First Call is old. The latest recommendation was an initiation by JMP last September with a Market Outperform rating.The company's shares have seen performance that is more or less in line with many other software names in recent months. After reaching an all-time high of close to $30/share in the wake of reporting Q3 earnings, the shares declined by about 1/3rd over the following 2 months until February 9th. Since that time, the shares have rallied about 20% including today's price action but remain 25% below the level they achieved in November. Obviously, valuation compression has been significant given that both results and guidance are higher than they were 3 months ago and the shares are down 25%.I believe that Pega is as well positioned as it has ever been both on an absolute basis and relative to its numerous competitors. It would not surprise me if the company were able to close a few ""whale"" type CRM deals given both the product set it offers and the significantly expanded sales footprint. It would be impossible to even think of forecasting whether some of the potential large CRM deals that are likely in the company's working set turn out to be cloud or perpetual or subscription. Needless to say that while multi-year deals are ultimately more profitable for this company, they do little to add to reported results in the year in which they are signed and because of Pega's peculiar accounting treatment for commissions, those deals might even be a drag on reported earnings in their first year. But that being said, I think that if product bookings growth significantly accelerates from the 20% range and stays that way for a couple of quarters, there is significant upside in these shares and I would think that it is a reasonable bet, all other things being equal, to speculate that bookings growth will accelerate during the course of 2016 above currently expected levels.Many investors seem to be looking for a smaller cap growth story in the IT space that is profitable, generates cash, and is not absurdly valued, with an under-appreciated upside. I think that Pega fulfills that set of specifications quite nicely. And of course there is the continued lottery on Mr. Trefler's desire to continue to run Pega, his personal creation, on a day to day basis after more than 30 years at the helm.Companies such as Pega do not exist in a vacuum unconnected to the rest of the market. If the market manages to de-couple from the price of oil, if it manages to climb a wall of worry and if some appetite returns for risk, Pega shares are going to be excellent performers, in my opinion. But if the market returns to the rout seen earlier this year, this company whose shares have a beta of 1.43X, are not going up.And so far as that goes, Pega's financial results do not exist in a vacuum either. The company has a customer concentration in what many believe to be a troubled financial services sector although management has said that they have seen no evidence of any constrained buying decisions on the part of those customers. The company has been making a push into manufacturing which obviously is cyclical. If our economy enters a recession, it stands to reason that this company will be unable to sustain growth. Its results during the Great Recession were exemplary, to be sure, but this is a significantly larger company now than was the case back in 2007-9 and I wouldn't expect it has the ability to walk between the raindrops of a deluge.Conclusion/SummaryPega systems reported another upside quarter Thursday evening and the shares have responded by a 7% rally in trading on Friday. That being said, the shares are still 25% below their peak in November and with the enhanced performance and the increased forecast, the valuation compression has been significant. The company seems finally poised to exploit the CRM and analytics technology it acquired when it bought Cordiant more than 5 years ago. I believe that in a steady-state environment, with the renewed focus on CRM, the company has the ability to close some ""whale"" sized deals and to exceed its forecast, although the evidence may be more in bookings than in reported headline numbers. With an EV/S below 2X and with significant cash generation as well, the shares are far less expensive than some of the other names in the space, although obviously, given the transition to cloud, headline numbers can never show the growth of some of the other companies about which I have written. I thought that the shares were reasonably valued when I published my initial article on this name back in January. It is obviously a better value now than it was then. I think it deserves a look from investors looking for neglected and undervalued names with some potential catalysts."
3794826,98236,2016-01-06T23:10:37-05:00,"Pega has achieved more than 20% compounded growth over a 10-year span.In the last several years, operating margins have started to expand significantly.Pega's operating margins still indicate significant potential operating leverage.The company has been able to build a balance of $380 million of deferred and unbilled product revenues that will enter the revenue and earnings stream.","I recently wrote an article about the largest specialist CRM vendor in the world, Salesforce.com. (NYSE:CRM). It proved to be more than a bit controversial. Momentum growth is, no doubt, a controversial thesis to espouse. There are many different styles of investing including growth at a reasonable price (GARP), deep value and contrarian. All of them have their day and none of them are likely to work all of the time. I make no secret that I like lots of momentum growth stories and that I think the economics of the cloud remain terribly underappreciated - but that is for a different discussion. Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA), the subject of this article, is one of those companies that has some characteristics of both momentum growth and of GARP.Pegasystems is one of the smaller of the smaller independent CRM vendors around these days and because the founder owns more than 52% of the shares, trading volume is quite constrained (average daily volume =173k shares). Although Pega is a CRM company, its solutions are nothing like those of Salesforce. It actually does focus on the customer relationship and its value proposition is predicated on improving the customer experience in order to drive greater revenues. While I am normally dubious about the quantification of user benefits from software solutions, the fact is that over the years, Pega's technology has been deployed in countless use cases that have lead to wide acceptance and continuing expansion of the footprint it has installed in its top customers. The fact is that it is installed at many of the large enterprises in its target industries and that is mainly a result of multiple reference sales.Pega's technology is based on the combination of a rules-based engine and business process reengineering. It is a powerful and elegant technology which has yet to be replicated by its competitors which has given the company a more defensible franchise than might be readily apparent. Although what it sells is self-evidently a niche, it is an important niche whose acceptance had broadened over the years and seems likely to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.Pega has been around for a long time as software companies go - it was founded in Cambridge MA. in 1983 by Alan Trefler who has remained its Chairman and CEO for the last 33 years. It seems likely to this writer that the only reason that Pega has continued to remain an independent vendor all of these years is Mr. Trefler's day-to-day involvement with the business. Simply put, the man eats, drinks and breathes Pega, and he still owns 52% of the shares. Mr. Trefler is 59 and appears to be in robust health - in recent years, he has taken up ping-pong as a competitive sport and is apparently recognized as a leading player in the greater Boston area. It would be hard to imagine that this company will not be pursued by numerous competitors and private equity firms as soon as Mr. Trefler decides to step down. Mr. Trefler has made it very plain on numerous occasions that he simply isn't interested in selling the company, and I think there is no reason to imagine that he is about to change his mind while he is fully engaged as CEO.I think it is fair to state that Mr. Trefler is the heart and soul of this company and that because of his background he makes most of the serious decisions regarding the company's future. About a decade ago, Mr. Trefler wrote a book called ""Build to Change."" I am hardly going to recommend the book as light reading. If you read it at bedtime, it will surely insure a lengthy sleep unless you enjoy learning about industry trends in a semi-technical fashion. But the fact is that the products the company sells, the distribution strategy the company employs and frankly the interaction between the company and analyst are, for better or worse, a product of decisions essentially made by the CEO. By all accounts, this is not the most collegial of management teams and if there has been much in the way of succession planning, I am unaware of it.While I have written but 4 articles for Seeking Alpha, they all have thematically stressed the cloud. There are still people who appear to believe that the cloud is hype. I am not going to deny that the cloud is hype to a certain extent. This is the software industry we are talking about and hype comes naturally to sales and marketing executives in the space, I ought to know. I was one once upon a time. But in its way, cloud is no more hype than other industry transformations over the years. There was distributed data processing for those old enough to remember. It was followed by client/server and then by its relation, thin client architecture. They were all hyped and they were all real, and if you invest in the software space, you ignore these kinds of trends at your peril. If you invested in a portfolio of the acknowledged leaders in those segments while they were being hyped, you would have wound up infinitely happier than if you had stuck with the erstwhile industry leaders. While there are going to be some exceptions (Tableau (NYSE:DATA) comes most readily to mind), the fact is that most investors who want to maximize their returns over the coming years are going to have to do with a portfolio of industry participants who either were born as cloud software vendors or who have embraced the cloud and who are rapidly moving their business model in that direction. Pega is one of the later names in that regard, but with a key twist in that it has sold subscription-based software for many years, and so the transition to a cloud-based model is going to be far less painful in terms of reported headline numbers than would be the case for some of the other vendors who are going to have to do a balancing act whereby they forego the heady rush of closing large software deals in favor of closing significant but not life changing revenue streams.As an example, in the last reported quarter, Pega was able to grow its cloud revenues by 78% while still achieving a 21% growth in license revenues and a 17% growth in overall revenues. Cloud revenues are, to be sure, still just a small fraction of total revenues. Last quarter, they were $8 million which is just 12% of the $67 million of product revenues and 5% of total revenues of $162 million, but something like 40% of what Pega describes as license revenues are derived from term licenses and subscriptions. As of the end of the last reported quarter (9/30), the company had a billed and unbilled backlog of subscription revenues that totaled $380 million. This is an increase of 14% over the prior year, and while not of the magnitude of growth that CRM has achieved in its somewhat comparable metric, it does suggest that Pega's financial model does have some of the characteristics of a cloud model even though the company's service delivery via the cloud is still in its infancy.Customer Relationship Management is many things to different people and while Pega is a CRM company, its solutions do not look very much like those of Salesforce or indeed many of its larger competitors. CRM, as its name suggests, focuses on automating the sales process and managing the sales force. This company focuses almost exclusively on automating customer-facing interactions. Both types of solutions are important and neither is exclusive, although in recent years with the advent of both e-mail and then social media users seem to be focusing on automating and customizing their marketing processes.The Pega product suite is basically composed of tools and templates that allow companies to build applications that incorporate their own customized set of business rules and which in turn are used to create closed loop marketing applications. While it is not easy to describe the functionality of the Pega solutions in just a few sentences, what users expect to achieve in adopting the Pega Build for Change model are customer-facing applications that accelerate upselling opportunities and that help companies to easily execute campaigns, special offers and strategies across all channels including digital (e-mail and social media) and traditional in real time. I tried to describe the evolution of the automated call center in writing about the opportunities that Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) is trying to exploit with its Nina technology. Pega has taken a different approach to the same problem with what it describes as intelligent Next Best Action guidance which tells customer service agents (CSRs) how they should manage interactions with potential and current customers.Honestly, the results of that can be mighty annoying if you just want to get a quote on home insurance, but apparently, the methodology works - although I suppose I am not the best example of that. In addition to automated and customized upsell scripts, Pega does facilitate what it describes as ""onboarding,"" which essentially allow CSRs to easily configure products and insures that the customer gets the product or the service that they actually want. If you have ever had the experience of trying to insure that your medical insurance coverage is what you wanted and didn't cover something you didn't need - your agent was probably using some kind of software developed with a Pega tool. Pega also provides templates and rules that automate business processes and insure that service level agreements are enforced, and intelligently prioritize work by customer tiers and manage dependencies of collaborative work. I think without laboring the point unnecessarily, what Pega does is to allow its customers to use a rational, systematized and commonsense approach to customer interactions in the digital age.If all of this suggests that Pega sells lots of service and needs to have collaborative practices with most prominent industry implementation partners such as Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Infosys (NYSE:INFY), that is indeed the case. About 25% of Pega's revenues come from professional services, but users probably spend 3 or 4 times that amount on average to implement an enterprise suite of Pega solutions. While there are those who might think that Pega spends loads of money on sales and marketing, the fact is that its partners shoulder much of the load and the relationships have proven to be symbiotic for both parties.As might be anticipated from looking at the type of solutions that Pega sells, it has a heavy concentration on the financial services and the insurance industries. It sells to 7 of the 10 largest banks; its most significant acquisition of a few years ago of Chordiant (CHRD) solidified its position in the banking space as well as improving its competitive offerings in analytics and for health insurance providers. Pega has also tailored its solutions for the large communications and media vendors, and it sells to the public sector and the big pharma companies as well. One of the obvious growth strategies for Pega is to increase its focus on new verticals as well as selling more functionality to its existing base.Pega has scores of competitors ranging from SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to specialist vendors such as Tibco - (but now part of a private company) and Guidewire (NYSE:GWRE). Once upon a time, a few years ago, there was vigorous debate amongst investors regarding how a company like Pega could exist in the midst of the then industry trend to buying from large integrated vendors. The fact is that if users are really interested in changing their business processes in terms of customer-facing interaction, they get lots more bang for their bucks with Pega than with the large integrated suppliers. I can't prove that assertion. There are no real statistics that encompass the space in which Pega participates. The fact is, however, that Pega has grown total revenues by more than 6X in 10 years with only one modestly significant acquisition. It has certainly had quarterly ups and downs, but on an annual basis, it has been able to grow revenues more than 20%/year over the past decade on a pretty consistent basis, which is one of the more enviable records in the software space, especially for a vendor that was more than 20 years old when its streak first started. I do believe, however, that depending on how the cloud transition actually rolls out, it might be a bit difficult for the company to achieve an equivalent growth tempo over the next few years.At the moment, to some degree, Guidewire is perhaps the most interesting of Pega's competitors in that it tries to do many of the same things that Pega does, but is focused strictly on the property and casualty insurance industry. GWRE is far better covered than Pega - 9 analysts vs. 5. Guidewire also has a somewhat complex set of revenue sources which I am not going to discuss here. For what it is worth, EPS growth estimates for Guidewire are 20% for the next five years and they are 28% for Pega. Pega has a market cap half that of GWRE and revenues that are about 70% higher with an EBITDA just less than 5X that of Guidewire. Whether or not Guidewire is overvalued is a separate discussion. For the record, and depending on the macro environment, I think that GWRE has upside potential. I just think at the moment that Pega has more.Pega has loads of potential operating leverage. At the moment, operating margins are just 9%, partially depressed by the bookings that go into the ""backlog"" category. It is not unreasonable to think that Pega can achieve non-GAAP margins of 20%-25% if it more than doubles in the next 5 years which I think is a reasonable expectation. Because Pega already is paying the penalty for contract signings that do not turn into current period revenue, it is far more likely than most other companies of its type to be able to increase margins as it grows reported revenues over the coming years. It will continue to spend lots of money on R&D and lots of money on sales and marketing by the standards of some. On the other hand, as it grows, it is going to achieve some level of economies of scale and some significant margin expansion from the renewal of term licenses. The CEO is always going to attempt to 'land and expand' and will balance on the side of growth as opposed to reported earnings if the opportunity presents itself.Pega share price is up 37% over the past year, which is one of the better performances in the enterprise software space. It has actually outperformed Guidewire over that period, whose shares are up about 19%. I am not suggesting that Pega shares are deep value. I rarely recommend deep value names; there are simply far too many value traps in the enterprise software space amongst those companies who do not have competitive products or an effective distribution network or a functioning partner ecosystem. I do think that multiples at Pega still have room for expansion while earnings continue to grow at rates of more than 30%/year. And if the CEO ever decides to hang up his responsibilities and to concentrate on ping-pong and chess… well this company has an EV/S of well under 3X, which suggests to me that a takeout, if it ever happens, will be at some huge premium of 50%-80%. Pega would be a prize well worth pursuing for most larger enterprise software companies that have the cash to make a realistic offer."
3427816,52382,2015-08-11T11:03:43-04:00,"Improving fundamentals should help the company outperform the broader software & services sector.
        Revenue growth to get boost from license, Cloud, new products and efforts to move beyond large enterprise.
        Investor sentiment should benefit from stability and visibility of revenue and earnings growth, which is already drawing attention of private equity players towards the space.","For last one year, Pegasystems Inc. (PEGA) has mostly underperformed the broader software and services sector (NYSEARCA:XSW), but fundamentals suggest that may change now. The products have matured enough and operational infrastructure has reached enough scale that even evolutionary change and incremental product additions should allow the business to grow organically at low double digits with relatively high visibility, which may not be as common, especially with the changing market conditions and expectations.New products, vertical expansions into different market segments, geographical restructuring and investments in sales & marketing infrastructure have started to bear fruits, as validated by company's exceeding revenue goals, while growing backlogs. Not just quantitatively, the revenue is improving qualitatively too, with more revenues coming from licenses and Cloud.Potential to outperform the broader software and services trendsEven though the products have some overlap with other service providers, the company is predominantly a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) player with significant exposure to the financial industry and related businesses. The company is one of the leading holdings of S&P Software & Services ETF , thus a hedging candidate.S&P Software & Services ETFCompared to the sector, the company offers relatively high growth rate with high visibility, while trading at a discount. Just as a reference, XSW is trading at 3.9 times book, approximately 30 times P/E and 17.6 times cash flow.If last week's Informatica (INFA) deal with participation from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is any signal, the market (and investor) shift towards subscription based models with focus on application layer is already underway, in the software space.The quality and visibility of revenue, combined with growth catalysts should help Pegasystems stand in good stead for trading multiple gains.Results PegasystemsThere is active and somewhat aggressive shift towards license and Cloud revenues at Pegasystems, with both revenue and backlog from license and Cloud showing improvement. License, Cloud and maintenance revenue grew 16% in the first half and constitute 74% of the total revenue, up from 72% in 2014. Revenues from the ratable sources, which are less volatile and offer more visibility, now make up close to 50% of the total revenues.Enough catalysts to drive a steady low double-digit growth, even in this marketImproving backlog, up 11% last quarter, and deferred revenue does provide confidence to the growth expectations, but a closer look makes one even more confidant.Strategically, the growth is expected viaFrom a product standpoint, major theme underway is the expansion from top 400-500 organizations to what may be top 4000-5000 organizations and the product development efforts to support this push are starting to deliver. One major example is the Pega Express. In June, at a major customer event - Pega World, the company announced Pega Express, which investors have mostly shrugged off, as another product announcement, is a major development on many levels. The product allows the customers to build application, with the ability to scale up for full use of the company's main product platform - Pega 7. At a macro level, the company seems to be promoting Cloud to speed client adoption, introducing products to far broader customer groups and taking initiatives to speed up the adoption of Pega 7. The ability to move between Cloud and on-premise solution is significant for customers facing challenges from using all Cloud solutions, no wonder Pegasystems is positioning itself aggressively against Salesforce.com (CRM) in its recent promotions.Source: Pegasystems WhitepaperSome of the well-respected independent industry analysts also seem to have taken note of these developments (link), which are worth reading and tracking closely.The company will be extending 'Pega Can' advertising campaign in North America through the fourth quarter and expanding it into Europe beginning this fall. It has just been a few months, since the company started focusing on broadening the market reach with an initial focus on the North American market, even though early results are visible, benefits should pick pace with time, as smaller companies (relatively) tend to take shorter time to close the deal.Geographically, Europe has started to improve, which is expected to pick pace over the coming weeks, with the company making management changes. South America is also expected to pick pack with the company expected to redraw strategy for the geography after some early success in Brazil.A numerical approach makes the growth prospects look even betterThe company has three major revenue segments and it is worth taking a look at each of the three segments up close.If one looks at Software Licenses business up close, there are three sub-segments and each one is growing.Even conservative growth assumptions in each of the three sub-segments, does lead to low double-digit type of growth rates, as the calculation below shows.Similarly, a closer look at the trend of the three sub-segments within the Services businessThe growth is equally impressiveSince, Maintenance revenue tends to grow as the installed base of the software grows and renewal rate stays strong, sooner or later the growth of the maintenance business will follow the growth trajectory of other businesses.Tying it together does lead to low double-digit growth rates, decent for the current state of the industry, current market expectations and even decent for the current state of the macro economy.Margins improving, but potential for further improvementGross margins have ranged between 69-90% in the recent times, but as the sheet below shows, there is significant room for improvement in the Services business, which has suffered from increased subcontractor costs, lower utilization in Europe and lower consulting revenues among other things. Higher mix of faster growing Cloud revenues should help improve the gross margins, even though one-time charges have impacted the Cloud margins recently.Non-GAAP operating margins are close to 11%, but worth noting that margins, helped by seasonality and budgets, for the second half are significantly better than the first and if previous year's trends is any guide, as the sheet below shows, current full year's operating margins should be significantly better than the 11% level.Operating expenses have also increased due to higher commission and other variable compensation expenses driven by increased sales activity in the first half, higher investments in the development of new products and Pega WORLD, a major sales event, which raised marketing costs in the first half.RelativelyThe business may look expensive compared to other non-technology names, but considering the premium enjoyed by software & services for growth, visibility and profitability or when compared against other players in the space, publicly traded or recently privatized, there is decent room for trading multiples to improve, which improving fundamentals should allow.Note: Detailed proprietary model is not attached in this note for the sake of easy readability, but happy to help and provide more details to readers interested in understanding the calculations used in this note."
3276045,63483,2015-06-22T19:44:05-04:00,"Mixed first quarter results.Accenture/Economist initiative has two-fold benefits.Existing customer relationships continue to expand, resulting in a greater degree of customer stickiness.New vertical markets show great market potential and bring diversification benefits.I remain bullish on Pegasystems.","Earnings ReviewPegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) recently posted mixed first quarter results. During the quarter, the company announced a joint initiative with Accenture and the Economist, which I think has two-fold benefits. The firm continues to expand its existing customer relationships, which should result in a greater degree of customer stickiness and other competitive advantages (such as pricing power) as well. PEGA has recently ventured into new vertical markets such as manufacturing. These new markets show great market potential and should bring about diversification benefits. Thus, I remain bullish on Pegasystems.Mixed first quarter resultsDuring the first quarter, PEGA managed to grow its top-line to $154m (+10% Y/Y). Bottom-line results were a different matter entirely. Diluted GAAP EPS slid to $0.08 (-33% Y/Y). In terms of analyst estimates the company failed to beat expectations, posting diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 vs. projections of $0.17, surprising 24% to the downside. However, I posit that this shouldn't be viewed as a negative as the company had tough comps (Q1 FY14) to live up to. Although PEGA is profitable, the company has yet to achieve scale. Thus, one can reasonably expect revenues to be lumpy in nature (which is the case when comparing quarterly results) due to the presence a few large deals every quarter.Accenture/Economist initiative has two-fold benefitsPEGA announced a joint initiative with Accenture and the Economist to position Pegasystems as a thought leader in digital transformation. I opine that this initiative has two-fold benefits for the company.One, the initiative is sure to bring PEGA a great deal of publicity and exposure, allowing the Pegasystems brand to become more recognized. A large number of companies today still source software from different providers. However, there are several problems with this practice. Due to the fact that the software is sourced from multiple vendors, inefficiencies and compatibility issues are sure to arise. PEGA offers a compelling value proposition to enterprises who have these problems through its single unified platform. Hence, the case for switching to PEGA's platform becomes very convincing. Thus, I think that a slight revenue acceleration might be in order.Two, due to the tremendous value-add that a unified platform brings, it is easy for PEGA to retain its customer base. Said another way, the main hurdle for the company is customer acquisition. Maintenance is not that large of a concern in comparison. This initiative allows PEGA to achieve widespread recognition. Due to the aforementioned dynamics, the company might be able to dial back its marketing spend considerably as a result.Existing customer relationships continue to expand, resulting in a greater degree of customer stickinessDuring the quarter, management reported that the company was able to expand existing relationships with many of its important customers, presumably by cross-selling these customers a greater number of the company's offerings. Not only is this an endorsement of the complementary nature of many of the company's products and services, it also results in a greater degree of customer stickiness among the firm's clientele.This is because as a client uses a greater number of PEGA's offerings, the client becomes increasingly reliant on PEGA's products and services, which leads to a gradual increase of customer switching costs over time. Retaining customers becomes considerably easier as a result. This is not all. A greater degree of customer stickiness also allows PEGA to derive a certain degree of pricing power, allowing the company to raise prices rather freely while still retaining their customer base.New vertical markets show great market potential and bring diversification benefitsRecently, PEGA has been exploring new vertical markets. One of these verticals is manufacturing. Per management commentary, the company seems to be making meaningful headway into this area. Management has identified the fact that manufacturers increasingly think of what they offer as a service as opposed to just selling a product. In other words, the focus is steadily shifting to customer relationship management. CRM is one of PEGA's areas of expertise, therefore, this trend definitely bodes well for the company.Apart from the market potential, venturing into new vertical markets also brings diversification benefits. Most vertical markets are very different from each other and thus are exposed to different dynamics. In other words, they tend to not correlate with each other. Hence, by sourcing sales from many different verticals, PEGA would be able to reduce the volatility of its revenue, profits and cash flows. In a nutshell, overall business risk is lowered.I remain bullish on PEGAAs seen above, my model assumptions remain unchanged from that of my prior article on the stock. This is because the company continues to perform in line with my expectations. The company should continue to perform well in the near-term for the reasons listed in earlier paragraphs. The only change in the model that of the exit multiple, which has been increased to 20x (up from 19.3x) as the company continues to trade at higher valuation multiples. My current model implies 41% upside potential ($32 price target). Thus, I remain bullish on PEGA and continue to recommend a long position in the stock."
286951,24750,2011-08-12T07:38:51-04:00,,"On Tuesday, August 9 after the close, Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) released its second quarter results. Here is a quick look at them and reasons to be interested in the name:Thesis: Pegasystems' stock is an interesting investment given its revised go-to-market strategy, strong competitive positioning, strong differentiators, significant business momentum, and attractive valuation.Company Description: Businesses often want to change their processes faster than IT departments can update the underlying technology, creating a significant disparity between how a firm wants its systems to work and how they operate. Business Process Management (BPM) software attempts to bridge the aforementioned execution gaps in a manner that is both quick and cost effective. In our view the firm with the best BPM solution is Pegasystems. Its solution enables enterprises to graphically map the processes and rules in a particular business in order to design new applications or modify existing ones. This software has provided customers with many benefits, including productivity gains and significant cost savings. Improvements seen by Pegasystems' customers include a five-percentage point increase in customer retention, a 40% improvement in productivity, and 30% growth in revenue. As a specific example, Farmers Insurance used BPM software to automate its SMB commercial insurance quoting process, reducing the process time from 14 days to 14 minutes.Business Model Change: Six years ago, Pegasystems changed its go-to-market strategy. Rather than targeting large up-front license megadeals via heavyweight applications as it did in the past, Pegasystems adjusted its focus to small piecemeal platform-based or light framework-based projects. These projects are much more palatable for decision-makers. To support its customers, the company also began to develop strategic relationships with consultants. Before 2005, the company did not partner and primarily performed all its own professional service work. These new relationships have opened doors for the company and led to business that Pegasystems would not have won previously. We believe these changes have led to a better business model, with more recurring revenue and less reliance on large deals.Strong Differentiators: While large infrastructure vendors have expanded their BPM presence in recent years, Pegasystems, in our opinion, has two key differentiators, which should allow the company to continue its market leader position and its impressive top-line growth. First, Pegasystems' offering combines a rules-based engine with a workflow/process engine, providing the company, in my view, with an architecturally superior product. Other BPM vendors have to integrate multiple solutions to compete with Pegasystems' unified BPM offering. Second, Pegasystems' platform was designed so that business users could graphically describe and help build applications, thereby reducing the need for IT assistance. Most BPM software requires a significantly greater amount of IT expertise.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

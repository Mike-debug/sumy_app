4315835,24361,2020-01-08T15:20:57-05:00,"PerkinElmer has a new CEO and the company will be refocusing on consumables over capex equipment and really concentrating on food safety, diagnostics, and pharma services to drive growth.EUROIMMUN and Vanadis can both be growth drivers, but both have challenges that PerkinElmer will have to overcome.PerkinElmer looks likely to generate double-digit FCF growth on solid revenue growth and improving margins, but the valuation isn't very appealing.","In a strong market for life sciences, a market that has seen Sartorius (OTC:SARTF) jump more than 70% over the past year, Bio-Rad (BIO) more than 60% over the past year, and Thermo Fisher (TMO) over 45%, PerkinElmer's (PKI) almost 30% climb doesn't seem quite so special. Part of the issue is an ongoing challenge with the company hitting its growth and margin targets (it seems like it can do one or the other in a given period, but not both), but I believe the lack of leverage to bioproduction is a drawback as well. Although a new CEO and a shifted set of priorities could help the former, it doesn't look as though PerkinElmer management is contemplating a major near-term shift in the business mix.As is so often the case for me in life sciences today, I like the companies but not the valuations. Mid-teens annualized FCF growth would only support a mid-single-digit annualized return at today's level, so I can't really call this a favorite idea now. The stock has proven to be volatile over the last couple of years, though, so this is a name worth considering for a watch list.The new year brings a new CEO to PerkinElmer, with Prahlad Singh taking over from Robert Friel. While Friel did some good things in his tenure, the shares did lag other life science companies like Thermo, Waters (WAT), Mettler-Toledo (MTD), and Sartorius, and the company had a reputation for frequently coming up short of management's long-term growth and margin targets. PerkinElmer also had a reputation as a sort of stodgy company that played in the less exciting areas of life sciences (like instruments) and that was unwilling to take the plunge into more exciting emerging areas like sequencing and bio-production. I don't think that reputation was entirely deserved, particularly with recent forays into areas like autoimmune testing, but I also don't think it was an entirely unfair criticism.It doesn't sound like any major changes are on the way, and that makes sense given that Singh has been with the company for some time now. Instead, there are some evolutionary goals that I do believe can help improve the growth and margin profile of the business.For starters, management is prioritizing a shift toward more recurring revenue (from its current 66/34 mix), including more software, assay, and reagent revenue. This is a common initiative across the space; tools aren't nearly as profitable as the recurrent consumables/reagent streams they can produce, and the budgets for those consumables tend to vary a lot less from year to year.Management is also looking to intensify its focus on core opportunities in food, pharma, and diagnostics. These priorities don't surprise me. While industrial markets like oil/gas and chemicals can generate good margins in good times, they're deeply cyclical and not always quick to adopt new technologies. Likewise with environmental testing.Food testing, though, remains an attractive opportunity, with growth in the cannabis market and Chinese food safety testing. Diagnostics, too, is attractive for PerkinElmer, with industry-wide growth in autoimmune testing and company-specific growth drivers like increased penetration of EUROIMMUN into the U.S. market. As far as pharma goes, I think the company's best prospects are in its OneSource lab management service business. PerkinElmer offers a wide breadth of services and already counts all top-20 pharma companies as customers, but there's still significant potential to dislodge in-house service done by even its largest customers.Margins should improve with these initiatives. The service operations generate attractive margins, as do the diagnostics and genetic testing businesses. Management also believes there are some opportunities to do more organizational streamlining - improving both the customer experience (one point of contact instead of many) and reducing redundancies.The roll-out of Vanadis has been slower than expected, but the company added another 4 sites in the third quarter to end with 19 placements. As expected, PerkinElmer is trying to position Vanadis, a non-invasive prenatal testing technology, as a cheaper alternative to sequencing-based prenatal testing and a better alternative to biochemical testing. European healthcare systems seldom reimburse for sequencing-based testing (which costs almost 3x as much as Vanadis) except in high-risk situations, and Vanadis has already received some positive reimbursement decisions in Europe. Opportunities are likely more limited in the U.S. (where sequencing-based testing has a stronger position) and China is more of a toss-up - the company has a good market presence in China (helped by the EUROIMMUN business), but sequencing-based testing has garnered almost 20% share without reimbursement, so Vanadis usage may be limited to smaller hospitals.EUROIMMUN continues to perform well, with ongoing double-digit growth as the company both gains share in its core markets and benefits from underlying growth in testing for autoimmune and allergies. Growth in the U.S. remains a promising opportunity as the company puts more tests through the FDA regulatory process and better leverages its existing sales infrastructure. This business should also get a boost from the company's roll-out of an automated random-access platform by year-end - the current technology is labor-intensive and rivals like Bio-Rad have long had automated offerings.While it's not accurate to say that PerkinElmer couldn't get into bio-production if they wanted to (an attractive growth opportunity for Danaher (DHR), Sartorius, and Thermo), the cost would be very high and it wouldn't really fit with the rest of the portfolio today. With that, investors need to make their peace with the reality that diagnostics, lab services, and food testing are going to be the prime drivers for this business. Fortunately, those are businesses that can support attractive growth and margins, at least relative to the ""average"" business.I believe PerkinElmer could see growth accelerate in the high single-digits over the next couple of years, but I'm not modeling that as my base-case (as I said, this is a business with a long history of coming up short). With my base-case assumptions, my long-term revenue growth rate comes in between 5% and 6%, while meaningful margin and asset leverage can drive mid-teens FCF growth. I'd note, though, that PerkinElmer has had some issues with working capital management (related at least in part to its diagnostics businesses), so that's something to watch.Whether I use DCF or margin-driven multiple valuation approaches, I still arrive at basically the same conclusion - that PerkinElmer is not particularly cheap and looks priced for roughly mid-single-digit annualized returns. That's not uncommon in the life sciences space, but I'm not willing to push my luck on valuation here. Still, with the volatility that these shares have shown in the past, it would be a decent idea for a watch list, as a 20% pullback would create a much different value proposition."
4307103,104439,2019-11-15T14:29:22-05:00,"Excellent portfolio in the field of diagnostics and analytics for life sciences, environmental, food and industrial applications.Acquisition of Meizheng strengthens its presence in the food safety business with a significant market in China.The firm has maintained sound financial health for a good period of time, opportunities exist to further expand its gross margins.The Share looks fully valued but its strong performance and significant long term growth opportunities make it a buy.","PerkinElmer (PKI) maintains an attractive portfolio of analytical and diagnostic solutions for several industries. The name is 82 years old but the last ten years have majorly reshaped the firm. During this period the firm has significantly extended its portfolio by making several acquisitions and expanding its analytical solutions base. Although the top line grew at a modest pace of 6.7% cagr, PerkinElmer has firmly established a highly sustainable company. Broadly, the portfolio has active exposures in the life sciences market, environmental, food, and industrial markets and typically attains high single-digit profit margins. Earlier in October, PerkinElmer acquired Meizheng Group, a food safety testing company in China that has an addressable market$1 billion to $2 billion, this could be a significant addition to the firm’s portfolio that has a TTM revenue of $2.83 billion. In its last earnings call, the management expressed confidence in its growth businesses like EUROIMMUN, Vanadis, our Genomics business, Service Informatics, and Cannabis. These factors, despite its fully valued situation, shows an attractive long term proposition for portfolios that require exposure to growth businesses. Last month PerkinElmer’s then CEO Rob Friel introduced its new CEO during the earnings call, Prahlad Sing, who previously served as its COO. I believe that PerkinElmer will be an excellent investment for growth-seeking portfolios.PKI’s latest earnings showed that its diagnostics (contributes 40% of total sales) and analytical solutions delivered an organic growth rate of 6% and 4%, respectively. Year-to-date, the Americas and Asia-Pacific are up mid- single-digits while Europe is up low single-digits. Productivity and cost out actions helped expand the adjusted operating margin by 250 bps during the quarter, reaching 21.6%. The firm has expanded adjusted operating margins by 150 basis points year-over-year on a YTD basis. All these led to an EPS of $1.06, reflecting an18% growth compared to 2018 Q3 and $0.05 ahead of its guidance.In the diagnostics segment, the 6% growth was primarily driven by its immunodiagnostic and reproductive health franchises. EUROIMMUN and Tulip, PKI’s immunodiagnostics solutions led the way by delivering a low double-digit organic growth rate. Although EURPOIMMUN U.S. business continues to grow, China may become a large market too. The firm expects EUROIMMUN’s U.S. market share for AMA testing to reach 50% as testing ramps up. A growth in PKI’s genomics testing business led a mid-single-digit growth in its reproductive health market, the firm has expanded its coverage in the Asia-pacific region.Image: EUROBlotOne, Unique automation solution for the immunoblot work stationThe analytical solution segment’s 4% growth was led by high single-digit organic revenue growth in pharma biotech which was driven by its imaging and detection and informatics product lines, both were up double-digits in the quarter. As leading pharma and biotech companies actively shift to modern future-proof workflow solutions, PKI’s informatics business continues to gain more spotlight. But the market was slightly flat during the quarter which I believe to be a temporary situation. Besides these, the cannabis segment saw low single-digit growth moved by high cannabis demand.Meizheng’s net purchase price amounted to approximately $152 million, and the management expects to extract a double-digit return on invested capital by year four. Meizheng is headquartered in Beijing, and its product portfolio covers immunoassay, microbiology and molecular testing for food safety in prioritized end-markets grain, dairy, meat, and seafood. The firm said that it expects Meizheng to have approximately $30 million of revenue in 2019 with accretive operating margins. PKI believes that Meizheng has developed a reputation as a leading food safety testing company in China due to its current portfolio breadth, a strong culture of innovation and unparalleled customer intimacy.“Meizheng is a highly attractive and strategic asset, one that will play a pivotal role in our domestic food strategy in China as well as our broader long-term food strategy across the globe. Meizheng has developed a reputation as a leading food safety testing company in China due to its current portfolio breadth, a strong culture of innovation and unparalleled customer intimacy.”- Prahlad Singh, PerkinElmerIn the last couple of years, PerkinElmer has continued to have greater cost efficiency which is clearly reflected in its gross profit margin pattern. There have been at least 300 bps improvement in the cost of goods sold, and selling expenses are very well controlled. PerkinElmer expects 2019 full-year revenue of $800 million, representing 5% organic revenue growth, including a foreign exchange headwind of approximately $11 million versus a comparable prior period. I believe PKI is well-positioned to maintain its cost structure and attain its revised adjusted EPS target economically for the year which is increased to $4.07 ($1.32 in Q4). In the last four quarters, the firm had beat earnings estimates 3 times, the one other time results were in line with estimates.Source: Seeking AlphaIn my relative valuation approach, I took several competitors. These include Waters Corporation(WAT), Bruker Corporation (BRKR), Thermo Fisher (TMO), Agilent Technologies (A) and Merck (MRK). Although Price/Sales and EV/Sales medians show an undervalued situation, P/E shows that the firm is overvalued. A broad examination suggests that the firm is fully valued in the market, but it is not enough to discourage an investor who is seeking growth exposures. The firm has built a solid portfolio that targets several attractive industries, financials also look strong. Source: Seeking AlphaPerkinElmer has an excellent product portfolio that covers several diagnostic and analytical product markets. The firm has delivered strong results for a good period of time and continues to strengthen its position with business expansions. Although the firm looks fully valued in a conservative framework, the firm has high growth potential with its cutting edge products. Combining all the factors, PerkinElmer is a buy.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
4344331,99756,2020-05-07T16:32:49-04:00,"Over the last 5 years, PerkinElmer has gone through a substantial make-over, fundamentally changing the profile of PerkinElmer from a 3-4% organic growth business to a 5-6% organic growth business.Free Cash Flow conversion has fallen from historic 90%-100% levels to mid-70%. We are convinced that the new CEO can bring FCF-conversion back to former levels.We believe this is a business that will be able to grow its EPS at a double-digit CAGR for the next 5 years.The latest quarterly earnings support our thesis.","PerkinElmer (NYSE:PKI) is a company that has manufactured analytical, scientific instruments in all of its 80 years of existence. Yet, over the last 5 years the company has gone through a substantial make-over. This puts the business in the enviable position where today no less than 70% of revenue comes from consumables, services and software, no less than 40% of turnover is generated in the emerging markets and no less than 75% of the business is geared towards the highly favorable diagnostics and life sciences end markets.Our take is that this has fundamentally changed the financial profile of PerkinElmer from a 3-4% organic growth business to a 5-6% organic growth business. This growth is supported by several tailwinds that we explain throughout the article: a shift to gene editing, the rise in autoimmune diseases, expanding the new-born screening assays in emerging markets, new product launches, etc. This makes that the growth is truly high-quality since it is not only significant in terms of quantum, but also highly diversified in terms of drivers.Complementing this growth with a very clear path of margin expansion, we believe this is a business that will be able to grow its EPS at a double-digit CAGR for the next 5 years. We therefore think PerkinElmer is a buy at current levels for the long-term investor.Source: Bloomberg; Author's own calculationsPerkinElmer was founded in 1937 by Richard Perkin and Charles Elmer as an optical design and consulting company. Throughout its history, the company has always manufactured scientific, analytical instruments, yet for a wide range of end-markets: from optical components for the Hubble Space Telescope to photonics, fluid sciences and clinical labs all the way to computer manufacturing. Today, the company's end-markets are confined to diagnostics, life sciences, food and environmental.We use the below charts to demonstrate how much the company has changed (for the better) over the last 5 years. We are using data up to 2018 because the company has significant exposure to China (20% of revenues) and we want to exclude any numbers that were impacted by COVID-19. Given that the Chinese operations already saw a small impact in Q4 2019, we have opted to use data up to 2018.Source: Company filingsSource: Company filingsSource: Company filingsThe simple insight from this is that PKI's growth potential has increased significantly (due to both its emerging markets exposure as well as its end-market mix) and its revenues are even more recurring than before.PKI reports along two segments: Discovery & Analytical Solutions (""DAS"") and Diagnostics (""Dx""). In turn, the DAS segment consists of Life Sciences, Food and Environmental & Industrial. Above we have thus already shown that 60% of sales are generated in the DAS segment and 40% of sales in the Dx segment. However, Dx's margin is significantly higher and therefore, the earnings split between the two segments is 50/50:Source: Company filingsHaving outlined which activity accounts for which amount of profits, we turn to what these business lines actually do and what their respective drivers and growth potential are.Diagnostics - 50% of group operating incomeBoth the Diagnostics and the Life Sciences activities produce analytical instruments that are used in a healthcare environment. The difference between the two is best explained by their setting: Diagnostics relates mostly to testing of blood samples whereas Life Sciences relates to instruments used in labs for drug discovery.Diagnostics represents c. half of group earnings. We have estimated that this 50% can be further subdivided in three big chunks: ""reproductive health"" represents c. 22% of group earnings, immunodiagnostics represents c. 20% of group earnings with the remaining 8% generated in applied genomics. We will now in turn describe these business lines in more detail.Reproductive health is probably the first business line that PKI is generally associated with, given their very dominant position here. Put simply, reproductive health performs all testing related to fertility, pregnancy and new-borns:Source: Company PresentationReproductive health represents the crown jewel in PKI's portfolio and it essentially boils down to prenatal screening and new-born screening.Prenatal screening consists of one or more blood tests which will tell you the chance of your baby having a chromosome abnormality such as Down syndrome, trisomy 18, neural tube defects, etc. Prenatal screening can occur through either biochemical screening (80% of current market) or NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing, 20% of market). The difference is simply that NIPT is even less invasive than biochemical screening, e.g. by studying placental rather than fetal DNA. PKI has a strong position in prenatal screening with 50% market share in biochemical screening and an emerging presence in NIPT. The appeal of this activity is straightforward: PKI has a dominant position in a lucrative market with high barriers to entry. In addition, the company has now launched its Vanadis platform, which is a state-of-the-art NIPT solution, which will allow PKI to further gain market share by entering the NIPT market, further increasing its dominance in the prenatal screening market overall.New-born screening consists of a simple blood sample collected from the infant's heel between 24 hours and 7 days after birth. PKI holds a global market share of >70% in new-born screening, an activity we find particularly appealing for two reasons. First, it is simply the case that EM penetration is extremely low: babies born in China today are only tested for 4-6 disorders in big cities, a number that drops to 0-2 disorders in more rural provinces. This stands in sharp contrast to the developed world where 20-30 indications being tested is the norm. To put things differently: 40% of the world's population lives in China and India whereas these two countries make up only 10% of the global diagnostics market. PKI is an excellent play on this trend as it is one of the biggest players in EM diagnostics.Source: Industry reportsThe second reason we are a fan of new-born screening is related to the wave of pharma companies that are increasingly focusing on gene editing as a more efficient means to tackle disorders as opposed to traditional treatment methods. Because gene editing is a completely new way of tackling disease (many compare it to turning off the faucet while traditional methods were simply mopping up the floor), it is not only proposed as a more effective alternative to current treatment standards, but also able to tackle many disorders that were previously untreatable.The first big wave of such untreatable disorders are so-called ""monogenic"" disorders. Monogenic disorders are diseases where a single gene is the cause of disease and thus much easier to tackle with gene editing as opposed to more complex disorders where there are mutations in more than a single gene (e.g. cancer). We could call monogenic diseases the low-hanging fruit of gene editing if you will. Examples of such diseases are cystic fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, etc. There are >10,000 monogenic diseases affecting millions and millions of people.The bottom line is that this is great news for PerkinElmer, since it now finally makes sense to screen at birth for these disorders as we can finally cure them. Take spinal muscular atrophy (""SMA"") for instance, a disorder where Novartis (NYSE:NVS) has brought a successful cure to market using gene editing. SMA is a terrible disease where 90% of children will pass away before the age of 2. In the past, SMA was never included in new-born screening as it made no difference since there was no cure. Hospitals were not very keen on telling newly minted parents their child would almost certainly die within the next two years from a disease they could not treat. SMA is but one of the many disorders that will in the future be treatable through gene editing and PKI will benefit greatly from this through more and more need for thorough new-born screening. There are a couple of things we particularly like about this:Immunodiagnostics is the second big piece of the Diagnostics segment, representing a further c. 20% of group earnings. As the name suggests, it relates to diagnostic testing for autoimmune diseases. Put simply, autoimmune diseases are maladies where the individual's immune system mistakenly targets own cells rather than foreign cells. Instead of guarding against germs and bacteria, it mistakenly attacks healthy cells of e.g. the skin or joints of its host body.Unfortunately, autoimmune diseases represent a group of disorders that has shown significant growth over the last decade, hinting at the fact they may be related to environmental factors such as infections or exposure to chemicals or solvents. Women are twice more likely to develop autoimmune diseases than men, with the disease usually starting during a woman's childbearing age. The most prevalent autoimmune diseases are multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and lupus.The combination of high and growing prevalence, very few treatments currently successful and advances in biology/genomics has generated increasing interest by pharma companies to spend R&D on autoimmune diseases, a trend that is likely to persist for many years, which obviously bodes well for immunodiagnostics.PKI's presence in immunodiagnostics is relatively novel, with the acquisition of EUROIMMUN which closed back in December 2017. EUROIMMUN has extensive expertise in the fields of immunology, cell biology, histology, biochemistry and molecular biology. It produces test systems for the laboratory diagnosis of autoimmune and infectious diseases, allergies, and for gene analyses. We think that EUROIMMUN is a fantastic asset and below list a couple of reasons why:Put simply, EUROIMMUN is a high-quality play on a great theme, with the right geographical footprint.Applied genomics represents the remaining 8% of group earnings generated by the Diagnostics segment. It is one of the highest growing fields in diagnostics, as this is where the major advances have been made over the past couple of years. Next-generation sequencing refers to deep sequencing techniques where now the entire human genome can be sequenced within a single day, a feat unthinkable not so long ago.Applied genomics is a relatively new activity for PKI and they have mostly started doing this upon the request of their clients in the new-born setting. If PKI's new-born screening yielded positive results (i.e. an abnormality was detected), the baby had to be further tested to verify the results, often triggering whole genome sequencing tests. This was pretty much the only step of the ""reproductive health"" cycle that PKI didn't offer yet, and clients wanted to go through the whole cycle with only one party. These skills are now broadened to be used in more and more settings, as the applied genomics market is claimed to grow at 25% per year currently. This very high growth is of course fueled by the shift in healthcare trying to use our increased understanding of DNA and biology in order to develop treatments.Conclusion on Diagnostics segment: the two big drivers of Diagnostics are EUROIMMUN and reproductive health, both great assets with dominant positions, high barriers to entry and various secular growth tailwinds. In Applied Genomics, PKI is more of a challenger, but we see them able to participate in the high growth this market is currently seeing. Overall, we think Diagnostics is an enviable business, carrying high margins, demonstrating strong long-term growth potential and stickiness given that 75% of turnover comes from reagents.Life Sciences - 28% of group operating incomeAs we have stated earlier, the Life Sciences activities (part of DAS segment) manufacture analytical instruments used in laboratories for drug discovery, finding their way to pharma, biotech and academic institutions. Within Life Sciences, we find three main activities: Life Sciences Research Solutions, preclinical imaging and OneSource.Life Sciences Research Solutions manufactures a wide range of instruments used in the lab setting, e.g. through pathology imaging: the visualization of cells and tissue and their reaction to various treatments, as well as phenotyping of immune cells, visualization and measurement of biomarkers, etc. More info as well as a video can be found here: Life Sciences Research Solutions.Preclinical imaging is the visualization of living animals for research purposes. Changes are observed at either the organ, tissue, cell or molecular level in living animals undergoing treatment in pre-clinical test settings. Imaging is usually multimodal, making use of a combination of MR, CT, PET and SPECT techniques. So as an example, PKI's instruments will for instance continuously monitor and visualize the size of a cancer tumor in a mouse undergoing a new treatment in a phase I pre-clinical study.OneSource Laboratory Services relates to a suite of software solutions that allows lab owners to optimize the yield of their operations, by maximizing uptime, lab analytics, compliance reporting, asset utilization and workflow solutions. The main goal is simply to maximize the yield of R&D labs, while reducing maintenance costs. Important to know is that OneSource not only does this for PKI products but for the entire lab, including products of competitors. PKI alone has 500,000 assets installed globally and a force of 1,700 service engineers.Environmental & Industrial - 15% of group operating incomeThe Environmental & Industrial activities sound complex, as the main products here relate to chromatography, mass spectrometry and liquid particle counters. In essence, it always boils down to the same thing: PKI's products measure the content of certain compounds in various products/settings, e.g.:Out of the 15% of group earnings, we estimate 10% are generated in industrial end markets such as oil & gas, general industrial, semiconductors and chemicals with the remaining 5% in environmental settings. Due to ever more stringent regulations, these are growth markets through the cycle, yet they certainly represent the most cyclical aspect of PKI, making it the least prioritized business line as well as the one most likely to be divested at some point. As the environmental side of things is mostly focused on drinking water, we think the needs (especially in EM) are high and cyclicality remains decent. This makes that we can posit that only c. 10% of PKI's earnings are cyclical.Food - 8% of group operating incomeThe Food segment is relatively similar to Environmental & Industrial, also using spectrometry techniques to measure the content of certain substances, such as gluten quantity, milk components, protein content, hormones, antibiotics, natural toxins, microbial and industrial contaminants, etc.A large part of this is tied to grain and dairy testing, where there are strict regulatory standards. PKI does testing for both the food as well as the feed sectors, working for 9 out of the 10 largest global food producers. Contrary to Environmental & Industrial, Food is a defensive, high growth segment where PKI is investing heavily. It has e.g. devised full workflow solutions for cannabis testing, as it tries to be the pioneer in this burgeoning sector, where marijuana or cannabinoids are increasingly finding their way to food and drinks in the U.S.Below we plot the historical organic sales growth of PKI.Source: Company filings, Author's Own GraphRather than historical growth figures, we think it is far more important to contemplate how much PKI's inherent growth profile has changed given the acquisitions and divestitures the company has done, significantly altering its end-market mix away from industrial towards diagnostics and life sciences. We think this change, in large part due to the EUROIMMUN purchase has changed the group's growth profile from 3-4% organic to 5-6% organic. Taking into account EUROIMMUN's growth, their entry into applied genomics as well as the Vanadis launch in reproductive health, we think this is realistic and above all prudent.Taking a look at what the consensus growth figures for the next three years were before the COVID-19 virus broke out, we can see that the sell side analysts share this view.Source: BloombergThe 2020 growth rate was a bit higher but this is because Bloomberg consensus obviously reflects nominal, not organic growth and PKI has done a couple of small acquisitions in 2019. Subtracting this 1-2% nominal growth from acquisitions, all three years were in line with our organic forecast. This reassures us in the sense that we view this as achievable, we would be worried if consensus had too high expectations. We realize that these growth rates have changed due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus but the whole point of this exercise is to demonstrate that the underlying growth profile of PKI has changed.As a final and important point, we are happy to see that future growth is well-diversified: it will come from life sciences, the Vanadis launch, EUROIMMUN, applied genomics, gene editing increasing the breadth of new-born screening, investments in food, etc. So it is reassuring to see that future growth is not dependent on one or two main product launches, but nicely diversified across different end markets and geographies.We want to understand how much upside there could be to PKI's margins or whether they potentially have already peaked. Taking a look at the company's margins vs. peers, it looks like there could be some upside left.Source: BloombergThis is always a tricky exercise, however, as every company is different. Therefore, we look at various ways in which PKI plans to increase its margins, other than being a growth business and exploiting its operational leverage. It plans to do so via 3 avenues:A final margin driver that we would add is that the Diagnostics segment grows a lot faster than the DAS segment. The former carries 30% margins whereas the latter has 20% margins, so mechanically this also helps the group margin as long as Diagnostics grows faster than DAS, which we believe will remain the case.These actions are bearing fruit, as margins have been on an upward trajectory: the group saw margin improvement in each of the past three years and initially expected to improve margins by 80bps in 2020 (pre-COVID-19). The new CEO at that time also stated that the company would pursue further margin improvement in the years after 2020, which makes sense as the initiatives we outlined above are relatively new.In terms of free cash generation, PKI clearly has some cleaning up to do. Over the past years, the focus was entirely on shifting the company towards different end-markets (as we have discussed in this article) through various acquisitions and divestitures. This has made that working capital management has suffered, amongst others because EUROIMMUN has different working capital dynamics, because of the investments in SG&A and the general priority of refocusing for growth.Now that this strategic realignment exercise has been successfully fulfilled, PKI is intent on tightening its working capital management and bringing FCF conversion back to 90-100% of adjusted net income.Source: Company filingsIn terms of valuation, we think it is important to highlight that PKI's financials are somewhat similar to pharma, as their main expenses are personnel and R&D, which are all expensed and not capitalized. This then results in the fact that EV/EBITDA multiples always look high, as your net income, EBIT and EBITDA will be closer to one another than is the case for more traditional companies due to the absence of meaningful D&A.Because of this, we have always thought it to be most appropriate to value the pharma/wider healthcare space primarily through a P/E multiple, with a check that the company does not carry too much debt. The latter is not a big concern, as virtually no major pharma company carries significant debt and neither does PKI.Below we plot the P/E, EV/EBITDA and FCF yield for the peer group we also used to benchmark margins, with the exception of Roche Diagnostics (SWX:RO). All metrics are forward metrics for full year 2020.Source: BloombergSource: BloombergSource: BloombergWith the usual caveats that no company is the same and relative valuations have many pitfalls, our observations are below:As a conclusion to valuation, by no means would we claim that PKI is cheap. We would actually prefer for it to trade below 20x P/E (on normalized earnings) prior to taking a position. On the other hand, we are confident of this company generating very nice earnings growth for a very long period: the tailwinds we discussed in this memo extend for a lot longer than just the next five years. Prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, PKI itself had said it could grow organic sales at high-single digits and EPS at mid-teens. We think this is somewhat ambitious and believe that normalized EPS growth is around 10-12% per year.Robert Friel has been the Chairman and CEO of PKI for the last 10 years, handing over the reins to Prahlad Singh as of Jan 1st, 2020. Friel joined PKI in 1999, having served in the COO and CFO roles prior to becoming CEO. We think he has done a relatively good job, especially the last few years, repositioning the company for the better. We also think it is time for some fresh blood at the top.Prahlad Singh joined PKI in 2014 as head of the Diagnostics business, which has thrived under his leadership given the growth, EPS growth and EUROIMMUN acquisition under his tenure. In 2019 he became COO, where he was able to roll out group-wide many of the best practices he had established in the Diagnostics unit. Prior to joining PKI, he has served in various leadership roles at GE Healthcare (NYSE:GE), Philips (NYSE:PHG), DuPont Pharmaceuticals and Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY). What we like about the new CEO is that he has been around for some time at PKI (with success) and that he has an operational rather than a financial background: we think this serves the company well at a juncture where integration of the acquisitions and better working capital management are crucial.PerkinElmer reported the results of the first quarter of this year after the market close on the fifth of May. PKI managed to beat market expectations on both revenues and EPS.Some of the highlights of this very strong earnings report were:A very important thing to note was that most sell-side analysts were amazed by the COVID-19 tests developed by PerkinElmer. These tests are more accurate and reliable than a lot of those developed by renowned diagnostics players. This is important because PKI is almost never mentioned in any industry primer on diagnostics and very often isn't even included in the peer groups that sell side analysts compile, despite PKI being a key player in this industry. If PKI's COVID-19 tests put the company on the radar, then maybe PKI will soon be rewarded with a multiple more in line with its peers.PerkinElmer is one of those companies whose transformation went unnoticed by the market. A smart M&A strategy and exposure to secular growth industries have transformed the financial profile of PerkinElmer from a 3-4% organic growth business to a 5-6% organic growth business. This growth is supported by several tailwinds that we explained throughout the article: a shift to gene editing, the rise in autoimmune diseases, expanding the new-born screening assays in emerging markets, new product launches, etc. This makes that the growth is truly high-quality since it is not only significant in terms of quantum, but also highly diversified in terms of drivers.Given the fact that management is very confident that it can meaningfully improve both the operating margin and the free cash flow conversion, we believe that PKI can compound EPS at a double-digit CAGR in the coming years.PKI has not received that same generous trading multiple that the market has given to other diagnostics players but the recent COVID-19 tests developed by PerkinElmer may force some investors and sell-side analysts to review their stance on the company.While we do not believe that the stock is cheap, we have high conviction that this is an attractive entry point for investors with a 5+ year horizon."
4320040,24361,2020-01-30T00:31:02-05:00,"PerkinElmer's fourth-quarter results and 2020 guidance were okay, but a high-teens forward EBITDA multiple should demand more than just ""okay""EUROIMMUN, lab informatics, and food testing continue to grow nicely, with Vanadis as a wild-card with significant upside.PerkinElmer is fine as a company, but it's hard to reconcile the underlying performance with the valuation beyond ""it's life sciences.""","For a company with rich expectations embedded into the valuation, I’d say the reaction to fourth-quarter earnings and 2020 guidance from PerkinElmer (PKI) was fairly restrained. The stock has weakened a bit since earnings, but only after an impressive climb from under $80 in early October to over $100 around the time of the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference.There are certainly attractive growth opportunities in front of PerkinElmer. I see good potential in the Chinese food testing market, the U.S. market for EUROIMMUN, and in the company’s vision of end-to-end solutions for highly-regulated industries. Vanadis could also be a real winner, given its potential value-for-performance argument. The “but” is that a lot of that already seems to be in the share price. Double-digit EBITDA and FCF growth are appealing, but shouldn’t you expect that from a stock already trading at more than 17x forward EBITDA?PerkinElmer didn’t have a bad fourth quarter by any means, but if you were looking for a strong beat-and-raise quarter, you didn’t get that. Instead, you got a bit of a beat and guidance that basically bracketed existing expectations.Revenue rose more than 6% and closer to 4.5% on a days-adjusted organic basis. That was slightly better than expected, and the performance between the major units was balanced. Both Discovery and Analytical Solutions (or DAS) and Diagnostics grew around 5% in organic terms, or around 4.5% in days-adjusted organic terms. Both segments did a little better than expected, with a slight lean towards DAS as the greater outperformer.Within DAS, environmental and industrial were weak, while lab informatics and food were both up double-digits. Diagnostics saw low-single-digit growth in reproductive health, a high single-digit decline in genomics (with a continued impact from a major facility move), and low-double-digit growth in immunodiagnostics, with mid-teens growth from EUROIMMUN.Margins were a little better than expected, with gross margin improved 100bp yoy as reported and 110bp adjusted. Adjusted EBITDA rose 17%, and operating income rose a similar amount, with 210bp of margin improvement. By segment, DAS was the stronger performer, with 25% segment income growth and 320bp of margin improvement against Diagnostics’ nearly 6% growth and 40bp of margin improvement.For the full year, free cash flow was a little light (though still up almost a third yoy), with working capital pinching free cash flow once again. Working capital management has been a long-standing issue with PerkinElmer; luckily life sciences companies don’t trade all that tightly to FCF performance (at least in the short term).Contributing virtually nothing now, Vanadis (the company’s lower-cost non-invasive prenatal testing technology) represents a significant potential revenue driver down the road, but one with significant uncertainty over future adoption rates. Theoretically, the system can produce results nearly as good as sequencing-based methodologies (from the likes of Illumina (ILMN) and others) but at a fraction of the cost (that fraction being around one-third in most cases).The company placed another nine systems in the fourth quarter, but with 28 in place the company missed its full-year goal of 30. Still, at full capacity, that small number of systems could support upwards of $60 million in revenue (at an ASP of EUR 100/test).PerkinElmer intends to participate in tenders in Europe in 2020, but the read-out of the VALUE study in mid-2020 could be a significant driver for good or ill. Run by the Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island, this 2,650-pregnancy study is the first independent study of note to explore the Vanadis approach, and success (high accuracy) should significantly improve the market proposition given that only company-sponsored/generated data has been available so far.Where companies like Thermo Fisher (TMO) and Danaher (DHR) that used to once focus on scientific and life sciences instruments have shifted towards bioproduction, PerkinElmer has shifted more towards informatics, lab management solutions, and overall workflow solutions for customers in highly-regulated industries like biopharma and diagnostics and increasingly-regulated areas like food safety.Both informatics and lab management services tend to be high-margin businesses with significant, sticky, recurring revenue. This isn’t PerkinElmer’s market all to itself. Thermo, Waters (WAT) and Agilent (A) compete here as well, but due diligence calls would suggest that PerkinElmer is at the very least well-liked by customers (something seldom said about Agilent’s service operations).PerkinElmer’s new CEO has laid out a vision for what I’d call largely incremental improvements. PerkinElmer is an “is what it is” company, and investors should not expect transformative M&A or major strategy shifts. Vanadis is probably the biggest wildcard at this point, while the growth opportunities in immunodiagnostics, food testing (particularly in China) and lab services look more reliable.Nothing in the fourth-quarter results or guidance lead me to major changes in my modeling, though I have cut back my near-term FCF margin assumptions – the potential to do better on FCF margins is certainly there, but this is a “show me” story for now. As is, I’m expecting double-digit EBITDA growth in 2020 and 2021 and 2022 has a chance of making it three in a row (technically five in a row, as PerkinElmer has two 10%-plus growth years behind it now).I’m looking for low-to-mid-teens FCF growth and I believe PerkinElmer’s strong margins can support a mid-teens forward EV/EBITDA, but none of that works today to drive a compelling fair value relative to today’s price.If I’m going to overpay for growth, I want something transformative – something like Repligen (RGEN) – and not really something like PerkinElmer. I realize that life science tools and services companies live in their own valuation world, and the higher valuations are not entirely undeserved, but I need to see more than modest outperformance before feeling comfortable paying up for PKI shares."
4152845,24361,2018-03-06T07:45:00-05:00,"PerkinElmer is benefiting from strong tool and consumable demand in its biopharma and academic markets, as well as ongoing growth in food safety and environmental testing.A pivot towards more diagnostics and life sciences services should not only support growth but also make that growth less cyclical and higher-margin.Low double-digit FCF growth can support a high single-digit expected return today, and PKI seems willing and able to deploy more capital into growth M&A in diagnostics, services, and safety.","These are good times for PerkinElmer (PKI). The life sciences/pharma tool market is about as strong as it has ever been, and the company's pivot toward diagnostics and services should pay off in the years to come in the form of more revenue stability and better margins. If management can reverse a pretty uninspiring historical trend of underwhelming M&A integration and missing long-term revenue and margin targets, the future could be pretty bright for this company.The fourth quarter of 2017 saw pretty much every major life sciences tool company beat their average sell-side revenue estimate, and high single-digit to low double-digit growth in the pharmaceutical market was basically the norm. All told, this was the strongest quarterly performance for the sector in over four years. For its part, PerkinElmer reported low double-digit revenue growth in the biopharma segment, as part of nearly 7% overall organic growth in its Discovery and Analytical Solutions (or DAS) segment.There are a lot of drivers fueling demand for equipment that go beyond ""budget flush"" (a phenomenon where companies and labs use up their remaining budgets in the fourth quarter, leading to a seasonal surge in orders and revenue). The growing use of biologics, including immuno-oncology and autoimmune drugs, is leading to stronger demand for processing and production equipment, as is the early growth of biosimilars, and this looks set to continue for many years to come (you can look at the number of drugs in pipelines ending in ""-mab"" to see what I mean).This is a bigger driver for competitors like Agilent (A), Thermo Fisher (TMO), and Waters (WAT) relative to PerkinElmer, as they generate around 15% of revenue (for Agilent and Thermo) to close to 50% (for Waters) of revenue from production-related biopharma spending, but healthy sales drive more R&D, where PerkinElmer is stronger.Although there has been ample criticism of drug companies using the recent U.S. tax cut to buy back shares instead of reinvest in research and development, R&D spending continues to grow - at a low single-digit rate for most of the larger entities and at a mid-single-digit rate overall (sometimes into the high single digits in stronger years). Venture capital funding also continues to flow into the biopharma sector, and that supports a healthy demand outlook for companies with meaningful research spending exposure like Agilent and PerkinElmer.It's not just the biopharma sector that will drive ongoing demand growth for PerkinElmer. The academic market is a significant one (around 10% of sales, which is typical for the space), and the spending outlook is healthy for the U.S., Japan, and China. I would especially keep an eye on China, as that country is investing considerable resources in life sciences research and PerkinElmer already has a meaningful China business (around 15% of sales). As Chinese labs become more significant in academic publishing and as Chinese biopharma companies start to play a larger role in the pharmaceutical market, I expect significant demand growth in the tools and consumables that PerkinElmer supplies and I wouldn't rule out the possibility of M&A interest down the road (though likely not under the current U.S. administration) as China looks to build up its domestic capabilities.Although PerkinElmer has a solid business in analytical tools and instruments (and corresponding consumables), management has made a concerted effort to increase the company's exposure to diagnostics and service opportunities outside of the biopharma and academic markets. These businesses tend to be less cyclical and often offer better margins, making it a worthwhile area for PerkinElmer to try to grow.On the diagnostics side, this area is now about 40% of the company's mix after the EUROIMMUN deal in 2017. PerkinElmer has a cornerstone legacy business in newborn screening, a roughly $450 million to $500 million market where it holds more than two-thirds global market share. Screening newborns in the U.S. is not a growth business, but it is in many emerging markets. China already screens about 90% of its newborns, but only conducts 2 to 4 tests (versus more than 10 in Western Europe and 40 in the U.S.), while only 5% of newborns in India are screened at all. As economic growth improves, countries tend to invest more in these initiatives, and I believe this can be a worthwhile, steady grower for PerkinElmer as countries expand testing both in terms of the number of infants screened and the number of tests included in the screening.With EUROIMMUN in hand, PerkinElmer has significantly increased its exposure to diagnostics and its growth potential. EUROIMMUN is a global leader in autoimmune testing (a market with high single-digit growth potential), with a broader array of products than well-known global diagnostics players like Abbott (ABT) and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), and it is also significantly leveraged to the very large infectious disease market (a $7 billion market where it has very low single-digit share) and the fast-growing allergy testing market.Importantly, EUROIMMUN already generates close to half of its revenue in China, with minimal exposure to the U.S. - giving PerkinElmer more exposure to the Chinese market in the short term and the opportunity to grow EUROIMMUN's business in the U.S. over the long-term. I'd also note that there are product improvement opportunities here. While EUROIMMUN uses lower-cost technologies like ELISA in its tests, many of its products are labor-intensive - creating an automation opportunity for PerkinElmer down the road and a market segmentation opportunity where EUROIMMUN can sell more labor-intensive tests in markets where lab labor is cheaper and (eventually) more automated tests in markets where lab labor is more dear.On the service side, PerkinElmer has been investing considerable resources to build and support its OneSource multi-vendor lab management service operation. This business is built around making life easier for biopharma and academic labs - traditionally, many equipment vendors (Agilent, Thermo, Danaher (DHR) and so on) would only service their own equipment, meaning that large labs would have to spend considerable effort coordinating their maintenance and repair needs. What PerkinElmer offers is a one-stop service where it will maintain and repair equipment regardless of who made it, as well as providing other services like data management, compliance, and staffing management.While this is a growth opportunity, it is not exclusive to PerkinElmer. Other tool manufacturers, including Agilent, Thermo, Mettler Toledo (MTD), and Waters have similar service offerings, but PerkinElmer tries to differentiate itself on the breadth of services it offers, as well as the quality and price/value of those services (something that rivals like Agilent have struggled with historically).PerkinElmer's growth outlook may be driven in large part by biopharma, academic research, and diagnostics, but about one-quarter of the business falls outside those categories. In particular, PerkinElmer is exposed to food and environmental testing and industrial instrumentation.Food safety has been an attractive market for some time now, with companies like Neogen (NEOG) and 3M (MMM) doing well for themselves. PerkinElmer has a strong business in food quality analysis (including measuring things like the protein or water content of grain) as well as food safety, and I believe this remains an attractive market with growth potential well above GDP growth. Food safety is an area of concern around the world, with the U.S. still seeing frequent contamination outbreaks and countries like China experiencing numerous cases of tainted/adulterated goods - so much so that many supermarket chains actively test foods as part of their efforts to compete on customer service. Environmental testing is likewise still a growth market, as governments and other entities look to monitor signs of contamination or pollution in the air, water, and soil.On the industrial side, PerkinElmer has an often-overlooked business selling instruments used in the production of a wide range of chemicals, petrochemicals, polymers, and electronics products. While Agilent has more exposure overall to the chemical/energy markets, PerkinElmer's is large enough to give it some leverage to the ongoing recovery cycle in chemical and energy markets.I see multiple growth drivers for PerkinElmer over the next three to five years. Spending from the biopharma industry and academic labs should support healthy growth for tools and consumables, and I believe the OneSource opportunity can grow above the overall market growth rate. I also expect the pivot towards diagnostics to drive more growth, particularly as PerkinElmer is targeting faster-growing markets outside of North America and the EU.I also expect further M&A from the company. PerkinElmer's M&A track record is mixed (at best), but management has already highlighted opportunities in reproductive health (prenatal and postnatal screening), food safety, biopharma services, and emerging market diagnostics. Food safety, services, and emerging market diagnostics, in particular, would all seem to offer up small, easily-digestible deals where PerkinElmer can gain ""niche"" exposures at affordable prices with less integration risk.Although I do expect M&A, PerkinElmer isn't the sort of serial acquirer where I'll include M&A into my model. As is, though, I believe long-term growth on the high end of ""mid-single digits"" is plausible. I also expect the company's efforts to improve its mix toward more high-margin business and leverage recent ""lean manufacturing"" initiatives to start paying off. Management has a track record of missing its revenue growth and margin targets, but the recent trend in margins (from mid-teens at the start of 2017 to over 20% at the end) does give some credibility to the near-term target of 22% operating margin and longer-term goals in the mid-to-high 20%'s. With that, I believe FCF margins will move into the mid-to-high teens (from a recent trend in the low double-digits and a longer-term trend in the mid-to-high single digits), supporting low-teens annualized free cash flow growth.I'm used to life sciences companies trading at rich multiples, but PerkinElmer's valuation isn't so bad. Although the shares are trading above my buy zone, the implied returns are still in the high single digits. Given the underlying end-market momentum and the long-term positive growth drivers PerkinElmer has in place, it's an okay prospect to buy today, though I'd really prefer to buy in the $60's if that opportunity should arise over the next six to 12 months.Thank you for reading this Seeking Alpha PRO+ article.

4211630,47521,2018-10-15T10:11:18-04:00,"Global cannabis testing market expected to grow at a CAGR of 13.2% through 2026, according to Coherent Market Insights.Why I think that may be understating the potential growth rate.Why the cannabis testing market could help it outperform over the next few years, making it my top pick in the pick-and-shovel segment.","source: company websitePerkinElmer, Inc. (PKI) has been a consistent performer over the last five years, gradually moving up in value until October 2016, when it caught a bid and jumped from almost $51.00 per share to over $98.00 per share not long ago, after it reported strong earnings and upwardly revised its outlook in its latest earnings report.It has pulled back since the high to about $86.00 per share as I write, but I believe it has a solid growth narrative going for it that the market isn't pricing in at this time.The major catalyst I'm referring to is the cannabis testing market, which is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2 percent through 2026, according to one source. The global cannabis testing market in 2017 was valued at approximately $925.3 million.The company sees the cannabis industry as being the subject of increased regulations in order to protect the end-users from any harm, or unintentionally misrepresenting what is in the final product offered for sale.It also sees the evolving regulations requiring the need to use the best instruments and support to test the cannabis in order to ensure companies meet the rules of the various jurisdictions. It sees cannabis testing as a key component of the success of businesses competing in the sector, and has positioned itself to take advantage of the expected growth over the next seven years or so.PerkinElmer, Inc. develops products and services for markets needing solutions for diagnostics, environmental, industrial, laboratory services, life sciences research, and food safety.The company operates via two segments: Discovery and Analytical Solutions, and Diagnostics. Its cannabis testing business is enfolded into Discovery and Analytical Solutions.Within its cannabis testing unit it has several instruments it offers for accurate measurements of a number of elements that are required by various jurisdictions. Among them are QSight 220, FLEXAR HPLC, Clarus SQ8 and TurboMatrix, and NexION 2000 and Titan MPS.source: company websiteQSight 220 tests for ""compounds in different sample matrices; FLEXAR HPLC deals with ""chromoatographic separation and quantitative monitoring of primary cannabinoids""; Clarus SQ8 and TurboMatrix combine to provide more accuracy and time savings in the analyzation process; and NexION 2000 and Titan MPS together test for ""nutritional and toxic elements"" in cannabis.There is a rapidly growing demand for accurate testing and results in the cannabis market. While it appears the marijuana market is like the wild west because of media coverage and skyrocketing valuations, the reality is there are an increasing number of requirements in various Canadian provinces, states in America, and other nations around the world that are embracing pot at the medicinal or recreational level, and sometimes both.With more regional governments approving of cannabis, each one may have differing legal requirements that must be met in order to sell cannabis there. For that reason, PerkinElmer, Inc. has a lot of potential growth in the sector, and is positioned well to garner a significant portion of the cannabis testing market.Revenue in the second quarter finished at $704 million, up 29 percent year-over-year. Organic growth was 10 percent. The remaining 19 percent in revenue growth came from a 3 percent boost from foreign exchange and 16 percent from acquisitions. Its organic growth accounted for the surge in its share price immediately after the earnings report.Earnings per share was $0.91, beating estimates by $0.05. The EPS performance was primarily from organic growth, which was up by $0.06, but offset by an unfavorable foreign exchange of <$0.01>.Breaking it down, Diagnostics accounted for 40 percent of revenue and the largest end market of the company. Ten percent of sales in the unit was organic. Key growth catalysts there were reproductive health, genomics and immunodiagnostics.Discovery & Analytical Solutions accounted for the remaining 60 percent of overall sales, which also grew approximately 10 percent organically in the second quarter. Driving the performance in D&A was Life Sciences, which grew its organic revenue in the double digits. Life Sciences competes in academic government and pharma biotech end markets.At the end of the quarter the company had about $2 billion in debt and $163 million in cash. Net debt to adjusted EBITDA at quarter end was 3.2x. By the end of 2018 the company guides for it to drop below 3.0x.Full-year revenue is expected to be about $2.78 billion, with sales from EUROIMMUN accounting for about $370 million, and favorable tailwinds from foreign exchange representing another $30 million.The major takeaway for me from the earnings report is the company is starting to grow in a number of the segments it competes in, and much of what cannabis testing offers has yet to have a significant impact on the numbers. The key to my thesis is the company will have to continue to grow its other businesses as it targets the cannabis testing market. If it were to stumble on its other businesses, it could grow in cannabis but not boost its overall performance. I don't see that happening, but it is a possibility.As mentioned earlier, the global cannabis testing market in 2017 was valued at close to $925.3 million, with an expected CAGR of up to 13.2 percent over the next 7 to 8 years. I've seen other reports point to CAGR being between 11 percent to 12 percent, but nothing under 11 percent. Assuming the higher end of projections, it would mean the cannabis testing market would be between $3 billion to $4 billion by 2026. I think this is probably understating the potential.My reasoning for that is there is going to continue to be a number of countries and states in America that approve of medical and/or recreational marijuana. With the accompanying strict guidelines for approval to sell it to various market segments, it suggests to me the potential for cannabis testing is likely to grow much quicker and larger than the market is looking for at this time.In April 2018 a report from Grand View Research the legal cannabis market will be worth about $146.4 billion by 2025. By then it sees medical marijuana's value climbing to $100.03 billion. It estimates CAGR for the legal U.S. pot market to grow at a hefty pace of 24.9 percent from 2017 through 2025.Again, all of that will require the cannabis to be carefully and accurately tested for a variety of reasons,As for cannabis testing itself, among the things being tested for are the concentration of active ingredients, such as cannabinoids, for one example; that helps measure the potency of cannabis for medical purposes.Other tests look for residue of any type of pesticide. Various government jurisdictions have different legal standards.Another thing tests determine are whether or not there are mycotoxin contaminants in the cannabis, such as bacteria and fungi, among other potentially harmful things like mercury, leads or arsenic, which would have a negative effect on the health of those consuming cannabis.Confirming specific species of cannabis is another reason for testing. Ensuring it's authentic and represents the beneficial amount of a specific active ingredient is important to the adoption of marijuana by a growing number of consumers and health professionals. Since it's vital to develop trust with legal cannabis, I believe companies and end markets will buy more testing products and services in order to offer that as a selling point to users. This will always be important, but it will be especially vital in the early years of acceptance as a medical and recreational alternative to other products and markets competing with cannabis.With PerkinElmer having operations in 130 countries, it's already geographically positioned to boost revenue from this rapidly growing industry. Combined with the upwardly revised outlook for cannabis demand from some analysts, which I agree with, I think the cannabis testing market is being underrated.With laws mandating compulsory cannabis quality control testing, the question isn't whether or not demand for testing will continue, but how much the demand will be in the years ahead as more markets give legal status to cannabis.Also be aware that government standards not only can differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but they can rapidly change within jurisdictions. That means that companies able to rapidly adapt their existing products and services to those changing market conditions, will be the big winners. PerkinElmer has already proven it can do that with the equipment it has in place for other industries it tests for.For many years PerkinElmer built its business and brand on machines or tools that use a variety of sensors to accurately perform a variety of industrial tests. At its core, it's able to re-purpose the existing machines and adapt them for cannabis. That means a quick response to changing market demands and conditions, along with lower costs. That could be a huge competitive advantage and moat over the next several years.An example of a superior product PerkinElmer offers in the cannabis segment is its QSight instrument.Talking about the product, Mark Greenbaum, PerkinElmer’s QSight Sales Leader for North America, said this about the breakthrough QSight offers in cannabis testing, because of the makeup of marijuana itself.He noted:Greenbaum added that the StayClean™ technology associated with QSight ""uses hot-surface-induced desolvation (HSID™), a sampling interface that never needs cleaning, resulting in about 15% more uptime than conventional systems."" He also stated that “Usually it would take hours to clean a traditional triple quad MS/MS. Juniper’s QSight instrument ... has been on line for over 8 months and has not yet required cleaning due to StayClean™ technology.”Another powerful feature of the instrument is its ability to analyze all pesticides in a single run. In the case of Oregon, it mandates that companies test to detect and quantify 59 pesticides. With QSight, it can analyze all 59 of those pesticides in one run, according to Greenbaum.The combination of its StayClean technology with QSight and its ability to analyze large numbers of pesticides with one run, makes it a significant player in the cannabis testing market. It also appears it should be able to rapidly adapt to any other changing guidelines or requirements that may unfold. Being among the market leaders in response time is a powerful competitive advantage for PerkinElmer when considering what's at stake for cannabis companies needing to prove the quality of their cannabis and their adherence to government guidelines in order to get the go ahead to sell it in various markets.The company is putting together a comprehensive and exhaustive strategy for the cannabis sector. I see it as second to none among its peers.Among its major competitors are Agilent Technologies, Inc., GenTech Scientific, Pharm Labs, LLC, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.For some time PerkinElmer has been growing steadily but incrementally. Recently it has shown it may have turned the corner and started to accelerate its growth. A key part of that going forward is its cannabis testing business.That said, my thesis is based upon the assumption its other major businesses will continue to grow in the years ahead, and when combined with my conclusion being the cannabis market is being underestimated as to its growth potential in the short and long term, I think all other things being equal, PerkinElmer has the strong probability to surprise to the upside over the next several years.With its revenue guidance of $2.8 billion for 2018, it's easy to see that cannabis testing sales could be a major catalyst for growth if it's able to capture meaningful market share. Since recreational pot in Canada is about to be put into effect, and other countries and U.S. states approving of medical and recreational pot, the demand for accurate testing is going to increase for many years before it starts to level off.PerkinElmer is positioned to be a market leader in this relatively new segment, which should help it drive growth in the future.I believe the cannabis and the associated testing market are going to outperform many of the former projections. If that's how it plays out, I see PerkinElmer significantly outperforming current expectations. Even in a more modest scenario it will still do very well if it's able to continue to grow in its core segments.To me PerkinElmer is among the top pick and shovel plays in the cannabis sector, and would be a great addition to those wanting a more visible but less volatile play in the cannabis market."
4169806,24361,2018-05-04T10:42:15-04:00,"Underlying mid-single-digit organic revenue growth stacks up a little weak next to ThermoFisher and Danaher, but the EUROIMMUN diagnostics business is growing nicely.Academic and biopharma markets seem healthy, but food, environmental, and industrial have slowed.PerkinElmer still looks capable of double-digit long-term FCF growth and high single-digit shareholder returns, but it's not a clear-cut buy.","It has been a so-so year thus far for PerkinElmer (PKI), and that has been true for many other life sciences companies as well. Thermo Fisher (TMO) and Danaher (DHR) have been stronger (with just under double-digit returns year to date), but Waters (WAT) and Mettler Toledo (MTD) have been weaker, and PerkinElmer has at least kept pace with the S&P 500.While I like PerkinElmer's biopharma, diagnostics, and food safety businesses for the long term, the underlying performance for 2018 looks like it is on pace for ""good, not great"". With the shares trading a little below my typical hurdle rate but still offering a high single-digit estimated annualized return, I'd call this is a ""high-interest hold"" at this point.All told, PerkinElmer's first quarter was okay. While management talked of pro forma organic revenue growth of 6%, that's not the typical way organic revenue growth is calculated and the usual method results in a growth rate a little above 4% - basically in line with expectations. That 4% growth figure was also weaker than the 7% growth posted by Thermo and the better than 5% posted by Danaher, while Waters posted just 2% growth this quarter.Diagnostics revenue was up a little under 4% on an organic basis, but EUROIMMUN continues to grow at a mid-teens internal organic rate and pushed the Diagnostics growth rate over 7% if you accept/use management's pro forma methodology. While the applied genomics business was a little weak on a tougher comp, the infectious disease business remains strong. Segment earnings rose 16%, with a greater than eight point year-over-year reduction in margin as EUROIMMUN is brought into the fold.The Discovery and Analytical Solutions business (or DAS) saw organic growth just a bit under 5%. Biopharma remained strong here, with revenue up in the high single digits, though ThermoFisher reported double-digit growth in this category. Academic end-markets picked up a little momentum sequentially (up yoy at a mid-single-digit rate), while food slowed (still up mid-single-digits) and industrial and environmental were both noticeably weaker on a sequential basis, with environmental still up mid-single-digits, but industrial down 1% on order timing and weaker revenue from customers in the chemical sector. Margin expanded 50bp, with segment income rising 13%.It's not just the traditional industrial stocks that are exposed to growing concerns about slowing end-markets. Most life science tool companies have some exposure to industrial end-markets, with that exposure ranging from around 15% to 20% at Thermo to around 30% at PerkinElmer and Danaher to upwards of 45% to 50% at Agilent (A) and Mettler Toledo.Oil/gas and chemical companies typically make up the bulk of this exposure, with companies using these tools to characterize test samples and production, maintain quality control, and develop/test new products and production techniques. On the whole, the takeaway from most companies exposed to the petrochemical sector has been that demand is still quite healthy, with companies making up for lost time and spending to keep up with production growth. Even so, weakening PMI trends in the U.S. and Europe are a modest concern at this point.Revenue growth from PerkinElmer's food business decelerated somewhat from the fourth quarter, but this remains an attractive long-term business to watch. Emerging market food producers are increasingly investing in testing to reassure consumers and support/build their brand reputation (many supermarkets in China commission their own food safety testing as a competitive service differentiator), and PerkinElmer already enjoys good market footholds in markets like China and India. I'd also note the possibility of longer-term growth in the U.S., as the U.S. tests only a tiny fraction of food imports (versus Japan which tests virtually 100%).With the EUROIMMUN deal done, not to mention the acquisition of Tulip in India, PerkinElmer has made significant investments in building up its diagnostics business. Given how well diagnostics have performed for companies like Abbott (ABT) and Danaher over the years, this looks like a rational strategic decision. Moreover, I believe EUROIMMUN and Tulip are both growth assets, leveraged as they are to China and India respectively, and with good growth potential in autoimmune, infectious disease, and allergy testing. I believe autoimmune and allergy testing in particular can be significant growth opportunities in China, as rising standards of living are bringing more attention to these issues (which are perhaps being exacerbated by China's air pollution issues).PerkinElmer also has a reasonably strong position in life sciences R&D, and funding for biomedical research at both the academic and biopharma levels looks reasonably healthy today. If there were one area I might like to see PerkinElmer build up, it would be in bioproduction - tools, equipment, consumables, and services used to produce biological products like antibodies. There are over 100 biosimilars in development for just the top seven biological drugs on the market, and I believe bioproduction is going to offer good growth for the next decade as biosimilars take off. Still, given PerkinElmer's recent investments in diagnostics and its current liquidity situation, this likely won't be a near-term priority.Also, on the subject of diagnostics, I'd note that a feasibility test of PerkinElmer's Vanadis non-invasive prenatal test assay for T21 was published in Nature in March. This study showed better than a 99% sensitivity rate with a high selectivity rate as well (only 0.15% false positives). Although encouraging, it would seem that the small group of women tested had an unusually high overall prevalence rate of T21 making wonder whether this was an artificially enriched sample group. I'd also note that while the technology should be applicable to other trisomies, only T21 was tested.It's hard to say at this point how big the Vanadis test could be. I know some bullish analysts think it is a $1 billion-plus opportunity, but I think PerkinElmer is likely to price this at a meaningful discount to other next-gen NIPT tests, and it will likely be most successful in China and Europe. I'd also note that, as far as I understand, the test has to be run on PKI's Operetta imaging system - an expensive system that may limit uptake when competing systems use Illumina's (ILMN) NextSeq and/or MiSeq (which can also run many other tests).I'm mostly just fine-tuning my estimates at this point for PerkinElmer, and I still believe that long-term revenue growth around 6% a year and long-term FCF growth in the low double-digits is plausible. With a 9% discount rate, that gets me to a fair value of about $68 - just a little under today's price, but still offering high single-digit expected returns.I'm not in a rush to buy PerkinElmer. I think the EUROIMMUN and Tulip deals will definitely improve the company's long-term growth profile, and I'm bullish as well on the OneSource lab management service business. But with some potential challenges in growth/margins for 2018 and with the recent weakness in the market bringing many stocks back to more interesting valuations, I'm inclined to wait for a better opportunity."
4376584,24361,2020-09-28T08:00:08-04:00,"COVID-19 has driven a sharp upturn in demand for PerkinElmer's ImmunoDiagnostic and Applied Genomics products, including RT-PCR kits, automated systems, and reagents.
        COVID-19 is likely to have a noticeable impact on birth rates, hurting the newborn screening business in 2021-2023.
        Lab demand for PCR kits should remain strong a while longer, and I believe PerkinElmer has won some new long-term business from this crisis.
        With PerkinElmer likely to hold at least a piece of the windfall, I've boosted my revenue and FCF growth expectations, but it's not enough to drive an attractive fair value.","It may be indelicate to talk about beneficiaries of a deadly global pandemic, but the reality is that COVID-19 has created an unexpected surge in business for many life sciences companies. In the case of PerkinElmer (PKI), while the recent demand for real-time PCR workstations and kits, liquid handling systems, RNA extraction kits, and so on will fade, I believe the company may hold on to some long-term benefits, as customers have now seen what EUROIMMUN tools can do, and some will likely become long-term customers.I expect at least a few more quarters of double-digit year-over-year revenue growth, and I’ve boosted my long-term revenue assumptions such that my long-term revenue growth rate moves up about a half-point to 6%. Longer-term opportunities remain in newborn testing (Vanadis), lab automation, lab informatics, and the OneSource management service, as well as EUROIMMUN test menu expansion. PerkinElmer is still not cheap by any standard approach, as is often the case with life sciences companies.At over 10% of revenue, newborn screening is both a significant business and a significant growth opportunity, but business has declined at a mid-single-digit rate in the last two quarters. I believe the first quarter was impacted by the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in the large Chinese market, and that impact has since intensified.Thus far, data from most developed economies indicates that COVID-19 is having a notice negative impact on pregnancies and projected near-term birthrates, as worries about infection, economic instability, and so on prove to be meaningful disincentives. The Brookings Institute has estimated that births could decline by 300,000 to 500,000 in the U.S. next year (a 10% decline at the midpoint), and the South China Morning Post has speculated that China could see a 900,000 decline in 2021 (a roughly 6% decline).That sort of decline would clearly have an impact on PerkinElmer’s testing business, given its significant global share. While the company could still see some uplift from an expanded testing menu in some markets and increased SMA testing in the U.S., the headwind is still real. On a more positive note, management has indicated that interest in the new Vanadis system remains strong, though installations have been frozen so far by the COVID-19 lockdowns.Where I believe PerkinElmer could see the biggest long-term benefit from the pandemic is in accelerating the growth of its EUROIMMUN business. With research and testing labs scrambling to get whatever equipment they could as quickly as possible, PerkinElmer has been able to put a range of equipment (RNA extraction kits, PCR workstations, automated liquid handling systems, et al) into the hands of new users.Many of these customers will go back to whomever they used before the pandemic, but management has noted winning some new business through this emergency, and the hurdle for adoption of new systems like the Axentis random access platform (coming out later this year or early next year) should be lower. Likewise, I believe PerkinElmer has won some business in areas like next-gen sequencing reagents that it will keep beyond the pandemic.It’s also fair to note that the demand for life science tools won’t disappear overnight. It seems fair to assume that population screening will remain necessary even after a vaccine (to assess the efficacy of the vaccine, among other things), and there will likewise be kits and tools needed by the numerous companies still working on therapeutics and vaccines for the virus.While the pandemic has provided a welcome bump for PerkinElmer, helping offset the double-digit decline it has seen in its non-COVID-19 business, it won’t fundamentally change the story for the long term. Yes, I believe the company is picking up some business in ImmunoDiagnostics and Applied Genomics that it will keep long term, but I don’t see that being enough to change the long-term trajectory of the business.With that boost, I expect long-term revenue growth closer to 6%. I likewise still expect a meaningful uplift in margin and FCF margin from 2019 to 2024 – margin was up eight points in the second quarter, and while that won’t be the new normal, it does highlight the positive impact of growth in the ImmunoDx and Applied Genomics segments on the overall business.Unfortunately, the mid-teens long-term annualized free cash flow I expect from PerkinElmer isn’t enough to really support a strong target price, and that’s a common issue in life sciences. So, I’m not all that surprised that the prospective long-term annualized total return appears to be on the high end of the mid-single-digits. That’s not terrible, and there could be some upside from greater adoption for Vanadis, EUROIMMUN, and OneSource, but it’s not enough to encourage me to buy today."
4083175,25120,2017-06-22T08:39:14-04:00,"PerkinElmer has made a great deal with the $1.3 billion acquisition of EUROIMMUN.While the deal does not come cheap, relative multiples look similar as this deal will provide diversification and a big boost to organic growth.I understand why investors like the deal, as the overall valuation has gotten a bit steep while leverage is quite high as well.Any sell-off to market-equivalent multiples, which translates into a $60 valuation, creates a buying opportunity in my eyes.","PerkinElmer (PKI) continues to shuffle around its portfolio. After selling its medical imaging business to Varex Imaging (VREX) earlier this year, PerkinElmer is now acquiring EUROIMMUN in what appears to be a great deal.Investors seem to like the deal as well given the price action of Perkin´s shares which rose to fresh highs. While I really like the portfolio shuffle which the company has made, I am hesitant to jump into the shares at these levels given the fact that shares trade at a decent premium based on forward adjusted earnings, and leverage ratios stands at fairly elevated levels. If shares re-test the low sixties, I will start buying into the much improved growth story.Portfolio TransformationPerkinElmer has reached an agreement to acquire German-based EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics in a $1.3 billion all cash deal.EUROIMMUN focuses on autoimmune testing as well as tests for infectious diseases and allergies. These tests deliver $310 million in annual sales as the five year CAGR just comes in short to an impressive 20% annual growth number. A key driver of this has been China which is responsible for nearly half of sales, as 30% of revenues are generated in the European home market. On the deal call, Perkin´s executives praise the speed at which the company brings products to markets, and thereby is able to catch emerging trends.With the deal, PerkinElmer will gain expertise into autoimmune and allergy diagnostic markets and significantly increase exposure to China. Given this positioning and the solid growth, the 4.2 times sales multiple looks pretty reasonable. As a result of the relative appealing price, PerkinElmer sees non-GAAP earnings per share accretion to the tune of $0.28-$0.30 per share in 2018. On the call management indicated that adjusted EBITDA of the acquired activities will amount to $70 million this year which combined with an asset-light model and cheap cost of financing allows for this kind of accretion.This deal is substantially larger than the $276 million divestiture of the medical imaging business to Varex, in a deal which sheds $140 million in annual revenues. This deal, which was announced late in 2016, closed in the second quarter.Adding Growth To A Technology LeaderPerkinElmer is a very well-established business which operates across the globe despite the ¨modest¨ revenue base of $2.1 billion, with significant presence in Asia and Europe. The purchase of EUROIMMUNE will only improve this diversification in terms of geographical exposure as well as across the two main segments of the company.PerkinElmer is mostly organized under its discovery & analytical solutions business which generates $1.5 billion in sales. This business derives little over half its sales from life sciences, as food, environment and industrial end markets make up for the remainder of the sales. The strong positioning in this segment is driven by imaging, detection, software and service capabilities driven by PerkinElmer´s strong IP position, brands and good relationships.Typical products include chromatographs, sample introduction systems, atomic spectroscopy instruments, as well as organic elemental analyzers, among others.The other segment is the diagnostics business following 2016s restructuring. This $602 million business (based on 2016 revenues) provides early detection for genetic disorders from pregnancy to early childhood, as well as infectious disease testing. This segment furthermore included the flat panel X-ray detectors, the $140 million business which is now sold to Varex. In this article on Varex, I estimated the EBITDA power of the X-ray business at around $25 million, a fraction of the annualized EBITDA of $380 million in 2016 for all of PerkinElmer.What About The Asset Shuffles?PerkinElmer posted 4% organic growth in Q1 of 2017, driven by 2% organic growth in the discovery & analytical solutions business and solid 8% growth in the diagnostics segment.The company ended the quarter with $288 million in cash and $1.06 billion in debt, for a net debt load of roughly $770 million. If we take into account the $276 million proceeds for the X-ray business and account for the $1.3 billion acquisition, net debt will increase to $1.8 billion.The core business posted annualized EBITDA of $380 million in 2016. If we account for 5% organic growth, this number rises to $400 million. After subtracting $25 million estimated EBITDA of the X-ray business, and taking into account $70 million in EBITDA from EUROIMMUN, the pro-forma number rises to $450 million. With $1.8 billion in net debt, leverage ratios are pretty steep at 4 times. On the bright side, cash flow generation is solid and the underlying businesses are growing at a stable rate.The company guided for 2017 earnings of $2.80-2.90 per share, but note that these are adjusted earnings with GAAP earnings seen $0.64 per share lower, mostly driven by non-cash impairment charges. If we take into account the promised $0.29 per share accretion to 2018 earnings, the pro-forma earnings number comfortably exceeds $3 per share and might approach $3.25 per share if we account for some synergies and organic growth as well.That does not mean that shares are cheap as shares have risen to a high of $68 per share, in part driven by the favorable reaction in response to the deal. This means that shares trade at 21 times forward adjusted earnings, even as the balance sheet is a bit leveraged.There are good reasons to be upbeat as well. The pro-forma revenue base of roughly $2 billion will jump by 15%, but more important is that these sales are growing by 15-20% per year on average. This means that this deal alone boost the organic growth profile of all of PerkinElmer by 2-3% per annum!Note that the $1.3 billion deal comes at 4.2 times sales and nearly 19 times EBITDA. PerkinElmer itself was valued at roughly $7 billion in terms of the market value ahead of the deal. Including existing net debt of $770 million (ahead of X-ray deal closure) the $7.8 billion enterprise valuation came in at 3.7 times sales and roughly 20 times EBITDA as well. This means that the company is buying a company at roughly similar multiples, yet with a great positioning and much better organic growth rates.Final ThoughtsPerkinElmer is a great quality company although the growth has not been that impressive over the past decade. PerkinElmer has grown sales from $1.8 billion in 2007 to $2.1 billion in 2016, or to nearly $2.3 billion on a pro-forma basis. The company furthermore managed to buy back 10% of its shares outstanding, which translates into 40% cumulative revenue growth per share over the past ten years, equivalent to 3-4% per annum.That is solid, but not very impressive, so on the back of those achievements, one can question the multiples being attached to the business.On the bright side, PerkinElmer has a great positioning and should be able to outperform going forwards, as notably the recent deal really delivers on the potential to accelerate organic growth rate to 5% or more per annum. For that reason alone, investors think that the company made a great deal. Shares jumped 6% in response to the deal, increasing the value of the firm by roughly $450 million on the back of a $1.3 billion deal, giving a clear vote of confidence about the deal.I certainly like the deal as well, yet shares of PerkinElmer are not cheap at 21 times adjusted forwards earnings while leverage is high, following a near 30% run higher over the past year. While the current positioning is great, I have to take this run-up and valuation into consideration as the track record of the company is not that great over the past decade, although the current positioning looks rather strong.If shares retreat to market-equivalent multiples based on earnings power of $3.25 per share on an adjusted basis, I am a buyer at around $60, as leverage remains on the high side. For now I can only congratulate investors and management on a great deal, but I am not jumping aboard the momentum train following a great deal."
3276295,25218,2015-06-22T23:48:44-04:00,I searched for companies in the S&P 500 that are long overdue for dividend increases.The companies I have covered so far are PVH Corp. and Precision Castparts.The company I will be covering in this article is PerkinElmer.,"This is my final article in my three-part series covering S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) components that are long overdue for a dividend increase. Each selection has a small dividend because management has chosen to not increase the dividend. The dividends of each of the companies I have covered are not low because the dividend was cut or business was poor.In this article, I will cover PerkinElmer (NYSE:PKI), which is extremely overdue for a dividend increase. Up until the research I conducted for this article series, I had never even heard of PerkinElmer even though it is an S&P 500 component. PerkinElmer operates in the environmental and health care industries where they provide diagnostics, life sciences products and products for the testing air, water, food products, etc.[Images from PKI Investor Presentation]Currently PKI pays a $0.07/share quarterly dividend, which equates to a dividend yield of 0.52%. The following historical dividend chart shows that the dividend for PKI has not increased its dividend at all during the last 20 years.Did PKI choose buybacks instead?After seeing that chart, a logical question an investor might ask is ""Did PKI choose to allocate capital returns to share buybacks instead of increasing its dividend."" The answer to that question for the last five years for the most part has been a no, except for 2011 when PKI repurchased a small amount of shares. However, since 2011, the share count has been essentially flat and in the fourth quarter of 2014 on the conference call the PKI CFO noted that the company had spent $61.3 million on share repurchases during 2014.Over the last twelve months, PKI has paid roughly $31.7 million in dividends, which is roughly a 52% dividend/buyback ratio, which is significantly higher than the 1% dividend/buyback ratio for my previous article selection Precision Castparts (NYSE:PCP). Even though PKI repurchased some stock in 2014, the impact was only minimal in the overall picture of reducing the share count and I believe after twenty years a dividend increase is warranted.Did PKI see a decline in its business?Over the last five years, PKI has grown its revenues 23.83% and EBITDA has grown 16.10%. As the chart below shows, PKI has had slow but steadily increasing revenues every year for the last five years. EBITDA on the other hand has also increase, however, its path upward has been more volatile and with that volatility, I could see why management would not want to increase the dividend.Dividend Growth PotentialCurrently PKI has 113.4 million shares outstanding and pays an annual dividend totaling $0.28/share. Therefore each year PKI spends roughly $31.7 million [113.4 million *$0.28] on dividend payments. Over the last twelve months, PKI free-cash-flow has totaled $224 million, which I believe shows that PKI has enough free-cash-flow to support a slightly more than doubling of its dividend. Looking at the financials, I noticed that PKI has issued $26 million in stock over the last twelve months, and a portion of the share repurchase has gone to make up for stock that has been issued. I believe PKI should continue buying back stock, however, just enough to cover any stock issuance.For example, if PKI were to have repurchased around $26 million in stock to cover issuance over the last year, that would have left $35.3 million of the $61.3 million in repurchase funds available for dividends. Using FinViz, I found that the other dividend paying companies in the Medical Laboratories & Research industry with a market cap over $2 billion have an average dividend yield of 1.19%. Therefore, for PKI to get to the industry average, they would have to increase their quarterly dividend from $0.07/share to $0.16/share. Based on the current share count, PKI would pay around $72.6 million for the year. If they were to take the ""savings"" of $35.3 from only repurchasing issued stock, which would leave only $5.6 million [$72.6-35.3-31.7=5.6), that would need to come out of the $224 million in free cash flow that PKI has.How can Investors take action?Closing ThoughtsIn closing, I believe PKI has significant potential for dividend growth in the future, if management decides to allocate more to dividends instead of spending more on buybacks that are not moving the needle with the share count. I believe PKI can increase their dividend because it has steadily growing underlying businesses and has the financial capacity slightly more than double its dividend.While PKI has the ability to increase the dividend, do not hold your breath because the dividend has been the same for twenty years and management in the fourth quarter the CEO stated ""I think we feel pretty good about the capability we have to continue to do acquisitions and potentially buy back shares as well."" [Fourth Quarter Conference Call, linked above] Investors who own PKI and have options experience have the tools to use covered calls to generate more income.Disclaimer: See here."
4082392,101421,2017-06-19T12:47:19-04:00,"Medical diagnostics company PerkinElmer has agreed to acquire EUROIMMUN for $1.3 billion in an all-cash deal.EUROIMMUN is a major autoimmune testing firm with significant operations in emerging markets, including China.The deal provides a complementary set of capabilities and geographical distribution for promising cross-selling opportunities.Initial market reaction is highly positive on the deal and I agree with the sentiment.","Quick TakeMedical diagnostics and discovery company PerkinElmer (PKI) has announced an agreement to acquire EUROIMMUN Medical Laboratory Diagnostics AG for $1.3 billion in cash.EUROIMMUN is a leading autoimmune testing company with a growing business in infectious disease and allergy testing.The deal appears to be complementary in terms of providing both firms with respective geographic and product strengths, so should be a win for PKI shareholders.Target CompanyLubeck, Germany-based EUROIMMUN was founded in 1987 to provide a range of medical laboratory reagents to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune and infectious diseases and allergies.Management is headed by founder and CEO Winfried Stocker.Below is a brief demo video about EUROIMMUN:(Source: EUROIMMUN US)EUROIMMUN has 2,400 employees, 14 international subsidiaries between 35 countries and has more than 60 distributors generating sales in more than 130 countries, ‘with approximately 45% of revenues in China, 39% in Europe, Middle East & Africa, 5% in the Americas and 20% in Rest of World.'Acquisition Terms and RationalePerkinElmer is paying $1.3 billion in cash for $310 million in 2017 revenues, a multiple of 4.2x. This is higher than a public company basket of firms in the NYU Stern Revenue Multiples dataset, which as of January 2017 showed an aggregate Price/Sales multiple of 3.34x for Healthcare Products companies.As of PKI’s April 2, 2017, 10-Q filing, the company had $288.3 million in cash and total liabilities of $2.1 billion.So, in light of PerkinElmer’s $7.3 billion market cap, this $1.3 billion deal represents a major transaction for the firm and will require it to add significant debt to its balance sheet to close the deal.PKI says the deal ‘is expected to be accretive to PerkinElmer’s 2018 non-GAAP earnings per share result by approximately $0.28 to $0.30. Additionally, PerkinElmer is reaffirming its 2017 revenue and earnings per share guidance.’One major strategic rationale for the combination is the relatively small penetration by EUROIMMUN in the Americas, at currently only 5%, which PKI intends to grow through offering EUROIMMUN’s industry-leading autoimmune testing services.Another important driver is EUROIMMUN’s 45% revenue base from sales in China, which PKI will want to tap to cross-sell its capabilities.As PKI stated in the deal announcement,With the new company under its wing, PKI will also round out a diagnostics portfolio for a variety of conditions including, autoimmune, infectious disease, gene analyses, reproductive health, allergy and genomics for oncology and other molecular tests.The overall market seems to like the deal announcement, with PKI trading up approximately 5% in early trading.At first blush, it appears the combination is a win-win, due to its complementarity, both geographically and product lines.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

2710035,25120,2014-11-26T09:59:21-05:00,"PerkinElmer is expanding in the analytical instruments business.The bolt-on acquisition seems fair, but does not move the needle in a big way.Given the premium valuation, and questionable long term operational track record, I display caution.","PerkinElmer (NYSE:PKI) announced a modest deal at the start of the trading week. The company is expanding in the analytical instruments business used by the wider food industry, in what can be considered to be a bolt-on acquisition.While the deal seems fair, the overall valuation of PerkinElmer seems on the high side, especially when considering the modest operational track record over the past decade. Consequently, I remain rather cautious on the prospects for the shares of the business going forwards.Highlights Of The DealPerkinElmer announced that it has reached a definitive agreement to acquire Swedish-based Perten Instruments Group AB for an amount of $266 million, to be paid in cash.Perten supplies analytical instruments used for quality control of food, grain, flour and feed. With the deal PerkinElmer is expanding in the food testing industry, a rapidly growing business.The deal is anticipated to close as soon as December of this year.Implications Of The DealJon DiVicenzo which is President of PerkinElmer's Environmental Health business likes the deal given the unique capabilities of Perten. With the ownership of the company, PerkinElmer can capitalize on the multi-billion food testing market, with significant opportunities in China as well.With the solutions, PerkinElmer has all the tools for quality control and the testing of imports and exports, thereby ensuring that global supply chains have sufficient integrity in terms of quality.The $266 million price tag is steep, with Perten being anticipated to post sales of $65 million this year. This results in a price tag of little over 4 times anticipated sales. Given the anticipated closure of the deal late in this year, the deal will not impact this year's results, but it is anticipated to add roughly four cents to 2015's non-GAAP earnings per share. This implies that the deal could add some $5 million in earnings after considering financing costs of the purchase of the business.ValuationAt the end of October, PerkinElmer posted its third quarter results. The company ended the quarter with nearly $204 million in cash and equivalents as the total debt being apparent on the balance sheet totaled some $867 million, for a net debt position of around $660 million. This debt position will increase to little over $900 million going forwards, resulting in quite some leverage at around 2.5 times trailing EBITDA.On a trailing basis the company has now posted sales of little over $2.2 billion on which it reported EBITDA of over $360 million and GAAP earnings of around $200 million.With some 114 million shares outstanding currently, and those shares trading at $45 per share, equity in the business is valued at $5.1 billion. Including leverage the entire business is valued at $6 billion, or roughly 2.6 times sales and 16-17 times EBITDA. The valuation for the equity comes in around 25-26 times earnings.Volatile Track RecordJust last week, PerkinElmer last presented itself at the Global Healthcare Conference organized by Jefferies. The company stressed the strong and broad detection and imaging capabilities. These capabilities are employed in growth segments in which the company holds leading market positions, including a strong presence in emerging markets. As a result, PerkinElmer now operates in growing markets like the environmental market, the diagnostics market as well as the life science business.While these intentions appear nice and seem to imply structural solid organic growth, the reported results over the past decade indicate otherwise. Reported sales of $2.2 billion are just about 30% higher from the $1.7 billion reported a decade ago in 2004. Adjusting for inflation, growth in sales is very much limited, especially considering the fact that the company made a few deals in the meantime. At the same time, operating margins of around 10% have been flattish.These results have not been very appealing, although the business has bought back some 10-15% of its shares outstanding over this time period. Despite the lack of real operational growth, shares have risen from levels of just $10 in 2009 towards current highs in the mid-forties.Final ConsiderationsI must say that the deal seems fair, although it might be a little bit on the expensive side. The company failed to specify the growth rates of Perten, nor did it specify potential synergies, notably on the revenue side. As a result an exact evaluation of the impact of the deal is hard to do.Yet the deal is rather small, representing just about 4% of the entire enterprise valuation of PerkinElmer, therefore not being sufficient to move the needle. That leaves the current operations as being a key determinant of the valuation of the business, as the valuation in terms of EBITDA and earnings multiples is very steep, especially considering the fact that the business has only grown its sales by about 30% over the past decade. As a result, I think valuation multiples have risen over time, which has been quite unjustified.Given the appealing end markets, one could argue for a premium valuation, although I believe that the business is underperforming and overpromising. As such I would remain very cautious, not at all considering investing at the current moment."
4082829,21877,2017-06-21T08:04:36-04:00,,"PerkinElmer's (NYSE:PKI) $1.3bn acquisition of Euroimmun is yet another example of a medtech company building scale in a space in which it is already active. In this case the sector is in vitro diagnostics - and there could be more to come, hinted the acquirer's chief executive, Robert Friel.""As we see other opportunities to add technologies or disease areas, we'll look to do that,"" he said during a conference call to discuss the deal. Mr. Friel described a 50:50 split between the group's diagnostics business and its food and services unit as the ""perfect mix""; diagnostics accounted for 30% of its revenues in the first quarter of 2017.As for potential targets, Mr. Friel said the company was focused on speciality and niche diagnostics in high-growth areas. It is not all about acquisitions though: PerkinElmer has also been streamlining recently, offloading its lower-growth medical imaging business to Varian last year.Euroimmun boonInvestors seemed in favor of the Euroimmun takeover, pushing PerkinElmer's stock up 7% yesterday.Unlike many scale-building plays the deal, which will be funded by $900m in debt and the remainder in cash, is aimed more at bolstering revenues than cutting costs, said Mr. Friel. Over the past five years, Euroimmun's top line has been growing at an average of 19% - by contrast, PerkinElmer's sales increased 5% in 2016.As well as providing a growth injection, the acquisition will give PerkinElmer a new presence in autoimmune and allergy diagnostics, and boost its offering in infectious diseases. Euroimmun is expected to bring in sales of $310m this year, around two thirds of which will come from autoimmune testing, 20-25% in infectious diseases, and the rest from allergy testing, Mr. Friel said.Euroimmun markets tests for the Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses; PerkinElmer's current infectious disease offering is focused on HIV and hepatitis B and C testing.In addition, Euroimmun will boost PerkinElmer's footprint outside the US, particularly in China, which is already a priority for the company. The country accounts for around 45% of Euroimmun's sales, while around 30% comes from Europe, the Middle East and Africa.PerkinElmer will also start marketing Euroimmun's products in India, where it has a presence through the acquisition of Tulip Diagnostics in January.Meanwhile, just 5% of Euroimmun's revenues are booked in the Americas. PerkinElmer believes that it will be able to ramp this up, helped by an existing sales infrastructure for its reproductive health tests and ""strong US regulatory capability"".""We think there's potential to build at least a $300m business in the US,"" Mr. Friel said. Overall the acquisition of Euroimmun doubles PerkinElmer's addressable market from $3bn to around $6bn, according to the chief executive, and this could increase as the company further penetrates the infectious diseases market.On this front, PerkinElmer hopes to learn from Euroimmun's R&D approach. Mr. Friel highlighted the speed at which the latter identifies opportunities and brings new tests to the market - which he believes is the reason for its above-market sales growth.So far this year, medtech megadeals have been thin on the ground, and not one has broken the $5bn barrier. Perhaps the climate is cooling again - but consolidation should continue to drive acquisitions for the foreseeable future."
4034272,76785,2017-01-05T12:07:01-05:00,"PerkinElmer has entered into many business lines; in hindsight, perhaps too many.Management is working on pruning the portfolio, recently selling the Digital Imaging business.Unlike many companies, however, there isn't a lot of leverage here. Asset sales would generate cash.Nonetheless, management's plans to drive margin expansion is unlikely to offset declining revenue.","PerkinElmer (NYSE:PKI) has been a perennial outperformer of both market and sector benchmarks, but the company has recently fallen on hard times. In retrospect, the company simply got involved in too many niche markets, and the lack of focus by management impacted consolidated results. Headwinds have only gotten worse given that the company's largest growth avenues for its core products are international, so the strong US Dollar has put a stranglehold on dollar-denominated results. Going forward, management has decided to shift gears a bit, instead placing emphasis on margin expansion, driven by shrinking the number of products in scope. Overall, the target is 400bps of margin expansion through fiscal 2020; a lofty goal, and one that is likely to cause some oscillations in earnings as management right-sizes the portfolio.Business OperationsBroadly, PerkinElmer reports in two segments, at least for now: Human Health and Environmental Health. Human Health concentrates on the development of diagnostics and tools to help prevent diseases earlier and more accurately. In particular, the Human Health segment has a well-regarded prenatal screening business to help diagnose genetic abnormalities, including Down Syndrome, hypothyroidism, and various metabolic conditions. Environmental Health focuses on products and services geared towards environmental protection and testing, such as gas chromatography and spectroscopy instruments used in many industries, including forensics, food and beverage, and industrial businesses.However, starting next quarter, this will change as a result of restructuring initiatives. The company will report results within Diagnostics and Discovery and Analytical Solutions. The major change here is the movement of research products (tools and supplies geared towards government and academic customers) into the old Environmental Health segment. This is yet another segment realignment, after making a similar change at the beginning of fiscal 2015 (discussed below). In my opinion, this latest move was done in order to help management cast its new Diagnostics segment as its high growth business line, which should improve market perception. That, along with so-called ""pruning"" of the portfolio, will help clarify the story for investors.I agree that this might be a prudent move, but it may lead to some potentially unintended results. As a result of de-emphasis of certain lines of business, driven by the last realignment in fiscal 2015, management stated that there were some unintended impacts on its sell-through within certain product lines. Long-term investors likely have noticed that some product lines have seen strong demand (prenatal screening, food analysis, pharmaceutical services), while others have been extraordinarily weak (government, academic, industrial, medical imaging). Beyond that, international growth has been strongest (high single digits organically), while developed markets have weakened in the mid-single digits. While some of this is secular, not all of it can be chalked up to the market; the fiscal 2015 reorganization led to a shift in sales staff internally, which impacted sell-through.Expect a repeat of those issues over the next year, which the market does not seem to be factoring into future earnings results. Management will be taking a lot of actions over the next year with respect to weak product lines: discontinuing operations, letting them slowly bleed off, or (best-case scenario) expect management to either discontinue some of these operations quickly, allow others to fade off with time, or (best case) sell at attractive prices. Selling operations was the case for the medical imaging business, which the company recently sold to Varian Medical Systems (NYSE:VAR) for $276M. Underlying data was not disclosed, but given this was sold at roughly 2x revenue, if results were similar to consolidated operations, the business was sold at roughly 11-12x EBITDA. After the cash infusion, net debt/EBITDA will be just a hair over 1x, which should give PerkinElmer plenty of breathing room to expand in complementary business lines to its core operations through acquisitions of its own if it so pleases. This won't be easy, and there will be growing pains here. Management has made it clear that it is unsure if margin expansion initiatives will be enough to offset the impact from pruning the portfolio on earnings per share growth.Financial OverviewEarnings results have been a bit all over the place, even excluding acquisition and integration costs:Nonetheless, there are positives. EBITDA margins are strong (regardless of nominal EBITDA), and should only improve, with dampened variance, as PerkinElmer restructures into a leaner organization. Investors do need to be careful of the mix of hard products sold versus services PerkinElmer is offering, given that services traditionally carry much lower gross margins for the company. This may simply be a factor of scale; services contribute less than a third of revenue. However, more than a fair share of the weaker products are held within the products businesses, like the recently sold medical imaging business. In particular, look for products geared towards academic and government customers, to be the next business lines to likely get the ax from an asset sale.As management works towards its stated goal of 400bps of operating margin expansion by fiscal 2020, expect this product mix to be one of the hurdles that has to be overcome by the company's operations. Wringing 80-100bps/year of margin expansion out of any business is never easy, but PerkinElmer already reports consolidated margins in line with medical supply and equipment peers, so the road is likely to be a little bumpy as the company works towards its stated goals. As far as investors know currently, most of this expansion is expected to be driven by cost-cutting and cutting lower margin products, and not via pricing increases.With that said, there are some things to like here. While the company trades at 15x EBITDA, this isn't necessarily unusual for the company historically, or competitors and peers within the sector. In fact, free cash flow is particularly strong compared to alternatives (5% free cash flow yield), and is actually highly attractive given the lack of leverage. On the flip side, shareholder returns have never been strong. The dividend has been kept stable for years, and while the recent share repurchase authorization is appreciated, it has not been enough to meaningfully reduce the float. While not acknowledged by management, the positive side of the strengthening USD is getting more value for your money on overseas acquisitions. Given management sees the international markets as a growth driver, I can imagine that buying overseas companies in complementary business as an excellent means of deploying capital. Expect repeats of the Vanadis Diagnostics acquisition, which added some prenatal screening capabilities to PerkinElmer's already well-developed business. These are the types of deals that PerkinElmer needs to make going forward to drive positive surprise within the markets.Given management's cautious commentary on earnings (management is unsure it can keep earnings growing continuously) and weak Q4 guidance (low single-digit organic growth), I'm surprised to see Wall Street projecting earnings growth going forward; 8% annually over the next two years. I don't think CEO Robert Friel is playing softball as he preaches caution in the short term on earnings, particularly as the company is likely to announce further asset sales. While estimates have come down somewhat since this commentary, there may be more downside ahead and the potential for missing on earnings.

I do not own any shares of this stock.PKI moved higher on the back of 2nd quarter earnings that came in at $42.6 million or $.46/share compared with $38.2 million or $.20/share the prior year same period. Sales climbed 14% to $497.8 million. Adjusted earnings came in at $.38/share, ahead of the $.33/share estimate. PerkinElmer went ahead and raised guidance for the full-year to $1.49 to $1.54/share from prior guidance of $1.43 to $1.48/share ahead of analysts who had been expecting $1.46/share.The outstanding results led Robert W. Baird analyst Quintin Lai to comment:According to the Yahoo ""Profile"" on PerkinElmer, the company,Looking longer-term at the Morningstar.com ""Financials"" on PerkinElmer, we can see that revenue has grown from $1.47 billion in 2005 to $1.94 billion in 2008 before dipping to $1.81 billion in 2009.PKI has struggled with net income, which dipped from $268 million in 2005 to as low as $86 million in 2009. Similarly diluted earnings per share have dipped from $2.04 in 2005 to $.73/share in 2009.Reviewing the Morningstar information regarding their balance sheet, we can see that the company has current assets of $884 million, easily covering the total current liabilities of $496 million. Total non-current liabilities totals $939 million. The company generated $117 million in free cash flow in 2009 down slightly from the $175 million in free cash flow the prior year.In terms of valuation, the Yahoo ""Key Statistics"" on PKI reveal that the market capitalization of $2.63 billion makes this company a mid cap stock. The trailing p/e is a relatively rich 26.22. However, the forward p/e is a reasonable 13.19 (fye Jan 3, 2012), with a PEG (5 yr estimated) even more reasonable at 1.09. The company has 117.81 million shares outstanding with a float of 116.44 million. As of July 15, 2010, there were 1.73 million shares out short with a modest short ratio of only 1.0. The company pays a forward annual dividend rate of $.28/share yielding an anticipated 1.4% based on the current price. The last stock split was a 2:1 back on June 4, 2001.Technically, the 'point & figure' chart from StockCharts.com is encouraging. This stock peaked back in June, 2008, at the $29 level, dipped as low as $11.00 in March, 2009, before rallying back, breaking through resistance at $15 and moving to the current $22.29 level, below the recent high of $25 set in April, 2010.In summary, PerkinElmers appears to be firing on all cylinders after several years of relatively mediocre financial performance. They reported a strong quarter in both of their business segments that beat expectations. They also went ahead and raised guidance for the year. The stock appears to be reasonably priced, pays a small dividend, and has a nice chart to boot. This is the kind of stock that I might consider buying for my own portfolio if the right buy signal could be recorded. Meanwhile, I shall add it to my burgeoning list of appealing stocks on this blog!Disclosure: none."

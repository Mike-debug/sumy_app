3987869,85506,2016-07-12T12:23:48-04:00,What’s next for Mitel after loosing out on the Polycom Inc. deal?Mitel continues its quest to find its identity in the tech industry.Mitel’s investors could be the winners of this failed deal in the long run.,"When it comes to mergers and acquisitions there are good deals, bad deals and deals that never see the light of day. There are times when good companies make bad deals, bad companies make great deals but at the end of the day the goal is the same: to grow and become better. In this case we have Canadian tech firm Mitel Networks (NASDAQ: MITL) and its continuing quest to grow its market share through the acquisition of video conferencing specialists Polycom Inc. (NASDAQ: PLCM), however this time around the $1.96 billion deal was not meant to be.For those unaware of Mitel, it is a Canadian based business communications expert powering more than 60 million users with 2 billion daily connections spread across 100 countries. What started off as a company focused on business communication hardware has over the past few years begun a transition to embrace cloud storage. Mitel's growth in cloud computing has been recognized by Synergy Research Group as having both the ""largest base of any cloud unified communications providers"" and being the fastest growing company in its sector.The potential that Mitel saw in its proposed deal was that both companies had corporate visions of helping their clients collaborate that were ""almost identical"", with Polycom's focus on video conferencing and Mitel's history in the business communications sector. From the very onset of the announcement for Mitel to purchase Polycom rumors had already begun to circulate that another suitor, named at the time Sponsor 1, was still in discussions with Polycom and had offered a ""superior"" offer than Mitel. Many believed that the Mitel deal was expected to be completed and had already received regulatory approval.Now we know that Sponsor 1 was private equity firm Siris Capital Group that it had beat Mitel's offer by 13.6% with its own proposal of $2 billion, or $12.50 per share in cash and debt assumptions.The investors' sayWhile news of this failed deal may be unpleasant news for Mitel, this has been a completely different story for investors. Long-term investors of Mitel have become rather accustomed to the constant cycle of mergers and acquisitions that Mitel has been on for quite some time with five deals in the past six years. Some of the highlights included the landmark $309 million acquisition of Aastra Networks which doubled its market cap and other deals such as the $560 million deal for Mavenir. Both of these larger deals offered Mitel a way to quickly expand its foothold in the industry and investors were supportive of this approach.However, this time around with Polycorp there was a much different reaction among investors. When we look at Mitel's NASDAQ chart over the course of this story we see that when the deal was originally announced on April 8 Mitel's stock price was up at $8.21, its highest point since November 2015. Then immediately after the announcement the stock price plummeted to $6.10, where it continued to tread water until the rumors of another suitor emerged. This lead the stock to climb back up to $6.84 at the end of May where it hovered before falling back down to $5.97 on June 27. Then the unexpected happened Siris and Polycom announced that they had not only reached and agreement, but Mitel had also waived its right to match the offer.These announcements triggered a 20% increase in Mitel's shares, pulling its stock price from $6.84 on July 7 to $7.21 on July 8, and managed to stay above $7.00 for the remainder of the week.Why the rebellion among investors?My personal belief is that there are two key factors in why investors reacted so coldly to the proposed deal with Polycom. The first is that this deal represented a stutter step in Mitel's ambitions to grow it cloud computing capabilities. The growth of Mitel's cloud computing arm has been a double edged sword with investors as while it is the technology of the future and has to potential to be a multi billion dollar industry, the pricing model of cloud services as compared to Mitel's hardware centric model has challenged the patience of some. The cloud model produces lower upfront revenues but higher long term revenues. The quest for the cloud was the key driver in the acquisition of Aastra Networks and represented the future of the company. This is a strategy which is paying off for Mitel as amidst the fallout of the failed Polycorp deal, Mitel has just announced that it has added AINEO Networks, Japan's leading provider of international communications systems by volume to its list of subscribers.Perhaps the deal with Polycorp failed to convince investors that this was the best step for the future of Mitel as it rediscovers itself while it is grasping onto two different aspects of the tech industry.The other potential catalyst for the reaction that investors have shown recently is Mitel's long term debt which is currently sitting at $603 million due in part to its steady stream of acquisitions. There is a belief that there is a desire among investors for Mitel to invest in itself for a time to remedy its debt before seeking out a more ""future compatible"" acquisition targets. This belief is further exasperated by Mitel's recent Q1 net loss of $22 million, and a projected 25% drop in Q2 2016 EPS which have left some leery of further acquisitions in the immediate future.Hope is not lostDespite this hiccup Mitel still presents itself as an intriguing option for investors looking to add something to the tech portion of their portfolio and its long-term potential shouldn't be overshadowed by recent events. In its most recent quarterly report Mitel saw its revenue rise to $276 million from $248 million in Q1 2015, this came in at the bottom end of its projected earnings of $270 million to $295 million. Where things get interesting for us in considering the future of the company is when we break down the revenue sources.Here we see the changing landscape of Mitel as it continues to face the new paradigm of cloud and mobile services beginning to erode its traditional business structure. For the most part Mitel has been consistent in its endeavors to embrace the change in technology and the needs of clients. It has shown this by increasing its total cloud seats from 1.37 million in Q1 2015 to 2.19 million in Q1 2016, investors are now waiting eagerly to see the effect that the new agreement ""to expand AINEO's iPBX Hosting solution with MiCloud"" over the next couple of quarters.It is this growth in the cloud computing sector which has kept Mitel's head above water with investors who are looking for a stable tech option in their portfolio. However as I have previously mentioned it is this same transition from a primarily enterprise solutions driven company to one focused on cloud and mobile technology which will challenge the resolve of some investors.Despite all of this Mitel is still maintaining an average short term price target of $12.20, which surpasses Mitel's all time high of $11.04 from back in May 2014. Mitel in its current state presents itself as an intriguing long term option for investors looking for a stable lesser known tech stock for their portfolio. While there will still be some growing pains in the immediate future patient investors who are looking to take advantage of the current fwd p/e ratio of 12.65 should consider the current state of Mitel for future gains.If you enjoyed this article and found it helpful, please ""Follow"" me on Seeking Alpha to receive notification whenever I publish a new article.You may also be interested in other recent articles I have written for Seeking Alpha with my Canadian point of view that focus on stocks and stories that I have found compelling.

3018006,66533,2015-03-20T17:12:31-04:00,"Polycom said it has entered into an expanded relationship with Microsoft for offering customers Polycom RoundTable.RoundTable, a Skype-based videoconferencing tool, will boost Polycom’s revenue significantly in the growing videoconferencing market.We believe Polycom’s stock is heading toward $18, based on one-year forward sales.","Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) said it has expanded its relationship with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and will start delivering a new series of videoconferencing solutions for Skype. The development, known as the Polycom RoundTable, is expected to help Polycom boost revenue significantly. The first device in the RoundTable series, the Polycom RoundTable 100, will help small to mid-sized businesses expand their videoconferencing capabilities.Polycom Is Leveraging Skype PlatformLeveraging Microsoft's Skype platform, Polycom is looking to expand its customer base and product portfolio. Currently Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) dominates the corporate video conferencing market with its Cisco TelePresence Systems (CTS). Polycom is not targeting the whole corporate sector including large corporations in the initial stage. Instead, it is targeting the SMBs (small to mid-sized businesses) to popularize the platform with Skype's existing user-base in SMBs. However, we believe Polycom RoundTable will gradually become CTS' chief competitor.Cisco offers a live and face-to-face videoconferencing experience via CTS. However, the drawback of implementing CTS is that it requires advanced knowledge of the latest networking technologies. Skype, on the contrary, is easy to use and hugely popular in SMBs. We believe Microsoft's endeavor will be to transform Polycom RoundTable to a user-friendly and affordable videoconferencing solution by combining it with Skype for Business and Microsoft Lync 2013. The Polycom CX series will also be a part of the Polycom RoundTable, which is expected to bring more than 50 million meeting rooms under the umbrella of Polycom and Microsoft.Competitive LandscapePolycom RoundTable will see fierce competition from Cisco, which introduced Cisco TelePresence back in 2006. Cisco has vast experience in developing online videoconferencing solutions. In 2007, Cisco acquired WebEx and began offering a variety of Unified Communications products to its clients. In 2009, Cisco acquired Tandberg which positioned Cisco to offer industry-leading videoconferencing products.The Tandberg content server helps organizations access on-demand video presentations, corporate training sessions and distance education classes, which are essential parts of the whole videoconferencing experience these days. We believe if Microsoft acquires Sonic Foundry (OTCPK:SOFO), the Polycom RoundTable experience could get even better and more competitive. Sonic Foundry's cloud-based Mediasite would be able to make RoundTable more interactive. Further, with Mediasite, past videoconferencing sessions would be searchable.ValuationPolycom's 2014 full-year revenue was $1.35 billion and currently its EBITDA margin remains at 9%. According to a new report, the global market for videoconferencing equipment and services is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 9.36% between 2014 and 2020. With Polycom RoundTable continuing to evolve, we believe Polycom's revenue will grow at a CAGR of at least 10%. At this run rate, the company's full-year 2015 revenue will be around $1.49 billion, and EBITDA will be $135 million. We believe Polycom will enjoy an EV/EBITDA multiple of around 15x, the multiple at which it trades on an average. Applying the multiple on the 2015 EBITDA, we get its enterprise value of $2.025 billion, which translates into a share price of $18, with net cash of $390 million on the balance sheet and 134.18 million shares outstanding. The share price represents an upside of ~33% from the current price level around $13.50.  ConclusionPolycom's fourth quarter 2014 revenue grew satisfactorily across all product lines except the UC platform. With its RealPresence platform gaining traction and RoundTable platform continuing to evolve, we believe Polycom's future is bright in the growing videoconferencing equipment and services market.

2065803,24063,2014-03-04T09:26:01-05:00,,"By Jason SeoCash rich technology stocks have been targeted by hedge funds because these companies trade at a discount to their peers. Carl Icahn has been forcing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to return more capital to shareholders. Since cash isn't generating any meaningful returns in this low interest environment, share repurchases will lead to increased earnings per share and, hopefully, higher share prices. In this article we will bring a cash rich stock to your attention that is likely to outperform the market over the next 12 months.During fourth quarter several hedge fund managers increased their holdings of Polycom Inc. (NASDAQ:PLCM), including activist investor Jeffrey Smith of Starboard Value, who more than doubled his stake and now owns 3.9% of the video and voice conferencing solutions provider. George Soros, Cliff Asness and Philippe Laffont are also major shareholders. Our research has shown that small-cap stocks that are popular among hedge funds tend to outperform the market by a large margin on average (read the details here).2013 was a volatile year for PLCM, which faced the departure of its product /services chief in February, followed by the resignation of its CEO due to expense irregularities in July. Post the appointment of a new CEO from ATM producer NCR Corp. (NYSE:NCR) in December, the distraction of management turmoil has been put in the backburner and investors have turned their attention back to the company's earnings, which have continued to meet or beat consensus estimates in recent quarters.Amid the headline-grabbing chaos, PLCM did announce a new $400M share repurchase plan (22% of its market capitalization) in early September. Interestingly, the third quarter was also significant when Starboard first bought shares of the company, scooping up 2.85M shares and making it the 13th largest holding of the 13F portfolio. We do not think this was a coincidence, as Starboard more than likely began amassing its stake in late July when the stock dropped more than 18% over two days following the news of the CEO departure. Shortly thereafter, PCLM increased the size of its board to seven by appointing two new board members and announced it had used up $285M of the repurchase authorization (for 27.4M shares) and was entering into an accelerated repurchase program for the remaining $115M (for 8.0M shares). Again, this development comes on the heel of Soros initiating a 9.4M share position in the company during 4Q13 (not to mention Starboard more than doubling its existing holdings).With these two heavyweight investors acquiring significant stakes during the quarter, further capital return actions could be on the horizon, especially in light of PLCM's high cash balance (30% of its balance sheet vs. 18% for its peer group of communications equipment companies) and free cash flow yield (11% vs. 2%). Valuation-wise, the stock trades at an EV / EBITDA multiple of 7.4X vs. the peer group median 9.1X; a narrowing of the discount implies a stock price of $15.50, or 19% upside from current levels.Disclosure: I am long AAPL.Business relationship disclosure: This article is written by Insider Monkey's writer, Jason Seo, and edited by Meena Krishnamsetty.

3966026,25120,2016-04-18T16:17:32-04:00,"Mitel Networks is acquiring Polycom in a deal which brings much needed scale.The company will be able to reduce relative leverage ratios, as the deal takes place at relative appealing valuation multiples.While investors in Mitel should applaud the deal given the synergies, improved positioning and reduced leverage, I still have some concerns.This follows the fact that the company remains relatively small in a competitive landscape, as technological developments bring risks as well.","Mitel Networks (NASDAQ:MITL) agreed to acquire Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) in a near $2 billion deal. With the deal, the combination will gain much needed scale in an industry which needs to consolidate, at least according to activist investor Elliott Management. It is Elliott who urged for these two players to combine their operations. This followed the fact that the activist announced an equity stake in both firms, back in October of 2015.While improved scale is much needed for both of these firms, I am not tempted to buy into this merger story despite the anticipation of sizable synergy estimates. Fierce competition and rapid changes in the technological landscape make that I remain cautious, for what is still a smaller player.The DealMitel has agreed to buy Polycom in a $1.96 billion deal. Investors in Polycom stand to receive $3.12 in cash and 1.31 shares in Mitel for each share which they currently own, equivalent to a $13.68 per share purchase price.It is very clear that the main rationale behind the deal is increased scale, inspired by Elliott´s involvement. Mitel´s management recognizes the very intensive competitive environment and the fact that technologies and markets are no longer subject to barriers, as has been the case in the past. Following the deal, the combination should be able to more effectively operate in the converging markets for seamless communication and collaboration.This is exactly the reason why Mitel itself has been active with regards to acquisitions in the past. In the period 2013-2015, Mitel bought PriarieFyre, Aastra, Oaisys, Mavenir and TigerTMS.This dealmaking and organic growth allowed Mitel to expand its revenue base from $400 million in 2006 towards $1.1 billion at the moment. While growth looks appealing, Mitel has issued a lot of shares and debt in order to finance this growth, a key reason why investors have not benefited from this growth. Shares still trade below the levels at which shares traded immediately following the IPO back in 2010.What About The Deal Multiples?Mitel reported revenues of $1.16 billion for 2015, up modestly compared to the year before. The lack of scale, restructuring charges and competitive environment has pressured the profitability of the firm. As a matter of fact, Mitel reported a GAAP loss of $21 million. It should be said that this number did include some amortization charges as well as restructuring costs of $55 million. Excluding these and other items, adjusted EBITDA came in at $168 million.Past dealmaking has resulted in a leveraged balance sheet. Mitel ended last year with merely $92 million in cash and equivalents while total debt stood at $645 million. This net debt load of roughly $550 million translates into a 3.3 times leverage ratio in comparison to reported adjusted EBITDA. If you take into account $127 million in pension liabilities, the leverage ratio approaches 4 times.The 125 million shares outstanding traded at around $8 before the deal has been announced. This translates into a $1 billion equity valuation, thereby valuing the entire business at roughly $1.6 billion if you include the net debt load. This is equivalent to 1.5 times sales and roughly 10 times EBITDA.While Mitel is the surviving entity, it is more or less clear that this deal is a merger, given that Polycom´s nearly $2 billion price tag surpasses the enterprise valuation of Mite. Polycom posted sales of $1.27 billion for the year of 2015, although these sales are coming under pressure. Full year sales fell by 6%, with revenue trends accelerating for the worse as fourth quarter sales fell by 9%. Unlike Mitel, Polycom remains solidly profitable as lower restructuring costs were the driver behind an increase in earnings, with the bottomline showing a $69 million profit. The company reported adjusted EBITDA of around $200 million last year.While the reported deal tag comes in at $1.96 billion, it is important to realize that Polycom has a very strong balance sheet. The company holds $620 million in cash, equivalents and marketable securities while debt levels stand at merely $230 million. This net cash load reduces the effective purchase price towards $1.57 billion. Based on this number, Polycom is valued at 1.2 times sales and roughly 8 times adjusted EBITDA.The Pro-Forma BusinessIf you simply add up the financial performance of both businesses, the new Mitel will post sales of little over $2.4 billion per annum, with adjusted EBITDA amounting to $370 million. Based on the modest losses of Mitel, and the profits reported by Polycom, net earnings are seen at little less than $50 million per annum.If you take into account the $550 million net debt load of Mitel and the $390 million net cash position of Polycom, the pro-forma business operates with a net debt load of $160 million. Mitel has however agreed to fork over $3.12 per share in cash to investors in Polycom, equivalent to roughly $400 million. This jacks up the net debt load towards $560 million, or nearly $700 million if you include pension obligations.With $370 million in combined adjusted EBITDA, the combination operates with a leverage ratio of roughly 2 times adjusted EBITDA. This does not take into account the anticipated synergy benefits resulting from the deal.Mitel will need to issue some 180 million shares in relation to the deal, a move which will dilute the shareholder base to roughly 300 million shares outstanding. At around $8 per share this boils down to a $2.4 billion equity valuation, or $3 billion if you include debt. The real accretion from this deal has to come from scale, something which could result in $160 million in synergies by 2018, at least according to executives. I must say that this synergy estimate looks quite aggressive as it is equivalent to 6% of the pro-forma revenue base.If the synergies could be achieved, the EBITDA multiple of the combination drops towards 6 times. These savings could easily boost after-tax earnings by some $130 million per annum based on a 20% tax rate, boosting earnings to $175 million. This would translate into a 13-14 times earnings multiple, at least if all goes to plan. Given that Mitel´s shares dropped from $8 towards $7 in response to the deal, that multiple drops to little over 12 times anticipated 2018 earnings.The Market DisagreesThe rationale behind Elliott´s push to merge is fair. Both companies are too small to survive in fast changing markets, as both companies compete with much larger and financially stronger competitors, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).While Elliott has put real money on the line by acquiring stock in both firms, it failed to make any money on this investment, at least until now. While the deal looks good on paper, the market reacted negatively towards the deal. Shares of Mitel fell by 10% in response to the announcement, translating into a decline in market value of roughly $225 million on the back of a near $2 billion deal.Part of the reason behind the disappointing market reaction might be the fact that Mitel released a little inspiring outlook for its first quarter of 2016. The company sees first quarter revenues of $270 to $280 million, accompanied by adjusted EBITDA margins of 7.5 to 9.5%.This is disappointing as pro-forma first quarter revenues totaled $277 million in the same period last year, indicating no growth. Worse, adjusted EBITDA came in at nearly $33 million in the first quarter last year, as this profitability number is expected to drop to just $23 million in the first quarter.Final Conclusions, AvoidWhile Elliott is seeing the merger which it has wished for, the market is not enthusiastic. This is despite a very strong track record of Elliott with regards to investments in technology companies.While Mitek is improving its balance sheet, profitability and is gaining scale with the purchase of Polycom at fair multiples, investors are not happy.This is despite the promise for sizable cost synergies in the years to come. The negative reaction in response to this deal is therefore surprising, but indeed could relate to the disappointing outlook for the first quarter. This is certainly the case as margins are expected to come under further pressure, hurting the bottom line even more.While the new $3 billion business has doubled its revenues to $2.5 billion overnight, it remains very small compared to Cisco which posts $50 billion in sales. If you exclude Cisco´s net cash balances, it trades at about 2 times sales which is a premium compared to the pro-forma revenue multiple of 1.1 times for Mitel.This is explained by superior margins, as EBITDA multiples are quite similar actually. Note that this might not even by the worst kind of competition as technology shifts have created a whole other set of competitors. This includes of course the emergence of Microsoft´s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Skype, as well as a string of apps which allow for easy communication.So if all goes well, Mitel should trade at 12 times pro-forma earnings in 2018, based on aggressive synergy estimates. That is actually quite similar to market leading firm Cisco which operates from a much stronger position in terms of scale and its balance sheet. There is a reason why Cisco trades at lower valuation multiples as well, and that might very well be the fact that emergence of technologies renders parts of its business to become obsolete in the future, just like Mitel.Small yet improving scale, a still somewhat leveraged balance sheet, suboptimal margins and worries about long term threats make me cautious on the prospects for the combination. That being said, strong execution has the potential to improve the investment case, although the company will need to deliver on many good things in the years to come. I will keep an eye on the story from the sidelines with an interest, potentially reconsidering my neutral stance as we move along."
2027231,57921,2014-02-18T07:29:58-05:00,,"Of all the companies I cover, Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) seems to be one of the more misunderstood organizations from an investor perspective. I think the primary reason for this is that the markets Polycom plays in are equally misunderstood, and if investors gave the company another look they would see strong value in PLCM's future.The market that most would associate PLCM with is, of course, enterprise video conferencing, which many perceive to be flat or even declining, hence the hesitancy to invest in a company like PLCM. I also find that many investors have a negative bias towards enterprise video based on poor experiences in the past when roll around carts and confusing interfaces were the norm. Don't get me wrong; I understand where the bad history emanates from and the frustrating experiences that users have had. I'm a former IT professional myself and I can tell you from experience that those old systems took anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to get going - hardly a spontaneous collaboration tool. However, the technology has come a long way over the past few years.Back to the market question and whether video is actually growing or not. My research firm, ZK Research, recently ran a survey of almost 1000 companies that use video today to understand usage habits and buying patterns. The results of the survey were in stark contrast with much of the industry perception. 90% of respondents indicated that they were expecting to see increased video utilization over the next 12 months. So why does the ZK Research survey conflict with industry opinion? It's because video is in transition and the market is still being sized using legacy methods.The box counting analyst firms still have market forecasts that measure only video hardware sales. I would agree that the market for video hardware is currently flat. However, customers are using and spending budgets on software solutions, cloud based video and consulting and professional services. In particular, upfront business planning services have been particularly hot as business managers and corporate executives are often making the decision for video today.Over the past year, PLCM has completely revamped its products to be more in line with the shifts to software, cloud and mobile video. In addition, the company has been building a strong professional services organization, which includes the 2013 acquisition of Sentri. Last week I attended the company's channel conference, TEAM Polycom, in Vancouver and at the event PLCM hit its reseller base hard with the theme of service and industry transformation as it preps for the next wave of video growth. Make no mistake, the video industry is as healthy as ever and PLCM finally has the right products to take advantage of the current market trends. I actually think the momentum behind software and mobile video will eventually drive organizations back to beefing up their hardware platforms to make video a company wide resource. Video usage begets more video usage and the key is to understand where to deploy what type of video and this should drive growth across all segments of the technology.Another theme I like for PLCM this year is the company's attachment to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Lync. Over the past few years MSFT has been convincing customers to deploy Lync as a desktop collaboration tool, primarily for chat and presence. This past year, MSFT released the first version of Lync that could compete with the likes of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Avaya in the area of enterprise voice. However, Lync alone can't fully replace an IP PBX, but Lync and a partner can and 75% of the time, when customers migrate to Lync voice, they choose PLCM as the partner. Additionally, PLCM has, by far, the best Lync video solutions. The typical journey for Lync customers is Lync desktop, followed by Lync voice and then Lync video. We're really at the early stages of Lync for voice and video, creating a Lync wave that PLCM should be able to ride for the next few years. PLCM certainly understands the opportunity here and has been aggressively pushing its Lync compatible solutions into a fast growing Lync install base.Lastly, the VoIP related products have been growing impressively for PLCM of late. This past quarter, the UC personal devices segment grew 33% YoY with much of that revenue growth coming from VoIP phones. While the growth of traditional premises based VoIP solutions has slowed down, cloud UC providers have been red hot and consequently so have the growth of PLCM's line of new VVX IP phones. Small and mid size businesses will continue to migrate their telephony infrastructure to the cloud, creating another strong market trend for PLCM to attach itself to.One final point, the recent hiring of Peter Leav to be the company's new CEO seems to be a great fit. PLCM has been aggressively rolling out new products and now it is time to shift the go to market strategy and help its channel evolve. In other words, now that the product transition is underway, its time to execute, something Mr. Leav has proven he can do given his previous successes at Motorola (NYSE:MSI) and NCR (NYSE:NCR).I'm a big believer that significant market share shifts only happen during market transitions. The unified communications (UC) industry, which includes video, is currently going through several market transitions and PLCM appears to have the right set of products today, but more importantly, the right mindset to go after these opportunities.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: ZK Research maintains a relationship with PLCM and CSCO."

Both companies shared several characteristics that we believe have made their shares undervalued relative to their fair value. In each case, the company in question is in a state of transition. Check Point, while maintaining a leading position in the global security market, has seen its growth rate slide into the single digits as the company expands in size. And at the same time, the company's balance sheet has continued to strengthen, leaving the company bloated with cash & investments. And even the company's rapid pace of share buybacks is not enough to halt the growth in its cash balances, thanks to the company's bountiful cash flow generation. In contrast, QLogic is navigating through a stagnant Fibre channel market, albeit one that has shown signs of stabilization. In addition, QLogic is in the process of cutting costs across its business, countering the decline in its gross margins as it shifts to the Ethernet market. When combined with the company's pristine balance sheet, this has created the opportunity for solid earnings growth and returns of capital for shares that trade at single-digit multiples. And now, we turn to Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM), a company that shares many of these same characteristics.In October 2014, shares of Polycom trade under below $13; since reaching a post dot-com bubble high of above $32 in July 2011, shares of Polycom have shed more than half their value as the company's growth stagnated and profits plunged. When combined with a structural shift in its business and a bloated cost structure that was for years partially masked by double-digit revenue growth, it is unsurprising to see that Polycom has lost a majority of its value since July 2011. However, Polycom's past past performance is not necessarily a reflection of its future potential. Throughout the course of 2014, Polycom has worked diligently to restructure its business, cutting costs across the company and working to stabilize sales ahead of a forecasted return to revenue growth in 2015. While ample progress has been made today, there is much work that remains, and we believe that as Polycom continues to restructure its business and stabilize sales, shares of the company will move higher. While we do not believe that shares will reach their July 2011 levels, we nevertheless believe that at under $13, Polycom's current share price does not adequately reflect its turnaround potential, and the clear actions that management has taken to date to restructure the company and position it for a return to revenue growth in 2015. Backed by a clean balance sheet, with net cash & investments equaling almost a quarter of the company's market capitalization, we believe that 2015 will be a favorable year for Polycom investors, and foresee upside of more than 30% as shares rise to a level that more accurately reflects Polycom's turnaround and forward prospects. Unless otherwise noted, financial statistics and managerial commentary will be sourced from Polycom's earnings releases, earnings calls, and SEC filings; chief among them the company's Q3 2014 earnings release, its Q3 2014 earnings call, and its 2013 10-K.Overview: The Story So FarWe believe that most readers are likely, at a minimum, familiar with Polycom's core technology, if not the company itself. Founded in 1990, Polycom is one of the largest providers of unified communications (UC) solutions, which enable the company's customers to communicate and collaborate regardless of physical distance. Through products such as IP conference phones and video collaboration software, Polycom offers a wide range of products that enable its customers to offer remote communication and productivity solutions to reduce costs across their own organizations.For much of the company's history, Polycom was able to leverage the structural transition to a global and Internet-based economy to sell communications hardware to customers around the world. But beginning in 2012, something fundamental began to change in Polycom's end markets, and the global videoconferencing market began to show cracks. On its own, perhaps this issue would have been manageable. But, the stall in revenue growth that Polycom experienced beginning in 2012 exposed another, arguably more important issue: the company's bloated cost structure. Since 2007, Polycom has seen its operating expenses as a percent of sales steadily climb, and when combined with a lack of revenue growth, the results had a material effect on the company's profitability.As the U.S. and international economy began to move past the global financial crisis, new challenges emerged for Polycom. For years, Polycom's business model had been hardware centric, dependent on selling equipment such as business phones to its customers. But, the emergence of software-based solutions from a number of competitors, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI), and a slate of privately held startups began to take its toll on Polycom, and the company's revenue growth and gross margins. While it would have perhaps been possible for Polycom to navigate these two issues on their own, the company's gradual but sustained increase in operating expenses as a percent of sales began to be exposed. In the table below, we present Polycom's revenue growth, gross margins, and operating expenses as a percent of sales for the period between 2004 and 2010.Source: company filingsThe rapid deceleration in revenue growth at Polycom, beginning in 2012 had a clear and tangible impact on the company's operating profits and net income. In the table below, we present a consolidated overview of Polycom's performance over the past 10 years.Polycom Historical Performance (in Thousands of $)Source: company filingsWe note that since peaking in 2011 at over $229 million, Polycom's operating income fell by almost 50% by the end of 2013, as the company saw a decline in its gross margins, which was materially exacerbated by a continued climb in operating expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales. It is therefore unsurprising that shares of Polycom have shed over half their value since their post-dot com bubble peak in 2011. But while 2013 represented a year of sharp declines in both operating profits and EPS, 2014 is shaping up to be quite different. With both a new management team and aggressive efforts to cut costs and reposition itself, Polycom's performance in 2014 is far better than its results in 2013. Backed by a strong balance sheet, Polycom has made clear progress in its efforts to turn itself around and restore the business to growth. This turnaround consists of three separate pillars: new management, aggressive cost cuts, and meaningful investments in new products, which are set to lead the company to a return to revenue growth in 2014. We discuss the first of these pillars below.In the middle of 2013, amidst an already difficult time for the business, Polycom found itself mired in scandal as CEO Andrew Miller resigned after the board's audit committee identified multiple irregularities in his expense reports. While these irregularities were not enough to cause the company to restate its financials, they nevertheless left the company without a permanent CEO at a time of turmoil, further contributing to weakness in the company's stock price. Director Kevin Parker was named interim CEO as a search began for a permanent CEO. That search ended in December 2013, when the company appointed Peter Leav as its next permanent CEO. Leav came to Polycom from NCR (NYSE:NCR), where he last served as its executive vice president of field operations, overseeing markets delivering billions in annual revenue, far larger than Polycom's annual revenues of less than $1.5 billion. And in March of this year, the company commenced yet another executive overhaul, appointing Laura Durr as its interim CFO (she has since been named permanent CFO) and eliminating its COO position, consolidating the duties of former COO Eric Brown under Peter Leav. In that press release, Polycom reiterated that expanding its operating margins is the company's top priority for 2014, and with a new management team in place, Polycom has worked diligently to deliver on its cost cutting programs, which form the 2nd pillar of the company's turnaround strategy. The positive impact of these cuts can be clearly seen in the company's Q3 2014 earnings and its year-to-date performance, which we discuss below.Q3 Results: As Revenue Growth Approaches, Restructuring ContinuesPolycom's results for the 3rd quarter demonstrate the company's clear commitment to restructuring its operations, and while the path ahead may not be linear, we believe that Polycom's performance so far this year demonstrates that over the next several years, the company is well positioned to continue expanding its operating margins as it returns to revenue growth. We will begin our discussion of Polycom's Q3 and year-to-date results with the company's financial performance, and then shift our discussion to its market position, which is the third pillar of the company's turnaround plan.For the third quarter of 2014, Polycom posted revenues of $335.686 million and pro forma EPS of $0.22; this represents a revenue beat relative to consensus of $0.83 million and an EPS beat of two cents. We present a consolidated overview of Polycom's Q3 results in the table below.Polycom Q3 2014 Results (in Thousands of $)For the third quarter of 2014, Polycom's revenues declined by just 23 basis points, well below the 237 basis point decline the company has posted for the first three quarters of the year. Gross margins however, have already begun to show signs of expansion; in Q3, consolidated gross margins rose by 37 basis points to 59.39%, versus an 8 basis point decline for the first three quarters of the year. CFO Laura Durr notes that this expansion is largely a function of a stable pricing environment. Polycom's margins have been slightly volatile from quarter to quarter, as the company's revenue base moves between various product lines and geographies, but in the aggregate, it has begun to shown signs of stabilization. While we do not believe that the company can easily move gross margins back up to their historical levels in the 62%+ range, we nevertheless believe that in the medium term, the pressures on Polycom's gross margins are being held at bay, which has allowed the company to fully realize the benefits of its meaningful cuts in operating expenses.While it is true that Polycom's revenues did decline slightly in Q3, operating expenses fell far faster, declining almost 7% in both absolute dollars and as a percent of sales (from 51.37% a year ago to 47.89%). Expenses fell in all categories on a year-over year basis, pushing up operating income 50% year-over-year, and leading to an almost 400 basis point jump in operating margins to 11.5% in Q3, and a 244 basis point expansion year-to-date. Polycom's commitment to cost discipline has allowed it to bring margins back up past its 2012 level of 10.81%, and further expansion is set for the 4th quarter, as per the company's guidance, which we present below (note: all figures for Q4 are given at the midpoint of Polycom's range, and figures for 2014 are calculated by adding Polycom's Q4 2014 guidance with its year-to-date results).Polycom Q4 2014 Guidance (in Thousands of $)In Q4, total revenue is projected to fall by 27 basis points to $347 million at the midpoint of guidance. But, a 28 basis point expansion in gross margins is set to boost total gross profits by 20 basis points. We note that operating expenses are set to continue their fall; at the midpoint of Polycom's guidance range, total operating expenses are set to decline by over 4% (and 74 basis points as a percent of sales), leading to a 22% increase in operating income (equivalent to a 45 basis point increase in operating margins) and a 37.5% increase in EPS. When taking into account Polycom's year-to-date results, this amounts to a 24.25% increase in operating profits, and a significant expansion in operating margins as the company reduces expenses by over $44 million in 2014 as a whole.But while expense reductions and a stabilization of gross margins are worthy accomplishments, there is a limit to what Polycom can accomplish through these levers alone. In the long run, the company's turnaround will be complete via a return to revenue growth in conjunction with these initiatives. And while overall revenues fell in Q3 2014, there is more to the story than meets the eye. Buried within the company's results are the seeds of growth, giving us confidence that the company can meet consensus forecasts that call for a return to revenue growth in 2015. We turn now to Polycom's market position, which forms the third pillar of its turnaround.For all the headlines about slumping revenues and a decline in Polycom's market position, we believe that it is prudent to point out that the decline in Polycom's revenues, while certainly an issue, is not as large as the headlines suggest. Polycom's guidance for Q4 2014 (when combined with its year-to-date performance) implies full-year 2014 revenues of ~$1.34 billion, which represents a decline of just 4.2% from the company's peak 2011 revenues of ~$1.4 billion, a far cry from the double-digit revenue declines seen at many companies in the midst of restructuring their operations. However, Polycom's new management team has made clear that this level of performance is unacceptable, and in Q3 2014, the company worked diligently to move itself closer to a return to revenue growth. While total revenues fell 23 basis points in Q3 2014, much of the decline was due to the loss of Cisco-related OEM revenue, which was included in Q3 2013 results, to the tune of $10 million. Absent the impact of this deal, Polycom's revenue grew by 3% year-over-year, suggesting that the health of the company's underlying business is improving. The company continued to expand its customer base in the quarter, signing up another branch of the Department of Defense as a collaboration server customer, and both a leading U.S. law school and medical center, which between them inked deals both Lync voice deployment products and telepresence solutions. And in Europe, Polycom displaced one of its competitors at defense contractor based in the continent that chose Polycom's Lync-based technology [a product of its partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)] in favor of other platforms (more on market share to follow). As a result of the ongoing shift to telepresence within the video communications market, group series revenues now account for 58% of Polycom's total video endpoint sales, up from 43% in Q2 2014. As a reminder for those unfamiliar with Polycom's revenue classification system, the company's revenue base is broken into three broad segments, which we detail below.In Q3 2014, Polycom's headline revenue decline was driven by UC Group Systems sales, which fell 2% year-over-year, due to the impact of the Cisco OEM deal. As CFO Laura Durr noted on the company's earnings call, that segments revenue would have been flat year-over-year when adjusting for the impact of the Cisco deal. Within the UC Platform segment, revenue was flat year-over-year. We remind investors that the platform segment is particularly exposed to end market volatility, and has a structurally higher rate of fluctuation than Polycom's two other divisions. And finally, UC Personal Devices sales grew by 6%. We present a consolidated overview of Polycom's revenues by segment in the table below.Polycom Revenues by Segment (in Millions of $)We direct investors' attention to Polycom's sequential performance. As the table above shows, Polycom's revenues grew by 1.11% sequentially in Q3 2014, and the company's guidance for Q4 2014 calls for an acceleration in sequential growth to 3.37%. Polycom's revenue weakness is largely confined to its UC Group Systems segment, and as the impact of the Cisco OEM deal begins to fade in 2015, the segment's underlying growth should begin to come to the forefront. Furthermore, Polycom has stabilized many of its markets on a geographic basis as well, both here in the U.S. and abroad. Revenue in the Americas, which totals ~50% of Polycom's sales, was down 6% year-over-year. However, this decline was once again caused by the Cisco OEM deal; absent this, revenues were flat year-over-year. However, sales outside of the Americas performed much better. In Asia, total revenues grew by 8% year-over-year as strength in China and India. CEO peter Leav specifically cited the company's performance in China, where new sales and management teams are allowing Polycom to take market share within the country. And in the EMEA region, sales increased 5% year-over-year, as weakness in Russia was more than offset by strong performance in France, the U.K., and Spain.Much of the company's stabilization in sales can be tied to its deep slate of partnerships with multiple companies in the technology and telecommunications sectors, such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), AT&T (NYSE:T), and most importantly, Microsoft. These partnerships have proven to be fruitful for Polycom, and in the coming quarters, we expect to see new offerings from the company and its partners to help restore Polycom to revenue growth. Management hinted at this on the Q3 earnings call, telling analysts and investors to ""expect to see Polycom deepen its strategic relationships with partners like Microsoft."" Given that much of the Q3 earnings call was devoted to the financial results of the quarter in order to extract as much evidence as possible relating to the company's restructuring, we expect more color on underlying product and service launches to be given on Polycom's Q4 2014 call, to be held in January 2015. But, evidence of Polycom's strength in the enterprise video conferencing market can be seen in its market share. While figures for Q3 2014 are not yet available, statistics for Q2 2014 suggest that the company's position is continuing to improve. We present an overview of Polycom's market share versus its chief competitors over the past four quarters.Source: IDCPer figures from IDC, Polycom's market share at the end of Q2 2014 (the most recent quarter for which figures are available), Polycom held 30.3% of the global videoconferencing market, up over a full percentage point from the 29.2% it held at the end of Q2 2014. Polycom has fully erased the decline in market share it saw in the 2nd half of 2013, and management has said that it believe that Polycom gained further share in Q3 (assuming a similar timeline as 2013, we believe that market share statistics for Q3 2014 will be released in early December). We note that between Q2 2013 and Q2 2014, Polycom narrowed the market share gap between itself and Cisco from 1,180 basis points down to 810 basis points, and we believe that a further narrowing of the gap is likely to have occurred in Q3 2014.Overall, we believe that Polycom's results for Q3 2014 demonstrate that the company's turnaround is on track. Polycom has delivered clear and material cost cuts throughout its business while working to stabilize its revenues, with headline results masked by the impact of the Cisco OEM deal. Furthermore, the company is taking market share within the videoconferencing market, closing the gap between itself and Cisco, and further share gains are likely in Q3. However, despite the clear progress that the company has made, shares of Polycom remain undervalued. We now turn to a discussion of Polycom's valuation and financial position.Valuation & FinancialsWe believe that at under $13, shares of Polycom are undervalued in light of the company's expanding market share, the clear progress that the company has made in turning itself around, and its solid financial position. And in our view, as Polycom continues to restructure its operations and stabilize its revenues, the company's multiples will re-rate to match its trajectory. We present an overview of Polycom's financial position, and its forward consensus estimates (per figures form Bloomberg) in the table below (note: share price and consensus estimates are accurate as of the close of October 28, 2014 and are subject to change).Polycom Financial & Growth Profile (in Thousands of $)Source: company filings, BloombergAs the table above shows, Polycom is set to return to revenue growth in 2015, with 2016 revenues projected to eclipse Polycom's 2011 revenue record. But, while sales are projected to grow by less than 3% over the next 3 years, EBIT is set to grow by more than 40%, as Polycom's cost cuts flow through its P&L. However, EPS is set to more than double by the end of 2016 to $1.13; this growth is the result of not only Polycom's underlying operational improvements, but also judicious deployment of capital on share repurchases. In 2013, as its stock price was in the doldrums, Polycom took on debt to fund an aggressive share repurchase program. In 2013 alone, the company repurchased over $500 million of stock, and over $35 million so far this year. These buybacks have left Polycom well-positioned to realize meaningful EPS growth in the years to come, and helping move the company closer to its historical levels of performance. We note that despite its aggressive 2013 buybacks, Polycom's balance sheet remains solid. The company ended Q3 2014 with almost $300 million in net cash & investments, equivalent to $2.92 per share, or almost 23% of its current market capitalization.However, despite its clear signs that the company is delivering on its turnaround plan, shares of Polycom continue to trade at modest multiples. Shares trade at a 2014 EV/EBIT multiple of less than 9x, despite consensus estimates that call for EBIT to grow by almost 25% this year. On an annualized basis, Polycom is set to grow EBIT by 12.99% over the next three years. And while EPS is set to rebound by more than 49% in 2014, shares of Polycom trade at just over 12x 2014 EPS, and less than 9x 2016 EPS, despite forecasts that call for annualized EPS growth of 27.5% over the next three years (even if we adjust for Polycom's 2013 EPS of $0.68, annualized growth over that 4-year period is set to come in at 13.54%, implying that Polycom is undervalued on a PEG basis). We believe that it is best to value Polycom on a blend of EV/EBIT and P/E, given that these two metrics best encapsulate the effect of the company's restructuring and share repurchases. We calculate our price target for shares of Polycom in the table below.Polycom Price TargetOur target multiples for Polycom are based on the annualized growth rates for both EBIT and EPS over the next three years for EBIT, and the 2013-2017 period for EPS (a compound annual growth rate of 13.54%), both discounted at 10%. Blending these two targets together yields a pro forma price target of $17.33 for shares of Polycom, implying upside of 34.34% for shares of Polycom relative to their October 28, 2014 closing price of $12.90.Key to unlocking this value will be continued execution by the company. Polycom's guidance for Q4 calls for further double-digit growth in operating profits and EPS, and we believe that guidance for Q1 2015, to be issued in January 2015, will call for a continuation of this trend. Secondly, the release of Q3 2014 market share figures for the enterprise videoconferencing market is likely to act as another catalyst, as there are signs that Polycom gained further market share in the 3rd quarter. And as investor and analyst focus turns begins to turn to new product launches in 2015, we believe that this will help ease concerns about Polycom's position in the market relative to Cisco, which should serve as yet another catalyst for the company's shares.ConclusionsAt present levels, we see shares of Polycom as trading well below fair value. While the company's current performance is below its historical levels, Polycom has made tangible progress in turning itself around. Both operating profits and EPS are set to increase by double digits in 2014 as Polycom continues to reign in its bloated cost structure and extract benefits from its share repurchases. And over the past year, Polycom has gained market share within the videoconferencing market, both on an absolute basis and in relation to Cisco, whom it now trails by 810 basis points on a global basis. As the company's return to revenue growth approaches, we believe that now is the time to add to or initiate positions in shares of Polycom, as the company continues to restructure its operations, take market share, and work to restore its results to their historical levels."
483551,25120,2012-04-08T13:49:24-04:00,,"Shares of Polycom (PLCM) fell 20% on Thursday after the provider of communication devices lowered its first quarter outlook.Lowered OutlookPolycom announced a first quarter outlook which came short of analyst expectations. The company expects net revenues of $364-$370 million for the first quarter of 2012, up some 7% at the midpoint of the range compared to last year. Earnings are expected to come in at $0.07-$0.09 on a GAAP basis compared to $0.19 last year.Analysts were expecting the company to report $400 million in revenue and earnings per share of $0.30. The videoconferencing company said revenues came in lower than expected as a result of demand shortfalls in Asia and North America. The results make investors wary about execution risk and increased competition. Polycom's CEO Miller says the company has expanded its sales force to compete more effectively with its major competitor Cisco.ValuationThe videoconferencing company holds over $530 million in cash and equivalents and operates without debt according to its latest quarterly release. With a market value of $2.5 billion, this values operating assets at around $2 billion. After the significant decline in its share price, Polycom trades around 1.3 times annual revenue and 15 times annual earnings. This ratio compares to a a revenue multiple of 2.3 times and earnings multiple of 16 times for its major competitor Cisco (CSCO)Investment ThesisShares have fallen some 60% after reaching an all time high of around $34 in July last year after the company announced a string of disappointing outlooks. While the miss is quite severe and execution risks are on the rise, the extend of the correction could provide long term investors with an interesting entry point.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
1969861,56152,2014-01-28T11:00:00-05:00,,"Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM): A Decent Risk/Reward OpportunityOverviewIn a year when the market ripped 30%, PLCM failed to find its footing and shares remained relatively stagnant. The stock is just hanging around although it has made an 8% move to the upside over the last couple of weeks on a fairly decent fourth quarter report. There are some simple yet valuable trends unfolding that I believe should provide material upside to the shares with comparatively less downside. Currently, the stock is priced at 1.8x book value with an 8% free cash flow yield. This modest valuation coupled with the following points provides material upside over the next year:Ultimately, I view this as a simple operating plan that just needs to be executed in order for the stock to react appropriately. Aside from cost cuts and new product launches, there are upcoming revenue catalysts. PLCM has announced major partnerships with tech giants including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM, HP (NYSE:HPQ), and AT&T (NYSE:T) to do battle with its largest rival, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), whom Polycom has steadily been taking market share from. There have also been substantial unusual expenses running through Polycom's income statement and the company has not been able to report a clean quarter this year as a result. The company is a strong cash flow generator and has shown an affinity to take money off the table via buybacks, which will only improve return on equity and valuation going forward, as the fact of the matter is that PLCM doesn't need the $584 million of cash carried on its books to fund its operations. I believe the stock has 15 - 25% upside based on improving fundamentals, comparable multiples, and strong cash flow, which may provide for further share repurchases.New CEO, Continued Cost CutsPolycom has been through somewhat of a transitional period the last two years: in mid-2012, the company announced it was divesting its enterprise wireless voice solutions business for $110 million. The company subsequently announced it would be launching a ""game-changing"" series of products in 2H12 and early 2013 intended to aid Polycom in its quest to sell both software and cloud-based delivery models that will ultimately allow the company to layer ratable services revenues on top of the enterprise solutions already offered.PLCM recorded over $50 million in cumulative restructuring charges over the last three years stemming from facility consolidation and workforce reductions (announced ~4% global headcount reduction in 1H12). The company didn't report a clean quarter through all of 2013, although management announced further cost cuts on the 4Q conference call and the stock has traded well on the cost cut / share buyback story. Despite booking an $0.11 GAAP loss per share for the year, PLCM generated $130 million in adjusted EBITDA and $113 million in free cash flow (8% yield on today's enterprise value) and distributed 4.5x that figure in share repurchases. I view the cost cuts as a simple way to boost operating margins (which is management's #1 priority for 2014) which will serve as a nice one-two punch when coupled with earnings accretion provided for by repurchasing 23% of the company, as well as upcoming revenue catalysts in the forms of major tech partnerships and growing services revenues.Additionally, former CEO Andrew Miller resigned earlier in 2013 after personal expense reporting irregularities surfaced - last month, his replacement was named. Peter Leav joined PLCM after a fairly successful run at NCR Corp. (NYSE:NCR), a time during which the company grew revenues 24% and the stock was nearly a four-bagger.SegmentsPolycom has three operating segments:Tech PartnershipsPreviously mentioned RealPresence is open and interoperable with hundreds of business applications (backwards/forwards compatible) thus it appears to be a nice feature for clients wanting to protect their IT investments. RealPresence is extremely important to Polycom, particularly in its fight against heavyweight Cisco: several of PLCM's major tech partners (including MSFT, IBM, HP, and AT&T) run their enterprise products through RealPresence… for example, RealPresence is the first and only MCU solution qualified for Microsoft Lync and over 70% of conferencing phones sold with Lync are made by Polycom.Lync is growing exponentially (MSFT reported Lync revenue growth of 30% and 25% in its last two quarters), and Polycom management has noted their own Lync-related growth rates are tracking this closely. MSFT's Lync related revenue surpassed $1 billion in FY13 while its voice software license sales grew 150% on top of a 5 million seat installed base (MSFT is now shipping more enterprise voice lines than any other tech company in the world). PLCM is well-aligned with MSFT by supporting the Lync video standard while licensing key pieces of technology to MSFT in return. Avaya and Cisco lost significant chunks of market share in 2012 partially because of this.AT&T is rolling out its Video as a Service offering in 4Q, which will utilize RealPresence infrastructure. PLCM released its latest cloud-based version of RealPresence in 4Q to coincide with this to deploy cloud-delivered video communications services through the AT&T Business Exchange. AT&T is selling its service as a Managed Service Bundle, which includes Polycom's products. This means AT&T will be driving pull-through revenues for PLCM endpoint products. Additionally, Cisco products were already a part of the AT&T Business Exchange - introducing Polycom to the channel means the company gains access to a giant chunk of the market it was likely previously cut off from due to Cisco penetration. The ""bundling"" aspect of the product offering is a plus due to the cost savings afforded to small/medium businesses, a historically underserved segment of the market.In 3Q11, Polycom acquired HP's visual collaboration business, making PLCM's enterprise-grade video applications available for HP's webOS platform, substantially widening the company's addressable market. PLCM and HP both share a strategic ally in MSFT and the operating mechanics here are similar to the AT&T Business Exchange relationship. Furthermore, PLCM has a new product titled ""CloudAxis"" (software allowing RealPresence to collaborate with anyone instantly through a web browser) that is being bundled with RealPresence: this product has 90% margins and is meant to drive pull-through revenues from customers. Because it is typically sold as a part of the RealPresence platform, PLCM might sell $1 worth of CloudAxis which can pull $4-$5 worth of general RealPresence Platform revenue in with it (margin on this entire revenue opportunity is higher than Polycom's corporate average).Growing Services BusinessPolycom has a growing services business (21% four-year CAGR) that makes up about 28% of total revenue. Now that the company has launched its own software and cloud-based delivery models, Polycom can sell its own bundled offering with hardware revenue pull-through traits and larger managed services opportunities (clients outsource the maintenance of the RealPresence platform to PLCM who specializes in it, rather than the client maintaining a large in-house IT service team to deal with it). PLCM can then layer a ratable monthly services on top of this - the recently-launched software offering will also give the company a direct counterpoint to all the new things the startups are doing (i.e. Skype, freeware), except PLCM has the brand, balance sheet, public company status, and trusted reputation.According to management, PLCM's ""largest and most strategic customers"" have an appetite for significantly higher levels of service engagement. Incremental service revenue streams associated with maintenance renewal rates flow through the company's income statement with very high gross margin profiles. Because the company was traditionally a hardware vendor, ""services"" included warranties and installations - services on hardware typically amount to 8-12% of product revenue relative to the 20% more common on enterprise software maintenance attachments. The move to a software-based delivery model allows PLCM to sell services at higher price points, which according to management, sell at a 50-60% premium versus ""standard"" maintenance contracts. The overall service market is roughly $1.5 billion today and should grow at an 8-9% 3-year CAGR.PLCM's renewal rates were historically in the low 40% range - added 10 or 11 points throughout 2013 by the end of 3Q and noted a 10-point year-over-year renewal base improvement on the 4Q13 conference call. With respect to adding larger managed services accounts, management has noted several ""large"" $10+ million contracts, which are extremely accretive to operating margins.ValuationI believe Polycom's valuation is relatively modest in light of the following trends: (1) revenue generating initiatives/opportunities including partnerships and product rollouts from major tech partners and growing high-margin service revenue opportunities, (2) cost cuts and opex re-engineering to improve earnings power and margins, and (3) 8% free cash flow yields with EBITDA poised to grow in FY14, allowing for substantial returns of capital to shareholders which will improve ROE going forward.On January 15th, Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ:RVBD) rejected a buyout offer at $19 / share, several days after Citigroup noted it expected a similar outcome and that a financial buyer could pay over $23 / share and earn over 20% annually, while a strategic buyer could pay up to $25. In the same note, Citi stated that the buyout math for PLCM looked attractive as well and that a financial buyer could pay over $14 / share for the company (18% upside). This would peg PLCM's enterprise value at a modest 11.5x its trailing three-year average free cash flow, not unreasonable to me in light of the company's ongoing improvements or the fact that it earned $136 million two years ago on a substantially higher share count.Management's goal is double-digit operating margins in FY14 and 15%+ margins in FY15. Holding revenue flat and applying a 10% margin gets me to about $0.55 in after-tax EPS, and 20% takes PLCM's earnings power to over $1 / share. Considering everything I've discussed, I believe revenue is poised to rebound somewhat which potentially understates my earnings estimates. I think worst-case scenario is the company continues to print weak top-line numbers (there's a possibility that legacy type products may decline faster than offsetting high-growth categories) while improving margins and generating cash flow, which could lead to more buybacks this year.SummaryAfter the S&P's strong performance in 2013, I believe PLCM offers decent risk/reward. Shares haven't really budged over the last year despite building momentum with tech partners, stealing market share from larger competitors, right-sizing the company's cost structure, and repurchasing a boatload of stock. I like the combination of improving revenue initiatives in the form of tech partner product rollouts and PLCM endpoint interoperability, continued cost cut efforts, and returns of capital to shareholders and believe it will lead to double-digit upside at a 15 - 25% magnitude in 2014.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

While those moves may have dented personal pride, when companies make failed moves, it hits their bottom line. Videoconferencing giant Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM) is experiencing that pain today. The company announced on Friday that it is divesting its enterprise wireless communications assets for just $110m to Sun Capital Partners, or about half the price that it paid for the business five years ago.Polycom entered the wireless communications market in 2007 when it paid $220m for then publicly traded SpectraLink - its largest-ever acquisition (today's divestiture also includes the assets of Kirk Telecom, which SpectraLink acquired for $61m in 2005). While we had doubts, Polycom argued that its rationale for the deal was sound. Polycom thought it would be able to boost revenue by leveraging the two companies' complementary sales channels as well as by merging their server-side software products into a single platform.Polycom, however, wasn't able to generate the revenue that it expected from the acquired assets. The SpectraLink and Kirk Telecom assets dwindled within their newfound parent, falling from $144m in revenue in 2006 to about half that, $94m, in 2011.Not to pick on Polycom, but its SpectraLink divestiture is just the most recent reminder of the risks involved in attempting game-changing acquisitions. Companies use M&A to enter new markets all the time, and often fail. HP shuttered its Palm Inc business just one year after paying $1.4bn for the company. And in 2010, Yahoo (YHOO) divested its Zimbra collaboration assets for $100m, or less than one-third of the $350m that it paid for the company in 2007. Cisco attempted to move into the consumer video segment when it paid $590m for Pure Digital Technologies, maker of the Flip video camera, but shut down that division two years later."

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for  the fourth quarter is pegged at 21 cents, representing an annualized  growth of 2.5%.With respect to earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters,  Polycom missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four  quarters but surpassed the same in the remaining two with an average  earnings surprise of 4.59%.Third Quarter RecapOn October 19, 2011, Polycom reported its third quarter 2011 financial  results. Total revenue in the third quarter of 2011 was approximately  $379 million, up 23% year over year, but below the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $388 million. The year-over-year increase in revenue was  mainly due to growing sales in the U.S. Federal markets and several  emerging economies, partially offset by lower sales of big businesses.GAAP net income in the third quarter was $23.7 million or 13 cents per  share compared with $17.3 million or 10 cents per share in the  prior-year quarter. However, adjusted (excluding special items) EPS in  the reported quarter was 16 cents; considerably lower than the Zacks  Consensus Estimate of 21 cents.Gross margin in the reported quarter was 59.8% compared with 59.3% in  the year-ago quarter. Quarterly operating margin was 7.8% compared with  7.5% in the year-ago quarter.Agreement of Estimate RevisionsIn the last 30 days, out of the eight analysts covering the stock, none  increased or decreased their estimates for the fourth quarter of 2011.

Similarly, for fiscal 2011 and 2012, the  current Zacks Consensus Estimates were at par with the previous  estimates of 76 cents and 92 cents, respectively.Earning SurprisesThe current Zacks Consensus Estimates for both the ongoing quarter and  the next quarter reflects a 0.00% upside potential (essentially a proxy  for future earning surprises), respectively. Similarly, fiscal 2011 and  2012 holds an upside potential of 0.00%, respectively.Our RecommendationPolycom is well positioned financially to pursue its future ventures.  Increased demand for video-conferencing services, mainly from India and  China coupled with overall improvement of marketing and sales service  will boost the company’s market share.

1300911,45511,2013-03-27T11:11:49-04:00,,"ThesisLeon Cooperman of Omega filed a 13G on March 14th after amassing 9.6 million shares, a roughly 5.4% ownership in Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM). The stock jumped 5% that day on the announcement taking it barely into positive territory for the year after a horrific 2012 that saw the stock drop 36%. Omega joins other top Polycom holders Maverick, Coatue, and AQR. What has changed to warrant an investment in this big 2012 underperformer? Polycom exhibits all the characteristics of a stock that has bottomed and is poised to outperform: (1) strong valuation support with 40% of market cap in cash, (2) numbers upside in 2013 as revenue and margins have bottomed, (3) rejuvenated product portfolio along with a compelling new product cycle, and (4) aggressive stock buyback.Industry and Company BackgroundPolycom provides the infrastructure and end points that allow enterprises to communicate and collaborate with each other. Traditionally when one thinks of Polycom they think of the voice or video teleconference consoles that were used in conference rooms. Recently, as solutions such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Lync/Skype and mobile devices in general have proliferated, voice/video collaboration have extended outside of conference rooms and onto the desktop or mobile device.The telepresence and video system market is expected to show an 11.3% CAGR through 2016 according to Gartner. The traditional single screen systems will decline almost 10% more than offset by the strong growth in personal devices. Polycom and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) were the only two vendors to achieve ""strong positive"" ratings in Gartner's September 2012 MarketScope report. Huawei and Vidyo received ""good"" reviews while Avaya, Lifesize and Teliris received ""promising"" reviews. Polycom and Cisco together control 75% of the Unified Communications video and voice collaboration market. Cisco is the largest market shareholder and most viable competitor as it has consolidated some key acquisitions in the space- Webex, Jabber and Tandberg. Polycom has aligned itself well with Microsoft Lync unified communications platform by natively supporting their Real-Time Video standard and in return licensing its SVC video codec to Microsoft (footnote: Gartner report). Polycom also has a strong relationship with IBM (NYSE:IBM).Polycom's revenue stream consists of three main components: (1) Core Unified Communications Platform (i.e. 'Real Presence') is the software infrastructure installed on servers that provide, manage, and secure video communication and collaboration. This segment has accounted for 18% of revenue in 2011 and 2012. (2) Unified Group Systems consist of telepresence and video conference systems and represented the bulk of revenue (69%) in 2011 and 2012. (3) The Unified Personal Devices are for the mobile user, home office, desktop and branch office. This group represents 12% of revenue the last two years.Video Conference Hardware Refresh will Provide Resurgence2012 was clearly a transition year for the video conferencing market with both market leaders (Polycom and Cisco) experiencing revenue declines. Polycom's 2012 revenue declined 1% year over year. Polycom's slide was exacerbated by weakness in sales of its product suite ahead of its broad product upgrade that was unveiled in October 2012. These products started rolling out in Q4'12 through Q2'13. However, the market appears to be poised to resume growth led by the ever increasing importance of unified communications led by Microsoft with its Lync and Skype offerings. According to Goldman Sachs IT Spending Survey as of October 2012, more than 2x the amount of respondents (30% vs. 14%) expect to increase videoconferencing hardware spend in the next 12 months vs. its December 2011 reading. According to management:The upgraded product suite consisted of (1) Real Presence Platform (2) Improved user interface and upgraded endpoints. (3) new mid market solutions, and most importantly (4) CloudAXIS. Polycom expands its TAM by addressing the SMB market through two new offerings. First, its new low end 300 device is its first ever sub $5,000 device. Second, the 800s virtualized server allows SMB's to utilize cheap industry standard servers for deployment.CloudAXIS Possibly the Company's Secret WeaponCloudAXIS is a software product add-on that allows a user on the Real Presence platform to securely collaborate via video with anyone instantly from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Skype, Google Talk (NASDAQ:GOOG) through their browser. This product automatically searches your address books of Skype, Facebook, Google Talk and shows users' status availability. The user sends an invite to a colleague or friend and by clicking on the hyperlink they are joined to the conversation through their browser. Both parties would then be allowed to exchange content. Maintenance for the product will cost 20% of the license fee vs. the typical 8-12% fee. The product is currently in beta and the feedback according to the CFO has been very positive especially in certain industries specifically attuned to B2C like financial services or in B2B supply chain collaboration. It will ship in limited quantities at the end of the current March quarter and will be generally available during the June quarter. Given the limited shipments in the March quarter, I would expect to start seeing the positive impact in the June quarter and more pronounced impact in the second half of 2013. In addition, customers must be current on the latest Real Presence platform to purchase the software. CloudAXIS given its all software should increase the overall software component for the company from the low 5% of revenue in 2012. According to Goldman Sachs, every 100 bps increase in software contribution increases the overall gross margins 10-20bps and increases overall EPS by one penny.Numbers Upside in 2013 Plus BuybackConsensus revenue is modeled up roughly 4% year over year in 2013 excluding divestitures, a very modest increase given the broad product upgrade. Other revenue catalysts in 2013 include Microsoft Lync integrating Skype in June, which should buoy Polycom related revenue. Note Polycom acquired Sentri earlier this year to advance its Lync offering. Sentri specializes in integrating Lync and Polycom deployments. In addition, AT&T will be rolling out its Video as a Service offering where they will be utilizing Polycom's Real Presence infrastructure.In 2010 and 2011, Polycom grew its revenue 26% and 28%, respectively. I expect Polycom revenue to increase 10% for the year with an acceleration in the second half. Consensus models gross margins falling 10 bps to 60.2% despite an increasing software mix, I think the Street has mis-modeled this line for sure. R&D increased 7% in 2H'12 as the company aggressively rolled out their upgraded product portfolio. Meanwhile revenue declined 2% weighing down operating margins to 11.1%. Yet the Street models an additional operating margin decline to 10.5%, too draconian even assuming the refreshed product portfolio was a dud. My model assumes operating margins expanding over 100 bps to 12%+ roughly $0.80 in 2013 EPS vs. $0.67 modeled by the Street. Note the company operated at 14-18% operating margins in 2009-2011 before sagging to 11% in 2012. The company continues to maintain its long term 2015 operating margin target of 20%. I think over the next couple of years the company has a very manageable task to grow margins back to the mid teens.Very Favorable Risk/RewardAt current levels, Polycom trades at 0.8x EV to 2013 revenue, 16x 2013 depressed P/E and 6.7x 2013 FCF. I think P/E is misleading given Street earnings estimates are way too low given there is no growth or margin expansion modeled despite the refreshed product portfolio and higher software content. Even assuming these ultra conservative estimates, the stock trades at very cheap levels. On my estimates, the stock trades at 13.5x '13 and 11x '14 P/E. One additional catalyst is the stock buyback especially at these low levels. On March 6th at the Wedbush Conference, CFO stated that:Yet the Street is not modeling any decline in shares outstanding for 2013. While the March quarter may not provide upside, PLCM is a must own at these levels with 2H catalysts galore. Join the smart money and buy PLCM before it's too late.Disclosure: I am long PLCM.

The company was founded in 1990 and is headquartered in Pleasanton, California.It wasn't a pleasant earnings release for Polycom, and here are some of the reasons for the selling pressure today. Within the first two hours of trading, the volume is about three times the average for an entire day.Business expenditures increased to $196.9 million from $159.6 million. This number does not appear to totally disappoint, and largely in line with the growth. In fact, the growth numbers are very good compared to most companies, but investors are not going to pay a 30+ earnings multiple in this economic environment unless the top and bottom lines are building fast.While continuing to grow, Polycom disappointed investors yesterday afternoon with their earnings results. Revenue increased to $379 million from $308.1 million for the same period last year; however analysts estimate a greater increase, to $387.3 million.Gross reported revenue compared to the mean estimate (rounded).M = millions, B = billionsNot including one-time items, Polycom generated 26 cents a share. Polycom reported net income of$23.7 million, or 13 cents per share, compared to $17.3 million, or 10 cents per share, for the same period last year.Reported earnings per share compared to the mean estimate. Based on the conference call, it appears the sky is not actually falling.Andy Miller, Polycom’s President and CEO had these things to say during the call.Look for selling pressure throughout today and Friday. If closing on lows Friday, Polycom will be setup as a technical buy due to the dead cat bounce expected on Monday. A retracement into $18 a share appears reasonable as value buyers pick up shares while on discount.With the current panic selling that likely will last through today, I will be watching for an entry to short put options as early as Friday afternoon. With the earnings disappointment fully priced in, I believe any further selling will be a mistake below the range we are in.After cooler heads review the value, next week should see stabilization in price compared to this week. I believe this will set up a great opportunity to short put options. Tomorrow is option expiration Friday, so I will skip the front month and look at the November series. I want to be able to collect enough premium to provide a buffer if the selling pressure continues. Currently, it appears the $12.50 strike price put option offers the sweet spot in terms of premium, risk and liquidity. Perhaps more strike prices will get opened up tomorrow.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in PLCM over the next 72 hours."
301098,24414,2011-10-21T04:47:18-04:00,,"Competitive and macro-economic pressures led to video-conferencing gear vendor Polycom Inc. (NASDAQ:PLCM) disappointing Wall Street. However, after a 50% drop in the last three months, do the fundamentals support a buy at these levels? And how does the stock compare to its peers in the videoconferencing space? This article is aimed at answering these and other questions, and evaluates if the impending bounce in the coming days and weeks will be one to buy, or if it is a dead-cat bounce that should be sold.PLCM reported that in the September quarter, both revenue and earnings growth decelerated for this high-flier that had risen a torrid six-fold to its peak in July at $34.30 from the crisis lows in 2008-09. Furthermore, it also missed analyst estimates for both revenue ($379 million versus $389 million) and earnings (26c versus 27c). The company blamed the miss on a slowdown in enterprise spending related to the weak US economy that pushed a few key transactions into the December quarter due to the lengthened sales cycle.Furthermore, it lowered its guidance for operating margins from 20%-22% to a range of 18%-20% due to investments it needs to make in its partnerships with International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), and in the mobile and social media spaces. A bunch of analysts (including Pipar Jaffray, William Blair, Morgan Keegan, Stifel Nicolaus, and others), however, weighed in and expressed skepticism that PLCM would even meet its sales goals (besides margin goals) due to both the macro-economic issues that the company cited, as well as competitive issues. They lowered ratings on PLCM across the board, and also lowered the price target to the low-to-mid-$20s from the above $30 range prior to the quarter report.During the conference call, the company defended its competitive strength against its chief rival Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), insisting that while the current quarter was a disappointment, it doesn't look at market share on a quarterly basis. The company cited that in the last half of 2010, it gained 8 points of market share against CSCO, and in the first quarter of 2011, it gained 5 points in market share.Cisco became PLCM’s main competitor after it purchased Tandberg, a global leader in uniform collaborative communications (UCC), and merged it into its own high-end videoconferencing division. The company also indicated that in the case of Chinese telecom equipment vendor Huawei, although it has a presence in international markets, the PLCM product is far superior and more competitive.Overall, the videoconferencing sector has excellent long-term fundamentals, as you have cost-savings drivers, on the one hand, that propel corporations to shift meetings to online in a tough economy, and then you also have revenue-enhancement drivers. Furthermore, the continuing pace of globalization is also a strong driver, and so is the proliferation of online learning and remote medical care. Gartner has projected that the videoconferencing market is expected to grow rapidly at 18% between 2008 and 2013.PLCM is one of the only pure play publicly traded companies in video-conferencing, with a 45% market share in terms of video endpoint shipments as reported in August. After Thursday’s fall, PLCM now trades at a cheap forward P/E of 11-12, while earnings are projected to increase at a 37% annual growth rate from 75c in 2010 to $1.39 in 2012. Furthermore, it also trades at a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 1.09. This is very reasonable, and a discount compared to its peers in the videoconferencing industry, as detailed below:Furthermore, PLCM is leveraging its strength in the enterprise market, and extending it to developing videoconferencing solutions for the desktop and for smartphones. It is working with leading mobile device vendors Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Motorola (NYSE:MSI) and Samsung in developing solutions for the mobile handset space. It also has strong business agreements with Hewlett-Packard Co., from who it acquired the Halo Visual Collaboration business in June. As part of that deal, PLCM struck an agreement with HPQ to be its exclusive partner for telepresence and certain video unified communications solutions for both internal HP deployments and for resale. Besides HPQ, PLCM also has strong business agreements with other vendors in the telecommunications industry, including telecom services providers Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) and AT & T Inc. (NYSE:T) in the U.S.; and with Telefonica SA (NYSE:TEF) for sales in Spain, the rest of Europe and in Latin America. In the social media space, PLCM recently announced the acquisition of ViVu, which gives it a fast track to embed video-enabled collaboration software into a wide range of web applications in social platforms. Furthermore, recently PLCM also announced a new partnership with social business platform Jive Software to integrate PLCM’s HD video into Jive’s business platform. Also, in March, PLCM acquired Accordent Technologies, a leading provider of video content management and delivery solutions, for $50 million in cash, increases PLCM’s market opportunity by $500 million.PLCM, despite the slight miss in the current quarter, is still posting healthy margins and generates consistent cash flow, and it also has a strong balance sheet and long-term operating performance record of rising revenues and earnings every year. It has a leading market share in the enterprise videoconferencing space, and is working on leveraging that strength into the mobile and social media spaces. After the fall Thursday, it is also trading at a discount to both its growth as well as to its peers in the videoconferencing space. We believe that it is a good value buy for the long-term investor, and would look to buy it here in stages to take advantage of any further weakness in the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
161855,20568,2009-09-16T12:53:45-04:00,,"We upgrade our recommendation to Outperform for Polycom Inc. (NASDAQ:PLCM) based on our assessment that the demand for the company’s unified collaborative communication offerings will continue to increase in the near future.  As a result of the severe economic downturn, business enterprises on a global basis are restricting travel budgets to control costs. This makes Polycom’s high-definition telepresence solutions a cost-effective alternative in an increasingly interactive world.   Polycom stands to gain as enterprises, governments, and educational institutions increasingly recognize the productivity-enhancing benefits of video conferencing. The company is a leading solutions provider for video conferencing, with an estimated 30%-40% share of the market. The Flagship RPX and TPX telepresence solutions continue to grow at a healthy rate. Newly launched RMX 2000 HD Videoconferencing Media Server version 4.0, Converged Management Application solutions, and Distributed Media Application solutions have attained encouraging market traction.   In addition, the company has a very sound balance sheet.  During the second quarter, the company achieved its 46th quarter of sequential positive cash flow from operations. A strong net cash position coupled with continued free cash flow generation remains a possible investment catalyst for Polycom especially under extremely tight credit market conditions.   The uniform collaborative communications market is fiercely competitive that has resulted in cut-throat pricing. Tandberg of Norway is the clear market leader in this segment. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS), 3COM Corp. j(OTCPK:COMS), and LifeSize Communications Inc. are the other major players in this market.   In order to maintain its profit margin, Polycom decided to reduce its workforce by 3% during the third quarter. Management stated that the headcount reduction was necessary to realign and reinvest resources in strategic growth areas. Last January, the company declared that it plans to reduce total headcount by 150 people during the current fiscal. However, Polycom did not initiate any workforce reduction program in the first half of 2009."

In the case of Polycom (NASDAQ:PLCM), the opposite may be true.This company provides communications solutions to enable voice, video and content communications. These solutions make businesses more efficient. They save money. For instance Polycom provides telepresence, room, desktop and personal video products. One person or a whole conference room full of people can meet effectively with another group via teleconferencing without having to travel thousands of miles to get there. With the cost of air travel going up as oil goes up, this would seem a business necessity. Aside from the travel costs, teleconferencing saves all of the travel time, which is a cost too. Not surprisingly Polycom has been doing well lately. It hit bottom at the market low in 2009, and it has been going up ever since. Few stocks have charts that look this nice.The two-year chart of PLCM is below:Click to enlarge  Why buy it now? Polycom has just made major new releases. It unveiled five new innovations at InfoComm to further accelerate unified communications. These addressed many major concerns of customers: scalability, interoperability, ease of use, price and performance. Polycom has even addressed the cloud-based networks with new software that gives it carrier class Telepresence in the cloud. It has formed a cloud consortium for open video exchange with leading telecom service providers such as Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Telefonica S.A. (NYSE:TEF) and AT&T (NYSE:T). It has a strong partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). It has recently made personnel moves designed to strengthen its leadership position in the public sector and in federal business. Polycom has recently bought Hewlett Packard’s (NYSE:HPQ) Visual Collaboration Business for $89M in cash. This should help it expand into some of the markets dominated by Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). All these announcements should give Polycom some near term upside. If the market starts to rally it should rally strongly with it. The fundamental financial data in the table below gives an investor an overall view of how viable an investment Polycom is. The data are from Yahoo Finance and TDameritrade.  All of the financial data above look good. The PE is on the high side, but this stock has been a fast grower. It is slated to grow 45.30 % this year. (Yahoo Finance). With its relatively high grow rate it still can go up. With its total lack of debt it can more easily be highly profitable. With PCLM’s multiples I would not want to buy it in a down trending market. However, it has a Beta of only 1.04, which is great for a fast grower. If the market starts to turn around, PCLM merit’s a “leg in” strategy. It should move up with the market. It may well move up much more quickly. The markets have been showing signs of rallying. However, today (Wednesday) may not be the day to test them. The EU ministers are having trouble agreeing on terms for the second Greek bailout. Plus Moody’s put several top French banks on review for a possible rating downgrade due to their exposure to Greek debt. It might be best to be wary today. For the longer term you will probably want to pay attention to a small company called Vidyo, which may give Polycom some competition in the future.

Over the last 30 days,  1 out of total 8 analysts covering the stock raised his earning  estimates for both the second quarter and fiscal 2010. No analyst made  any downward earning estimate revision during this period. The current  Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is 21 cents per share,  which is actually indicating a 5.11% fall from the prior-year result.   We believe increased competition in the videoconferencing market is the  main reason for this negative outlook. After Cisco System Inc’s (NASDAQ:CSCO) acquisition of Tandbarg  and Logitech International SA’s (NASDAQ:LOGI) purchase of LifeSize  Communications, Polycom is facing severe pricing pressure.   Nevertheless, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2010 is 93  cents per share, which indicates a substantial gain of 18.59% year over  year. We believe positive sentiments come from the future growth  potential of the videoconferencing industry. As a result of economic  downturn, business enterprises on a global basis are restricting travel  budgets as cost control measure. This makes Polycom’s high-definition  telepresence solutions a cost-induced alternative in an increasingly  interactive world.  Magnitude of Estimate Revisions   In synergy with the flat estimate revision trend, the Zacks Consensus  Estimate for the second quarter 2010 earnings per share remained the  same during the last 30 days. However, for fiscal 2010, the Zacks  Consensus Estimate decreased by 1 cent in the same time period.  Our Recommendation   Currently Polycom is a short-term Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock. This is  primarily due to several positive industry trends that may allow Polycom  to maintain healthy profit margins and a strong balance sheet. At the  same time, this is also our view that these positives are already  reflected in the current valuation leaving little room for above-market  gain. The stock price moved up 53% in the last one year. We thus  maintain our long-term Neutral recommendation for Polycom."

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate  for the third quarter is pegged at 21 cents, representing an annualized  growth of 79.71%.With respect to earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters,  Polycom has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the three  quarters except for the last quarter where it missed the Zacks Consensus  Estimate by 2 cents. The average earnings surprise was a positive  14.05%, implying that the company has outdone the Zacks Consensus  Estimate by the same magnitude during the same period.Second Quarter RecapOn July 21, 2011, Polycom reported its second quarter 2011 financial  results. Total revenue in the second quarter of 2011 was a record high  of $365.6 million, up 24.1% year over year, surpassing the Zacks  Consensus Estimate of $362 million. The increase in revenue was  primarily attributable to strong growth at both its voice and video  communications businesses.GAAP net income in the reported quarter was $28.5 million or 16 cents  per share compared with a net income of $12.6 million or 7 cents per  share in the prior-year quarter. However, adjusted (excluding special  items) EPS in the reported quarter was 19 cents, below the Zacks  Consensus Estimate of 21 cents.Gross margin in the reported quarter was 60.4% compared with 58% in the  year-ago quarter. Operating expenses in the reported quarter were  $182.1 million versus $155 million in the prior-year quarter. Quarterly  operating margin was 10.6% as against 5.4% in the year-ago quarter.Agreement of Estimate RevisionsIn the last 30 days, out of the 9 analysts covering the stock, none  increased or decreased their estimates for the third quarter of 2011.  Likewise, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, none of the analysts  raised their estimates but three analysts reduced their estimates.For fiscal 2011, in the last 30 days, out of the 9 analysts covering  the stock, none increased their estimates but two analysts decreased  their EPS estimate. Likewise, for fiscal 2012, out of the 9 analysts  covering the stock, none of the analysts raised their estimates but  three analysts reduced their estimates.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsDuring the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate was in line with  the ongoing quarter at 21 cents but for the fourth quarter of 2011, the  Zacks Consensus Estimate was a penny above the current estimate of 27  cents. Similarly, for fiscal 2011 the Zacks Consensus Estimate was a  penny above the current estimate of 86 cents. Likewise, for 2012, the  Zacks Consensus Estimate was 3 cents above the current Zacks estimate of  $1.17.Earning SurprisesIn the previous quarter, Polycom reported EPS of 19 cents, which beat  the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents. The current Zacks Consensus  Estimates for the ongoing quarter reflects a 0.00% downside potential  while the upcoming quarter contains a 3.70% upside potential  (essentially a proxy for future earning surprises). Similarly, fiscal  2011 and 2012 has 2.33% and 3.42% downside potential, respectively.Our RecommendationPolycom is well positioned financially to pursue its future ventures.  The company is currently developing video conferencing application for  smartphones and tablets. With the growing popularity of smartphones and  tablets, Polycom will have huge growth opportunity going forward.However, we remain concerned regarding the fiercely competitive nature  of the video conferencing industryand the future business infrastructure  spending by enterprises in the European regions. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) has emerged as the main rival of Polycom, after it purchased Tandberg TV of Norway.We, thus, maintain our long-term Neutral recommendation forPolycom,  Inc.Currently, Polycom, Inc.has a Zacks #3 Rank, implying a short-term  Hold rating."

Last month, it was also featured in my Forbes column, Kill the Business Trip. In a recent study, Gartner expects telepresence to generate $600 million in annual equipment revenue and $1.5 billion in revenue including services by 2010. In addition, in an IT budget priority survey for enterprises, collaboration moved up two slots to number eight. My earlier post on Polycom as an online video beneficiary is available here, and my interview with Bob Hagerty, CEO, is available here.On Wednesday, Polycom, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLCM) reported its second quarter results, which beat revenue estimates but missed earnings estimates by one cent. Revenue grew 16% y-o-y and 5% q-o-q to $271.6 million. Net income grew 77% to $17.8 million or $0.20 EPS, versus $10.1 million or $0.11 EPS last year. Non-GAAP net income was $30.7 million, or $0.35 per diluted share. Wall Street expected profits of $0.36 per share on revenue of $265.5 million. Polycom repurchased shares worth $80 million and is left with $300 million in its current repurchase authorization.By product, Video Solutions continued to account for 62% of revenue at $169.2 million, up 17% y-o-y and 6% q-o-q. Of this, Video Communications revenue grew 25% y-o-y and 8% q-o-q to $130.3 million, driven by strong telepresence and HD video offerings. However, Network Systems revenue declined 10% y-o-y and 4% q-o-q to $28 million due to low voice networking revenues and the product transition to Polycom’s new RMX platform.Voice Communications revenue was $102.4 million, up 14% y-o-y and 3% q-o-q driven by leading voice over IP solutions.By region, North America revenues were up 7% y-o-y, Europe grew by 36% y-o-y, Asia by 20% y-o-y, and Latin America by 36% y-o-y.Polycom expects its telepresence and HD video business to continue to benefit from the increasing cost of travel, particularly in the economic slowdown. It is also increasing its marketing and R&D spending to reap benefits from the trend. Further, the new RMX line is also expected to return Network Systems to growth. For the third quarter, Polycom expects revenue to increase 3% q-o-q.Polycom is currently trading around $24, recovering from its 52-week low of $19.47 on March 17.

The consensus estimate is 35c for EPS and $279.45M for revenue, according to First Call. On Oct. 9, Jefferies said that its quarter-end channel checks suggested Polycom would likely meet its Q3 estimates as demand for video conferencing solutions remains strong. Wedbush expects Polycom to post in-line Q3 results, but believes the business environment is challenging and the outlook may be subdued from the company. For Q3, Wedbush expects EPS of 35c and revenue of $280M, which matches consensus expectations and management's guidance of sequential growth. The firm also expects growth to be driven by Federal spending and video products, which should be offset by softness in enterprise spending and voice products. Wedbush expect EPS to benefit from share repurchases and cost management. While Wedbush expects in-line results, quality will be key. The firm's checks indicate payment terms may be extending out and thus would expect to see an increase in account receivables. Wedbush also has started to see backlog growth top out for Polycom and would not be surprised to see a modest decline in Q3. Wedbush remains concerned on margins and pricing as new competition further encroaches. Thus, Wedbush believes margins will remain below corporate goals. The firm expects an operating margin of 14.8% for Q3. Looking forward, Wedbush anticipates more subdued revenue guidance for Q4. However, it believes with cost management and the share buyback, EPS guidance will likely be closer to expectations, or could be a bit light. For 2009, Wedbush is becoming more cautious given the hazy outlook. The firm maintains a Hold rating."
56914,20521,2007-12-11T06:44:10-05:00,,"I recently conducted an interview with Bob Hagerty, CEO of Polycom, which I strongly suggest you read. My earlier post on the company as one of the online video beneficiaries is available here. Here is an update on its earnings for Q3 2007, and some analysis of the stock. For Q3, Polycom, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLCM) recorded revenues were $240 million, up 3% sequentially and 39% y-o-y. Excluding SpectraLink revenues of $37.8 million, Polycom had a growth of 17% y-o-y. Its gross margin was 60.2% and GAAP net income was $19.8 million or $0.21 per diluted share in Q3 of 2007 (up 15.6% y-o-y). It bought $50 million of its stock, and has $190 million remaining in its share repurchase funds. Video solutions revenue was $146.4 million (Video Communications $113.7 million and network systems $32.6 million), up 1% sequentially and 19% y-o-y. Its Voice Communications business also returned to sequential growth with revenue of $93.7 million, up 5% sequentially 88% y-o-y. Polycom is focusing on scaling its global sales and marketing efforts. It recently appointed Heidi Melin as its Chief Marketing Officer. Heidi was the Chief Marketing Executive at Hyperion, and beforehand at PeopleSoft. Bob discussed at length the challenges of growing the company at a fast pace, and in multiple countries. Apart from its partnerships with Avaya (NYSE:AV), Nortel (NT), Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and AT&T (NYSE:T), Polycom has added Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), 3COM (OTCPK:COMS), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Easynet to its list of strategic partners. With Microsoft, it is launching Microsoft® Office Communications Server 2007 voice products. It is adding media conferencing to IBM Lotus Sametime and Lotus Notes for an on-demand desktop collaboration solution. Other exciting products are its new HDX4000™ executive desktop product, the HDX8000™ and HDX9000™ series, and the RMX media server network platform. Its stock is trading around $25 after hitting a 52-week low of $22.81 on December 4. I would say, Polycom is, at the moment, an excellent buying opportunity. The market for Video Conferencing is in its infancy, and is expected to grow rapidly over the next decade. Video Conferencing not only cuts down the need for travel in an increasingly globalizing world, it makes people vastly more productive. I am, personally, a big believer in Video Conferencing, especially when faced with the situation that you have to cross the Atlantic for just one meeting in Paris. It is inefficient, exhausting, and definitely not green. World business needs to standardize on video conferencing as part of the business protocol, and when it does, Polycom will be a very strong beneficiary."
61642,20521,2008-01-25T06:57:26-05:00,,"On Wednesday, Polycom, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLCM) reported its results for Q4 and fiscal 2007 that ended Dec. 31. Earlier coverage on the company is available here and here. My in-depth interview with CEO Bob Hagerty can be found here. For Q4, net revenues were $263.3 million, up 41% y-o-y and 9.7% q-o-q. GAAP net income was $22.8 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, down 12% y-o-y and up 15% q-o-q. Polycom bought back $50 million worth of its stock, and still has $140 million allocated for its share repurchase program. For the full fiscal year, net revenues were $929.9 million, up 36%. GAAP net income was $62.9 million, or $0.67 per diluted share, down 12.5%. SpectraLink, which was acquired in March 2007, contributed $113.5 million to the revenue. During the year, it fueled its revenue efforts by forming fruitful strategic partnerships with Avaya (NYSE:AV), Nortel (NT), Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), AT&T (NYSE:T), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), 3COM (OTCPK:COMS), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Easynet. Product-wise, for Q4, video solutions revenue was $164.9 million, up 23% y-o-y and 13% sequentially. Of this, video communications revenue was $129.2 million or 49% of the Q4 net revenue, and network systems revenue was $35.7 million. Voice communications revenue was $98.4 million, up 88% y-o-y, and 5% sequentially. Region-wise, Q4 revenue in North America grew 35% y-o-y but declined 2% sequentially. Revenues from EMEA grew 51% y-o-y and 23% sequentially, Asia grew 48% y-o-y and 34% sequentially, and Latin America grew 32% y-o-y and 22% sequentially. 2007 turned out to be a great year for Polycom with its revenue almost reaching the $1 billion mark driven by strong demand for IP-based collaboration. A report from Global Industry Analysts in July had estimated video conferencing revenue to reach $6.7 billion in 2007. The U.S. market is estimated to have $4 billion revenue in 2007. By 2010, video conferencing revenue is expected to reach $11.9 Billion. As I discussed in my interview with Bob Hagerty, CEO of Polycom, video conferencing saves time, travel expenses, and makes communication easy for a highly dispersed workforce. The slowdown of the U.S. economy could actually work out in Polycom’s favor in that sense, which is a point that Bob emphasized on Wednesday. On the other hand, capital expenditure typically slows down during recessions, and could impact Polycom in 2008. Perhaps the two would cancel each other out, and it would be business as usual at Polycom. Polycom’s market cap is now around $2.3 billion. Its price hit a 52-week low of $20.56 yesterday and picked up after the earnings. It rose by 12% in after-hours trading to open today at $24.97. I still maintain that this is an excellent company, and for those in the market looking for value, Polycom is a great buy. If you already own it, don’t sell. Over the 3-5 year window, video conferencing will gain ground in a huge way."
48673,20293,2007-10-02T05:55:06-04:00,,"Video conferencing systems manufacturer Polycom said Tuesday it expects flat-to-higher EPS on higher Q3 revenue as relatively weak U.S. sales growth undercut strength in international markets. The company forecasts that it will post EPS under GAAP rules in the $0.19-0.21 range versus $0.19 a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, Polycom expects EPS in the $0.33-0.35 range against $0.27 last year. Q3 revenue is projected to rise 36-38% to $235-239 million from $173.2 million a year ago. Analysts had been forecasting EPS of $0.35 on revenue of $244.5 million. ""Our results for the quarter were driven by strength in key international markets across our entire product line, offset by less than typical seasonal growth in U.S. sales,"" said CEO Robert Hagerty.

The consensus estimate is 36c for EPS and $265.47M for revenue, according to First Call. Management's most recent guidance calls for revenues of $264M to $267M. Tandberg (OTC:TADBF), the leading video conferencing vendor worldwide and competitor to Polycom, reported Q2 results that were encouraging considering the state of the economy, which should bode well for Polycom. Wedbush expects Polycom to report good Q2 results and a positive outlook for Q3. The firm expects revenue to be in line with its expectations of $265M and EPS to be in line with its 36c estimate, or slightly better than expected. Wedbush expects revenue growth to be driven by international and video revenue, which should be offset by some softness in domestic and voice revenue. While Wedbush expects management to maintain a conservative tone for Q3 and FY08 given the macro environment, the firm expects the outlook for video growth to remain positive. Wedbush anticipates the international markets to remain strong for Polycom. That said, the firm has some concerns given the bookings deceleration in Q1 and modest downtick in deferred product revenue. Wedbush also believes Polycom still needs to improve its channel relationships versus its peers."
46534,20521,2007-09-06T08:12:55-04:00,,"Driven by globalization, telecommuting, and offshoring, an enterprise is no longer limited to one building or one geography. With this ever increasing distance between people working in an enterprise, there is a growing stress on applications that facilitate collaboration. Applications like video conferencing are critical today for meetings with offshore employees or even employees on the move. In this post, I will analyze Polycom’s standing as an online video beneficiary.Related posts of interest can be found here and here. Note, enterprise video conferencing is not the only trend driving the online video market momentum. The advent of YouTube and its compatriots have set in motion a rollicking online entertainment industry that has also been a major contributor to the phenomenon. Polycom, Inc. (NASDAQ: PLCM) is a leading global provider of unified collaborative communications solutions with revenue of $682 million in 2006. It has four core product lines: Video Communications, Voice Communications, Network Systems, and Services. It has a wide range of video conferencing products that target the small and medium scale enterprises as well as large companies. Its key differentiator is its platform-independent collaboration solutions. To facilitate this, it has strategic partnerships with leaders such as Alcatel-Lucent, Avaya, BroadSoft, Cisco, Digium, IBM, Microsoft, and Nortel among others.Another key aspect of Polycom’s strategy is its commitment to providing advanced security features. In July this year, it got the distinction of being the first vendor to receive the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 Validation: Security Requirements for Cryptograhic Modules for its VSX™ line of video conferencing products. This validation would enable Polycom to extend its secure video conferencing facilities to federal agencies as well as banking firms. Polycom also has a video network management platform, ReadiManager SE200, that increases the reliability and accessibility of IP based video networks.Polycom has recently acquired SpectraLink Corporation in a strategic move to extend its video conferencing capabilities to the mobile individual. SpectraLink on-premises wireless telephone systems complement existing telephone systems by providing mobile communications in a building or campus environment.Another strategic acquisition is Destiny for $47.6 million in January 2007. This acquisition would help Polycom gain core intellectual property as well as key Telepresence customer relationships with Capital One, AOL, and Deloitte & Touche. The edge to its Telepresence solutions is its standards-based technology, high definition audio and video, and multipoint links. With this, it attempts to take on rivals Cisco, Tandberg, HP, RadVision, and Lifesize. The Telepresence segment would likely see some further acquisition activity. HP has already formed a partnership with Tandberg. Polycom itself could be an interesting merger with another networking player, not dissimilar to the Cisco-Webex story, drawing on its twin trend alignment: online video and collaboration.On the financial front, Polycom reported revenues of $233.9 million for Q2 2007, a 42% increase over the same period of 2006. Video communications revenues increased 26% to $99.8 million for the quarter from $79.2 million in Q2 2006. This increase in revenue was primarily due to higher sales and higher average selling prices of its VSX™ and HDX group video systems. The RPX telepresence products also contributed to the increased revenues. Its stock is is currently trading between $29 and $31 and reached a high of $35.5 in July."

This soild performer is suffering partly from a weakening sector and partly from failure to grow fast.","At the end of 2018 I wrote about CRO PRA Health (PRAH), how its share price had risen 36% year on year and that the stock tended to move in parallel with underlying indices SPX and NASDAQ, only dipping less when these two indices dipped, and gaining more when they rose, allowing the stock to significantly outperform the market.This had been the trend almost throughout PRA’s time as a listed entity, since 2015, but in 2019 this trend seems to have inverted, and during April and early May this year, the stock has lost a significant amount of value even while the SPX and NASDAQ have gained.Source: TradingviewPRA did recover from its December low of around $91 to reach nearly $114 in February but the decline since has been pronounced - back to the low $90s - and this time there are no systemic market issues to explain the drop in price.The PE ratio has also dropped from 76.55 in December to 39.05 at the time of writing suggesting the market is not as excited about PRA’s growth as at the end of 2018.So what is the story here? Let’s look at some of the reasons for the price drop and assess the prospects for PRA for the remainder of 2019 and beyond.The Life Sciences sector has enjoyed 26% growth over the past year, making it a top performer despite the growing threat of wholesale changes to the industry being made by the government after the next election, whichever side wins. Many Democrat candidates are pushing the Medicare For All agenda, which could affect the way that major Pharma companies develop and test drugs. The majority of PRA’s 16,400 staff across 70 offices worldwide are involved in assisting with clinical drug trials. According to PRA’s most recent 10K statement:PRA says it has had more than 300 biotechnology and pharmaceutical clients over the past 30 years, but the company is perhaps unusually dependent on the fortunes of its clients to sustain its own business model.During the Q1 earnings call CEO Colin Shannon revealed that PRA’s top five clients were responsible for approximately 38% of revenue for the quarter with the largest client representing approximately 9% of revenue. Complications introduced by new government regulations could seriously affect the way that big Pharma addresses its drug development process, possibly slowing the pipeline of new drugs, which would leave PRA scrambling to fill its employees time with meaningful, revenue generating projects to work on - a worst case scenario for the company.And a Republican win in the 2020 election is no guarantee of security either, with Republicans urgently looking to find ways to reduce drug prices, or import new drugs from abroad - both scenarios that could hurt PRA and its business model. In their 10K submission the company quotes research that suggests 40% of Phase I through IV of clinical development spend is outsourced to CROs, and the levels of penetration are expected to increase to approximately 47% by 2022.PRA’s management believe that big Pharma will continue to outsource clinical trial work to CROs because it is cheaper and more efficient to do so, but regulation changes could equally take PRA by surprise, leaving it struggling to adapt, whilst opening up the market to new and more agile competitors.For 2019, PRA is reaffirming its revenue guidance of between $3.09 billion and $3.20 billion, just touching double digit year-on-year growth (8-11%) with EPS growth ($4.93-$5.08) set to grow 15-19%, all being well.The nature of PRAs business means that the company has a good idea of its backlog of work, and although management sounded positive on that front during the recent earnings call, equally there seemed a lack of genuine enthusiasm about growth in volumes of work coming in. PRA’s billings can be adversely disrupted by cancellations, delays, or changes to work in the pipeline, and in Q119 revenues of $722m and a net income of $44.1, showed a margin of just 6.1%. Not enough, perhaps, to sustain a slowdown, a bad quarter, or adverse regulation.Pricing plays a key role in how the company operates. PRA needs to be able to compete in a highly competitive CRO market where mergers amongst competitors are creating even more price pressure. That is why PRA are placing a lot of emphasis on their data solutions segment.Essentially PRA reports two service offerings: Clinical Research, and Data Solutions. This is described in the 10K as follows:The acquisition of Symphony Health for $530 million last year, which provides data, analytics and consulting to the Life Sciences industry, was an attempt by the company to shift towards a more data driven and efficient approach across both segments, but especially the Data Solutions segment, it can be assumed.However, whilst Clinical Research delivered revenues of $2.2 billion and profits of $626 million in 2018, the Data Solutions segment contributed just $90 million of revenues and $38 million of profit. Not quite enough yet, seemingly, to justify a $530 million outlay on a data solutions company?Management do not seem to be convinced about Symphony’s ability to contribute to earnings in 2019. CEO Colin Shannon was unwilling to give numbers around Data Solutions, but did say that the sales force had been “depleted” and that new hires had been made which initially slowed momentum but will be expected to deliver new business wins across potential new areas of business.Recent share price drift would indicate that investors had slightly lost faith in PRA’s ability to grow dramatically with so much uncertainty around, but this $6 billion market cap company can still deliver a share price gain, in my view, in 2019, just not a dramatic gain.Essentially PRA’s business succeeds when it can find work for its employees, many of whom work remotely, or at one of PRA’s 70’s properties and perform the work to a high standard, whilst making enough margin by practicing smart and competitive pricing techniques. Now, the company are trying to bring analytics and insight into the business model also, which is highly fashionable and a good move in my opinion, but PRA has a mountain to climb to grow that side of its business into a significant revenue contributor.Many investors may be of the opinion that PRA Health does not offer enough promise of share price growth in the short term, but history tells a different story. This could be a blip in the otherwise serene progress of the company within the CRO space. Its also possible, however, that the company is failing to move with the times quickly enough.PRA is not significantly burdened with debt having a free cash float of $274m and one option the company has to spice things is up would be to make further acquisitions, which could move the share price sharply in either direction. The safest bet, however, is probably to follow the company’s guidance, that the CRO market, worth approximately $34 billion in 2017, will grow at a 7.5% CAGR to $49 billion by 2022. Steady, if unspectaculat growth, in other words.This could be a good time to purchase and hold PRA stock, if you are prepared to wait 12-18 months - with no dividend paid by PRA Health, however, share price accumulation is your only hope. Over 5 years, the stock has performed remarkably well, returning more than 350%, touching $120. Over the last year, however, the stock has gained only 13%, and that might be more than you should expect, growth wise, from 2019."
4375418,104985,2020-09-21T08:02:44-04:00,"I last covered PRA in May 2019 - the stock is up 14% since then, which was at the top end of my forecast at the time.Market selloffs aside, PRA's share price has hovered between $100-$110 mark for nearly 2 years - tough operating conditions due to the pandemic may be holding it back.PRA has dealt reasonably well with the crisis and are forecasting ~$3.1bn of revenues in FY20 as the midpoint of expectations - a slight increase on FY19.Momentum from 2 good quarters could see the share price break out above $115 and get close to my calculated fair value price of $127.Management and the company pass most of the investment tests but need to go above and beyond, in my view to make the company a ""strong buy"". I am mildly bullish.","Investment ThesisI last posted about PRA Health Sciences (NASDAQ:PRAH) in May 2019, after the company's share price had slipped from late 2018 highs of $117 to trade at $90.I suggested that the company's days of sector and S&P beating growth - PRA's share price gained 216% between 2016 and 2018 - were most likely behind it and that shareholders could still expect gains, albeit in the mid-double-digits, in 2019.That proved to be the case - the stock is up 14% since my note, so I thought it would be a good time to evaluate what the rest of 2020 and early 2021 may have in store for the company.PRA Health (PRAH) is one of the world's leading contract research organizations (""CRO""), and one of the largest by revenues generated. Its focus is on helping biotechs and large pharma organizations conduct development and clinical trials of their drug candidates, from pre-clinical testing, through phase 1,2 and 3 clinical trials to commercialization, and post-marketing studies if required.PRA's areas of specialism include oncology, immunology, central nervous system, inflammation, respiratory, cardiometabolic and infectious diseases. The company has more than 75 offices, and 17,500 staff worldwide, and since 2000, has worked on more than 4,000 clinical trials, including more than 95 pivotal late-stage trials that have resulted in FDA or international marketing approval. PRA earns the bulk of its revenues (56% in Q220) from large pharma concerns, ~8% from mid-sized pharmas, 18% from larger biotechs, and the remainder (18%) from other biotechs.PRA has 2 reportable segments - Clinical Research, which covers most of the company's day-to-day operations and development and trial work, and accounts for ~92% of all revenues earned by the company, and Data Solutions, which is focused on leveraging data analytics and technology to provide consulting solutions to the life sciences market.The company is led by an experienced management team and board - President, CEO and Director Colin Shannon has been with the company since 2007, whilst most of the rest of the management team have been in place for more than 5 years.The company's Board of Directors comprises a mix of private equity, investment banking and biotech experience, including James Momtazee, formerly Head of the Americas Health Care industry team at PE firm KKR, Glen Stettin, Senior Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer at Express Scripts & Cigna Services, and Matthew Young, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of GRAIL, the promising cancer diagnostics startup that has been in the news owing to a rumored $8bn acquisition bid by former owner Illumina (ILMN).According to Fintel, PRA has ~50% institutional ownership, with its largest shareholders being Price T Rowe (11%), Vanguard Group (11%), Blackrock (10%) and Wellington Management (9%).With the exception of the market selloff in mid-March this year as traders reacted to the impact of coronavirus, and PRA's share price dropped briefly to $66 - its lowest level since May 2017 - PRA has traded in a narrow range since 2019, typically between $85 and $115, which is some way below the fair value I have calculated for the company based on DCF analysis of >$127.There are explanations for the lower trading price however. First of all, PRA is heavily indebted - its debt to equity ratio is ~3.2x, and the company reported $1.27bn of long term debt as at Q220, alongside near-term cash of just $168m.The pandemic has also disrupted the company's operations and its revenues have suffered - falling from an impressively high $800m in Q419 to $784m, and $730m in Q120 and Q220 respectively, while adjusted net income has fallen from $136m in Q419, to $99m in Q120 and $82m in Q220 - its lowest level since Q318.On its Q220 earnings call, management reported that ~30% of its client's studies had been put on hold owing to coronavirus, and that 65 - 80% of sites were subject to restrictions, causing billable hours to drop. On the plus side however, management noted that by the end of Q2 only 18% of studies remained on hold and more than 50% of sites were no longer subject to restrictions.Management took the unusual step of issuing Q3, as well as full-year guidance, perhaps in an effort to dissuade analysts from cutting their price targets and ratings. Revenues of between $754 - $784m were forecast for Q3, and adjusted EPS of $1.09 - $1.19, whilst FY20 forecasts have been adjusted to $3.07 - $3.13bn, and adjusted EPS of $4.35 - $4.55 (GAAP EPS of $2.4 - $2.6).At the midpoint of FY guidance, then, management is anticipating annual growth of 1%, which, if achieved, I would rate as an impressive achievement given the pandemic headwinds, although it will require a bumper last quarter of $800m+ - which PRA achieved in Q419, so investors ought to be hopeful.The detailed guidance trick certainly seems to have satisfied analysts - whose consensus rates the stock a ""strong buy"" with a price target of $117 - and investors - who have helped PRA quickly recover from its March lows to trade at $103 at the time of writing. If PRA encounters more fair-weather market conditions in 2021, as seems likely, it may find itself in a strong position to buck the trend of recent stagnant share performance and push on towards $120.Now let's consider the state of PRA's competition and market, and consider what the company must do in order to thrive.The below 2 charts show how PRA's performance has declined vs. the S&P 500 and key sector rivals over the past year after a period of sustained outperformance.PRA Health 5-year share price performance vs S&P 500 plus sector rivals CRL, LH, SYNH, ICRL. Source: TradingView.As we can see above PRAH stock is up 128% over a 5-year period - outperforming the S&P (+70%) by nearly 2x, and only bettered by Charles River Laboratories (CRL),+205%, whose gains have mainly been achieved in the past year.PRA Health 1-year share price performance vs S&P 500 plus sector rivals CRL, LH, SYNH, ICRL. Source: TradingView.As above, however, over a 1-year period PRA stock is down by 1.5%, behind the S&P 500 (+10%), and key sector rivals Laboratory Corp (LH), +7%, Icon Group (ICLR), (my note here), +17%, and Charles River (CRL), +62% - and only slightly ahead of Syneos Health (SYNH), -1.5%.This might suggest that PRA is underperforming relative to its rivals, and a quick look at the investment fundamentals of the different companies adds some weight to this thesis, but also provides some positives.Investment ratios of CRO sector rivals compared. Source: my table using company data.PRA's EBITDA multiple is one of the higher in the sector, at 18x, but is still competitive, with only Lab Corp's significantly lower. PRA's $3.1bn of revenues generated in FY19 is second only to Lab Corp, which is notably higher than the rest of the sector at $11.6bn, but PRA's net profit margin of 7.9% is somewhat lower than Charles River and Icon plc (ICLR), at 9.6% and 13.3% respectively, and PRA's price to free cash flow, at $41, is nearly double that of the rest of the sector, indicating the stock may be overvalued. The reason for this, I suspect, is PRA's indebtedness -the second worst in the sector (behind Charles River) at 128%.Still, looking at PE ratio, ROIC and price to sales, PRA scores slightly above average. Overall, based on analysis of more than 25 data points I award PRA a Haggerston BioHealth score of 3.20 out of 5, with 1 being best and 5 worst (more information on the HB scoring system and a rating for >1,000 biohealth stocks is available with a Haggerston BioHealth marketplace membership). This is the same as LabCorp, lower than Icon Plc and Charles River, and above Syneos Health.I'd say this accurately reflects how I would rank the companies currently, but in truth, this is a closely matched sector, and I do not consider PRA to be overvalued or underperforming. Icon aside, and given Charles River's recent share price surge, which looks unsustainable, I would rate PRA the strongest buy opportunity.The specialist nature of the CRO market means that it would be hard for new competitors to gain a foothold in this market, which was estimated to be worth $39 billion in 2018 and growing at a 7.5% CAGR to reach $56 billion in 2023.PRA had a healthy backlog of work as at June 30, 2020 of $4.9bn compared to $4.5 billion at the same time last year, and the company's gross new business awards for H120 were $1.48bn, compared to $1.5bn in H119, with cancellations down to $172m, from $193m one year ago.One area where I believe PRA has underperformed is within its Data Solutions business. The company spent $0.5bn in 2017 acquiring Symphony Health and its database of claims and prescriber information, but this hasn't translated to tangible revenue growth - Data Solutions contributed just $120m in the first 6 months of 2020, compared to $116m in H119. All the acquisition seems to have done is added to PRA's worrying debt burden.It could also be argued that PRA has not taken advantage of an increase in clinical trials related to infectious diseases owing to COVID-19. CEO Shannon commented on the Q2 earnings call:I suspect this is an area where PRA has lost ground to some of its rivals. When prompted on the earnings call, in response to a query about percentage of earnings from COVID-related trials - a figure that has been supplied by peer group rivals, Shannon responded:Nevertheless, COVID trials have to go down as a potential opportunity for PRA in the second half of 2020 and into 2021. Then, if the Symphony acquisition proves to be a slow-burner and begins to pay off in 2021, together with the company's new business wins, backlog and tailwinds potentially created by a return to BAU plus additional COVID work, the next 18 months begin to look good for PRA - perhaps providing the impetus the company needs to finally break out beyond $100 and towards my target price of ~$127.For my fair value price calculation I have decided to use free cash flow to equity, in other words, using EBIT minus interest expenses before subtracting tax (23% as per company guidance) and adding back depreciation (3.7% of revenues as per 2019 figure).I assume that OPEX remains the same in 2020 as it was in 2019 - 88% of revenues, but give the company some leeway by reducing the figure down by 0.5% per annum between 2020 and 2025, and I am assuming that after 2020's 1% growth (using the midpoint of current FY projections), PRA achieves a rate of 7% revenue growth per annum - just behind the projected 7.5% growth of the CRO market.I calculate interest expense of ~$35m per annum, which is lower than the figures recorded in 2017-2019 of $47m, $57m and $52m. Interest expense in the first 6 months of 2020 are reportedly $25.3m, so I am being quite generous here, although if, as expected, pandemic pressures ease, PRA should have less recourse to use its line of credit.With high CAPEX of $75m per annum I forecast PRA's free cash flow to be down from $457m in 2019 (and $441m in 2018) to ~$315m, rising to $475m by 2025 at a CAGR of 6%. Using a WACC of 8.2% (expected market return of 9%, beta of 1.02, RFR of 1.6%), I forecast a present day firm value for PRA of $8.1bn - a 23.3% premium to current market cap, and a fair value price per share of $127.PRA's debt burden has to be the stand out risk in an otherwise positive - albeit limited - growth story. Despite its size - $1.3bn as at Q220, as we can see below the interest rate on the senior debt - which comprises ~$1bn of the whole portion - is a modest 1.68%.PRA Health debt structure. Source: PRA Health Q220 earnings presentation.PRA Health current maturities of long term debt. Source: Q220 10Q submission.PRA is not under pressure to repay the debt quickly, with just $12.5m remaining due in 2020, $195m falling due in 2021 (PRA has a current cash position of $168m to net this off with), and after that, the vast majority falls due in 2024.I don't see any way that PRA can make this repayment in 2024 - even a huge share offering would not come close to raising sufficient funds - so I would expect the company to secure a new agreement from 2024. It is a shame that the cost of supporting the debt will be close to $50m per annum - which could be put to much better use - but it is not unusual either.Charles River, for example, had long term debt of $1.8bn at the end of FY19, but the company's share price has gained 62% nonetheless. Syneos Health has a more crippling debt position of $2.5bn, but its share price, if not performing optimally, is not suffering as a result.Icon has just ~$0.3bn of debt, another reason I like the company - but on balance it would be fair to say that being highly leveraged does not necessarily correlate with underperformance for a CRO.Another risk I believe PRA faces would be the competitive nature of the marketplace, with 5-10 companies of similar size and experience competing for the same contracts from the same pool of clients, with probably 15-20 companies - big pharmas e.g. Pfizer (PFE), Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) or Merck (MRK) responsible for as much as 50% of all available business.Competitors other than those mentioned already include IQVIA Holdings, and PAREXEL International Corporation, and Pharmaceutical Product Development, so there is a level of intense competition that requires company-wide performance to be at a high level at all times. Success rate in trials will be noted by clients, and it is easy to see how CROS can create either a virtuous or vicious circle through their actions that will either enhance or harm their reputation.PRA also needs to avoid becoming too dependent on major firms for its revenues - the company's top 5 clients generate ~39% of its total revenues, CEO Shannon revealed on the Q220 earnings call, although he also stated that no one client represents more than 10% of revenues which provides satisfactory diversification.With reputation key in the CRO sector, the company's recruitment strategy must augment the current strength of its staff, which includes roughly 850 PhDs, 600 medical doctors and 275 doctors of pharmacy worldwide. This is a balancing act given that PRA must manage costs and hire according to the amount of work it has, whilst making sure it hires to people who can do the job.Will 2020 - 2021 be the year that PRA finally breaks a near 2-year period of share price stagnancy?As I argued in my last note, I think PRA is capable of delivering upside for investors but as before, I would not expect gains to exceed a mid-to-high teen percentage in the next 12-18 months. The company does not pay a dividend and is unlikely to initiate a share buyback program owing to its debt, hence investors are reliant upon the share price alone to make a satisfactory ROI.Personally, I preferred to add the CRO Icon Plc to my model portfolio at Haggerston BioHealth in mid-July, and its performance has been so-so to date, gaining 4%.Icon trades at a significant premium to its pre-pandemic selloff peak, however, whereas PRA still trades at a discount, so although I pegged Icon as having the greater momentum at the time, if PRA delivers a solid second half to 2020, it may well reinvigorate analysts and investors and drag its share price significantly above $100 and towards its fair value price of >$125. That would be my hope - rather than my expectation - for PRA - but since I don't see much case for downside with PRA, I would describe myself as bullish on the stock price.A final thought - it strikes me that a congested sector with many companies of similar size in competition with one another has the potential for significant M&A activity, so I would also keep a close eye on that.For PRA shareholders, a best case scenario would be an acquisition by a larger firm - LabCorp (LH) or Thermo Fisher (TMO) for example, who would pay a premium to whatever price PRA stock traded at the time a bid was made. A merger is another possibility, however this would require investors to be patient and may depress the share price in the medium term.In the short term, I would keep a close eye on PRA and see how it responds to COVID and whether it can grow via its infectious disease segment by capturing more business from companies leading the coronavirus treatment/cure race.If it can, it may be a sign that PRA is alert and gathering momentum. If not, it may be a sign that things really are stagnant at the company and management are suffering from inertia."
4255575,23468,2019-04-21T13:03:58-04:00,"Says who? The best-informed (about likely coming prices) investment pros, the Market-Makers [MMs] negotiating volume (block) trades among $Billion fund managers.They know who owns, who wants to add, who may want to lighten up in PRA Health Sciences (PRAH), and what prices may be paid in the next few months.Not only for PRAH, but for the other major services competing in the industry’s varied activities – typically outside of the now politically-blighted big-pharma stocks.This article compares the Medical Services Industry’s likely coming stock prices on a head-to-head basis with both CAGR probable returns and interim price drawdown exposures.All based on how the MMs are now risking – and protecting – their own firm capital, and on how right they have been in doing that in the past 5 years.","It’s all about how intensive the price bidding may get for the specific stocks.That competition among investment fund portfolio managers is perceived and reported on 24 x 7 by the 100,000+ world-wide employee information-gatherers and evaluators of the MM community. Price expectations are in constant flux, and are what makes investment portfolios grow – or suffer – both for the big institutions and for the individual investor.The expectations all have both fundamentals and emotions behind them. There are details more convoluted than can be dealt with practically here. But the basics of putting money to work, exposed to risks, has simple and measurable meanings. They are reflected in the way the MM pros protect their firm’s capital.We watch carefully how they operate, we have done it for decades, and we have the records of when and where they do well, where they haven’t, and where they learned things. Their price expectations signal opportunities – and risks – that make very important changes in portfolio values. Price changes are the way the investing score is kept.Price changes from which your portfolio can benefit.Today’s prospects for evaluation are the stocks of leading companies providing services for medical organizations. Many of them are compared in Figure 1, showing the basic trade-offs for each stock between forecast price rewards currently being expected and possible price change risks which may be encountered.Figure 1(note: all materials from blockdesk.com have been approved to be seen in this article.)This map of the numbered intersections (horizontally between the red scale risks of price drawdowns and vertical measues from the green scale of reward expectations) which identify the stock symbols in the blue field to the right. Locations down and to the right are good; any above the dotted diagonal line are issues with more risk in prospect than gain.The positions of Humana (HUM) at [20] and United Health Group (UNH) at [19] argue for their preference as portfolio buy candidates in putting reinvestment-available cash to work. But there are additional considerations which raise questions as to the reliability or severity of the expectations. Still, Figure 1 is helpful for general perspectives. It deters us from chasing after the higher-return potentials of DVA at [9], BKD at [10], MOH at [17] or THC at [22].A deeper analysis of how the strong trade-off expectations at [19] and [20] compare with what has happened to these stocks’ prices after similar forecasts in the past can be helpful in evaluating what may be coming in the weeks and months ahead. Several of the alternative stock candidates are also detailed for comparison in Figure 2.Figure 2(source: blockdesk.com)While past market actions are never any guarantee of the future, when substantial numbers of similar forecasts lead to prevalent price outcomes it logically suggests that the odds may be in a desirable direction. The key to using that approach for stock investment selections is that the measures involved must be comparable.First, the forecasts of likely coming price possibilities need to have common derivation, and second, the measures of events subsequent to the similar forecasts need to be scored under observation of common portfolio management discipline.The columns [B] and [C] of Figure 2 are forecasts of price ranges within which Market-Makers are behaving, in their own professional interests, as though they clearly believe the prices might occur. All of the specifics of influence for each stock are wrapped up in the range of prices between [B] and [C].MMs are often called on to put their firm’s own capital at risk to temporarily balance at one price the demands of buyers and sellers when large trades are proposed as a single block. The MMs will do so if a hedging deal can be arranged to protect against damaging market price movements while they temporarily have a position creating the market liquidity, either long or short, for this trade.The markets for derivatives – futures, options, swaps, and other exotics – involve legal contracts with limited lives, based on specific prices for the underlying (typically equity) subject security. That creates structure leverages on the derivative contracts’ prices making them economically effective risk-transfer devices.The prices paid and the proportions of specific contracts involved tell just how far both the buyers and sellers of such price-change “hedge” deals believe the underlier stock’s price is worth protecting against. Hence columns [B] and [C].This all comes about because buy-side (of the “street”) investment organizations with $ Billion portfolios need to reposition holdings in multi-million-dollar trades well beyond the capacity of the “regular-way” automated exchange markets. They know the MMs know where (on the buy-side) other big-money players may be found to take the “other side of the trade” to make their desired trade happen.But usually the MM’s block trade desk finds inadequate “other side” to balance their big-$ client’s trade order. Then they may “position” or “principal” the balance to “fill” the client’s trade order. But they will do that only when their risk is hedged. We’re told that happens in about 95% of all volume “block trades”.Everyone involved is a player intending to make money. The big-$ client sees a capital-gain (or loss-avoidance) opportunity, making a trade worth a LOT of $. The MM is quoting a “spread” between the price the “other side of the trade” gets and what the client pays. The sellers of the hedge price-insurance (typically proprietary trade desks at other MMs) quote a deal priced and structured to protect the MM buyer, but giving themselves a profit and potential coming-event gain opportunities.But if the cost of that “market-liquidity” insurance cuts too deeply into the price the MM has to quote to its client, the trade order may get killed rather than filled. So there is implicit agreement between all three interests as to the reasonableness of the coming-price expectations for the subject stock.The price-range forecasts are the necessary start to the comparisons between alternatives leading to an investment selection for your completely separate investment portfolio.The forecast range exists in relation to a current market quote for the stock. Usually that quote is within the range, implying proportionality between upside and downside price change prospects. The Range Index [RI] tells what percent of the range is below the market quote at the time of the forecast. We can evaluate how well prior forecasts of similar RIs have performed by observing the stock’s price behavior only subsequent to incidents of that RI sample.Columns [L] and [M] tell how much information there is to work from in each stock’s current-day situation. And a decision ought to be made today or tomorrow, from current forecast outlooks.There are 1,261 market days in 5 years normally. A sample from less than 3 years, or 756 market days might occur during a period of market abnormality (i.e. late 2008, early 2009) which could make a poor comparison with longer periods. Likewise samples of less than 15 market days could easily occur all in an abnormal (for the stock) period of as little as 3 weeks. We prefer to see comparisons between samples of 20 or more from periods of at least 750 market days of history.So in Figure 2, for PRAH there were 63 prior forecasts with today’s RI of 15, out of a total history of 1102 (about 4 ½ years) market days. Today’s forecast implies an upside price move [E] of +13.2% from $94.47 to $106.98. Well, what happened in those 63 prior instances?It turns out that 60 out of the 63 either reached their forecast upside limits and were closed out at good profits or after 3 months (63 market days) were priced above the next-day-after-forecast entry price to provide some profit if closed out.Remember, above we noted that keeping score on what happens to stock prices needs a common discipline to evaluate the differing price performances of the alternatives from which investment selections will be made. Our standard is clear-cut and simple:Any stock position reaching its upside forecast limit is closed out on the day of that event. No stock positions will be held beyond 63 market days, so all instances of the sample failing to reach the upside limit will be closed out at that time horizon, measured from the date of the forecast. The time-outs will be either gains or losses; in PRAH only 3 were losses. The other 95% of the sample [H] were Winners (profitable). Including the 3 losers, the average net gain for all 63 was +11.9% [ I ].So with a current forecast of an upside price gain of +13%, even after taking 3 losses, the sample’s profit realization was 12%. Not bad, its achievement credibility was 0.90, [N] or 90% of the current forecast.And the average holding periods of those 63 priors was only 40 days [J] because many of them reached their forecast’s upper limit before the 3-month time limit was reached. That +11.9% gain in 40 days is an annual profit rate [CAGR] of +102% [K]. If maintained during a year, it would double your invested capital.To reflect on how important is the RATE of gain, in Figure 2 skip down to the first blue row of results for the SPDR S&P500 Index ETF (SPY). Its column [J] shows that the 309 market days when this day’s RI of 45 [G] was forecast, the average holding period was 60 days – out of 63! Its average upside forecast [E] at 6.8% was only half of PRAH’s, but its CAGR of +9% was less than one tenth of PRAH. SPY took half again as long to make its gains of 2% [ I ], which were one-sixth of PRAH.Why should PRAH be favored as a wealth-building investment selection over a huge Dow-Jones component like UNH with 60,000 interested SA investment prospects or a well-recognized corporation six times the market capitalization of PRAH and seven times as many interested SA readers? Much of the answer lies in being able to deliver on an implied forecast.Start with column [N]: PRAH at today’s RI forecast Upside [E] and Realized Payoff [ I ], produces a credibility ratio of .90. Which quickly trumps lesser ratios of .53 and .41. Added to that are the lower payoffs of 8.6% and 5.8% which produce CAGRs [K] of 65% and 35% instead of PRAH’s 102%.A visual comparison of current PRAH outlook with the path of recent-year forecasts suggests that this may be becoming a timely opportunity for a near-term recovery, as well as a favorable preference over the valuations of its industry competitors.Please see Figure 3 for the once a week extracts of daily forecasts during the past two years.Figure 3Note the current position of the Range Index of 15, relative to its past 4+ year daily forecasts. This is consistent with its history of 95 / 100 Win Odds in short-term performance.

Click here to find out more »Medtech market watchers doubtless have PRA Health Sciences (PRAH) on their radar. The company is a CRO (contract research organisation) that provides outsourcing services to the medical industry, including operating bio-analytical labs in the US, assisting with the clinical development process, building technology architecture, completing global surveys, managing research projects, and so on.The company's share price has risen by more than 36% year on year, from just over $74, to just under $100. In the main, PRA Health's share price has done little but grow steadily, outperforming key indices, since the company first listed at a price of $20 in November 2014, after being acquired by the private equity group Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.Source: TradingViewThe company's latest financial results, issued in September, were well received by analysts who noted the company's expectation of 10-12% organic growth in 2019 (despite a drop to 8.2% in the third quarter, below expectations, which has been attributed to a slower moving pipeline of work), and adjusted profit expectations of $4.22-4.27 per share, on sales forecasts of $2.87-2.92bn. Since the results were announced, the company's share price has risen almost 15%.PRA Health has become a darling of the stock exchange, with a Zacks rank Growth Score of A, based on expectations of long-term share price over-performance, and a Zacks rank of #2, suggesting the stock is a clear buy. Source: TradingViewThe company's PE ratio is a high 76.55 at the time of writing. A high PE ratio is often interpreted by investors as a sign that the market expects further sector beating growth. PRA's PE ratio is significantly higher than its market sector average of around 40, implying that big things are expected of this company.Essentially, investors are prepared to bide their time and accept smaller earnings per share in the anticipation that the ratio will rapidly fall as the company delivers better earnings, driving up the share price. When we compare the PE ratio, which is calculated using historical earnings data, to the forward PE ratio, based on future earnings data supplied by the company, which currently stands at around 20.35 based on next full-year estimates, we can clearly see the opportunity.Source: ZacksDespite its steady, if not quite sector-leading growth over the past year, PRA Health has also experienced some alarming dips in share price. Alarming, or an opportunity, depending on how you look at it.For example, PRA Health shares fell from a high of $103, to $92 in October, before recovering to a November high of $107, dropping again to $96 on 19th November, then climbing sharply to hit $116 at the beginning of December, only to experience a further correction all the way back to $96 at the close on 19th December.The dips can be explained by systemic market movements rather than any negative company-specific news flow, however.Source: Trading ViewAs we can see in this chart above, PRA Health's stock price tends to track the Nasdaq closely. When the Nasdaq dips, so does PRA, usually by a similar amount. But when the Nasdaq price climbs, PRA does too, only by a proportionally larger amount, meaning that, over time, PRA outperforms the index.A good example of this can be seen in this 3m performance chart: Source: Trading ViewOver the period, whilst the Nasdaq declines more than 16%, PRA, thanks to far more pronounced upswing at the beginning of December, loses just 11%. Rinse and repeat over time, and you have a stock that is consistently climbing higher, and therefore outperforming the major stock market indices as a whole.By most available technical measures, PRA Health tends to emits strong ""buy"" signals, but if the share price can be so easily buffeted by adverse market movements within the sector, there is potential for investors to realise greater short-term gains by waiting for the next dip, safe in the knowledge that the share price has the ability to pare its losses, correct itself, and continue its climb when the prevailing trade winds change.In August last year (2017), PRA Health acquired rival health data and analytics company Symphony Health, paying $530m upfront to gain control of a business with over 250 employees, with revenues of around $200m in 2017, and more than 400 customers.The 2 businesses have many synergies, but the progress and integration of Symphony was nevertheless a popular line of inquiry during PRA's earnings call with investors back in September. Progress has been steady, reported PRA CEO Colin Shannon, with PRA taking a hands-off approach and allowing Symphony to trade without interruption to its core business, with plans to align the two companies more closely into 2019-20.In all, PRA Health has made 14 strategic acquisitions, with Symphony Health the largest by a distance. Investors can take comfort from the fact that Symphony is almost perfectly aligned with PRA's business model and target market, with its huge reserves of data one of the main underlying reasons for its purchase.There are many reasons to be optimistic about PRA Health, despite the fact that it does not pay a dividend. PRA operates within a highly favoured (currently) market that is seeing substantial investment and demand for PRA's core services is likely to remain steady, if not increase significantly, over the coming year. Company revenues are up 23% yoy, with adjusted net income up 30%, with a strong pipeline of business, established international presence and strong infrastructure and company culture.PRA booked more than $600m of new business in Q3, generated $717.6m of revenues, with net income of $74.8m; $1.13 of net income per diluted share.As far as the market is concerned, PRA shares represent good - if not exceptional value. The share price outperformed the market in general over the past year, but not the life sciences sector, but its earnings growth expectations are way ahead of the competition.Source: Simply WallSt.Essentially, PRA Health stocks are good value because the company itself is in good health. It sits within a strong sector, with a strong pipeline of work, earning potential, and management team. It's diversified with a manageable level of debt (debt to equity ratio is 1.2235, net debt = 1.064bn).Therefore, I would recommend this stock, but caution that the timing of any share purchase is more than usually important, because, as mentioned above, the stock is volatile, with frequent dips and disproportionately large gains.At the time of writing, the stock looks to be bottoming out after another pronounced dip, for systemic reasons i.e. not because the company is performing poorly, but the sector overall.With trading likely to be thin as we enter the holiday season, it looks like an interesting time to buy PRA - and to hold throughout 2019, notwithstanding the threat of a backlash against the medtech/life sciences sector - PRA has a proven ability to ride the dips and come out ahead."
3977458,101453,2016-05-25T14:18:26-04:00,"PRAH is a leading contract research organization (CRO), which as an industry is one of the more intriguing growth segments in the healthcare space.Even after more than 2.5x capital appreciation following its November 2014 IPO, PRAH projects to have small-to-moderate upside with limited downside.Company is likely somewhere in the gray area between a ""strong hold"" and ""marginal buy"" and is a good consideration for pullbacks into the low-40s.","PRAH data by YChartsPRA Health Sciences (NASDAQ:PRAH) is a North Carolina-based contract research organization (CRO) that supports pharmaceutical companies with various clinical development and therapeutic services. The company predominantly assists its clients with clinical pharmacology and development, conception-to-marketing approval services, and safety management activities.The company is one of the top CROs by revenue and focuses its business on being one of the few that has the expertise to conduct pre-clinical and clinical trials across nearly all therapeutic segments on a global scale. PRAH can also point to its diversified client base, which partly stems from its September 2013 acquisition of ReSearch Pharmaceutical Services (RPS). Its clients range from biotech start-ups to multinational pharmaceutical companies, which has included all of the top 20 worldwide by market cap.PRAH also invested into a deep medical informatics database, which includes hospital and pharmacy data for over 280 million patients and 10 billion patient and pharmacy claims within the U.S. alone. In the company's own words, the analysis and application of the data will help ""identify more productive investigative sites and speed up overall patient enrollment"" and therefore expedite the drug development timeline for its clients.Growth in the CRO space is predicated on the notion that as patents expire, there is enhanced demand for R&D to drive new drug development, especially through the expansion of biosimilars. Globally, over $70 billion alone is spent on Phase I through IV clinical trials. Approximately 43% of clinical trial spending is expected to be outsourced to CRO businesses by 2018.The demand for CRO specialty services is expected to increase on the basis of pharmaceutical companies' necessity to enhance R&D productivity, minimize the burden of clinical trial complexity, navigate the waters of registration requirements among various global jurisdictions, and better assist their needs as the growth in latter stage clinical trials increases going forward. Outsourcing to CROs also obviates the need to maintain employed staff to deal with these matters internally and helps drive cost efficiency on the part of drug producers and manufacturers.PRAH plans to realize continued growth by leveraging its market position within the biotech space and especially among small- and mid-sized pharmaceutical companies, with many relationships and ties that have gone back thirty years. At the same time, its RPS acquisition has helped broaden its relationships among large pharmaceutical companies. This is especially important as the clinical trial complexities increase and growth in Phase II-IV trials expands from the acceleration of impending patent expirations.Accordingly, these factors decisively drive growth in these companies' needs for outsourced CRO services. PRAH has also aligned its main therapeutic expertise among the areas where the majority of drug candidates are focused (oncology, central nervous system, inflammation, and infectious disease). The company is also focused on a selective acquisition strategy to help achieve financial synergies and realize strategic benefits that focus on its fundamental service offerings.The company went through its initial public offering in mid-November 2014 and saw 60% earnings per share growth in 2015 alone. PRAH's growth story has caused the stock to increase by a factor of 2.5x over its $18.00 IPO price. The global CRO industry itself is valued at approximately $26-$28 billion, with 8% annualized growth projected over the next five years according to its IPO prospectus.The company's main business risks include outsourced contracts that may be terminated on short notice, failure to perform the contract services required, inefficient contract pricing, unanticipated fall in service demand, risk in international dealings (exchange rate risk, political and economic risk, compliance with various international laws and regulations, among others), potential failure to integrate or continue to integrate any strategic acquisitions, liabilities related to patient health, potential operational restrictions due to its financial leverage, and any events that may invite risk of reputational damage. Also, 70% of the company's balance sheet is comprised of intangibles - ideated in the form of customer relationships, customer backlog, trade names, patient list, and ""other intangibles"" - which are subject to annual impairment checks.PRAH is also largely subject to the influence of its largest shareholder, private equity firm KKR & Co., which held it private for a period before its IPO and oversaw the RPS acquisition. KKR owned approximately 58% of its stock as of March 31, 2016 (source: company's 2016 Q1 10-Q report), although the private equity company sold off 4.9 million shares (worth $224 million) earlier this month to lower its ownership stake to 49.8%. KKR is expected to sell off blocks of shares of the company as time proceeds to realize gains on their investment. None of proceeds will be returned to PRAH.Per NASDAQ rules, given that no single party controls more than 50% of its share ownership, PRAH will now be subject to certain corporate governance regulations designed to benefit stockholders, such as the requirement that the majority of the company's board must be ""independent directors"" (i.e., individuals who have no pecuniary relationship with the company aside from sitting fees). KKR, however, still maintains the authority to execute actions requiring shareholder approval, including acting as the nominating entity in the board of directors election process.ValuationOn a relative basis, the company is currently trading at 2x sales. Its EV/Revenue stands at 2.5x and its EBITDA multiple is just shy of 14x. Its competitor Charles River Laboratories (NYSE:CRL) trades at 3x sales, with revenue and EBITDA multiples at 3.4x and 14.2, respectively. A company such as Quintiles Transnational Holdings (NYSE:Q), trades at 1.8x sales, with revenue and EBITDA multiples at 2.1x and 11.5x, respectively. It's hard to get a good grasp on its relative valuation, as multiples tend to vary among its closest comps.CROs may also have somewhat higher multiples than expected as an industry, on average, due to the M&A environment in the space. LabCorp's acquisition of Covance for $6.1 billion (32% premium) in early 2015 remains the most prominent M&A transaction in the space. The deal valuation gave Covance a LTM implied EBITDA multiple of 13.3x (source: page 5 of LabCorp Investor Deck PDF released November 3, 2014). Many companies are targeted not only for the growth potential behind the catalysts and secular growth influences alluded to earlier, or the potential cost synergies associated with vertical integration on part of the acquirer, but due to their medical informatics databases.Discounted cash flow is inherently the better way to value a company, by projecting out the present value of the cash that can be extracted from the company as a going concern rather than relying on market values of non-pure play comps. FY2015 revenue came in at $1.614 billion. Revenue growth, after standing at approximately 30% year over year from 2012-14, fell to just shy of 10% growth for FY2015 and looks to fall by about 4% for FY2016. I assumed an effective tax rate of 26% to reflect PRAH's lower tax rates in foreign subsidiaries and tax credits associated with R&D investment. Until 2019, PRAH does not have to pay principal debt payments, but does have standard interest payments to account for.FY2016 revenue is projected to come in at approximately $1.55 billion. I assume revenue will increase by 9.5% over this amount for 2017, then drop off 10% from that figure year over year throughout the projection period (e.g., 8.6% YOY growth for 2018, 7.7% for 2019, etc.). PRAH had a gross margin of 30% and EBITDA margin of 15% in 2015. For modeling purposes, I have the EBITDA margin at a constant 15.4% moving forward.Depreciation has historically come in at a relatively constant figure at just above 5%. Capital expenditures normally works out to 1.8%-2.5% of sales (entered at a constant 2.5% for the sake of conservatism). Working capital is currently negative, although it has been positive in the past. I currently have working capital set at -5.3% of revenue, but with a straight-line increase to 0% within five years to reflect likely better working capital management in the future.Using a set of comparable firms, I project the equity beta of the industry to be approximately 1.26 using a basic unlever/re-lever approach, as PRAH's equity beta is uncharacteristically low due to the small time it's been on the public markets. I calculate its cost of equity at around 11.3%, and tax-adjusted cost of debt at 4.6%. Weighted proportionally, I assign a cost of capital of approximately 7.58%. Long-term growth rate is assumed at 2%.Based on the numbers articulated, I assign PRAH an intrinsic enterprise value of $4.09 billion. The market currently values the company at $3.56 billion, or undervalued by approximately 15%. Making the necessary adjustments to arrive at equity value, I estimate the company's intrinsic market capitalization at $3.31 billion or just under $55 per share, or undervalued by 18.7%. As I like to do to achieve a valuation range as opposed to a specific price point, I worked in WACC and perpetual growth rate, g, sensitivities (+/- 50 basis points) within the charts below:(Image source: author)If, alternatively, we assume that PRAH's margins have yet to peak and the company obtains a 10% year-over-year EBITDA margin growth until 2020, before decreasing 10% year over year to reflect a more competitive landscape, maturation, and so forth (i.e., a more parabolic trajectory rather than linear), the company would be valued in the high-40s range. These numbers would give PRAH a median projected enterprise value of $3.68 billion (3.3% undervaluation) and market cap of $2.90 billion (4% undervaluation).(Image source: author)This actually provides a more bearish scenario from a pure modeling perspective, as opposed to a basic projection of revenue growth with constant EBITDA margins following. This is due to the FCF contraction in later periods outweighing any boost in the near term when the cash flows are cumulatively discounted back to their present value.Final ThoughtsPRAH appears slightly undervalued based on its current price, although not to the degree it was before its significant post-IPO appreciation. This may be a stock to consider on pullbacks to $40 per share (a price point not reached even accounting for WACC or perpetual growth rate error/variation). Or at the very least, it may be a worthy growth story to evaluate each quarter, as the CRO business is presently a very interesting growth landscape.If I were to project my opinion, I would not purchase the company, but this is only due to my own personal philosophy. The secular dynamics are there, but I would prefer to see a better price before entering - ideally 20% upside on fairly conservative assumptions. The company's track record of capital allocation is still yet to be determined and the company's ROIC remains below its cost of capital. But an innocuous pullback back down to the low-40s would put PRAH fully on the table. Like with any growth business, there is always the chance that you might miss the train completely, but that's part of the bargain.Most importantly, the downside projects to be fairly limited. Unless revenues stagnate, working capital fails to improve, and capex needs are higher than I anticipate - all of which are fairly unlikely - it's hard to foresee an intrinsic value below $40 per share, or 15% downside in relative terms. Also, any institutional investor would have to be content with KKR still owning a sizable stake of the business - and therefore having some influence over its operations and strategic actions. While PRAH is no longer a ""controlled company"" by NASDAQ rules through KKR's 8% ownership sell-off earlier this month, in the interim, the private equity company will maintain its status as an influential shareholder so long as it remains bullish on its growth story."

4054845,24361,2017-03-15T08:20:13-04:00,"PRA is looking to leverage its growing data management/analytics capabilities and functional service outsourcing to grow its share in the $29 billion CRO market.PRA recently announced a major agreement with Takeda, furthering its transition as a credible partner to Big Pharma.Despite a strong run over the past year, PRA could still offer some upside as the company gains share in a growing market and drives improved operating performance.","It's hard enough to find undervalued stocks today, and a stock that is already up more than 40% over the last year and within a few percentage points of its 52-week high is not initially the most promising candidate. To be sure, PRA Health Sciences (NASDAQ:PRAH) is not conventionally cheap on backward-looking multiples and there are valid concerns that the CRO market could be in for a harder stretch as biotech funding dries up and Big Pharma pushes another round of consolidation. On the other hand, PRA's strong foundation in clinical trial management and its growing capabilities in strategic outsourcing and data/analytics shouldn't be ignored, and I believe there are opportunities here for the company to outgrow its addressed market.CRO, With A TwistContract research organizations (or CROs) have been around for quite a while, and offer pharmaceutical and biotech companies an outsourcing option for managing their clinical trials. The industry really got its start when the biotech industry came to life, as these companies didn't have the capital (or, at least in some cases, the expertise) to build the internal infrastructure needed to effectively manage clinical trials. Along the way, Big Pharma realized that it also made sense for them in many cases - freeing them from investing in the fixed infrastructure and allowing them to make more of their R&D spending variable (and tied to the productivity of their internal drug development or in-licensing efforts).PRA Health Sciences is a relatively small player, with mid single-digit share, but it is nevertheless the fifth-largest CRO and it has the size and scale necessary to provide a full range of services in clinical trial management for Phase I-IV development. PRA has come about this scale relatively recently, and while the company now counts Big Pharma as a major source of revenue (close to half), the company's culture was built more around serving the needs of smaller biotech companies (which still make up close to 30% of the revenue base).In terms of clinical trial management, PRA is relatively comparable to companies like Quintiles (Q), LabCorp (NYSE:LH) (through Covance), and PAREXEL (NASDAQ:PRXL), though Quintiles and Covance offer a broader array of services (including central lab functions). The ""twist"" for PRA comes with some of the other services it can offer clients.PRA's Strategic Solutions business contributes around a third of the company's revenue and is basically around offering a more limited set of outsourcing functions for pharmaceutical and biotech companies which want to maintain control over their projects. A company like Novartis (NYSE:NVS) or Merck (NYSE:MRK) may not need or want to outsource all of a clinical project, but it could still find that it makes more sense to outsource functions like data management, study management/monitoring, biostatistics, and so on. While many of PRA's peers can offer at least some of these services, they're typically less than 10% of the revenue mix and PRA has made a more meaningful commitment to providing these services to pharmaceutical and biotech customers.Another twist is PRA's data and analytics capabilities. Under the name of Predictivv, PRA has assembled a powerful integrated platform that consolidates trial design, planning, and monitoring functions into a single system, allowing for a much smoother process of designing and monitoring studies. PRA also has growing capabilities to monitor and track patient distribution/location, medical histories, and investigator behaviors, allowing clients to more effectively design and implement their study plans (it makes little-to-no sense to enroll a clinical site where there are few patients with the relevant disease and/or where the investigator(s) has a history of slow enrollment, and so on). Predictivv has already been singled out as an important factor in recent client wins and this could evolve into more of a standalone product over time for the company.Two Big Wins, Amid Industry TurbulencePRA presently generates around half of its revenue from five clients and the company recently secured two major wins. The first was with Japanese pharmaceutical company Takeda (TKPYY) and will see Takeda give the ""vast majority of its full-service clinical work"" to PRA. At around $3.4 billion in annual R&D spending, that could mean several hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue to PRA, and the deal was recently expanded to include Takeda's Japanese operations. There's much less to talk about with the second win, as the company announced it in conjunction with fourth quarter earnings but gave little additional detail. That's actually more the norm in the space, so investors may have to wait a while to figure out who this customer is.All told, business is looking up for PRA right now. In addition to growing traction for Predictivv and its Strategic Solutions business, PRA has been reporting solid trends in net new business wins with the book-to-bill ratio accelerating from 1.25x to 1.4x in recent quarters and cancellation rates remaining relatively low (3.4% in the last quarter).Still, there are some reasons for concern. The biotech bubble has most certainly burst and with that come growing concerns about funding levels for new clinical trials coming out of that sector. Big Pharma, too, could be looking at lower (or at least slower) clinical spending if concerns about increased regulation on drug pricing lead to a deprioritization of R&D spending and a new wave of consolidation that will see many clinical programs winnowed out and canceled.On balance, I don't think this is much of a long-term risk. Consolidation can create expense synergies but you cannot cost cut your way to long-term prosperity; R&D spending is the ultimate growth engine for biotech and pharma, and that means more spending on clinical trials. Moreover, I believe industry trends continue to favor CROs like PRA. Clinical trials are becoming more complex, with more procedures per trial and increasing requirements in terms of safety monitoring and data analysis. Just on the site/safety monitoring and data collection/management/analysis fronts, that should encourage more outsourcing activity and push growth in outsourcing from around 40% of eligible work today to 50% (or higher) over the next decade.The OpportunityPRA has a somewhat convoluted corporate history, full of M&A and being taken private twice. With that, the company has a higher debt level than is typical for the space (though not necessarily problematic on a standalone basis, given the multiyear contracts that are common in the industry) and KKR (NYSE:KKR) still owns about 37% of the shares after the latest IPO in 2014 and some subsequent selling.There could also be some issues with margins vis a vis foreign currency. PRA's business is global and while more than 80% of its revenue is priced in dollars, the percentage of expenses priced in dollars is closer to 60%. If the dollar weakens, that could create some challenges for the company.There is also regulatory and industry uncertainty to consider. I mentioned the risk of Big Pharma spending slowing and the risk that biotech funding goes through a prolonged dry spell. There is also the chance that the new U.S. administration will drive more comprehensive changes at the FDA and the drug approval process. A faster, simpler process could be bullish for biotech and pharma, but could make the value arguments for outsourcing to CROs less compelling. My personal view is that it's very unusual for systems to become less complex over time, so I don't consider this highly likely… though the Street doesn't like uncertainty.I'm looking for PRA to generate long-term revenue growth of around 6% to 7% on a long-term basis. That's above what I expect for the underlying growth rate of the CRO market, so I do expect PRA to be a share-gainer on the back of its differentiated service offerings (like Predictivv). I also expect margins to improve as the company gains scale and as higher-margin services like data/analytics grow within the revenue mix. I expect double-digit FCF margins relatively soon and long-term growth in the low-to-mid teens. That supports a fair value in the low $60s, or a few percentage points ahead of today's price.The Bottom LineNeither PRA nor its sector is particularly cheap today, but I think PRA does have its own credible individual growth story. Whether the reward is sufficient is up for the individual reader to decide, but I believe that PRA has a meaningful opportunity to gain share, leverage its data/analytics capability, and become a larger player in the CRO space.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

        PRAH is a contract research organization (CRO) with 75 international offices across 6 continents manned by 10,000 + employees.
        PRAH is backed by powerful firm KKR, which could bode well for future success.
        In addition to these and other bullish indicators, research suggest above-market returns in the days preceding and following a firm's quiet period expiration; we suggest investors consider the buying opportunity.","PRA Health Sciences's (NASDAQ:PRAH) quiet period, as required by SEC rules, is set to expire Monday, 12.8; on Tuesday, 12.8, PRAH's underwriters could likely boost the share price by issuing positive reports.PRAH is a contract research organization (CRO) with 75 international offices across 6 continents manned by 10,000 + employees.PRAH's powerful syndicate includes: Jefferies, Citibank, KKR, UBS, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo Securities as joint managers, with Baird and William Blair as co-managers.PRAH's IPO commenced trading on Nov. 14th at $19.50 and has stayed in a trading range of $20.39 to $22.50 since Nov. 19th-well-positioned for at least a temporary boost.A Handful of Competitors For This Powerful Global CROPRAH is one of the largest CROs in the industry by revenue. They manage and supervise all of the protocols necessary for FDA Phase 1 to Phase 4 trials on behalf of their clients on an outsource basis. Their therapeutic expertise specialties are in pharmaceutical development for treatments targeting oncology, central nervous system, inflammation and infectious diseases.As a global CRO, they have only a handful of competitors, among them INC Research (NASDAQ: INCR) another recent CRO industry IPO. With over 45 drugs approved by the FDA or other international bodies via the PRAH platform and over 2,300 clinical trials credited under their supervision, PRAH boasts a track record of contributing to over 100 drugs successfully commercialized.Prior to its recent IPO, PRAH had changed ownership several times: The Carlyle Group (NYSE: CG) sold the company in 2001 to Genstar for $95 million, who then subsequently filed an IPO in 2004. 3 years later, PRAH went private at a $800 million evaluation. KKR then acquired the company for $1.3 billion and has enhanced its global reach in Asia and Eastern Europe through their joint venture with WuXi Apptec of China and its purchase of ClinStar. Vertical integration for pharma included the M&A deals to add CRI Lifetree and ReSearch Pharmaceutical Services into the PRAH family.Recap of Strong IPOPRAH had a successful IPO launch. The underwriter syndicate, which included Jefferies, Citibank, KKR, UBS, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo Securities as the joint syndicate managers, with Baird and William Blair as co-managers, opted to exercise the over subscription allocation of shares for the full offering, netting $330 million + for PRAH.As KKR still owns a controlling stake, they certainly should be pleased with the stock's current $1.26 billion market cap.With the stock price in a stable trading range above the IPO price and volume also in a reliable range, pricing appears to have reached equilibrium pursuant to new press releases on December 9.(Nasdaq.com)Gradually Limiting Debt, ExpensesThe Use of Proceeds, which had been earmarked for redemption of $150 million worth of senior notes and paying down $165 million of its Secured Senior Loan Term Facility, is certainly going to help PRAH.One area of vulnerability is PRAH's $1 billion plus in debt, resulting in a current -0.39 EPS.With over $1 billion posted in revenues, anything that empowers PRAH to bring down expenses will aid its growth prospects going forward.Conclusion: Strong Buying OpportunityWhite paper studies by a number of academic institutions, including the University of Florida, and our own research, observe a demonstrated price appreciation of between 2% to 5% on average in the days both preceding and following a quiet period expiration when other bullish indicators are already publicly disclosed.For PRAH, solid revenues, a strong IPO and underwriting group, as well as being in the ever growing industry of biotech, all point to at least a short term appreciation at the expiration of the quiet period.With the influx of biotech company IPOs in 2014, a pool of cash flush customers for CRO services has been increased dramatically over the past 12 months. The global CRO market was estimated to be $22 billion in 2013 and is calculated to grow at an 8% CAGR over the next 5 years to $32 billion. Roughly 31% of Phase 1 through Phase 4 trials were outsourced in 2013, and this percentage could rise to 43% by 2018.The vested interest of KKR could continue to bode well for PRAH.We suggest investors strongly consider a buying opportunity ahead of the likely analyst report releases before-market on December 9th.We invite readers wishing to join the discussion on IPO quiet period expirations to click the +FOLLOW button above the title of this article, and those looking for the latest updates to click +Get real-time alerts."

PRAH's global clinical development platform includes more than 75 offices across North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, South Africa, Australia and the Middle East and more than 10,000 employees worldwide. Since 2000, PRAH has performed approximately 2,300 clinical trials worldwide, it has worked on more than 100 marketed drugs across several therapeutic areas and conducted the pivotal or supportive trials that led to FDA, or international regulatory approval, of more than 45 drugs.PRAH is focused on further expansion into high growth, emerging markets, which is demonstrated by the formation of its 2012 joint venture with WuXi AppTec (Shanghai) Co. Ltd., or WuXi, a CRO managing clinical trials in Asia, and its 2013 acquisition of ClinStar, LLC, or ClinStar, a CRO managing clinical research trials in Eastern Europe.PRAH believes it is a leader in the transformation of the CRO engagement model via its flexible clinical development service offerings, which include embedded and functional outsourcing services in addition to traditional, project-based clinical trial services.September 2013 acquisitionIn September 2013, PRAH completed the acquisition of ReSearch Pharmaceutical Services, or RPS, a global CRO providing clinical development services primarily to large pharmaceutical companies, which provides a highly complementary fit with PRAH's historical focus on biotechnology and small- to mid-sized pharmaceutical companies.RPS, now known as PRAH's Strategic Solutions offerings, provides Embedded Solutions™ and functional outsourcing services in which PRAH's teams are fully integrated within the client's internal clinical development operations and are responsible for managing functions across the entire breadth of the client's drug development pipeline.PRAH believes that its Strategic Solutions offerings represent an innovative alternative to the traditional, project-based approach and allow its clients to maintain greater control over their clinical development processes.PRAH's flexible clinical development service offerings expand its addressable market beyond the traditional outsourced clinical development market to include the clinical development spending that biopharmaceutical companies historically have retained in-house.Intellectual propertyPRAH does not own any patent registrations, applications, or licenses. PRAH does maintain and protect trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information regarding many of its business processes and related systems.PRAH also holds various federal trademark registrations and pending applications, including PRA Health Sciences® (including a design) PRA® (including a design) and PRA International®.CompetitionPRAH competes primarily with other full-service CROs and in-house research and development departments of pharmaceutical and established biotech companies.PRAH's principal traditional CRO competitors are Covance Inc., ICON plc, INC Research, Inc., PAREXEL International Corporation, Pharmaceutical Product Development LLC, Quintiles Transnational Corp. and inVentiv Health Inc.CROs compete on the basis of a number of factors, including reliability, past performance, expertise and experience in specific therapeutic areas, scope of service offerings, strengths in various geographic markets, technological capabilities, ability to manage large scale global clinical trials, and price.5% shareholders pre-IPOInvestment funds affiliated with KKR 93.2%DividendsNo dividends are planned.Use of proceedsPRAH expects to receive $343 million from its IPO and use it for the following:to redeem $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes for an amount equal to 109.5% of their face value, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date, to repay approximately $165.0 million of borrowings under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility and for general corporate purposes.

For those of us who follow PRA Health Sciences, we are expecting their eleventh straight beat.

Conservatively forecast and over delivery:(Source: Quarterly Data from SEC 10-K Reports.)(Source: Quarterly Data from SEC 10-K Reports.)Without any major disruptive event in PRA Health Sciences’ path, we would expect this positive trend to continue. A simple trend analysis on PRAH’s prior ten quarterly reported earnings predicts PRAH’s 2Q17 Quarterly Earnings performance should result in an upcoming 5% to 7% beat. This trend analysis predicts a value of $0.77 to $0.79, which is slightly above the high end of the current Wall Street Forecast: PRAH company guidance $0.74, analyst’s range $0.69 to $0.77. (Source: Investor Relations - PRA Health Sciences.)PRAH’s 2Q17 Earnings Report will be released after the market closes on Monday August 7, 2017. Based on this trend analysis, their stock will close the week in the $78 to $82 range. This is a nice uptick from their current $76 to $77 price range.Moreover, PRAH has positioned themselves to continue for several quarters into the future with solid quarter-over-quarter gains.Digging deeper into the data on PRA Health Sciences Inc. helps us understand how they can perform in such a stable predictable fashion:PRAH is a Contract Research Organization, or CRO. PRAH basically provides outsourced clinical development services to the pharmaceutical and biomedical industries. They offer a wide range of services, which encompass turnkey data management, statistical analysis, clinical trial management, drug development, and regulatory consulting and filings.In the simplest form: PRAH is a service provider or a consulting firm. They serve their clients by managing all aspects of clinical trials and pharmaceutical development from Phase I through Phase IV on a global basis. PRAH has roughly 85 offices across North America, Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, South Africa, and the Middle East with over 13,000 employees many with advanced degrees.A combination of their global reach and consulting contracts results in a predictable revenue stream. While their contractual structure is confidential, one must assume that they receive consulting fees for much of their services no matter the outcome of the clinical trial. When a drug company is developing a new medication for an infectious disease, for example, we all hear about the setbacks and iterations. Novel drug development is an expensive R&D investment. Like legal and tax consultants, PRAH is paid as the clinical trials progress irrespective of the results.As a CRO, PRAH specializes in clinical trial services and offers their clients a wealth of knowledge and expertise in managing the complex FDA, NIH, EMA approval processes. The CRO Market and Providers have seen a recent rash of mergers and consolidations.Source: Composite Summary from Harriswilliams.com Industry Reports 2014.4.17 Contract Research Organizations; Arena-International.com Journals 2014/05/29 Axel-Mescheder.pdf; Pharma-IQ.com Regulatory Legal Articles Top 10 Clinical Research Organisations.Per Clinical Leader, ""Clinical Outsourcing Market to see Continued Growth Through 2020"": R&D spending from 2015 and forecasted through 2020 is increasing at an annual 15.5% YOY growth rate as the Pharmaceutical and Biotechnology Industries races to build their intellectual property shelves. A portion of this expansion will be supported by CRO and their clinical trial management skills. Per the Association of Clinical Research Organizations (ACRO) fact sheet, found at ACRO Health Media Center, the current estimate for the CRO Market Growth is 7% CAGR. In 2015, CRO Revenue was estimated at $25.6B. This pegs the 2020 market at over $38B. ACRO segments the CRO business by roughly 66% from pharmaceutical; 27% from biotech; and the remaining 7% by medical device, foundation and government sectors. According to ACRO, (referencing a Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development Report), clinical trials are completed 4 to 5 months more rapidly through CRO organizations.(Source: Registered Studies - Clinical Trials Resources Trends)Reviewing the US Government listed data on Registered Studies, we find a 17.5% year-over-year growth in registered studies since 2010. This figure supports the CRO Industry and Association’s growth rate prediction of 7%.The top ten global CRO firms have carved out a well-structured niche business segment. They manage clinical trials and ensure a revenue stream partially independent of the success or setbacks of the underlying drug, compound, or device. PRAH, and the other CRO firms, have excellent barriers to entry within their market niche. These include FDA, NIH, EMA approval and certified processes, such as Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards.Of course, there are downside risks within a PRAH investment, which should not be ignored. The three primary risks are related to: 1) Economic Slowdown, 2) Changes to our Domestic Health Care Policies, and 3) Competition and Competitive Factors.For the scope of this analysis, we are focused on the short- to medium-term quarterly pickup with Thursday’s after-hours Earning Announcement. That said, PRAH stock has performed well over the past ten quarters and has proven to be a good long-term investment.The greatest risk to the current PRAH business model and growth rate is a general economic slowdown. An economic slowdown, if deep enough, will result in an R&D spending reduction at major Biotech and Pharmaceutical principles. While an economic slowdown is not on the horizon, I have partially accounted for this risk by discounting PRAH’s growth rate percentage “beat” from their ten-quarter average of 12.06% to the range of 5% to 7%.Changes to our Domestic Health Care Policies could have a secular negative effect on the CRO Industry. However, all signs point to the fact that both major political parties are reluctant to lay a heavy hand on the Healthcare Industry. Here we see the double-edge sword of active governmental participation within private industry. On one side of the sword, Biotech and Pharmaceutical companies spend billions of dollars for intellectual property advantages. On the other, heavy R&D Investments and risk related to successful outcomes during clinical trials must be rewarded with larger than normal downstream margins during production on the resulting devices, drugs and treatments. The 3rd and final primary risk to PRAH’s success is related to general competition. However, as previously discussed, barriers to entry within the CRO Industry are large. The CRO Industry is shifting to M&A consolidation from the historical “new player” expansion. PRAH has proven to take market share with revenue growth rates exceeding the market expansion rate. While PRAH is much smaller than the CRO Market Leader (Quintiles IMS Holdings), PRAH’s strong management team is leveraging their business process well, and on a percentage basis has expanded their business at a faster rate than Quintiles, as represented in the table below:(Source: SEC Edgar Database – July 23, 2017 reference data)(Source: SEC Edgar Database – July 23, 2017 reference data)The mergers and CRO Provider consolidations that have occurred over the past 18 months are expected to continue over the next several years. The CRO Provider Industry is ripe and in play for M&A. The complexity and regulations that create the solid protective barrier for entry entices M&A. Quintiles IMS Holding Inc. (NYSE:Q) is one of the consolidating drivers. While Parexel International Corp. (NASDAQ:PRXL) was recently acquired by a Pamplona Capital Management LLP (a Private Equity firm). The market is watching for action around Icon PLC (NASDAQ:ICLR) and Charles River Laboratories Int'l Inc. (NYSE:CRL).Per FierceBiotech:PRAH becomes a long hold play for its excellent and consistent quarterly growth and the acquisitive nature of the CRO Provider Market.These three factors ensure PRAH earnings will continue to grow for the foreseeable future: resulting in a Strong Buy. Moreover, I expect to see a very positive PRAH Earnings Report on Monday August 7, 2017, with 2Q17 Quarterly EPS range between $0.77 and $0.79, and a proportional stock range between $78 to $82 per share."

PRAH intends to use the remaining proceeds to invest in cash or money market accounts.Company OverviewThe biotech and pharmaceutical industries' enormous growth in the last few decades has created a need for infrastructure suited to the testing and data collection services required by biotech firms to satisfy U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for approval. PRA Health Sciences, located in Raleigh, NC and founded in 1982, is one of the premier global contract research organizations (CRO) on the planet, when measured by revenue. PRA handles all of the protocols necessary for FDA Phase 1 to Phase 4 trials on behalf of their enormous client base on an outsource basis. PRAH's areas of with therapeutic expertise include pharmaceutical development, including oncology, central nervous system, inflammation and infectious diseases.PRA is a true global CRO, with clinical development platforms and 10,000 + employees in over 75 office locations throughout the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South Africa. In the last decade and a half, PRA has supervised over 2,300 clinical trials that contributed to the successful marketing of over 100 commercial drug therapies. Over 45 drugs to date under PRA's watch have been approved by the FDA or for international regulatory approval.PRAH competes with other full-service CROs, as well as established pharma and biotech companies, who have in-house research and development departments. Major CRO competitors include Covance Inc., ICON plc, INC Research, Inc., PAREXEL International Corporation, Pharmaceutical Product Development LLC, Quintiles Transnational Corp. and inVentiv Health Inc.See PRAH's S-1 filings for full info.Ownership, Financial, and Growth HistoryThe Carlyle Group (NYSE: CG) sold PRA to Genstar for $95 million in 2001. Genstar subsequently floated an IPO for PRA in 2004, then took it private 3 years later at a much higher $800 million price. They subsequently sold it to private equity behemoth Kolberg, Kravitz Roberts (NYSE: KKR) 14 months ago for $1.3 billion. To cover Asia, PRA formed a joint venture with WuXi AppTec (Shanghai) Co. Ltd.In February 2013, PRA Holdings acquired ClinStar, LLC, or ClinStar, a US based CRO and logistics provider with operations in Eastern Europe, for $45.0 million in cash and contingent consideration in the form of a potential earn-out payment of up to $5.0 million.KKR also bought ReSearch Pharmaceutical Services (RPS) in September 2013 from Warburg Pincus for $274 million and combined it with PRA Health. By year's end, the company had acquired CRI Lifetree for $77.1 million. This growth by acquisition or merger strategy has since created what it said to be the world's fourth-largest pharma contractor.PRA posted $1.1 billion in revenues for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2014. In the first 6 months of 2014, the company got 20% of its revenue from small- to midsized pharmaceutical companies, 26% from large biotech firms and 14% from emerging drug developers. However, the company also posted a net loss of ($14.097 million) for the same period.As of June 30, 2014, PRAH holds total assets of ~$2.4 billion, total liabilities of ~$1.9 billion, for a total stockholders' equity of $462,061.Conclusion: Exercise CautionBiotech and pharmaceutical sectors' R&D and clinical trial requirements have ballooned of late (The global CRO market was $22 billion in 2013 and is expected to grow at an 8% clip over the next 5 years to $32 billion.) Roughly 31% of Phase 1 through Phase 4 trials were outsourced in 2013, and this figure could rise to 43% by 2018-all of which highlight enormous potential for PRAH.CRO deals have found also favor on Wall Street recently. Successful raises include $800+ million for Catalent (NYSE: CTLT) and Quintiles' (NYSE: Q) $947 million IPO in 2013.While these are promising signs, we are hearing the deal might need a lower price target to complete and suggest investors exercise caution.

2685655,25120,2014-11-17T03:19:47-05:00,"PRA Health Sciences is another contract research company making its public debut.
        The KKR-backed business has grown by deals, and carries along a heavy debt load.
        The premium valuation, high leverage and existence of informed investors who are selling, makes me cautious.","Investors in PRA Health Sciences (NASDAQ:PRAH) have seen a difficult public offering this week. PRA sold its shares far below the preliminary guidance range set by the underwriting syndicate, but they managed to regain some ground following the offering.The Public OfferingPRA Health Sciences is a CRO, or contract research organization, providing outsourced clinical development service to traditional pharmaceutical businesses as well as biotechnology clients.The company conducts clinical trials around the globe, focusing on areas like oncology, the central nervous system as well as inflammation and infectious diseases.PRA sold 18.6 million shares for $18 apiece, thereby raising $335 million in gross proceeds excluding the potential additional capital raised though the exercise of the greenshoe option. The company is selling roughly 17 million shares as the offering of selling shareholders is quite limited. Consequently, the company itself will see gross proceeds of around $306 million from the offering.The pricing of the offering was quite a disappointment with the company, its investors and bankers aiming for a price in the $20-$23 range. With some 57.3 million shares outstanding following the offering, and shares having recovered towards $20 per share, equity in the business is valued around $1.15 billion.Banks which aided the company in its process to become a public firm were Jefferies, Citigroup, UBS, Credit Suisse, Wells Fargo, Baird and William Blair.The Valuation And PotentialPRA Health Sciences is one of the larger contract research organizations, employing some 10,000 workers across 75 locations throughout the world. Work which the company has done has resulted in the approval of more than 45 drugs by the FDA or other international regulatory bodies.The company aims to benefit from a general increase in R&D investments, especially as large pharmaceutical companies are struggling to replace their current blockbusters. At the same time the trend towards more flexible developments and outsourcing is benefiting the company on top of that.The company has been acquired by KKR as recent as September of 2013 in a $1.4 billion deal. Following this purchase, PRA has acquired RPS Parent for little over $274 million as it bought CRI Holding in a $77 million deal as well.Given the dealmaking and the complicated reporting structure, it is hard to judge how quick growth has been on an annual basis. The pro-forma business posted sales of $1.39 billion in 2013, of which nearly $192 million resulted from reimbursements. The company posted modest operating earnings of $12.5 million that year, as $86.1 million in interest expenses pushed the company into the red numbers that year.For the first nine months of this year, revenues totaled $1.09 billion which implies that if sales can be annualized, revenues for 2014 could come in around $1.45 billion. More importantly the company managed to post operating earnings of $45 million for this period, making real advancements in terms of its operating profitability. Again the high cost of debt resulted in net losses, totaling nearly $13 million for this nine month period.Ahead of the offering PRA Health held merely $49 million in cash while it has $1.24 billion in debt outstanding. The $1.2 billion net debt position is significant, and costly as the effective cost of debt comes in around 7% per year. Following the offering, the net debt position will decrease to little over $900 million. PRA aims to use the IPO proceeds to redeem debt carrying interest rates as high as 9.5%, as the redemption of debt and refinancing of existing debt at lower rates, could save the business easily some $30 million per year.This should allow PRA Health to break-even on a GAAP basis, or post even modest earnings. Adjusted EBITDA which excludes the impact of the leverage, is seen around $175 million.The nearly $2 billion valuation which includes both the valuation of debt and equity, values the business at around 11-12 times annualized adjusted EBITDA, a significant multiple.Final TakeawayInvestors largely avoided the offering of PRA Health. Even as shares have risen some 10% from the public offering price, they only trade at the low end of the preliminary offering range.One of the reasons for investors to be cautious might be the fact that KKR is willing to sell the business just a year after having acquired the business, which even for a private-equity firm is a very short holding period, and could potentially be a worrying sign. The quick exit is one thing, as PRA has a huge debt load of some $900 million following the offering. In relation to the reported EBITDA this is a huge debt load, as GAAP profitability will be very small anticipated going forwards. Other risks include potential contract losses on large contracts, short term cancellation policies, advancements in technology, competition, and in-house competition from the company's clients.Just like many offerings these days, I am not convinced about the quality of PRA Health Sciences. High leverage, an informed seller and a premium valuation are reasons for me to remain cautious."

An example of such company is Cambrex (NYSE:CBM), a contract manufacturing organization (CMO) that specializes in producing innovator and generic small active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). Cambrex has benefited, and is still benefiting, significantly from the strong growth in the biotech and pharmaceutical industry. For the past 5 years, the company's EPS has been growing at 40% CAGR and the stock price has risen over 800%, more than double the return from the biotech index (NASDAQ:IBB). You can read my detailed analysis on Cambrex here.Another industry that has got an advantage from the consolidation is contract research organization (CRO), which helps biopharma companies to run their clinical trials. Notable publicly traded CROs include Quintiles (Q), Icon PLC (NASDAQ:ICLR) and INC Research Holdings (INCR). I have written about INCR here, but now, another CRO called PRA Health Sciences (NASDAQ:PRAH) has come under my radar. INCR and PRAH bear close resemblance in many aspects, and therefore, I think a comparison is necessary to determine which CRO deserves to be in your portfolio.OverviewINCR and PRAH both came public late 2014, and their respective stock prices increased rapidly since the IPO, returning more than 100% from their recent highs, compared to less than 20% from IBB during the same period.Unlike some CRO juggernauts such as Quintiles and Parexel that offer a wide array of services, INCR and PRAH focus almost exclusively on late-stage clinical trials, especially Phase III-IV, and related services. The only difference in the two is that PRAH has larger geographical presence and does have quite as strong presence in other areas of the business like INCR does.Income StatementLet's start with a basic income statement analysis. As shown in the chart below, both firms have been growing their EBITDA steadily every quarter since 2014. This reflects the fact that both firms are benefiting from the active R&D spending by biotech and pharmaceutical companies. As a matter of fact, the late-stage CRO industry is actually expected to grow at 7-8% CAGR until 2020.The EBITDA margin is also improving for both firms. However, INCR has a consistently higher EBITDA margin compared to PRAH. This reflects the emphasis in INCR's business model on the higher-margin late-stage projects, as compared to PRAH, which is dragged down by other services that yield lower profitability.Source: INCR, PRAH Investor PresentationsBoth companies have also grown their revenue at impressive rate from 2012 to 2014, especially PRAH. PRAH's revenue grew at 27% CAGR, while INCR's grew at 10%. Its wider range of services and also its wide geographical presence allows PRAH to steadily attract new business awards (projects) every quarter as compared to INCR. This factor might explain why PRAH's revenue grows more than INCR's.Source: INCR, PRAH Investor Presentations. Net new business (bar, left scale). Backlog conversion (line, right scale)But revenue alone does not give us the whole picture. The backlog conversion rate for both companies, I think, reflects what's happening in their overall operation. As you can see, both companies have very small range of backlog conversion rate. This means that their respective operational capacity has not been compromised, even though they are getting new business awards. In other words, they could complete the same percentage of a project in a given time, despite having more projects at hand. Overall, this situation reflects the flexibility of both companies to deploy their resources in order to fulfill increasing demand.Ending backlog refers to the portion of projects that have not been completed yet. As in the chart below, both companies maintain almost the same amount of backlog quarter over quarter. Depending on the revenue recognition system of each firm, some of that revenue from ending backlog may have not been recognized yet. Why is this important? Well, let's assume that all of the revenue from the ending backlog has not been recognized yet. Then, it would be clear that both companies actually have a reliable stream of revenue for every quarter that originates from the ending backlog being rolled forward to the next quarter.Source: INCR, PRAH Investor PresentationsTo make things more interesting, we could consider the actual book-to-bill ratio for both companies. Other than hinting at the demand for their services, this ratio could also indicate how much of the revenue from projects is actually being recognized for each quarter. Again, we could see that PRAH has steadier demand and revenue recognition. In contrast, INCR shows higher variability in this aspect, which is expected, since the company's new business award is also more variable.Source: INCR, PRAH Investor PresentationsBalance Sheet And Cash FlowOne of the concerning aspects of the CRO industry is that the companies usually have high leverage. This could cause trouble, especially for a small cap, high-growth company such as INCR. Therefore, I pay the most attention to the net leverage ratio for each company. As in the chart below, I am very relieved to see that both companies have been deleveraging since their respective IPOs. This is a healthy sign that their operating profits have been able to cover their debt obligations.Source: INCR, PRAH Investor PresentationsTo further convince myself, I looked into the credit rating of both companies. It wasn't surprising that INCR has a better credit rating compared to PRAH, because of PRAH's higher leverage. However, both companies have received upgrades on their respective credit ratings. As of May 2015, INCR's senior credit facilities was rated ""Ba3"" from Moody, up from a ""B+"" rating. While for PRAH, S&P has just upgraded its credit rating from ""B"" to ""B+"". While both companies' credit facility are not investment-grade, but the uptick in the credit rating indicates some sign of improvement in their balance sheets with respect to solvency.As for cash flow, I only looked at operating cash flow and free cash flow for the previous three years. Since, both companies are still in the growth phase and the data range is short, the cash flow is not as stable as many investors would have wished. However, it is worth noting that INCR's cash flow is better as compared to that of PRAH. For the past three years, PRAH's cash flow has been declining, and its free cash flow dipped into negative territory in 2014.Source: INCR, PRAH Investor PresentationsValuation and GrowthNow, let's take a look at the valuation of and also the growth prospects for both companies. Highlighted in green in the table below are the valuation metrics that I focus more on.P/E, P/B, P/CF from Morningstar. EV/EBITDA and PEG from Yahoo Finance. Earnings Growth from Zacks.While the current P/E ratios of both stocks are way above the industry average (which is usual for growth stocks), the forward FY2016 P/E ratios around 18 are still reasonable. INCR's P/B and P/S indicate that it is more expensive compared to PRAH. However, if we focus on the cash metrics such as Price/Cash Flow, investors are buying INCR at a cheaper valuation compared to PRAH. The same could be said based on EV/EBITDA, which is a metric that I really like, since it is capital structure-neutral.On the growth front, analysts have higher expectation for INCR's earnings growth in the current fiscal year (116%) compared to that of PRAH (35%). For INCR, this is in line with management's EPS guidance. But for PRAH, analysts' expectation are below management's EPS guidance. However, this could be because analysts haven't revised their forecasts yet. Regardless, we shouldn't overlook the fact that both companies' managements increased their EPS guidance during the last conference call.Source: INCR, PRAH Investor PresentationsConclusionFor a large company, PRA Health Sciences seems to be doing well in term of revenue. The company has shown that it was able to grab new business awards in steady fashion, and therefore, had a higher revenue growth rate. I believe PRAH achieved this by leveraging its size and wide geographical presence. In the short and medium terms, PRAH could continue to leverage its size to benefit from the increasing demand for clinical trials. However, this prospect seems cloudy if we take into account its declining cash flow and low EBITDA margin.As a growth stock investor, I think INCR is the clear winner. This is a classic case of why bigger is not always better. While I don't have PRAH's year-over-year EBITDA and earnings growth, I've shown in my previous article that INCR had logged triple-digit growth in five out of the six previous quarters. And, as I highlighted in this article, analysts and management have also expressed their confidence in INCR's growth prospects, which is higher than that of PRAH. In addition, this higher growth from INCR comes at a cheaper valuation compared to PRAH, as discussed above. Last but not least, INCR also carries better credit rating as well as cash flow. Overall, I have more confidence in INCR as a medium- to long-term growth stock."

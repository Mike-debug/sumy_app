4377171,103480,2020-10-01T10:39:26-04:00,"Progress Software dipped ~5% after reporting fiscal third-quarter results, despite a decent earnings print.
        Most notably, while the company's top line only roughly matched consensus expectations, Progress Software returned to growth after being at flat revenues in Q2.
        Continued cash buildup provides additional dry powder for Progress Software to execute its M&A ambitions.
        The company also raised its expectations for the full year.","Here's my advice on Progress Software (PRGS): try not to think of this company as a tech stock. You'll be disappointed when you look at the company's growth rates and its legacy technology (Progress Software focuses on PaaS, which is technology tools that help developers build other applications) versus faster-growing SaaS peers.But if you think of Progress as more of an industrial concern - one with a very stable, recurring revenue base and gradually lifting margins, as well as steady profits and cash flow - then it's fully possible to appreciate this value stock.Shares of Progress Software dipped ~5% after reporting fiscal third-quarter results, despite what I believed to be a relatively strong print:With value-oriented tech stocks being such a rare breed in today's market, I think there's plenty to like about Progress Software:Wall Street analysts are expecting $3.29 for the next fiscal year (FY21), up 11% from the midpoint of this year's $2.94-$2.97 EPS range (which, by the way, has been lifted ~5% from last quarter):Figure 1. Progress Software guidance updateSource: Progress Software Q3 earnings deckSo against next year's EPS consensus, Progress Software trades at a very modest 11.1x FY21 P/E ratio. That's not just a discount to tech stocks - that's a discount to the broader market. One more note to add: though Progress Software's revenue growth is only in the single digits, its pro forma operating margin is ~40% - so technically, Progress Software would pass the ""Rule of 40"" test that is often applied to growth SaaS stocks (many of which ""fail"" this test because there loss margins are so excessive). To me, given Progress Software's cheap valuation and passable ~2% yield, I think the stock makes for a good defensive, safe play in the tech sector.Let's now dig deeper into Progress Software's fiscal third-quarter results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 2. Progress Software Q3 resultsSource: Progress Software Q3 earnings releaseProgress Software's revenue grew 3% y/y to $109.7 million. Note here that the company actually saw accelerated growth versus flat performance in Q2. We note that on a pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of deferred revenue adjustments in recent acquisitions, revenue contracted by -4% y/y - but Progress' CFO noted that renewal timing skews this metric and makes it lumpy. The company still noted that its $110.9 million in pro forma revenue was ~$2 million above the high end of its guidance range. Note as well that Progress expects this strong performance to sustain into Q4, primarily due to the contribution of a recent $220 million acquisition called Chef, an automation platform for software developers. The transaction is expected to close in October, and start contributing to Progress' results midway through its fiscal fourth quarter ($10-$12 million in total expected contribution for Q4). The high end of the company's $125-$129 million revenue range (on a pro forma basis) would imply 5% y/y growth. Overall, Chef is currently running at ~$70 million in annualized revenue - which would boost Progress' scale by roughly 15%. The Chef acquisition is also expected to enrich Progress Software's recurring revenue mix (currently at 80%) by another two points.Looking ahead to next year, Progress CFO Anthony Folger also gave some directional pointers on FY21 without giving explicit guidance. Key among them is that he expects Chef to drive double-digit revenue growth for the company overall, while the company's organic growth will be roughly flat. Per his remarks on the Q3 earnings call:We also continue to be encouraged by Progress Software's cost discipline. As seen in the earnings table above, sales and marketing costs and product development costs declined by -12% y/y and -11% y/y, respectively. This allowed Progress Software to boost its pro forma operating margins to 42%, two points richer than 40% in the year-ago quarter. Margin expansion has also translated well into cash flow growth. In Q3, Progress grew cash flows by 10% y/y to $30.1 million; year-to-date, it has notched the same 10% y/y growth to $101.8 million:Figure 3. Progress Software cash flow trends Source: Progress Software Q3 earnings releaseWith annual cash flows currently in the ~$140 million range (Progress has guided to $135-$140 million for the full FY20), the way I'd think about Progress' earnings and growth potential is that the company is generating enough cash to pursue a nearly-Chef-sized acquisition every year and boost its scale by double-digits. As long as these acquisitions ramp up to become earnings-accretive relatively quickly, this is a plausible growth strategy (and one that more than justifies Progress' lowball ~11x P/E ratio).Where most software companies offer growth, Progress Software offers stability. This is a company with rich ~40% operating margins, a very high ~80% recurring revenue mix, and a plan to recycle its cash flows into buying companies that both boost Progress' ARR and expand its bottom line. To me, this stock is worth a nibble at current low prices."
4305804,104952,2019-11-12T13:39:20-05:00,"Progress' TTM growth rates in the last few years have been volatile, negatives, and also unable to break at least the mid-single-digit zone.Progress' weak execution of its accretive M&A growth strategy has adversely affected its financials in recent times.With ~4.4 TTM P/S, weak fundamentals, and inorganic growth, investors are faced with increasingly high opportunity cost to consider dipping their toes in the stock.Almost all of Progress' businesses are prone to disruptions from the more innovative and faster-growing cloud competitors in the PaaS, APM, and BI spaces.","The downside Q4 outlook despite the guidance-beating Q3 speaks volumes about the situation at Progress Software (PRGS). We have a bearish view of the company, primarily driven by the lack of innovation and overall weak execution on its growth strategy. In the last few years, the company has been relying on acquisitions of smaller technology companies to boost its growth. The inorganic growth strategy appears to come with a significant challenge.(source: stockrow)TTM growth rates in the last few years have been volatile, negatives, and also unable to break at least the mid-single-digit zone. Based on the FY 2019 guidance, Progress will finish FY 2019 with $425 million - $428 million of revenue. If all goes according to the plan, that means Progress will achieve a ~7% YoY revenue growth in the near term. In the long term, however, we remain skeptical of Progress' capacity to maintain the outlook going forward.Part of the issues we see in Progress is its weak executions in both M&A deal identification and integration. Ultimately, its accretive M&A growth strategy has not been producing shareholder values. Deal integration has been weak overall. Revenue has been unstable and even declined in recent years, while the company was forced to scale back one of its recently-acquired units, Kinvey:The bigger part of the issues in Progress, however, has a lot to do with its overall enterprise business. Competing in some of the fastest-growing technology sectors such as PaaS, Data Management, Serverless cloud, and Analytics, we expect Progress' lack of ongoing innovation to create a major long-term challenge. For instance, Progress' idea of innovation has been its approach to develop for its clients ""cognitive applications"". The idea is a weaker alternative to what a lot of fast-growing cloud BI (Business Intelligence) or APM (Application Performance Management) players have produced and sold out of the box.Overall, we think that the aforementioned issues will put pressure on Progress' long-term revenue growth and margins. Last year alone, we saw how ""Data Connectivity and Integration"" and ""Application Development and Deployment"" segments were down by -5% and -1% YoY. Eventually, in the long term, these downward pressures will be felt across all of Progress' businesses due to the disruptions from the more modern and innovative competitors. We see threatening disruptive forces around Progress' businesses already.Progress' DataRPM and Kinvey platforms, for instance, are hardly special next to PagerDuty (PD) or New Relic (NEWR) platforms. Progress' OpenEdge Ipswitch, meanwhile, is also prone to disruption from the likes of Box (BOX) or Atlassian (TEAM). In the end, Pivotal (PVTL) is also one of the more innovative and well-funded competitors that can easily put Progress' ""cognitive services"" application development business on the back foot.Having no definite answer while competing in an increasingly saturated and growing technology market, Progress still puts a lot of hope in its accretive M&A strategy. The company claimed that upon the successful execution of its ongoing strategy, we should expect a target 10% - 20% YoY inorganic growth to double the revenue over 5 years. As it stands, this would be the only potential upside in addition to the company's adjustment on its share repurchase plan:With a lackluster 3.93% YoY growth and weak business fundamentals, the opportunity cost to invest in Progress is relatively high despite its moderate TTM P/S of 4.45, further justifying our bearish thesis. Upland Software (UPLD), another competitor that uses the same M&A growth strategy, for instance, trades at the same TTM P/S despite having grown its top-line by over 51% YoY. In general, the market does not appear to award a sizable premium to inorganic growth stocks, which gives us another challenge when valuing Progress aside from its relatively volatile metrics. With $435.2 million of revenue in FY 2020, the stock trades at P/forward sales of 4.2."
4357359,104952,2020-07-07T14:01:53-04:00,"Progress relies on accretive M&As for growth. Having not made any recent M&As, Q2 revenue was down ~1% YoY.Progress boasts 81% of recurring revenue in Q2, but we suspect that much of that still came from a lower-quality revenue stream, such as Maintenance and Services.M&A playbook still does not address the recurring revenue quality issue, consequently raising questions on Progress's capacity in driving shareholder value longer term.","In our last note, we discussed Progress Software's (PRGS) vulnerability to disruption across some of its businesses. The company relies on accretive M&As to drive growth, though some of the past acquisitions are questionable. In our view, many of the acquired businesses are playing in the enterprise spaces that are either too segmented and competitive, such as low code, UI/UX tools, file management, and business rules automation. The share price has been down -8.16% since we published our bearish thesis last time. We still think that Progress is exposed to critical long-term risk factors going forward, and we maintain our bearish stance on the business.Despite being a tech company, Progress offers relatively minimal organic growth opportunities. The company relies primarily on M&A to drive growth, as reflected in its Q1 result, in which it had a 22% growth in revenue after it recognized the result of the Ipswitch acquisition. Ultimately, despite beating its guidance in Q2, revenue was still down ~1% YoY, even after including the full quarterly result of its Ipswitch acquisition.(Source: Company’s earnings call slide)Progress also boasts an uptrend in recurring revenue, though it did not break it down by the business segment further. Based on the most recent Q1 report, we suspect that the recurring revenue mostly comes from the M&S (maintenance and service) businesses, which are of lower quality. In 2019, Progress reported that 70% of the recurring revenue came from M&S, though in the recent earnings slide, it reported that it had 78% of recurring revenue in 2019, indicating that only 8% of its Licensing business was SaaS. The recurring figure improved to 81% in Q2, though we believe that M&S still largely drives the segment. In Q1 alone, Licensing made up 28% of the revenue, already down 2% from the figure in 2019.(Source: Company’s earnings call slide)To boost growth and the recurring portion going forward through M&A, Progress leverages its playbook, whose strategy we found to be weak and vague, in the context of creating shareholder value. It will continue focusing on driving recurring revenue through M&A, though it does not indicate how much of the new acquisitions will have SaaS-based, as opposed to M&S-based, recurring revenue. As we highlighted in our past coverage, Progress’s businesses are less attractive to us, considering that they face threats from more disruptive competitors. Without more SaaS-based M&As, it remains uncertain how Progress will improve its revenue quality as well as competitiveness, despite the plan to double its business in five years through M&As.Progress still has a relatively powerful list of enterprise clients, such as Toshiba, Microsoft, or eBay. However, the offering adoptions vary among clients, with some adopting more mission-critical solutions than others. Nasa, for instance, uses Progress’s Telerik tool, which is pretty much a UI/UX web development tool that is easily replaceable by others. On the other hand, eBay leverages Progress’s Corticon offering for its risk management function, which in our view, has a relatively much higher switching cost.(Source: Company’s earnings call slide)Overall, Progress remains an unattractive opportunity, given no meaningful catalysts in the business, despite the remaining $230 million in its share repurchase program. The best it can do is to continually improve its profitability through cost reduction initiatives like it did in Q2. In Q2, it achieved a 100 bps expansion in operating margin as a result of a reduction in T&E and other expenses. Progress only expects revenue to grow by ~4.8% this year to ~$433 million. In the meantime, M&S will likely still make up the majority of the recurring portion of the revenue, effectively making the overall revenue quality low. Progress also largely depends on accretive M&A for growth, which should see some challenges this year, given the macro uncertainties. At ~4x P/S, we think that there are far better opportunities in the market today."
4252250,21815,2019-04-02T03:24:09-04:00,"Despite a lack of organic growth as it operates a mature business, the company has come up with a growth strategy.Growth for shareholders occurs mainly through accretive acquisitions and share buybacks, and this strategy is working.Q1 results and guidance surprised on the upside but the shares are likely to have to digest last week's jump first, though we see some further upside to them longer term.","In December last year, we considered buying shares of Progress Software (PRGS), but despite the considerable margins and cash flow, we wanted to see some results of the company's growth strategy. You can see what we mean:Data by YChartsRevenue has flatlined for a couple of years, and even seems to move a little backwards lately. But despite that (which is at least in part a result of the move to the new 606 accounting standard), there is something of a growth strategy:The results came ahead of analysts' expectations:OpenEdge, the company's flagship application development platform, was responsible, producing better-than-expected license sales (both directly and from ISV partners). Even though it was only up 1% to $67.5 million, so it's hardly rocking.This progress could continue, as the company is rolling out its new version, OpenEdge 12, which is backwards compatible and, among other things (from the Q1CC):While not yet substantial in generating revenue, last year's acquisitions Kinvey platform (app development) and DataRPM (anomaly detection and prediction machine learning solutions for sensor data) are ramping up in terms of S&M efforts, and management sees steady pipeline growth.We're a bit disappointed management could not give more precise guidance, as this part has the potential to offer at least some organic growth, which would be very welcome.License revenue declined by 12%, but this was (from the Q1CC):Progress Software acquired Ipswitch, a provider of software solutions with an annual revenue of $75 million (75% of which is recurring) and a similar growth profile and recurring revenue (that is, it's a mature business). The company has two core products with over 24,000 customers in 170 countries (although 70% of revenue comes from the US):Here are the main data bits:For Q2:For 2019:The increase in guidance comes from the Ipswich acquisition, while the guidance from its core business remains the same. The increased guidance seems to have been the main factor in the favorable market reaction to the Q1 figures.Data by YChartsData by YChartsThe company is a solid producer of cash flow, which has been used for buybacks, producing a substantial decline in the share count as it exceeds stock-based compensation. Dividends are a more recent phenomenon:Data by YChartsThe buybacks will be suspended for a year to digest the acquisition, as management argues that the returns on the acquisition are much larger than those on buybacks.The company had $133 million in cash and equivalents at the end of Q1, with adjusted free cash flow reaching $24 million (down from $33 million last year). As a result of the Ipswich acquisition, total debt will be $301 million, to be repaid over five years.Data by YChartsNon-GAAP EPS is estimated at $2.51 this year, rising to $2.73 in 2020, which gives the shares an earnings multiple of 18 for this year.A combination of better results, higher guidance and a sensible, accretive acquisition has powered the shares 16% higher last Friday. We expect more progress for the company with the full cost synergies still over a year away.On the one hand, the shares aren't terribly expensive, but on the other hand, the company isn't growing gangbusters either, even if it's quite profitable and produces lots of cash flow to finance acquisitions, buy back shares and pay a dividend.We suspect the shares might have to digest last week's jump, but we think a year from now they are likely to be higher still - but Progress Software's organic growth is basically absent, so acquisitions and buybacks are the main mechanisms."
4160233,103480,2018-03-30T23:27:15-04:00,"Progress Software reported a better-than-expected Q1, with revenue returning to low-single-digit growth after declining for much of FY17.Despite the beat, the company didn't raise its guidance - which calls for FY18 to be essentially flat to FY17.Profit comps look elevated in the quarter, but that's due to the fact that Progress incurred restructuring expenses in the same quarter of last year.The company has also seen choppy trading in March since Praesidium Investment Management, one of its largest shareholders, exited its stake.","Progress Software (PRGS), the mid-cap PaaS company that focuses on platforms to deploy business applications, has just reported a much better than expected first quarter. For a company that has essentially tapered down to negative or zero growth, investors breathed a sigh of relief in seeing the company's 3% revenue lift this quarter - no matter how small.Despite initially rising in the post-market reaction to the earnings results, Progress Software has largely traded sideways on the news. Year to date, shares have lost 10%. And though the broader markets themselves have just posted their first quarterly loss since 2015, Progress Software's losses are bigger.PRGS data by YChartsTypically when a company beats earnings and the stock slides as a result, there's an opportunity to buy and make a profit on the reversal of sentiment. But in Progress Software's case, as it has been all of last year - the company isn't making enough progress (no pun intended) to become competitive.PaaS is certainly a hot space to be in right now. But what does it say about the quality of Progress Software's offering when it's only showing meager 3% revenue growth when much smaller, much more agile startups are racing ahead to ~$100 million run rates while Progress gets left behind?More so in PaaS than in SaaS, the biggest advantage to growth is scalability. It's true that Progress Software does count some large companies among its client base - its website showcases the likes of IBM (NYSE:IBM), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Volvo (OTCPK:VOLVY), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Sony (NYSE:SNE) as customers. If cloud companies like Adobe and Microsoft embrace Progress Software's offerings, is that not a validation of its technology?Perhaps - but the real question is how long Progress can retain these customers. PaaS inherently requires a large ecosystem that applications can be connected to. The fact that Progress Software is essentially flat year over year indicates that it doesn't have much more room to scale up. Competition, too, is heating up. Salesforce (CRM) this month announced its intention to buy MuleSoft (MULE) for $6.5 billion for 15.8x forward revenues, one of the most expensive transactions in software to date - an indicator of how serious Salesforce is at expanding its footprint in PaaS. Other heavyweights in the space include the likes of Amazon (AMZN) AWS, Microsoft, and Red Hat (RHT) - the latter of which, by the way, just reported earnings which showed a ~40% growth rate in its PaaS business.I have trouble believing Progress Software can stand tall in an arena of giants with much more developed product offerings and much greater resources to finance R&D. And for the little growth and potential you're getting with Progress Software, it trades at quite an expensive multiple.Progress Software's recent close at $38.45 puts the stock at a $1.78 billion market cap. Netting out the company's $167.5 million of cash and $120.4 million of debt (a large amount of debt for a software company of its size, relatively speaking), we arrive at an enterprise value of $1.73 billion. Against Progress Software's FY18 revenue guidance of $399-404 million (+1% y/y at the midpoint), the company trades at 4.3x forward revenues.That's certainly not a crazy multiple, but for the same price, you can buy a growth stock like Box (BOX), which is growing in the mid-20s and starting to churn out positive free cash flow. Box, too, has a growing Box Platform offering that has seen great adoption with its Fortune 500 clients.PRGS EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThere's a reason that Praesidium Investment Management, one of Progress Software's largest investors, has dumped the shares - as covered in a prior article on this site. For its zero-growth situation, Progress Software doesn't look attractively priced.The bottom line on Progress Software: avoid at all costs. The stock will likely continue to trade sideways as its low-growth results eventually lead to churn and a return to y/y declines.Here's a look at the company's first-quarter results:Source: Progress Software investor relationsAs seen in the chart above, revenues in the third quarter grew 3% y/y to $94.0 million. This was a modest, one-point beat to analyst consensus of $92.6 million (+2% y/y), but nothing to write home about. The company's return to growth is certainly mollifying after FY17 saw a 2% decline in full-year revenues - but in what part is this quarter's ""growth"" due to the easy comps from last year? All that Progress has essentially done is return to its run rate from two years back - hardly where we want a technology stock to be at.Progress Software's flagship platform offering, OpenEdge, saw 3% revenue growth as well to $66.4 million. Its Data Connectivity and Services business did achieve 11% revenue growth to $7.6 million in the quarter, but with that segment representing less than a tenth of Progress' revenues, it's unlikely to contribute a meaningful bump to its total results.On the profitability front, Progress didn't achieve too much either. Gross margins on a GAAP basis actually fell one point to 82% from 83% in 1Q17 (though we do note that in the 80s, Progress already has a very high gross margin relative to other companies in the software industry). On paper, it looks like Progress Software achieved huge operating margin expansion, with GAAP operating profits of $17.8 million, more than 10x 1Q17's operating profit of just $1.2 million. Note, however, that last year's comp included $17.1 million of restructuring expenses that have vastly tapered down this quarter.Pro forma EPS was $0.54 in the quarter, a 7-cent beat to analyst consensus of $0.44. Both operating and free cash flows, however, took a dip in the quarter. Most investors likely lean toward a cash flow valuation for Progress Software, so the dip is especially meaningful.As seen in the chart above, operating cash flows fell 15% y/y to $31.6 million, while free cash flows fell 18% y/y to $30.2 million.Unlike most companies, Progress Software issues free cash flow guidance, pointing to $115-120 million of FCF for FY18. This puts the company's current trading valuation at a 14.7x EV/FY18 FCF multiple - which isn't terrible, but factoring in the company's FCF declines, I'm still inclined to stay away.Despite a modest beat to Wall Street's expectations in its first-quarter results, Progress Software still looks like it has a rocky future ahead of it. Low single-digit top-line growth and a mild EPS beat are balanced by a double-digit decline in OCF and FCF. On top of that, Progress Software is playing in an increasingly heated arena with plenty of formidable competitors - especially Salesforce, whose play for MuleSoft gives it a ton of attention in the space.Though Progress Software looks like a value stock in an otherwise expensive tech sector, its lack of growth and good prospects more than likely makes it a value trap. Continue to stay away from this name."
4355857,103480,2020-06-26T12:09:34-04:00,"Shares of Progress Software rose ~4% after the company reported stronger-than-expected Q1 results and raised its guidance outlook.Operating margins gained, making the company's ~14x forward P/E look attractive.Progress is embarking on an aggressive M&A strategy that is targeting to double its size in five years.The company's leverage ratios are easing, giving Progress ample room to finance a growth-by-acquisitions strategy.","Progress Software (PRGS) is one of those ""legacy"" technology companies that has largely been forgotten by the markets in the wake of much more exciting and faster-growing software companies. The company, whose flagship product is an app development (PaaS) platform that helps other companies develop applications and web interfaces, has largely been unable to grow in the face of fierce competition.The company just reported Q2 results, however, that surprisingly exceeded expectations. As a result, shares jumped ~4% - a rare reaction for a company whose earnings frequently disappoint growth-oriented investors.Data by YChartsI last wrote on Progress Software more than a year ago, and rejected the stock as a value trap (in the intervening year, Progress has underperformed the S&P 500 by nearly ten points). Now, however, I see a path to this stock gaining on two counts:Progress won't be a multi-bagger winner like more recent IPOs might be, but there's now a value argument to be made. Keep an eye out for an entry point in this name.Let's touch first on Progress' recent fundamental strength. The company's revenues were relatively flat year-over-year at $100.4 million, but that came in three points stronger than Wall Street's expectations of $97.0 million (-3% y/y).Figure 1. Progress 2Q20 resultsSource: Progress 2Q20 earnings releaseThe company called out strong execution by its sales teams in the quarter, while also noting that the company's high mix of recurring revenue (81% of Progress' top line) helped to stabilize its revenue visibility. Anthony Folger, Progress' CFO, noted as well that the company's customer retention rates remained high.The company's pro forma operating margins also rose one point to 39%, up from 38% in the year-ago quarter. The company was able to exercise expense discipline in the wake of the coronavirus; on a GAAP basis, operating expenses reduced by -10% y/y, driven by reductions in sales and marketing expenses.This strength in the quarter prompted Progress to raise its full-year outlook. The company bumped up its revenue outlook by $5 million on both ends of the range (worth one point), while also boosting its full-year operating margin by one point to 40% as well.Figure 2. Progress guidance updateSource: Progress 2Q20 earnings deckEspecially given the expansion in Progress' operating margins, the company's P/E ratio at 13.7x based on the midpoint of Progress' FY20 pro forma EPS range, below the broader market, looks attractive.Of course, a cheap valuation isn't reason enough to buy a stock - there needs to be a path to growth as well. For Progress, whose organic growth has been largely muted over the past several years, the potential for growth lies in a renewed M&A strategy.In May, Progress appointed a new head of corporate development, Jeremy Segal, to lead its new M&A binge. Prior to joining Progress, Segal led M&A at two other notable public tech companies, LogMeIn (LOGM) and Akamai Technologies (AKAM). The company has an overall goal to double the size of its revenue within five years:Figure 3. Progress M&A strategySource: Progress 2Q20 earnings deckProgress believes that the current market environment plays well into an expanding M&A strategy, particularly because target valuations have fallen. Here's some helpful commentary from CEO Yogesh Gupta on the Q2 earnings call on the company's M&A strategy:We also like the fact that Progress has ample liquidity on its balance sheet to allow it to execute an ambitious M&A plan. As of the end of May, Progress had $203.6 million of cash on its balance sheet. The company is also free cash flow positive - in the first two quarters of fiscal 2020, the company generated $71.7 million of FCF, up 11% y/y. We note as well that, thanks to the company's strong cash flow generation, Progress' net leverage ratio has consistently fallen over the past several quarters, down to just 0.5x as of the end of Q2 (most banks consider a ~3x leverage multiple to be a ""highly leveraged"" company). This gives Progress plenty of borrowing capacity to chase M&A targets.Figure 4. Progress leverage trendsSource: Progress 2Q20 earnings deckThe prospect of extended lockdowns has fueled the rally in tech stocks to the point where many companies, especially software stocks tied to the remote-work trend, have runaway valuations. Progress Software has a completely different profile than most other software companies: below-market P/E-based valuation, rich operating margins, and growing free cash flows. Low leverage and ample balance sheet cash give Progress Software decent runway to grow via M&A. Keep an eye out for an entry point in this name."
4234740,103480,2019-01-22T12:59:48-05:00,"Progress Software reported yet another disappointing quarter that led shares to tumble ~5%.The company saw contracting revenue growth for the second quarter in a row, despite beating Wall Street's expectations.Making matters worse, Progress Software is forecasting an essentially flat year in FY19, falling far short of Wall Street's expectations.Progress Software is a company that has lost its momentum. Despite a seemingly attractive valuation, Progress Software is a value trap.","Embattled application development technology company Progress Software (PRGS) repeatedly turns up empty-handed in its earnings results. Progress Software just closed out its fiscal 2018 with another bleak Q4, continuing a recent trend of weakness that began in Q3 (when the stock suffered its biggest one-day plunge of ~20%). For the second quarter in a row, Progress Software saw its revenues decline year over year.PRGS data by YChartsAdmittedly, Progress Software looks like a value stock. The company's stock has fallen by 33% over the past year, and for a company with its revenue scale and GAAP profits, it certainly isn't worth nothing. Many small and mid-cap technology companies have been ""rescued"" by buyouts or acquisitions over the past year: Apptio (APTI), MuleSoft (MULE), and Red Hat (RHT) are good examples. In my view, however, Progress Software's legacy technology is insufficient to attract serious attention - especially as its core app dev use cases have a plethora of competition from the likes of Red Hat, Oracle (ORCL), and others. Its sinking valuation is a reflection of the fact that its opportunity to hold on to its client base - much less for new growth - are severely handicapped by daunting completion.At present, Progress Software trades at a market cap of $1.55 billion. After netting out the $139.5 million of cash and $116.1 million of debt on its balance sheet, Progress has an enterprise value of $1.53 billion. Against next year's revenue guidance range of $380-$386 million, this represents a rather modest valuation multiple of 4.0x EV/FY19 revenues.In my view, however, Progress Software is little more than a value trap. Its bleak guidance for FY19 is a reflection of that assessment. It's adopting ASC 606 next year, which will actually hurt its full year revenue volumes. Against this year's as-reported revenues of $397.2 million, this represents a -4% y/y contraction. Even after adjusting for the effects of the accounting change, however, Progress Software is only forecasting 1% y/y growth, far below the $398.4 million (+5% y/y) that Wall Street was expecting.Figure 1. Progress Software FY19 guidanceSource: Progress Software Q4 press releaseProgress Software's profit forecast is falling short of Wall Street's targets as well. Though the company is at the very least forecasting modest 8% y/y earnings growth (primarily due to a slight operating margin expansion, as well as a slight drop in pro forma effective tax rates), the Street was looking for EPS of $2.49. We can view Progress Software's valuation from an earnings growth lens as well. Based on the $2.33 midpoint of Progress Software's FY19 EPS range, the stock currently trades at a 14.6x P/E, but its earnings growth rate is only 8% - indicating a PEG ratio of 1.83x, a clear indication of a company that is overvalued relative to its earnings growth potential.The bottom line on Progress Software: The stock is a basket full of problems with no immediate fix. The company's product has become stale in a very competitive field for infrastructure software products, and this reflects clearly in the company's negative revenue growth. Continue to stay on the sidelines here: the bleeding is likely to continue.Here's a look at Progress Software's latest quarterly results:Figure 2. Progress Software 4Q18 resultsSource: Progress Software Q4 press releaseRevenues bled -4% y/y to $111.3 million, which actually represented a slight beat to Wall Street's expectations of $109.4 million (-6% y/y). When Progress Software had initially guided Q4 revenues, it had offered a range of -5% to -8% y/y decline, so at the very least it was able to come out on top. Nevertheless, Progress Software's declines worsened quarter over quarter: in Q3, the revenue contraction had only been -2% y/y. When we consider the fact that Progress Software had seen declining revenues in each of the past two quarters, the company's guidance to hit +1% y/y growth in FY19 seems somewhat optimistic. Given the company's spotty track record for execution, Progress may have a rough time hitting its estimates for the year.Yogesh Gupta, Progress Software's CEO, noted on the Q4 earnings call that the company's flagship OpenEdge segment saw better than expected performance, thanks in part to strength in the third-party reseller channel:For the full fiscal year, OpenEdge was Progress Software's only product line to see positive y/y growth. Its other two main businesses - Data Connectivity and Integration (DCI) and App Dev, however, saw declines:Figure 3. Progress Software revenues by segmentSource: Progress Software Q4 press releaseWhat I find troublesome about the quarter, in addition to the negative revenue growth, is the fact that sales and marketing costs jumped 8% y/y to $28.2 million - despite the fall in revenues. As a percentage of revenues, GAAP sales and marketing costs represented 25.3% of this quarter's revenues - 270bps worse than 22.6% in the year-ago quarter. Likewise, general and administrative costs saw an 8% y/y rise.As a result of increased operating expenses amid negative revenue growth, Progress Software's operating income dipped -16% y/y to $24.3 million, representing an operating margin of 21.8%, or a full 300bps lower than 24.8% in the year-ago quarter.It's important to underscore that Progress Software's FY19 guidance calls for both positive 1% y/y revenue growth and a one-point increase in operating margins. Yet Progress Software's most recent trend of actual results shows the company going in the other direction. That, in my view, is the biggest risk weighing on the stock. Despite an already-bleak guidance range, Progress Software may not even be able to hit these targets if the weakening trends from Q3 and Q4 spill over into FY19.There's little incentive to continue investing in Progress Software. Across the company's three product segments, none seems to be a growth engine that can redefine the company, while a rise in operating costs has whittled down its profit margins. Seeing as perfectly strong software companies are still down more than 30% from their peak values since the December pullback, Progress Software's own 33% decline seems rather modest because its fundamentals are actually weakening. Avoid this stock and invest elsewhere."

As a result, the deal was probably a 2x to 3x return for early investors – not a large outcome, but a small win in venture capital terms.As of Progress’ February 28, 2017, 10-Q, the company had $264.2 million in cash, equivalents and short-term investments, so had ample resources to complete the purchase without undue financial stress.Furthermore, Progress posted $37.3 million in cash flow from operations, so is showing growing and positive CFFO to replenish its cash reserves.Progress has acquired Kinvey to bolster its end-to-end development system for companies wanting to deploy ‘modern, cognitive-first applications.’In March 2017 Progress acquired DataRPM for its cognitive, predictive maintenance application in the industrial IoT market.I previously wrote an article on that transaction, Progress Acquires DataRPM For Cognitive Business Software.Progress paid $30 million for DataRPM’s predictive, machine learning technologies that help Industrial IoT companies develop applications more efficiently.As Progress CEO Yogesh Gupta stated in the deal announcement,Concurrent with the deal announcement, the two companies also announced the integration of Kinvey with Progress’ NativeScript and DataDirect data connectivity products.It appears that integration risk is low, as the companies have already integrated certain aspects of their operations.Denise Lund, research director of Enterprise Mobility at market research firm IDC, said of Progress acquisition strategy,Observers are therefore positive about the combination, as I am. PRGS stock is slightly down with normal volume and is currently trading is slightly lower than the average analyst price target of $31.00.Most analysts are recommending a HOLD on the stock at its current level of nearly $31, with a few recommending a BUY. Progress just reported a 2Q 2017 EPS result of $0.42, which was a beat by $0.05 per share.(Source: Yahoo Finance)I view the deal as a positive for Progress as it is positioning itself as a mobile app development system provider for ‘cognitive’ mobile applications designed for a variety of markets including the nascent but potentially large IoT (Internet of Things) markets.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

4184446,103480,2018-06-28T06:47:40-04:00,"Progress Software reported decent Q2 results that topped analyst consensus on the top and bottom lines.Flat revenue growth is still a problem. The company grew its top line by 3% y/y in the quarter, or 1% y/y in a constant currency scenario.It also failed to raise its full-year outlook from +1% y/y growth.A resurgence in operating cash flows was the one redeeming factor in the quarter, but shares still have further to fall before an entry point can be considered.","Progress Software (PRGS), a small-cap PaaS software company that focuses on deploying enterprise applications, has just released its Q2 earnings. While the headline figures beat analyst consensus on both the top and bottom lines, I'm more keen to view the company's quarter as rather mixed. By and large, Progress Software is facing much of the same problems as it did last quarter - primarily, flattening growth - while at the same time posting a strong resurgence in a key area, operating cash flows. Last quarter, the company had posted negative OCF growth; this quarter, it made up for that loss by growing operating cash flows by nearly 2x and bringing cash flows for the first half of the year (Q1 and Q2) to a respectable ~20% growth rate.Investors largely cheered the news, sending shares of Progress Software up by 4% in after-hours trading after a decline earlier in the day (though to be fair, the entire technology sector, and especially enterprise software stocks, got routed due to China trade tensions over technology investments):In my view, however, Progress Software is not yet a buy. Though the company's cash flows are becoming attractive, it's likely that the company will continue to get routed along with other technology stocks, and a better entry point will come further down the road. It's obvious to see that cash flow is the key to Progress Software's success. It is not a typical SaaS or PaaS company with high-flying, >30% growth rates - it is a somewhat less exciting product with a respectable, but slow-moving client base. In other words, Progress Software will likely never be the MuleSoft (MULE) of its generation - an exciting high-profile company that ends up getting sold for a rich valuation multiple - but it can become like VMware (VMW), who despite slowing growth has managed to outperform the broader markets due to the strength of its cash flows. And certainly, Progress Software appears reasonably valued from a cash flow perspective. Here's where the company's guidance landed for the year after reporting Q2 results:Figure 1. Progress Software FY18 guidanceSource: Progress Software investor relationsThe company is calling for $120-$125 million in operating cash flows, representing a sizable ~30% OCF margin. A quick check on valuation - at its current share price of $35.50, Progress Software carries a market cap of $1.58 billion. After netting out $144.2 million of cash on its balance sheet and adding back $119.0 million of debt, Progress Software is left with an enterprise value of $1.55 billion.Against the $122.5 million midpoint of the company's OCF guidance of $120-$125 million, this represents a valuation of 12.7x EV/FY18 OCF. This is an incredibly reasonable valuation multiple among positively cash-flowing software stocks, especially in a tech market that has seen overheating of late.However, I'd caution investors against declaring Progress Software as a true value play too soon. For one, I'm suspicious of investing in software companies that are predicting flat year-over-year growth - history and common sense both tell us that technology companies that cannot produce growth tend to fall to the wayside. In particular, PaaS is a space that requires immense scale, given that PaaS platforms rely on external connections and ease of integration with other tools to become successful. Large companies naturally tend to have an edge here, thus why Salesforce (CRM) chose to purchase MuleSoft in the first place for a huge $6.5 billion takeover price to bolster its Salesforce Platform offering. Progress Software's ~$400 million in annual revenues is comparatively tiny. Further, even despite the revenue beat to guidance this quarter, Progress Software didn't raise its full-year outlook from the same $399-$404 million revenue range it guided to last quarter, implying just +1% y/y growth. In my view, a technology company that can only produce a flat top line is on the next step toward revenue decay.There is certainly still hope for Progress Software. Its cash flows - helped also by a lower tax rate, thanks to Trump's tax reform - is a major bullish driver for the stock. Flat growth becomes a secondary issue if Progress Software can scale up its OCF to enormous amounts. My view, however, is that there will be a better entry point for Progress Software down the road, especially if volatility in technology stocks continue. Here's a look at Progress Software's results in the second quarter:Figure 1. Progress Software Q2 resultsSource: Progress Software investor relationsClearly, there are plenty to things to like about this quarter's results, particularly on the margin and profit front. The top line, however, fails to impress despite a beat to Wall Street's consensus estimates. Total revenues grew 3% y/y to $96.1 million, slightly outpacing analyst estimates of $94.9 million (+2% y/y) by a hair. It's important to note, however, that favorable currency effects helped the optics of this quarter's growth - the company disclosed that after controlling for foreign currency movements, real revenue growth would have stood at just 1% y/y. This is the same growth rate at which Progress Software is expecting to grow for the full year FY18, which simply isn't good enough for a cloud software company, especially one concentrated in scale-dependent PaaS services.It's also worth noting that Progress Software's management team is considering turning to M&A to help this flat y/y growth rate. Yogesh Gupta, the company's CEO, noted the following on the earnings call:However, with only $144.2 million in cash and with a debt load nearly equal to that, Progress Software's resource capacity for taking on a meaningfully accretive acquisition isn't high - not without offering stock to a potential target and diluting existing shareholders down.On the margin front, Progress Software performed a little better. Helped by a 16% y/y reduction in maintenance and service costs (despite growing service revenues), Progress Software achieved an 82.7% GAAP gross margin, up 140bps from 81.3% in the prior year Q2.A drop in last year's restructuring expenses also helped Progress Software achieve 7% y/y growth in operating income to $21.8 million, representing a 22.7% operating margin, 90bps better than 21.8% in 2Q17. Fueled by a much lower tax rate, Progress Software also achieved nearly 50% y/y net income growth, and pro forma EPS of $0.60 quashed analyst expectations of $0.53. Operating cash flows - one of the central tenets of Progress Software's bullish case, as previously discussed - also saw robust 88% y/y growth to $42.1 million, up from $22.4 million in the year-ago quarter. This reversed a worrying trend from last quarter where OCF fell by -15% y/y, highlighting that last quarter's underperformance was likely due to a Billings or collection timing difference. Year-to-date, Progress Software has achieved 23% y/y growth in operating cash flows in the first half of the year.It's not all doom and gloom for Progress Software, but not all is well yet either. The company's strengths on the margin expansion and operating cash flow side are fairly balanced against a low growth trajectory and limited revenue upside. Given how critical scalability and growth are to cloud SaaS and PaaS companies, I'd say Progress Software is fairly valued, even at 12.7x forward operating cash flows.In my view, Progress Software only becomes truly cheap if it falls below 10x EV/FY18 OCF, implying a threshold of $28 (20% downside from current levels). Unless the stock hits those levels (for reference, Progress Software was trading in the high $20s as recently as a year ago, so this would imply reversing 2017's gains), I'd continue to stay away from this name."
4136840,103480,2018-01-11T07:24:58-05:00,"Progress Software reported a decent Q4 in which it marginally beat on revenue and earnings.The company, despite being named a Gartner Leader in mobile PaaS, has suffered from a declining revenue trend and has stagnated for several quarters.The company's 8% jump post-earnings will be short-lived - without growth, the company has no viable future.Progress Software's very small cloud SaaS revenues haven't grown, highlighting the fact that it is still an old-school license company.Trading at ~5x next year's revenues on no growth, Progress Software looks absurdly expensive.","Progress Software (NASDAQ: PRGS), the Boston-based developer of application development software tools, was one of the first software companies to report Q4 earnings as we head back into the earnings season. Despite the company's name, I don't believe that Progress Software has made substantial progress at all in turning around its business. Potentially the only silver lining in Progress Software's results and guidance is an upbeat earnings forecast - but in truth, who cares about the EPS a stagnating software company can generate if it's not backed by growth?I have strong conviction that 2018 is the year that profits and earnings start to play a more important role in tech-sector valuations. High-flying, loss-leading tech stocks that have risen sharply in 2017 are likely due for a pullback this year if they don't start showing a healthier bottom line. But in technology, earnings must also be accompanied by robust growth - because of the high margins afforded by the software business, strong top-line growth usually translates to even stronger earnings growth.Progress Software has let investors down in this regard. The company can tout its (few) product distinctions all it wants - sure, it's a Gartner-designated Leader in mobile application development - but then again, so is Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), whose Heroku and Salesforce Platform offerings are immensely popular. Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), with its suite of AWS PaaS tools integrated neatly into AWS infrastructure offerings, is another major contender in the space - as is Red Hat (NASDAQ: RHT) and countless other large-cap software companies.How can Progress Software - a $2 billion market cap, $400 million revenue mid-cap company - with almost no presence in cloud software nor a massive developer ecosystem like Salesforce or Amazon - ever hope to compete and remain a serious player in the space for the long term? Developers like to build on top of platforms that will be agile and future-proof and laden with third-party connections - something they can usually only get from a large vendor.Progress Software's stock has risen by an absurd amount over the past year, and one must wonder why. There's little to like about this soon-to-be-forgotten name.PRGS data by YChartsAlso have a look at some qualitative indicators - like the fact that Progress Software's Google search popularity has steadily diminished over time:Figure 1. Progress Software Google Trends performanceSource: Google TrendsComparing Progress Software's Google search performance relative to Salesforce and Red Hat also makes it look like just a blip in the ocean (note that if we added Amazon to this mix, its popularity would dwarf all the rest):Figure 2. Google Trends versus Salesforce and Red HatSource: Google TrendsNow, I of course don't believe that Google search volume is a reliable proxy as to corporate performance: only true sales traction and raw financial results can speak to that. But the above comparisons illustrate a salient point: in PaaS, the market will converge into a few large players, and Progress Software is clearly not one of them.Progress Software reported $116.1 million in revenues for Q4, down 1% y/y but marginally beating analyst consensus of $114.1 million. Full-year revenues were $397.6 million, down 2% y/y.Figure 3. Progress Software Q4 resultsSource: Progress Software investor relationsGeneralist investors might think - hmm, one percent decline isn't so bad, can't Progress bounce back? With technology companies, rebounds are far and few between - flameouts are the more likely outcome. Unless we're talking about the hypercyclical memory industry, almost no company that undergoes a sustained period of revenue declines ever finds itself in another growth spurt.To make matters worse - the company's revenue mix is terrible. Software licenses actually declined 5% y/y, while it's maintenance revenues that are sponging up the blow with a tiny increase. We would prefer Progress to be generating revenue from its higher-margin licenses, not its maintenance and services.Looking at Progress Software's revenue mix by product line isn't helpful either - its flagship OpenEdge business is roughly flat y/y, while its Application Development segment (supposedly its namesake capability) declined by a staggering 11% y/y. This segment is mostly made up of Progress's acquisition of Telerik in 2014, a company it purchased for a whopping $262.5 million (almost two-thirds of a year's revenue - a massive purchase for a company its size). Now, that acquisition is in serious y/y decline and looking like a poor choice.Figure 4. Progress Software revenue mix by product lineSource: Progress Software investor relationsOne more negative point to make on Progress's top-line results - nobody ever expected Progress to fully turn into a cloud SaaS company, as it seems rather stubbornly fixed on its on-prem license roots, but SaaS revenues for the full year FY17 declined 25% y/y to a mere $3.3 million, barely 3% of its total revenues. In an IT environment where every company and developer is pushing hosted solutions in the cloud, Progress Software just doesn't seem to be keeping up with modern trends.Figure 5. Progress Software SaaS revenuesAs previously mentioned, earnings was really the only bright spot in the quarter. Pro forma EPS of $0.67 edged out over consensus estimates of $0.61, but just barely. Free cash flow was - well, respectable, but without top-line growth it's hard to see the ~2x or ~3x growth in cash flows that you can typically get with a faster-growing software company.Figure 6. Progress Software free cash flow resultsThe company's outlook for FY18 was basically ""more of the same."" As reported by SA News, the company's revenue goal of $399-$404 million represents continued flat revenues into the following year (and was more or less in-line with consensus of $400.7 million), while EPS guidance of $2.29-$2.35 was above analyst estimates of $1.91.Perhaps it's the strength of the earnings forecast that has the stock up 8% after hours, but I wouldn't get too excited about profit growth without any sign of the company turning around its product and top line results.Yes, it's true that Progress Software's ~5x forward revenue multiple makes it cheaper than most of the software industry - see below:PRGS EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsBut think about what you're paying for - 5x for no growth? No thanks. For 5x revenues, you can also buy Box (NASDAQ: BOX) and Twilio (NASDAQ: TWLO) - despite not yet having GAAP net income like Progress, these companies have strong operating cash flows and are growing at 30% and 40%, respectively. It's the latter two that will have the far better long-term potential, in my opinion, and they can be had at the same price.Progress Software's chances for upside are extremely limited. Without substantial growth, it's unlikely for fundamental performance to take the stock up - and without much of a brand name presence, it's unlikely for sudden hype to expand Progress's valuation multiple. Let the bulls have their day today as Progress soars to new highs - but in my opinion, the company's rally is built on thin air."
3962093,99946,2016-03-30T16:10:53-04:00,"Reports that Progress Software is exploring a sale first emerged in January, but have since gone quiet.Largest shareholder and activist hedge fund Praesidium is working with management behind the scenes.We believe a sale is likely on track due to a number of reasons, such as small enterprise value and the activist's desire to find an exit strategy.Investors should tune in to the earnings call this evening for clues.","What's Happening At Progress?As per Google Finance:Progress Software Corporation (NASDAQ:PRGS) is a global software company that simplifies the development, deployment and management of business applications. The company's products provide solutions for rapid application development, broad data integration and efficient data analysis.The company will report its Q1 2016 earnings after the bell today. It last reported in mid-January, and as per SA, it disclosed that it was exploring a sale with a small group of buyout firms. The surprise move comes shortly after a revenue miss but strong FY16 revenue guidance.Reuters also confirmed that the company was exploring a sale. Shares are currently trading slightly above $25, about 10% before the report emerged in January and -6% below the peak of the excitement:PRGS data by YChartsWho Is This Stealthy Activist?Praesidium Investment Management, a $1bn activist hedge fund, appears to be working with management behind the scenes. The firm owns 9.8% of the Progress' outstanding shares as of December 31, 2015, making it the largest shareholder.Praesidium focuses on technology companies. Approximately two thirds of its 13F portfolio is comprised of tech firms. Progress Software was the second largest position in the portfolio with a weight of 11%, after largest position Accenture (NYSE:ACN).The firm first took a stake in Progress in 2011 and this has been topping up since then.Sale ProgressIt has been over two months since initial news of a sale being explored, with no new information emerging since then. That said, we believe the chances of a sale are still high for the following reasons:1. Activist's Past TracksThe activist has been involved on a string of similar sales in recent years, as shown below:This includes TIBCO in Q3 2014, Informatica and Kolfax in Q2 2015. The typical timeframe from initial investment to a sale appears to be approximately < 2 years, with Kolfax being particularly short and stealthy. There were no news prior to Kolfax announcing a deal with Lexmark.Note: The red statistics in the table represents today's date, current share price (not the final sale price) and current enterprise value.2. Smaller Firm To SwallowWith an enterprise value of just $1.19bn, Progress Software is a much smaller company to swallow than past candidates, should a buyer be found. The Informatica buyout was one of the largest LBOs last year. The company's EV was 5 times the size of Progress.Perhaps a more comparable buyout is one relating to Kolfax in 2015, which fetched a staggering 50% premium.3. Failed Turnaround EffortIn 2012, Progress Software was the target of Starboard Value, another activist hedge fund. In a letter in January 2012, Starboard argued that the company was significantly undervalued. At the time shares were trading at ~$20, not far below current levels.Starboard eventually bailed out of the investment in April 2012, dropping its proxy context. Progress' management decided to pursue with a turnaround plan. Shares have since then progressed nowhere, an indication that the plan has stalled. This means alternative avenues need to be explored to generate shareholder value.For Starboard's initial letter, see here.4. Lousy Investment?It has been nearly five years since Praesidium's initial investment in Progress, making this one of their longer investments.Since taking an initial stake in Q2 2011, shares in Progress have traded sideways and delivered a negative cumulative return, while the S&P 500 has surged ahead:PRGS Total Return Price data by YChartsThe fact that Praesidium is still holding onto its stake after all these years is a vote of confidence in the company, despite its flagging share price. Or the manager may simply be confident in its ability to engineer a near-term exit strategy.According to our estimates, we believe Praesidium established its position at an average price of $21.15, with most of the shares acquired between 2011-2012. That is a mediocre +20% cumulative return over four years, well shy of the 20%-plus ""annualized"" return managers typically seek for individual investments.Summary ThoughtsBased on the factors above, we are optimistic that a sale for Progress Software is on the horizon, although the timing is uncertain. Investors should look for clues on the earnings call scheduled for 5.00PM ET."

The firm's strategy consists of performing ""an intense, fundamental, grassroots research process on each potential investment to identify the key long-term business drivers of the company and its industry.""Progress Software provides software solutions for various industries worldwide. It sells its products directly to end users, as well as indirectly to application partners, original equipment manufacturers, and system integrators.Analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes Quantum (NYSE: QTM), Red Hat (NYSE: RHT), Pegasystems (Nasdaq: PEGA) and Qualys (Nasdaq: QLYS). Analyzing Progress Software's financial metrics and ratios relative to this peer group offers insight into why Praesidium sold its ownership stake.Return on Equity (ROE) measures a company's profitability in relation to the book value of Shareholders' Equity. ROE is a measure of how effectively management makes investments to generate earnings for shareholders.The company's latest ROE of 9.8% is only above Quantum (6.8%) and below Red Hat (24.9%), Pegasystems (13.0%) and Qualys (15.3%).Source: finbox.ioAnother helpful metric is Return on Assets (ROA) which represents the dollars in earnings or Net Income a company generates per dollar of assets. ROA is typically used to gauge the efficiency of the company and its management at deploying capital to generate income for shareholders. In general, a higher return on assets suggests management is utilizing the asset base efficiently. Progress Software's ROA of 5.2% is also below the majority of its peers.In addition, the company's top-line is expected to underperform this same peer group moving forward. Projected 5-year revenue CAGR is the average annual growth rate of revenue over a five year period. It's calculated as follows:5yr CAGR = [ Revenue FY+5 / Revenue FY ] ^ (1/5 years) - 1The chart below plots the five-year revenue compounded annual growth rate for Progress Software and its peers. The company's projected 5-year revenue CAGR of 0.4% is only above QTM (-1.1%) and below RHT (13.8%), PEGA (13.8%) and QLYS (13.7%).Source: finbox.ioNote that the company's historical 5-year revenue CAGR of 4.6% is also generally below its selected peers.Finally, a number of future cash flow models imply that the stock's overvalued. The median fair value estimate of $32.16 implies -27.6% downside and is calculated from 8 separate analyses as shown in the table above. Note that each model uses consensus Wall Street estimates for the forecast when available.Even though Progress Software shares have traded lower over the last month, the stock is still way up from its 52-low and appears to be trading at a premium to its intrinsic value.

The firm led DataRPM’s major funding round of $5.1 million, so likely received a nice multiple of its original investment.However, a $30 million exit is only a ‘base hit’ for venture capital firms who seek companies who can achieve multi-hundred million dollar valuations.Due to the relatively low purchase price, Progress likely acquired the team and technology on a ‘buy vs. build’ valuation approach, and management probably figured it could more quickly execute on its larger business goals by acquiring and integrating the technology than building it from scratch.Progress acquired DataRPM to help build out its ‘Cognitive Apps’ offering, which promises to assist data application developers in speeding their development cycles for increasingly sophisticated systems.As Progress CEO Yogesh Gupta stated, “With the acquisition of DataRPM, we now have leading predictive analytics capabilities to round out our cognitive apps platform.”DataRPM’s solutions are focused on the Industrial IoT (Internet of Things) markets, where enterprises seek to gain operating efficiencies by connecting their supply chains and equipment operations activity to their information systems.The company claimed major customers such as Jaguar, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (OTCPK:MHVYF) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) among its customer base.Progress partner and cloud manufacturing software company QAD’s CTO Tony Winter praised the deal, stating, “We see the acquisition of DataRPM by Progress, and its machine learning capabilities, to align well with our vision and are excited about the opportunities this could have for our customers going forward.”So, investors should expect to wait nine to twelve months for integration and initial results from the acquisition to show up in financial results.If Progress can take advantage of DataRPM’s predictive, machine learning technologies and sell those capabilities to the industrial IoT market, the deal should be a winner.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

4209017,103480,2018-09-29T14:55:11-04:00,"Progress Software missed Wall Street's expectations in Q3 as its revenue growth dipped to negative for the first time all fiscal year.The company's guidance for Q4 also implies that negative growth will continue.Optically, it appears that Progress Software was able to grow operating income in the quarter, but that was largely due to one-time restructuring expenses incurred last year.It's unclear if Progress Software has a future, given the presence of much larger and much better-known PaaS products.","Throughout much of its fiscal third quarter, Progress Software's (PRGS) stock had been quietly riding higher, with investors hoping that the company's marginally improving cash flows would balance out its rather disappointing growth and lack of an exciting product story. However, after releasing third-quarter results, all enthusiasm for Progress Software quickly evaporated as the stock gave up all of its gains in the past quarter. Responding to a revenue miss in both this quarter's results as well as next quarter's guidance, investors sold off Progress Software's stock in its worst one-day performance all year, down nearly 20%:PRGS data by YChartsI've been skeptical on Progress Software for a long time, as I noted in a prior article. The company's name is a misnomer - it is, in fact, the opposite of progress. Progress Software is nearly a 40 year-old company now, and its technology has lagged markedly behind peers.For those who are unfamiliar with this stock, Progress Software's products are typically considered in the PaaS space, or Platform-as-a-Service. In essence, this means Progress Software provides developers (typically enterprise developers and IT professionals) with the tools necessary to build and deploy applications. Yet, technology like this has proliferated over the past several years, and has taken on many forms. Application development technologies are central to Red Hat's (RHT) latest growth strategy; and several other notable PaaS names have sprung up too, like Appian (APPN), which specializes in low-code development, or Pivotal Software (PVTL), which was recently spun out of Dell. Clearly, competition has weighed on Progress Software's results - it posted negative y/y revenue growth for the first time all fiscal year.Beware any software company that is showing negative y/y growth. The sector lives and breathes by revenue growth, and even the minimal profits that Progress Software is showing now cannot hold if the company's top line doesn't improve.This quarter's results aren't the only problem: chiefly at issue is the fact that Progress Software is flagging a revenue decline for Q4 as well. See the company's guidance below:Figure 1. Progress Software outlookSource: Progress Software investor relationsProgress Software's revenue guidance of $107-$110 million for the quarter represents a revenue decline in the range of -5% to -8%, which is a huge miss relative to Wall Street's expectations of $116.7 million (approximately flat to last year's $116.1 million). This also implies a lower FY18 revenue range than before - previously, Progress Software had guided to $399-$404 million in revenues; now, the Q4 guidance range implies $393-$396 million. Needless to say, investors tend to do a lot of extrapolation, and when both Q3 showed declining revenues and Q4 is expected to decline even more, there is tremendous fear that FY19 will be bloody as well.Don't invest in companies shouldering this much uncertainty. Progress Software's value is rapidly withering as it struggles to maintain its place in the IT landscape, and investors are encouraged to stay away.Here's a look at Progress Software's Q3 results:Figure 2. Progress Software 3Q18 resultsSource: Progress Software investor relationsRevenues declined -2% y/y to $95.7 million, missing Wall Street's expectations of $97.0 million (flat y/y) by two points. As you can see in the chart above, the problem lay mainly in the company's software licenses - its bread and butter, and the source Progress Software's previously strong gross margin. Software license revenues fell -5% y/y.Progress's management team has acknowledged its growth deficit, and it's looking at both organic and inorganic opportunities to drive growth. Here's a comment from CEO Yogesh Gupta on the company's sales initiatives on this quarter's earnings call, who also said he was ""disappointed with our decreased revenue expectations"":On the M&A front, Progress has indicated its criteria for an acquisition are ""margins of at least 35% after cost synergies"" and be accretive to recurring revenues. My worry here is that Progress Software's growth initiatives seem very costly - after all, expanded sales teams have to be hired, onboarded, and trained through a multi-month ""lame duck"" period before they become useful. And that is a big if - even great salespeople are limited by the products they sell, and if Progress Software is losing traction in the market, it will still suffer declining revenue growth even with a larger sales team.In the meantime, the company's financials are lagging badly. Optically, it appears that operating income in the quarter rose slightly to $22.2 million (a 23.2% GAAP operating margin) versus $20.3 million (20.9% margin) in the year-ago quarter, but one of the major drivers of that was a ~$1 million higher restructuring expense in the year-ago quarter.Of course, Progress Software still did better on the profit side than it did with revenues - net income grew 50% y/y, chiefly thanks to a lower tax rate (as with most companies), but pro forma EPS in the quarter of $0.60 still beat Wall Street's expectations of $0.58, despite the revenue miss.Adjusted free cash flow, which normalizes the effect of Progress Software's restructuring costs, also grew 16% y/y in the quarter to $21.3 million, and are up 9% YTD:Figure 3. Progress Software adjusted FCFSource: Progress Software investor relationsI wouldn't count on these profit gains to last very long, however, as Progress prepares to beef up its sales teams going into Q4.It's not worth waiting to see if Progress Software can stage a turnaround. A possible recovery is still many quarters in the making, and will require Progress Software to completely revamp its sales efforts and refresh its product lineup to distinguish itself against the many PaaS competitors in the market. This is a company whose best days are behind it - steer clear of this name."

The 2015 actual earnings per share were exactly in line with market expectations, while the mid-point in 2016 guidance is approximately 4.5% better than consensus 2016 numbers. The first quarter 2016 guidance was a touch weaker than expectations but I'm happy to pay more credence to the annual guidance rather than get consumed in natural quarterly variability.An investment in Progress Software today is offering investors relatively lowly 5% revenue growth in 2016, while earnings per share are expected to grow even more modestly at 3.7%. The lack of earnings leverage is explained by continued investment in research and development which accounted for 21.1% of sales in 2015 compared to 19% in 2014. This software development spend can come back in time, propelling operating profit margins back over 30%.The lackluster topline 2016 growth is explained by OpenEdge and the Data Connectivity & Integration Division's essentially flat revenue growth, with the Application Development and Deployment Division(Telerik) growing by 15%. The company maintained each of these three divisions were growing in constant currency in 2015, with a further $7 million in currency headwinds expected in 2016, based on currency today. On a constant currency basis, Progress Software is guiding 6.7% organic revenue growth for 2016, which while not setting the world on fire is credible.There is belief from management that the company can achieve double-digit earnings growth in the medium term, so the consensus 2017 earnings per share estimates at $1.68 now look light. And if Progress Software hits its 2016 guidance of $1.63, the number could easily be $1.80.Investors are getting Progress Software at 14.6 times historical non-GAAP eps and 14.1 times 2016 guidance. After adding back stock based compensation (only), investors are paying 20.6 times 2015 and 19.6 times 2016 earnings per share. The enterprise value to sales and enterprise value to recurring revenues ratios for 2016 at 2.5 times and 3.7 times are pretty solid for an enterprise software company.Investors will get rewarded when the Telerik acquisition is fully digested and margins return to over 30% which should push earnings growth back to double digits. The likely return of the buy-back should underwrite the share price in the immediate future. More of a waiting game than anything."

While the company does generate fantastic margins and substantial amounts of free cash, we need to see signs of its growth strategy working before jumping on.Progress Software, the provider of app development platforms, has had another difficult year with growth again stagnating:PRGS Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThere is a huge improvement in GAAP operational performance as acquisitions from last year, like DataRPM and Kinvey, are absorbed and this reveals a rather profitable company.Here is an overview of how its different segments performed in Q3, from the 10-Q:Most of the revenue comes from maintenance, from the 10-Q:Its OpenEdge segment is by far its largest business, but it experiences three problems:Management believes these are temporary issues. The company is also slowly moving to a SaaS cloud basis, much of it through ISV partners. This part is actually growing at 12% in Q3 and 15% year to date. It's now a $25M revenue stream for the past 12 months, still not terribly large but at least it's a part that is growing.Direct license sales were also still growing in Q3, but are expected to be down a little for the year on above mentioned problems, which look to be temporary.License sales in the other two segments (DCI and AD&D) were also down. For DCI, that's primarily due to timing of contracts; overall, DCI revenues were down over 15% to $7.6M as a result.Quarters can be lumpy but management argues the overall health of DCI is good, but we're not entirely sold on that as multi-year license backlog is also down to $12.3M (from $18.1M last year and $14.9M at the end of Q2).AD&D revenues were up 1% to $20.1M on a small license growth in DevTools and Sitefinity.The company has several main growth strategies:The main growth strategy for the company lies in the field of cognitive computing, here is Forbes:It's basically machine learning, which was exactly the missing link, according to a report from 451 Research (which you can download here):It acquired DataRPM, a Cognitive Predictive Maintenance (CPdM) platform for $30M in March last year with the company focusing on predictive maintenance for the Industrial IoT with a surprisingly solid customer list, including GE, Cisco, Jaguar and Orange.The idea is to keep the industrial IoT segment but add other predictive applications and (451 Research):They are up against formidable competition (451 Research):Progress to-date is difficult to gauge, which after more than 18 months is a little disappointing. Management explains it as follows (Q3CC):The company has scaled up its go-to market efforts and sees signs of a building pipeline, but that's about all that they had to say about this, which isn't a great deal. Next quarter with the 2019 guidance they'll provide some more info.Last year, the company acquired the aforementioned DataRPM but also Kinvey for $49M to strengthen its mobile application development platform (to be more precise, the backend of it).With its margins and cash generating capabilities, it makes sense to acquire more companies, which is what management intends to do, given the right opportunities (Q3CC):Apart from these financial criteria, the company does perhaps better to acquire missing capabilities (which indeed it did with the DataRPM and Kinvey acquisitions) to strengthen its market position and growth opportunities, because these are lacking at the moment.The market for application development platforms is fairly crowded, with names like Amazon (AMZN), Red Hat (RHT), Salesforce (CRM), Pegasystems (PEGA), Quantum (QTM-OLD), and Qualys (QLYS).There is a relatively new segment which is the low-code application platforms from the likes of AgilePoint, Bizagi, Appian, Caspio Inc., Mendix, OutSystems, MatsSoft, Salesforce.com, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Alphabet/Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)For a non-specialist in the field it's not easy to assess the company's competitive position. Management argues it has two advantages for problems that Gartner identified:Unlike many other solutions which use proprietary languages and therefore face a lack of developers. Progress, however, noted (Q3CC):Gartner has indeed called Progress a 'visionary' in its magic quadrant for Mobile App Development Platforms. One can find peer reviews at Gartner, one of which argued that it is hard to get people with Progress skills, which seems to negate at least part of its above claimed JavaScript advantage (but this review is so full of spelling errors that we're not sure how serious it is).One might also note that OpenEdge is mostly a (proprietary) ABL or Advanced Business Language.We're sure the company has some advantages, but this can only be part of the picture at best. There are a few metrics that are at least indicative that its competitive position isn't that terrific.Stagnant revenue growth doesn't indicate success and the relatively small cloud sales ($25M in the past 12 months). Its health vertical, the Progress Health Cloud, looks to be a positive as it was called a leader in the Forrester Wave: Enterprise Health Clouds, Q3 2017. On the other hand:The stagnant revenues contrast with much of the competition, so that is a pretty worrying sign and investors should not lose sight of it. Cloud sales are still small while management argues it delivers a 30% performance improvement.There are two ways of looking at this. The positive way is that the company has a large runway growing its cloud business, but a much less optimistic view is that it shows the company is at a competitive disadvantage.For Q4:FY 2018:PRGS Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThese are GAAP margins, their non-GAAP counterparts are substantially higher. Non-GAAP operational margin was a whopping 37% for instance and was even up 100 basis points despite the (minute) revenue decline.PRGS Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe company does generate impressive amounts of cash flow, boosted in Q3 by a substantially lower tax rate. The company has $138M in cash and short-term investments, but that keeps on decreasing from $207M at the end of Q2 2017 and $133M at the end of the previous quarter.PRGS Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsShare based compensation isn't excessive and the large free cash flow enables the company to buy back a substantial amount of shares. The company even raised its dividend to $0.155 (from $0.14) per share, although the yield (0.62%) is rather modest.The company repurchased another 513K shares in Q3 (for $20M) and has $110M remaining on its existing buyback program, $10M of which will be spent in Q4 with the rest for 2019.The company also has $111.7M in long-term debt.PRGS PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsThese are GAAP and backward looking figures. Analysts expect a similar EPS next year ($2.50) as this year, from CNBC:We're not convinced Progress is a good investment. On the plus side, the company generates large margins and a large amount of cash which it can put to use acquiring companies which can bolster its competitive position and revive growth and buy back shares to boost EPS growth.Given the decrease in cash, the company cannot keep up the shareholder friendly policies on this magnitude for long, or it won't have as much immediate firepower for acquisitions.On the negative side, given the stagnant revenues, we think its overall competitive position isn't very compelling. Existing users seem to stick around, but new ones seem to largely choose other solutions.There isn't much visible progress on its cognitive computing strategy yet, and this strategy was formulated almost two years ago with the acquisition of DataRPM following soon after."
3796576,68095,2016-01-07T13:28:01-05:00,Exposure to the growth of cloud and mobile.Highly cash generative.Growth returning.Refocused and streamlined company.Core domain software expertise.,"Progress Software Corporation (NASDAQ:PRGS) is a global software company that provides enterprise software programming tools which simplify the development, deployment and management of business applications on-premise, in the cloud or on any platform or device. The business comprises more mature products like OpenEdge and DataDirect/DataCloud, but also the nicely growing mobile application platform and software tool business Telerik.Equity markets were disappointed with Progress Software cutting its revenue guidance for 2015. However, with 44% of revenues generated outside the United States, the strengthening US dollar will logically impact revenues.I take comfort from the recent Investor Day with management guiding revenues now organically growing 4% on a constant-currency basis. The fact the engine room for PRGS has returned to growth is positive news, especially if we see this trend continuing in future quarters. The fact the company is hosting Investor Days suggests to me that PRGS now has a story to tell.The market has struggled with Progress Software's slow top-line revenue growth and also the merits of the recent acquisitions. The market has difficulty apportioning value during periods of sharp currency movements. This strong US dollar is muting any organic revenue growth, but in time this will come out of the wash. The company with its overseas cost bases has been able to insulate profits to a degree from these revenue shortfalls.The merits of the $262.5 million acquisition of Bulgarian mobile application tools company Telerik and the associated accounting for deferred revenue of this acquisition have added complexity to the Progress Software story. However, the strategy of acquiring global software expertise around mobile application programming tools appears eminently sensible for a company with domain expertise in software programming tools for on-premise and cloud applications.I can see the strategic rationale of the Telerik acquisition, but, as an outsider, I can't judge the quality of the business acquired. It also appears Progress Software paid a big price (4.4 times historical revenues) for this business, so the jury is still out on the Telerik acquisition.Divisional Background And DiscussionIn 2011-2013, there was a fair bit of rationalization at Progress Software as the company narrowed its focus through divestment and closing down non-core parts of the business. The company today has three operating divisions with its core software programming business OpenEdge generating the majority of free cash flow.The highest margin and cash-cow component of Progress Software is OpenEdge, which accounts for ~$300 million in revenues and generates more than 90% of group operating profits. OpenEdge is a fourth-generation software programming language which has its own embedded relational database. The division includes the Corticon rules engine product where revenues have been languishing in recent years, however, management remains committed to its future. The OpenEdge software enables data access to other computer systems without the software programmer having to fully comprehend all the differing software architecture and data access methodology. The OpenEdge business is the engine room for Progress Software and encouragingly is now growing 4% organically.The Data Connectivity and Integration business division includes the DataDirect and DataCloud products, where Progress Software claims undisputed leadership in the premium data access market. The company guided this business has strong thematic drivers including 1) rise of big data, 2) rise of integrated data silos sitting in SaaS and on-premise applications, 3) rise in analytics demand, and 4) need for speed. The ~$31.5 million Data Connectivity and Integration business generates high margins, but has struggled with growth in recent years. It's encouraging however to see the business is now growing by 3% organically in the 2015 year.The Application Development and Deployment division predominantly accounted for by the Telerik acquisition appears on course to generate circa $83 million revenues in the 2015 financial year. The Telerik business was acquired with an annual revenue run-rate of circa $60 million with management appearing confident the business is still growing at around 20% per annum. There is some complexity in the accounts which may be confusing investors with accounting conventions, requiring the recognition of deferred revenues acquired at the time of the Telerik acquisition to be recorded separately from GAAP revenues.Outlook And Investment RationaleProgress Software guided $410-415 million revenue in the 12 months to 30 November 2015, with non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.51 to $1.55. This represented a 4.2% cut from the $425 million to $435 million revenue guided at the start of the 2015 year while earnings guidance is unchanged. Currency has certainly played a major role highlighted by it being a $25.5 million drag on revenues for the 2015 year vs. 2014. The company also acknowledged a soft Brazilian country market and sales of its rules engine Corticon not meeting internal budget expectations.The attractive investment qualities for Progress Software today include the very reasonable 2.8 times enterprise value to sales ratio and 4.2 times enterprise value to recurring revenue ratio. The non-GAAP price-to-earnings ratio for 2015 at 15.7 times is cheap especially as we are seeing revenue growth returning, albeit modestly. After adding back one-offs and non-cash items but including employee stock compensation, Progress Software trades on a price-to-earnings ratio of 22.8 times for 2015 earnings, which isn't cheap by any means. I would make the point that investors are getting a business where 67% of revenues are recurring and renewal rates exceed 90%, so we are at the quality end of the spectrum for software business models.Coming into the annual result announcement (expected 12 January 2016), I'm quite encouraged with the return to organic growth in the core OpenEdge division. The strategy around diversifying the technology into cloud, analytic and mobile makes sense to me. I believe the acquisition strategy is coherent albeit the Telerik acquisition will not contribute in a meaningful way toward profits for another 12-24 months.The valuation looks robust without being compelling, but maybe this is as cheap as a quality business model like this gets, especially with the continuation of the share buyback around the corner. I don't have a strong view whether Progress Software is an acquisition target.I would much rather pay 2.8 times 2015 revenues and 15.7 times non-GAAP earnings per share for a company like Progress Software than over five times revenue for an unprofitable SaaS company promising the earth. I think this investment can give investors a lower risk exposure to the growth of cloud and mobile. The company now has a story to tell investors, and I have dipped my toe into this one."
3959952,56112,2016-03-22T12:18:06-04:00,"Progress Software's application development tools offer investors a neat way to play the growth of software without having to make a bet on specific verticals or technologies.While the stock looks cheap on FCF and non-GAAP numbers, significant stock-based compensation makes it look less cheap in reality.A potential buyout could provide near-term upside, but I think expectations should be tempered.While Progress has interesting assets, I'm in no hurry to buy at this time or price.","Everyone knows that software is eating the world. If you want exposure to this trend but don't want to pick winners and losers, Progress Software (NASDAQ:PRGS) has an interesting set of application development tools that are embedded within the processes of companies ranging from giants like Fiserv (NASDAQ:FISV) to smaller up-and-comers. The legacy business doesn't look to be a rapid grower, but it's still a cash cow, and higher-growth segments of the business (such as data connectivity and mobile) should be enough to drive at least mid-single-digit growth on a consolidated basis.The problem I see with Progress Software is similar to that at many other software companies: while shares look reasonably inexpensive on non-GAAP numbers, and cheap on free cash flow, a big slug of stock-based compensation lowers the true economic value accreting to shareholders, making it look less attractively priced relative to economic reality. A rumored buyout may provide near-term upside and somewhat of a floor under the stock, but a deal seems neither highly probably nor likely to occur at a huge premium.Progress Made Progress In 2015On a constant-currency basis, the business achieved organic growth in all of its segments. The cash-cow OpenEdge segment grew 1% in Q4 and 3% for the full year (organically), with acquisitions boosting that number. OpenEdge is not going to be a high growth business, but 2015 does validate the idea that it's now on the right footing versus where it was several years ago.Things weren't all great, though. Turning to the Telerik mobile app development business acquired in 2014, bookings grew at ~16% for the full year of 2015, losing some momentum in the back half of the year. This is a somewhat disappointing result in the context of a few factors. First, it marks a deceleration from the company's historical 20%+ growth rate. Second, it didn't come cheap. Third, there are obvious tailwinds for mobile app development, so 16% growth here isn't really all that impressive of a number. Fourth and finally, there are seemingly meaningful revenue synergies between Telerik and OpenEdge, and management's commentary at Investor Day made it clear they've been cross-selling it - suggesting that the performance of the business on its own might have been even weaker absent those efforts. Management does expect to return to 20%+ bookings growth in 2016.In light of everything, I do think Telerik has a shot at continuing to grow at or around 20% over the medium term, but this won't be an easy road to hoe. It's ironic, but one nice visual is the Gartner quadrant the company highlights in its own slide deck (see page 42). Telerik isn't even in the top right quadrant, and the names it's up against are a veritable who's-who of big tech companies with functionally infinite budgets. That's not to say that it can't continue to take its fair share, but rather, that it will require continued execution. While it's not a gigantic portion of the business, and the high price paid for it (>4x trailing revenue) is a sunk cost, the growth rate here is still important because it materially influences the overall growth rate at PRGS (and thus the valuation).Cheap or Not? A Valuation GAAPWith a pristine balance sheet and a relatively credible opportunity for mid-single-digit growth, at the current price around $24.50, Progress shares look reasonably inexpensive at first glance at merely ~15x the midpoint of forward non-GAAP earnings ($1.59 to $1.65 per share). As with many software companies, though, reality is somewhere between GAAP and non-GAAP. While the amortization and purchase accounting charges should be excluded and it's probably fine to back out restructuring as well, stock-based compensation is quite significant - $24 million, or nearly 6% of (non-GAAP) revenue. This obviates its seeming cheapness on free cash flow - forward FCF is expected to be $100 million or so against a current market cap of $1.3 billion, but when you factor in dilution, you get back to a number that's around the non-GAAP earnings multiple.I am aware that tech companies routinely trade on the basis of non-GAAP earnings, but I'm not willing to play along. Given that the company has been an active buyer of stock, it's intellectually screwy to treat stock-based comp as if it doesn't exist. With that, accepting all other GAAP-to-non-GAAP adjustments, the number I use for operating income is about 20% lower than the company's non-GAAP number. At $24-$25, that puts PRGS shares at 11.5-12x my estimate of ""real"" trailing EBIT, or 18-19x my estimate of ""real"" forward EPS.That's not terribly expensive (especially considering the balance sheet), but neither is it obviously cheap considering that the company likely cannot deliver much more than mid-single-digit organic growth over the long term. They could certainly buy more growth (as they did with Telerik), but that's not going to come cheap.The upside scenario is one where the company manages to hit ""high-single digit"" growth year in and year out, and simultaneously manages to improve margins towards the mid-30s. I view the latter of these goals as likely more achievable than the former, but don't have a strong enough view on how they're going to get there to call it a highly probable scenario (or the base case).On the other hand, the downside scenario is one where the company does not manage to maintain its revenue growth rate in Telerik (which, as discussed, dipped a bit in the back half of the year), and consolidated revenue growth comes down to below 5%. That would make the valuation look fairly rich; in technology, popular perception (valid to a degree) is that if you're not growing you're dying, and technology businesses without much growth often struggle to gain the multiples that their cash flow would seem to justify. At that point, not only would a double digit to ""real"" EBIT look fairly aggressive absolutely, but it could certainly trade even lower.Potential Sale Provides Interesting Optionality, But Temper ExpectationsNews that the company might be pursuing a sale process sent shares skyward in January, and while they've pulled back some since then, the potential for a buyout is likely still providing somewhat of a floor under the stock. Several investors seem to believe the company will be sold in relatively short order, based upon the ownership base and management having previous sales under their belt, as well as the company's rather odd rationale for pulling off the gas pedal on its buyback program. While this could provide quick upside if it goes through, I think there are several reasons that investors should be cautious on both timing and magnitude of upside (as well as probability that a deal actually occurs).Let's split this up by the two potential buyer types. Strategics are typically the ones who are willing to pay silly multiples - but that's almost certainly not going to happen here. Why? Of the strategics with enough scale and potential fit/synergy to make Progress doable - Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), for example - the challenge I see is that they already have plenty of what Progress is selling. Among major software vendors, there is certainly no shortage of steady cash flow from mature (but lucrative) on-premise products. Rather, they have more cash flow than they know what to do with, and are using the cash flow to buy their way into the cloud and bolt on interesting emerging technology platforms.Conversely, there would likely be meaningful synergies to a strategic on the SG&A line. Comparing Progress to a list of relevant software companies on revenue per employee and SG&A per employee, it seems like there's room for productivity improvement with scale.Turning to the financial buyer side, on the bright side, PRGS has a clean balance sheet and could support a decent level of leverage. On the not so bright side, market volatility and the state of high yield markets obviously makes LBOs more difficult to get done - although not impossible, as Apollo (NASDAQ:APOL) demonstrated by closing two sizeable ones right after they said they thought it would be tough.There's also the question of whether the bid-ask spread is too wide - i.e., whether the price that Progress management (and major shareholders) wants is too high for potential buyers. I would note that Progress has had activist involvement for quite some time now (dating back to late 2011), and the opportune time to sell the company would seemingly have been right after they divested a lot of non-core product lines and before they returned to being a net buyer of assets. Telerik, for example, was decently sizable relative to the enterprise value of Progress, and while the acquisition makes strategic sense for Progress if it continues as a standalone business, I'm not sure it would make quite as much sense to a financial buyer looking to run it for cash flow. As I've discussed numerous times in my coverage of the contact center software space, for example, the rapid traction gained by cloud-based newcomers is thanks in no small part to the fact that big PE-owned incumbents like Avaya and Genesys are saddled with debt and more focused on wringing cash flow out of the business rather than investing in next-generation solutions.None of this is to say a sale couldn't happen. (Watch - now that I've talked down the possibility, tomorrow there will be an announcement, and I'll look silly.) All told, though, I'm not sure Progress is an attractive enough asset - nor screamingly cheap enough - to justify a huge premium in a transaction. As far as a specific price, I could see PRGS getting bought out at around $30 - which, at around the level of last year's peak, would be high enough to obviate lawsuits and conceivably gain support from most shareholders. It would represent a reasonable multiple to non-GAAP numbers, and likely still provides either a strategic or financial buyer with decent returns after accounting for synergies (or cost cuts and leverage). Higher than that is really hard for me to justify, though, and the percentage upside from the current price of $24.50 (25% at best?) doesn't seem high enough to be exciting.Wrapping It UpBased on the valuation and the fundamentals of its various divisions, Progress Software doesn't seem to have any particular investment merit for prospective shareholders at this price. As a standalone public company, it's probably worth close to what it's trading to, if not a little bit less. It would be worth more in a deal, but I'm not sure a deal is particularly likely, and the upside even if it were isn't breathtaking. All of that isn't to say it's a bad company - I reiterate what I said in the intro; it's a neat way to play the growth of software without having to make a specific bet - but it's one that I'm in no hurry to buy at this price and time.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

2529935,25341,2014-09-30T03:01:17-04:00,Progress Software posted mixed results for the last quarter.The company's current and upcoming products look promising.There is still potential in this company.,"Late last week, Progress Software (NASDAQ:PRGS) announced its financial results for the third fiscal quarter ending on August 31st. In the last quarter, the company generated $79.3 million in revenues, $19.4 million in operating profits, and $11.1 million in net income. While revenues were up slightly from last year's $77.6 million, operating profits were up sharply from last year's $9.7 million and net income was down sharply from last year's $24.8 million. Holding currency exchange rates constant, the company would have reported flat revenues, which indicates that the 2% revenue growth mostly consisted of currency effects.Excluding non-continued operations and restructuring costs, the company's operating profit margin was 37% which is a solid improvement from last year's 28%. Also, net income from continuing operations came at $20.0, up from last year's $14.7 million. On per share basis, net income from continuing operations was up from 27 cents to 39 cents.The company ended the quarter with $261.3 million in liquid assets including cash equivalents and short-term investments. This was a result of operating cash flow of $25.9 million for the quarter, which was a huge improvement from last year's slightly negative cash flow from operations in the same quarter. This strong cash position was maintained despite the fact that the company spent $52.6 million to repurchase shares as a part of a $100 million repurchase program.In the beginning of this month, Progress Software decided to separate its three product lines into distinct business segments. These three business segments will be named after the product lines: OpenEdge, Application Developments and Deployment and Data Connectivity and Integration. This separation will allow the company to focus on each product line better and dedicate specialized resources for these product lines. For example, each product line will get a separate sales force that will focus and build expertise around that particular product line. This will also give the company more agility in the rapidly-changing market dynamics and ever-evolving customer demands.For the current fiscal year, Progress Software is expecting to generate $333 million in revenues, $1.48 per share in non-GAAP earnings, 34% in non-GAAP operating profits from continuing operations, and $80 million in free cash flow. The company is authorized to spend another $47 million as a part of its repurchase program and shares will probably continue to be repurchased by the company in the next couple quarters.Progress Software's OpenEdge product saw strong demand in the last quarter and this product is expected to drive growth for the company for the foreseeable future. Both license revenue and total revenue were up for this popular product. Currently OpenEdge is being utilized in 175 countries by 47,000 businesses for building and integrating high-performance multi-platform systems. This product increases developer productivity by accelerating production and as a result, operating costs for the clients that use this product get reduced.DataDirect Cloud is another product of Progress Software that sees strong demand from many clients. This product collects business-related data from multiple platforms and combines them under one location. This allows companies to have access to their data that may come from computers, tablets or even mobile phones in order to make healthy business decisions based on data. Progress Software is currently taking orders for this product in order to build its pipeline, and the company was able to cross-sell this product to its clients that are using its other products.A few months ago, Progress acquired Modulus, which is a platform for application developers that use Node.js as a developing tool. Since Node.js is one of the fastest growing development tools in the market due to its ability to deal with data-intensive projects, Modulus had a lot of potential. During the last quarter, Progress worked on integrating this platform with the rest of the company and it will be taking advantage of a great growth opportunity in the coming quarters. Modulus makes it easier and faster for developers to deploy and maintain their applications and there is a large and growing market for this product. By removing or reducing issues and complexities of application development and deployment, Modulus platform will make it more fun for developers to focus on what they enjoy doing the most: putting their ideas into work and developing applications.Progress Software's platform solutions allow developers to build one application and run it on multiple platforms such as computer and different mobile operating systems. This saves developers a lot of time because traditionally many of them are forced to develop multiple versions of the same application for different platforms, which can be very time-consuming and costly. This is one of the factors that will allow Progress Software to see solid growth in the coming years through products like Modulus.Another exciting Progress product that is likely to drive growth for the company is Easyl. This product is used in data-analyses to make complex jobs much simpler. By doing so, it reduces the amount of skill that is needed to conduct some complex analyses, and the client companies should be able to utilize this tool without having the need to spend large amounts of money on specialized experts in many cases. The data can be visualized and summarized in a custom dashboard, which makes it easier to read and saves time for the users in both ends.As mentioned above, the company will now have 3 business units that are loosely connected. Each business unit will have its own focused workforce with specific goals and achievement targets. This will allow each business unit to have a better focus on serving its customers and have accountability to meet their goals.Currently, the company's market value is $1.22 billion. Excluding its cash position, the company is trading for 11-12 times its future cash flow and 13-14 times its forward earnings. Since Progressive is in a good position to take advantage of data-driven multi-platform developer market, the company might be in an attractive position in terms of future valuation."

The purpose of this note is not only to highlight the company's impressive performance, but also detail my views on recent developments.There were two recent developments that I believe are notable - Analytics360 and Sitefinity. Analytics360 is the product of a partnership between PRGS and Logi Analytics. I believe this new add-on would enable PRGS to benefit from the growing demand for analytics solutions. With the addition of the digital experience cloud, Sitefinity CMS is likely to see rapid adoption, considering the woes that retailers (both online and offline) face. Regardless, I remain neutral on PRGS for valuation-related reasons.Strong Q2 performance amidst currency woesAs I alluded to earlier, the company had a strong second quarter. Top-line performance grew to $89m (+10% Y/Y). On a currency-neutral basis, revenues actually increased 19% y/y. Steady top-line growth in the face of currency headwinds indicates that the firm's existing and prospective clients are rather price-insensitive, thus paving the way for the possibility of further pricing increases in the future.As for the bottom line, diluted GAAP EPS fell to $0.11 (-56% Y/Y) from $0.25. However, the large drop in earnings can be attributed to currency headwinds, which had a negative impact of about ~$0.13-0.14/share. In terms of analyst estimates, the company beat expectations, posting diluted non-GAAP EPS of $0.35 versus estimates of $0.31, surprising 13% to the upside.Analytics360 allows PRGS to benefit from the growing demand for analytics solutionsThese days, data analytics solutions are all the hype (apart from cloud and mobile). This has resulted in double-digit growth rates within the data analytics market in recent years. Additionally, the industry still has room to grow. According to research, the big data analytics market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 25.52% to $46b over the 2013-2018 period. Clearly, the potential in this market is significant.Recently, PRGS formed a partnership with Logi Analytics. This led to the development of Analytics360, an analytics solution which is optimized for the firm's flagship OpenEdge software development tool. The analytics add-on allows developers to gather insights on their operational data, enabling them to make better and more well-informed decisions.Without a doubt, Analytics360 is the firm's attempt at entering the data analytics market. Tangible benefits to the firm are rather obvious - the add-on should allow the company to generate incremental revenues going forward as they upsell the add-on to its client base.However, I believe that there are intangible benefits as well. Analytics360 is interconnected with PRGS's OpenEdge platform. Developers looking for an analytics solution need not source the solution from a third-party provider - analytics is already integrated with OpenEdge and available for purchase as an add-on. As a result, the firm's client base becomes increasingly sticky.Sticky client relationships are not only good for client retention, but they also enable the company to command a certain degree of pricing power while still retaining its customer base. Thus, profit margins are likely to experience expansion.Sitefinity CMS is likely to see rapid adoptionIt is no secret that retail is gradually shifting online. Due to the proliferation of smartphones and other mobile devices, many consumers are increasingly preferring to begin their shopping online. Due to the convenience of eCommerce, switching costs in the retail space have been literally non-existent - a consumer can bounce from website to website without much effort.Enter Sitefinity's digital experience cloud (""DEC"").The DEC enables multi-channel retailers to draw key data from individual customer interactions across their various channels. This data can then be used to optimize the digital experience for every customer. Not only would this benefit lead conversion, it would also allow multi-channel retailers to develop a small degree of customer switching costs due to the tailored nature of the digital experience that the DEC provides. This is a huge value-add to these retailers, and therefore I posit that Sitefinity CMS is likely to see rapid adoption.I remain neutral on PRGSPRGS is clearly making very good moves that I believe will be very successful going forward. Analytics360 allows the firm to take part in the fast-growing data analytics market while Sitefinity CMS is likely to see rapid adoption with the addition of the DEC. Although the company continues to face currency headwinds, these headwinds should be short term in nature.Regardless, I remain neutral on PRGS as the company's performance was in line in my expectations. I reiterate my earlier investment thesis in the stock, and continue to recommend that investors wait for a pullback before accumulating PRGS stock."
3244036,63483,2015-06-08T15:25:00-04:00,"Software development platform provider.Modest competitive advantages.Cash cow continues to fund AppDev, the company's fastest-growing operating segment with plenty of room left to grow.Progress Software is fairly valued. Await a pullback before going long.","The businessProgress Software (NASDAQ:PRGS) is a software development platform provider. At the risk of oversimplification, the company provides software platforms to developers, allowing said developers to develop new software. Basically, before software can be developed, developers require an ""environment"" of sorts to work in. PRGS provides that environment and charges license fees (perpetual/term mix) along with periodic maintenance fees for their software development tools.Modest competitive advantagesThe company benefits from modest competitive advantages. New entrants looking to enter the space would need to spend tens of millions developing a platform that is equivalent to incumbents that would take a few years to bring to market. Even ignoring the upfront costs (time/money) required, such a strategy is risky, considering that the new entrant would need to convince users to switch to their platform. Even if the newcomer is able to persuade users to switch to his competing product, inertia would result in the start-up operating at a loss for many years before significant scale can be realized.However, switching costs are not as high as one might think. Software development is inherently complicated, and hence developers tend to utilize software development platforms that are easy to use in order to simplify the process of software development as much as possible. As time goes on, I opine that these tools will eventually converge in terms of ease-of-use, resulting in said platforms edging toward near-commoditization. Switching costs will remain modest as developers need only get used to the new ""simpler-to-use"" platform. Further, I expect the cost to be a constraining factor as when all software development platforms eventually become very intuitive price increases would be hard to justify due to price-sensitive consumers, acting as an upper bound to profitability. Thereon, only volume increases would augment performance.In a nutshell, we have a business that:Regardless of my prediction that software development tools would eventually be commoditized, this is unlikely to manifest in the near-term. Backing up the narrative above, PRGS generates 65% of its top-line from maintenance streams. I posit that actual recurring revenue is likely higher than this figure given that the company sells perpetual and term licenses of its platforms, but does not give a breakdown between the two. Nevertheless, one can conclude that the business should be able to continue generating stable recurring cash flows over time.Cash cow continues to fund AppDev, plenty room available for growthPRGS's cash cow is its OpenEdge segment, which is used to fund other growth initiatives in markets with huge potential. One such initiative is AppDev, the company's business unit which focuses on meeting the demands of developers who are seeking productivity increases and cloud-based platforms. AppDev solves these needs by providing PaaS solutions. This segment is still in its infancy and is experiencing monstrous growth. Revenue grew 161% y/y (FY14) to $1m, which is to be expected as the segment is starting from a very small base. These massive growth rates are likely to continue as developers worldwide turn to platforms that meet their mobile and productivity demands. Furthermore, secular growth trends support this assertion. In the company's Q1 FY15 earnings call, management cited IDC forecasts which projected the mobile enterprise application development platform market to reach almost $4b by 2018, representing a 25% CAGR over the period. PRGS appears poised to be a large beneficiary on this trend, as any reinvestment required to sustain high levels of growth and achieve scale can be supplied by the company's cash cow.PRGS is fairly valued, await a pullback before going longAs seen above, I have laid my assumptions regarding PRGS's future performance. Revenue growth is expected to grow at low single-digits throughout the projection period, which is in-line with historical performance. Although the company does not break out perpetual/term/subscription license distributions, I suspect the main reason for the company's flat performance is due to customers switching to the term/subscription alternative - not willing to pay a relatively higher price upfront for the perpetual license. AppDev is likely to continue experiencing triple-digit growth, but this will not move the needle much in the short-term. EBITDA margins are expected to remain at 31.5% as the company is unlikely to be able to raise prices significantly due to modest switching costs. Margin pressures are unlikely for the same reason. My model implies a non-existent margin of safety for PRGS with a target price of $26. Hence, investors should await a pullback before going long."
2824256,58341,2015-01-16T14:20:58-05:00,"PRGS reported strong Q4 results, but the Q1 and FY15 guidance is what sent the stock lower.Earnings are likely to be less YoY and revenues are at best projected to be flat this year.The company has a large cash position in case they want to acquire more companies or buy back stock.Trading at 17x earnings there is still risk to the downside for PRGS shares.","The $1B software company that focuses on cloud computing for business applications, Progress Software (NASDAQ:PRGS), reported better than expected Q4 results on January 13th, but gave a lackluster outlook for 2015. Fourth quarter EPS came in at $0.47 per share vs. the Wall Street consensus estimate of $0.45 per share (earned $0.41 in Q4 FY13) on revenue of $97.9M vs the $96.3M estimate (8% year over year increase). Operating margins ticked up 200 basis points to 39% and operating income rose 13.4% to $38M on a non-GAAP basis.Cash and short-term investments totaled $283.3M compared to $231.4M from the year-ago quarter, which was largely due to cash flow of $39.2M from operations. This has allowed Progress Software to acquire several smaller companies. In Q4, BravePoint, a Georgia-based consulting and training company, was purchased for $12M in cash from Chesapeake Utilities (NYSE:CPK). More recently a deal for Telerik AD was completed for $262.5M as part of $150M term loan (1/2 of a $300M revolving credit facility) and cash on hand. Telerik AD is a Bulgarian enterprise mobile platform design company with a developer community of 1.4M people (20% annual revenue growth). Modulus, a Cincinnati-based manager of digital applications and websites and app data analyzer with roughly 500 customers, was purchased in June 2014 for an undisclosed amount. The buying spree all started in mid-2013 with the acquisition of Rollbase, a start up in Silicon Valley, which helped them launch their platform-as-a-service offering (PaaS).The big drag on the stock post-earnings was the miss on guidance for Q1 and FY15. For the first quarter they expect to earn $0.22-$0.24 per share vs. the $0.31 per share Wall Street estimate and for the year ending in November 2015 they see EPS of $1.37-$1.47 (earned $1.51 in FY14) vs the $1.51 estimate. Other guidance they laid out was revenue in the $425M to $435M range, positive free cash flow of $90M-$93M, 27% operating margins, and a tax rate of 33%-34%.A strong U.S. dollar is a factor in the light guidance for the current year since more than half of all revenue is outside North America. If the strong dollar continues throughout 2015 then the company might come in at the low point of the range or even below it.ValuationPRGS shares trade at a P/E ratio of 17.15x (mid-point of FY15 guidance) with -6% EPS growth, price to sales ratio of 4.07x, and a price to book ratio of 2.52x. Revenue is at best projected to grow 1% this year, but it might actually shrink slightly if they only met the low end of their guidance. Progress Software does not pay a dividend as many smaller tech companies don't. However, back in January 2014 they announced a $100M share repurchase program.Prior to the earnings/guidance announcement, PRGS shares had a low short interest that had actually been shrinking. At just over 570K shares sold short, or 1.30% of the float, investors can't count on the bears covering to have any meaningful impact in the near-term.As of September 30th, 160 13F filers held a position in Progress Software. Four money managers had the stock as one of their top ten holdings too. Praesidium Investment Management had PRGS shares in their top three at a near 11% weighting for the firm, representing 9.89% of the total float (largest single shareholder).Technical AnalysisLooking at the two-year weekly chart above we can see that PRGS shares have given back almost the entire rally that began in September. The stock is now retesting the uptrend line from March of 2014 and the 40-week simple moving average (200-day simple moving average). Unfortunately, the most ominous sign is the bearish crossover in the MACD, which has been a good secondary indicator when looking at the previous two crossovers. If PRGS is able to snap the three-week losing streak soon there still remains an uphill climb once/if it makes it back to the $26.50 resistance level (has struggled at $26.50-$27.50 for more than a year). Ultimately it could return to the low $20s, like in 2013 and 2014, before putting in a bottom.Similar to what the charts are saying, the fundamental picture shows that Progress Software is one investment you want to avoid right now. The stock trades at 17x earnings with no foreseeable top and bottom growth coming. PRGS doesn't have any financial concerns (solid balance sheet with steady free cash flow), but a sluggish business environment (growth and currency rates) coupled with a fair value (or slight overvaluation) in the stock don't provide much evidence for investors to allocate capital here at this price.The company has made some strategic deals to bolster their cloud offering, making it a one-stop shop for web content management, digital marketing, customer analytics, and other products for developers across the world. If they continue to make accretive acquisitions and better market their products to various enterprises (the company named Melissa Puls as CMO in October) this could bring back the mid to high single digit revenue growth that Progress Software was accustomed to seeing."
322353,23005,2012-01-26T13:23:01-05:00,,"For a number of years, Progress Software (NASDAQ:PRGS) has been something of a work in progress. Historically, the company had acquired fairly independent software businesses, albeit with discipline, and operated them as autonomous entities, allowing the cash flows to aggregate up to the corporate parent. This conglomerate structure originally had an appeal to investors on a lower scale, though the lack of synergy ultimately forced management to rationalize the business into its present operating structure, one that is still focused on three separate offerings.Stocks being fairly innumerable, it is easy for an analyst to lose track of a company in transition as we are focused (hopefully before others) on those stocks that are poised for a dramatic change. It was thus with interest I listened in on the fourth-quarter earnings conference call a few weeks ago for an update on the company's prospects. And a work in progress it still is. Jay Baht had joined as CEO just 30 days previously from Autodesk. But he had clearly hit the ground running, offering fresh insights on operating and cultural issues within each of the businesses. He also announced key management changes. That said, revenue was down, operating expenses up and key segment initiatives just underway. Clearly it was way too early to recommend this stock, despite its low valuation. So I moved on.Now, Starboard Value LP has taken a 5.1% position and delivered a public letter to Mr. Baht decrying the company's conglomerate structure and the deeply depressed stock valuation it has produced. Written by the firm's Jeffrey Smith, the letter offers a lucid analysis of the operating segments, credibly stating that the Application Development Platform business alone (its largest and most profitable) is likely worth more than the company's traded value. With this stated observation, the stock is up 15%. In fact, since falling to $17.69 in the wake of the earnings call, the stock has appreciated 33%.Starboard's investment has generated a nice paper gain, just with the splash of its announcement. Still to be understood, however, is the path from the company's present strategic orientation. Mr. Baht announced a renewed focus on strategy and corporate development intended to augment current businesses through adroit M&A. He seems ready with numerous operating initiatives as well. With an activist investor in the mix, one seemingly inclined to break the business up, the outlook is clouded, however. Even a down-and-dirty breakup valuation suggests a stock price of about $25 a share, just a bit above where it now trades. Yet the arduous work of achieving this valuation, through either a turnaround of the existing businesses or some combination of acquisition and divestiture, lies ahead. For now, I will be watching with interest. The road may well be bumpy; better entry points could be ahead.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Investors should not believe the ""we've turned the corner"" hype from the enterprise software spin machines.Software was immune to overall economic issues in the 1991 downturn. Software basically caused the 2000-2001 downturn (the dot.com fiasco). Now entperprise software is just plain too tightly tied to the overall economy to move in any other direction than the rest of the world. And with debt crisises emerging in the former European Union and elsewhere, no job growth in the US except for the government hiring people to count other people, the about-to-explode cost of crude, and a long litany of other problems, the rest of the world is about to dance the double dip. And so goes software.Progress' issues are not entirely macro. The company is really made up of multiple unrelated acquisitions of distressed and/or second-tier software companies, one self-created spinout/spin-in (Sonic), and its heritage 4GL-plus products. This amalgamation has led to both operational and product-development irrationalities that needed to be sorted out at some point. The company had taken the tack throughout its acquisition spree that it could prosper with multiple brands supported by separate marketing and development and no clear Progress image.Unfortunately it succeeded in this mini-General-Motors-circa-1960 strategy. There was never any way it could succeed in this approach in a market where the leaders -- IBM (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) in alphabetical order -- control over 50% of the spend. There may be an investor play here however. Three of the top four might be interested in acquiring a slimmed down Progress.Disclosure: No positions"

1091391,24051,2013-01-02T14:16:57-05:00,,"Expected earnings report and the whisper number impact for Thursday, Jan. 3:Progress Software Corp. (NASDAQ:PRGS): The whisper number is $0.35, one cent ahead of the analysts estimate. PRGS has a 61% positive surprise history (having topped the whisper number in 11 of the 18 earnings reports for which we have data).The average price movement (starting at next market open) within 10 trading days of all earnings reports is +0.2%. The strongest price movement of +4.0% comes within 20 trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -9.0% within 30 trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number.Last quarter, the company reported earnings six cents ahead of the whisper number. Following that report the stock realized an 8.9% gain in five trading days, before turning and seeing a 9.5% loss in 20 trading days. Enter your expectations and view more earnings information here.Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report will help you make better trades. Many investors believe that beating or missing the whisper number has the greatest impact on stock movement. If the number is exceeded, the stock is rewarded and prices move higher. If the number is missed, the stock is punished and prices move lower. Unlike the analysts estimate, the ""whisper number"" from WhisperNumber.com has actually been proven to have a greater impact on stock movement.Since 1998, WhisperNumber.com has been tracking and publishing ""crowd sourced estimates"" for earnings. We call these earnings expectations whisper numbers. The ""crowd"" that provides us with whisper numbers are primarily individual investors and traders just like you that have registered with our site.We are an independent financial research firm. We have no affiliations with investment banks, investment management, or corporate organizations that could compromise our data or analysis. (So no relationships with the bad guys or so-called professional analysts.)As for our data collection, methodology, and price reaction accuracy: For the past 15 years we have remained consistent with data collection and methodology, and our data has proven itself over that time. We also have two independent academic studies supporting the premise that investor expectations for quarterly earnings (our whisper numbers) provide greater returns when used as an investment vehicle, and have a greater impact on stock movement than analysts consensus estimates.A company's ""price reaction"" to the whisper number expectation is the key -- on average companies that exceed the whisper are ""rewarded,"" while companies that miss are ""punished"" following an earnings report. According to the Wall Street Journal, ""positive surprises are becoming so common they are nearly universal. They are predetermined in a cynical tango-clinch between companies and the analysts who cover them. All the numbers are gamed at this point."" This is why the proprietary whisper number we provide is a more useful and viable alternative to analysts' estimates.All trading involves risk, and the information presented is not intended to be a recommendation of any kind.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

83126,21168,2008-06-29T09:58:18-04:00,,"Earlier last week, as I reported on Wednesday, Progress bought IONA Technologies for a little over $100 million, which broadened Progress' position in the SOA marketplace.Last August, I had a podcast discussion with Colleen Smith, managing director of Software as a Service for Progress, in which we discussed the company's acquisition strategies, among other things.I took my first briefing with Mindreef, given their neighborly proximity, about three years ago. The seasoned team had a hit on their hands with SOAPscope, and their timing in the SOA market was great. But I'm not sure the company grew as was hoped, and perhaps the fast evolution of SOA beyond a WS-* emphasis played a role. SOAP hasn't blossomed to quite the degree some people had forecast.In any event, I expect this was a happy transition."
132541,21168,2009-04-23T04:23:52-04:00,,"Progress Software (NASDAQ:PRGS) this week announced the release of an enhanced Parallel Correlator for its Apama Complex Event Processing (CEP) platform so it can take advantage of multi-core, multi-processor hardware.Progress claims a seven-fold increase in CEP performance on an eight-core server in the company’s internal benchmark testing of this version of the Parallel Correlator in what the company described as “real-world customer scenarios.” John Bates, who founded Apama in 1999 to build out technology based on his research at Cambridge University in the UK, believes CEP is an easier technology sell to business users than service oriented architecture (SOA) because a clear case can be made for the ability of a product like Apama to execute high-speed transactions based on the identification of millisecond movements in the business environment. It can also provide business managers and executives with split-second snapshots of how they are doing in their markets.I guess we can think of CEP as SOA for high octane business intelligence (BI) for transactional and real-time insights and inferences from tremendously complex and often massive streams of services (and more). Mostly traditional BI comes from read-only agglomerations of fairly static SQL data, some of which needs a lot of handholding before it gives up its analytics gems.Incidentally, I also spoke this week with Cory Isacsson at CodeFutures, busy at the MySQL show, who has a lot to say these days about database sharding and how applying it to OSS databases like MySQL gets, among other things, more BI love from transactional read/write SQL data. More here.Back to CEP ... This is being newly perceived by some as much more tangible to business users than the more nerdy benefits of SOA, such as reuse of services for more agile programming of new applications. Talk about the benefits of CEP and business users eye light up. Talk about the benefits of SOA and even business process management (BPM) and their eyes can glaze over.I should point out that my buddy at ActiveEndpoints Alex Neihaus would argue that CEP and SOA are the real somnolence inducers, and that BPM and visual orchestration form the far better point on the business value arrow around service swarms. Talk among yourselves ... In making the latest Apama announcement, Progress touts an IDC report on CEP (excerpts) that included evaluation of the 2008 version of the Apama platform. IDC gave the Progress product high ratings in the categories of “Low Latency,” the speed of event processing, “Business User Control,” how it works for the business people, and “Deterministic Behavior,” the predictability and repeatability of the event processing programs.Although it is not mentioned in the Progress announcement, Apama did not get such high scores in the two other IDC categories, “Data Management,” and “Complex Event Detection.”IDC does non-metaphysical squares, rather than Magic Quadrants, we should gather.In the real world, the major market for CEP appears to be the beleaguered financial services industry and the government watchdog agencies that are overseeing them. This appears reflected in the Apama customers listed in this week’s announcement, including JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and FSA (Financial Services Authority) of the UK.Written in the midst of this recession, the IDC report worries: ""Because Apama is so closely identified with the financial markets, the current downturn is likely to negatively impact Apama's opportunity and growth prospects in the near term. Therefore, it is incumbent that Progress figure out how to cost effectively apply the technology to new markets with better short-term growth prospects.""At the beginning of last fall’s financial system meltdown, Bates told a reporter that there may be a silver lining for CEP even in the midst of a banking crisis. He foresees potential for greater use of CEP by both government regulators as well as the financial institutions that need to supply more and more detailed data to show how they are complying with new regulations now being formulated, as well as old regulations now being more rigorously enforced.Too bad they can't apply it to card counting or my wife's algorithmic-rich shuffling of copius coupons for generating a simple groceries list. Just start with the old one, I keep telling her.Other industries that both Progress and IDC agree might provide new markets for CEP include transportation and inventory control systems based on RFID, and ERP systems for manufacturing. I continue to be intrigued too by mobile commerce (Google Voice, anyone?), laced with locations services and other varibles like weather.CEP is going to advance the competitive capabilities for a lot of companies. What's less clear is how they will manage that along with their BI, SOA, cloud, and other must-do-somedays on the IT groceries list.Disclosure: Progress is a sponsor of BriefingsDirect podcasts."

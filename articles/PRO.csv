Today it identified Pros Holdings (PRO) as an attractive buy.It appeared as attractive as many of the changing 20 others we daily provide for subscribers in our “Market-Makers’ Intelligence Lists”.","Readers familiar with our work may want to skip to the Comparing Details heading below.Not because “Technical Analysts” see patterns of past price changes in the stock which may currently fit some part of their folklore and could stir up temporary trading interest. That sector of attention among the investment establishment has, in over 50 years of my observation, consistently failed to provide reliable profitable evidence of the value of studying centuries of stock prices by looking at them in the rear-view mirror.If studying the past can provide some reliable means of dealing with future events, then Artificial Intelligence gets morphed into genuine intelligence thru learning. Our understanding of global and local weather appears to be in this process.No doubt there are business challenges which present similar opportunities, and PRO has built a business around them. Here is how Yahoo Finance describes the company's activities:PROS Holdings, Inc. offers artificial intelligence ((AI)) solutions that power commerce in the digital economy worldwide. The company's solutions enable buying experiences for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer companies. It delivers its cloud-based solutions through the Internet as a Service on a subscription basis. The company offers solutions for selling improvement, including PROS Smart CPQ that automates the quoting process by enabling sales teams, partners, and end customers on e-commerce platforms; and PROS Opportunity Detection solutions, which enhances sales productivity, accelerates quota attainment, and delivers data-driven product recommendations. It also provides PROS pricing solutions comprising PROS Control, a platform for price measurement, coordination, and strategy; and PROS Guidance, a prescriptive price guidance solution. In addition, the company provides PROS airline revenue optimization solutions consisting of PROS Airline Revenue Management, PROS Airline Real-Time Dynamic Pricing, and PROS Airline Group Sales for enterprises in the travel industry, including the airline, hotel, and cruise. Further, it offers Airline e-commerce suite of products, such as PROS Airline Shopping and PROS Airline Merchandising that provide airlines with shopping and merchandising capabilities. Additionally, the company offers professional services consisting of implementation and configuration, consulting, and training; and maintenance and support services. It sells its software solutions to customers in various industries, including automotive and industrial, B2B services, cargo, chemicals and energy, consumer goods, insurance, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech, and travel. The company markets and sells its software solutions primarily through its direct global sales force, as well as indirectly through go-to-market partners, resellers, and systems integrators. PROS Holdings, Inc. was founded in 1985 and is headquartered in Houston, Texas.Please note that what PRO sells is not forecasts, but tools with which to make forecasts.Most of the investing community takes the same approach when it comes to stock price forecasts. Yes, Yahoo Finance provides one-year-ahead target stock price estimates, with no clue as to how they are derived, or any indication of how often they may get adjusted, or what date the “1-year est.” involves. Yahoo’s current number is $78.56, compared to a past 52-week range of $28 to $75, and a current market quote of ~$59.We do not make stock price forecasts. We report what other, better-informed market professionals (market-maker firms [MMs] ) appear to be expecting for specific stock prices in the coming next few months.And then we look to see what has happened to actual market prices after these pros (not PRO) have had similar prior expectations in the past 5 years. Then we compare both the extent and reliability of the price changes experienced with those of available alternative investments, collected the same way.When we do that, here is what appears, in Figure 1.Figure 1The vertical lines in this picture are not actual past market prices like those seen in “technical analysis charts”. Instead they are forecasts of likely future ranges of market stock prices implied as probable in coming weeks and near months. The heavy dot in each vertical is the market close price on the day of the forecast. It splits the forecast range into upside and downside price change prospects.The imbalances between up and down potentials are what are useful in estimating both coming price direction and extent of change. Their proportions are measured by the Range Index [RI]. Its value is the percentage of the whole forecast range which lies below the current market quote. A 20 RI has 4 times as much upside prospect as down. A 33 RI has only 2 times as much upside potential as downside.Segregating past MM implied forecasts by their RIs produces clues to how market prices have reacted to the conditions seen by the MM community at various points in time. We use a 5-year sliding window to count how many prior forecasts (the sample size) have been like the current Range Index.The essence of valuation is in comparison, which requires that the compared measures be as close to identical as possible. To that end we place all of our valuations in a carefully defined set of measures, and describe them in as parallel a set of comparisons as is possible.To do so often presents what many readers recognize as text and ideas they have encountered before, as they have in our just-published comparison between Microsoft and Boeing. The use of the heading for this section of the article as an accelerant to reading provides for experienced readers an economy of time and effort, while leaving for the newly-initiated the opportunity for an important introduction.Figure 3What is important to us in this analysis is how big a price gain is in prospect, column [E], and how likely is today’s RI forecast to produce a profit [H] as a proportion of the [L] sample of such forecasts. That combination result appears in the [ I ] %payoff which includes loser forecasts as well as the 96% winner. The size of [ I ] relative to [E] is a measure of [E]’s credibility in [N].Time required [J] to accomplish the payoff is another important dimension for any investment mission. The retirement, tuition, or health emergency clock won’t patiently wait for “long-term-trend” investments to be “sure” (like EK, GM, GE, others) of their “passive investment” buy&hold strategy results. Compound Annual Gain Rates [CAGR] are the essential measures [K]. Figure 3’s rows are ranked by the historical results (of today’s RI) statistic.One additional complication of being time-efficient in an investment strategy is that the score-keeping can’t be easily sliced up into uniform time periods. That is not what happens to holdings in an active investment strategy. Gains (and losses) occur in irregular lumps of time, and we need to evaluate likely prospects in the way they may be accumulated.What is done in proper financial analysis of any capital commitment is to anticipate the RATE of gain or cost in units of change per time of involvement. The most commonly used measure is basis points per day, where a basis point is 1/100th of a percent.That’s a tiny unit, but is what works best. Put together and maintained each day for a year, 19 of them would double your investment. They can be powerful.In Figure 3 we use the Odds of gain [H] as a weight for the average prior payoffs [ I ], and take the complement of [H] ( 100 – H ) as a weight for the risk prospect [F]. Put together as [O] + [P] in [Q] we have an odds-weighted net outcome of each row’s prior MM RI forecast sample [L]. Then by converting those [Q] nets into bp/day in [R] we have a guide to making investment selection decisions across a broader array of alternatives.Using [R] as an integrated measure of wealth-building desirability places PRO in first place by a wide margin among other “people also watch” stocks. Its 35 bp/day score is well above the discouraging -1.8 that the SPDR S&P500 Index ETF (SPY) now produces.The current negative SPY comparison starts with its history of small Realized Payoffs [ I ] at +1.2% because of only 64% of its 316 prior forecasts at RI 40 produce gains, and over one third of them resulting in price losses. Better than 19 of each 20 PRO prior forecasts at its RI level of 4 earned profits, averaging +18.5%.Other “market” comparisons are available, but one not often seen is provided by our aggregate of MM forecasts now earning an average of +2.8% net profit realizations. At their current average RI of 28, 4 out of every 10 were losers, worse than SPY.The daily ranking of “best-odds” stocks we produce for subscribers from this total forecast population of over 2,600 issues currently generates +12.5% net gains. That group has won 7 out of every 8 of its prior forecasts, where their RIs averaged 27. Their rapid rate of price change (average holding period) [ J ] of 38 market days – less than 8 weeks – accelerates their CAGR average to +132%, nearly equal to the stellar level of PRO at +137%.PROS Holdings Inc. (PRO) currently presents several evidences of likely super-competitive portfolio wealth-building attributes and should be considered a good buy here.Disclaimer:We firmly believe investors need to maintain skin in their game by actively initiating commitment choices of capital and time investments in their personal portfolios. So, our information presents for D-I-Y investor guidance what the arguably best-informed professional investors are thinking.

(PRO) stock offers a substantially larger and more likely achievable price gain in the next 3 months, with less interim price drawdown exposure, than most of over 2,700 other stocks whose price prospects are now forecast by well-informed investment professionals.This is an analysis of how the prices of specific securities are likely to change in the next 3-4 months, based on the way major investment organizations (""institutional investors"" or ""big-$"" funds) have perceived those prospects and made multimillion-dollar trade changes of holdings in their multibillion-dollar portfolios. That rationale is explained further in my SA blog’s article “Why Read This Report?”Source: Yahoo FinanceFigure 1Source: AuthorThis map locates equity securities at the intersection of prospective price gains (green horizontal scale) and potential price drawdowns (red vertical scale) based on market-maker hedging behavior to protect their necessary endangerment of firm capital as they enable volume trades. These subjects are stocks of software vendors. Desirable map locations are down and to the right.The ""frontier"" of best advantage runs from SPY at [10] to VMW at [21]. Of most interest to us here is PRO, at location [4]. Its recent six months daily price range forecasts are pictured as vertical lines in Figure 2.Figure 2Source: AuthorFigure 1 shows how PRO’s range of stock price expectations has varied daily over the past 6 months. The heavy dot in each day’s range is of the closing price on the forecast day. It separates the range into upside and downside prospects.The row of data below the daily trend picture tells what prices are currently being seen as possible. And from a restricted sample of prior forecasts from the past five years, what could be gained or lost from being “long” in the security while following a simple but rigorous portfolio management discipline. A discipline described in the “TERMD explained” link.How effective the MMs have been in forecasting for these stocks is a matter of market records, when conditions of uncertainty similar to today's are examined. That was done in the row of data between the graphics of Figure 2. For ease of comparison, they are repeated and slightly expanded in Figure 3 for the more interesting stocks of Figure 1.Figure 3Source: AuthorPRO has had 71 prior-outlook days (out of 1261) where nearly half of the full forecast price range lay below its then-current market quote. Now, this segment from $66.03 to $59.86 is 47% of the full range from $59.86 to $72.96. We use this measure, which we call the Range Index [RI] as a comparative standard for expectation balances (between up and down prospects) for all stocks.Using that RI of 47, the 71 priors for PRO produced net gain %Payoffs under TERMD of +9.7%. Not all of the 71 were profitable, but 94% of them (67) either reached or exceeded the price target of the forecast time (now $72.96) by or before the next 3 months after the forecast. Or the subject’s price was above its entry cost at the end of that holding patience period.Pro’s high Win Odds, coming from the middle of its forecast ranges, mark it as being a momentum stock, frequently reaching its sell target near the top of its market cycles.A comparison of the prior accomplished +9.7 payoffs with the present forecast of +10.5% suggests a degree of credibility for the current outlook: 0.92 as indicated at column [N] of Figure 3. Any such Credibility Ratio of 0.75 to 1.25 encourages acceptance of the current forecast.So much for the “good side” of a buy proposition; what about the “bad side”?As we condition the credibility of the upside price change forecast by comparison with actual experience, so too do we look to see how bad the downside might get. But with concern only during those “long” holding periods when committed capital would be at risk under the TERMD discipline. All other periods are irrelevant, shocking as they may be.Figure 1’s data row tells what the worst case price drawdowns have been (an average of them) during all of each actual exposure period when they were to be held. What matters is how bad a fear of loss may get induced, not whether or not it existed at the end of the holding. Investors will have varied reactions to the exposures, so there is no way to evaluate potential risk impact by historic outcomes. But by having knowledge of the maximum degree of intensity possibly present some useful guidance may be provided.One logically-simplified way to address the combination of stock price risk and reward is to weight each part by its probability and combine the two. The “Win Odds” of profitable position odds here for PRO of 67 out of 71, or 94 out of 100 offer such a probability. One minus those odds, or 100 – 94 provides the loss probability weight. Thus .94 times +9.7% plus 0.06 times -4.3% produces a weighted net payoff of +8.9%.To make this style of evaluation more comparable between varied investment opportunity situations, an integration of the likely holding periods used in the calculation is helpful. For PRO the average number of market days required by all 71 positions of the sample was only 29 out of the maximum 63 possible, because of the high proportion of upside target prices reached.A standard evaluation measure used in many capital planning decision situations is the expected net payoff stated in “basis points” of 1/100ths 1%, per day of capital involvement. On a 365-day calendar year +19 bp/day when sustained for a year doubles the original capital, or a CAGR of +100%. When a smaller-count of 252 market days makes up a relevant year, the fewer days are each proportionally more powerful, so only 14 bp/mkt day does the 100% equivalent.Comparison is the essence of evaluation. If the investing objective is to make capital as productive of future spend-able amounts as possible, using an odds-weighted bp/d yardstick can be helpful.To that end Figure 3 includes the relevant MM forecasts and their prior outcomes for nine other Software Applications stocks. For a broader perspective, a market-index proxy of the SPDR S&P 500 Index ETF (SPY) is provided, along with the average of over 2,700 current-day MM price-range forecast issues, and a ranked set of the likely 20 best of those near-term wealth-building stocks under TERMD portfolio discipline.All of these comparisons in Figure 3 have the same basic data as included in the row of Figure 1 for PRO. That is expanded by the columns [O] thru [R] to provide for odds-weighted bp/day price-prospect evaluation comparisons.Please note that PRO has a history of superior Win Odds [H] at its current MM forecast RI [G] of 47. While its upside sell targets [E] are less than some others its forecast credibility [N] is higher than most others because its achieved payoffs [ I ] are above most others.That combination puts its net Odds-Weighted return [Q] higher than all others. Its Days Held of 29 widens that advantage in most cases.Competition from the market-index alternative SPY at this point in time is rather limited because of an unenthusiastic upside target outlook of only +5.0% at a CAGR of only +9%. That is better though, than the overall population of 2,754 MM forecasts of a modest net decline (-2.6%).As usual, all is not gloom among that large population, where the best-looking 20 stocks appear nearly as good [Q], [R], on average as PRO, and in a few cases, even better. The currently-popular speculation of TSLA has block-trade-induced hedging support for near-term prices ranging from $439 on the downside, up to a possible high of $615. Its odds-weighted outlook from this point of +4.2% is better than most market averages, but less than at least 20 other members of our forecast population.

3330465,40031,2015-07-17T09:51:26-04:00,"PROS is going through a transition from a license-first to a cloud-first company and the negative short-term effects have taken a toll on its share price.
        A look under the surface reveals that the long-term growth story is intact.
        Recurring revenues are in a ramp up stage and it will take time for the top line growth to catch up.
        Clear value proposition and tangible results to drive strong customer growth as well as upsell and cross-sell opportunities.
        Initiating PROS with a buy rating.","PROS (NYSE:PRO) is going through a painful transition, at least after looking at the company's share price performance and growth expectations for 2015. Revenue growth is expected to be negative in 2015 after years of strong growth and margins are taking a hit as well as the company transitions from a license-first to a cloud-first company. However, the underlying momentum is still strong, as evidenced with strong bookings in Q1 and while it may take up to two years for the growth to gain traction due to the shift from a license model to a subscription model, the company should get back to growing its top line north of 20% in 2018 and beyond. The current valuation is attractive and I believe that the gains in the next three to five years could exceed 100%, while the downside should be limited given the substantial contraction in the company's P/S multiple. I am initiating PROS with a buy rating and a $27.50 price target.Understanding the PROS business model and value propositionPROS is a big data software provider which helps companies outperform their markets by analyzing, executing and optimizing sales, pricing, quoting, rebates and revenue management. The company started out with providing solutions to airline companies and has expanded to more than 40 industries since 2005. The company's differentiated platform aims to improve the sales organization of the customer, increase the efficiency and drive higher consistency in the sales process. The results are very tangible and can be seen in the customers' top and bottom line. PROS' management shared on the latest investor webcast that their solutions drive a 1% to 3% revenue improvement and better than 15% margin improvement. The 95% maintenance renewal rate also provides additional evidence of the value of its platform and moving to a cloud-first business model should also positively affect the long-term revenue and earnings growth rates. The cloud enables faster time to value, it is easier to expand and allows immediate access to innovation as opposed to on-premise solutions. The company also provides attrition data and analyzes what is in common with customers that are leaving, which is also a valuable tool, as it makes it easier to catch the negative business trends and make the sales process much better for its clients. Given the focus on the cloud and the development of more tools, I expect increased upsell and cross-sell opportunities in the following quarters, which should enable the company to bridge the license revenue gap faster than it is currently anticipated.HP (NYSE:HPQ) is a good example of the value of the PROS platform. PROS' management shared the following in the latest investor presentation (paraphrased): HP deployed a PROS solution for their ET business globally a year ago. It was focused on driving faster turnaround time on quotes and also on better quotes in order to drive a higher win rate as well as a higher margin. The resulting effect was an increased win rate and an increase in deal size with a 200 basis point margin improvement. This translated into $100 million in tangible improvements based on PROS' platform. It has helped increase the probability of winning, sped up the quoting process and led to a solid competitive advantage for HP. The technology is also self-learning, which means that, when HP does more deals, the new data is used together with the historical data to adapt to any competitive changes in the market. PROS has also managed to penetrate into industries that have a lot of complexity, like the chemical and high-tech industries and has managed to remove a lot of the manual processes and has added a dynamic process where clients have a real-time calculation which includes currency fluctuations and real-time market prices. This enables a real-time view of the customer's business and enables them better insight into their processes, revenues and margins.This year's performance driven by lower than expected execution on license side of businessPROS plunged from $27 to as low as $16 in April after the company preannounced Q1 earnings. The company lowered the Q1 revenue guidance from a range of $47 million to $49 million to $44.3 million to $44.8 million and eventually delivered at the top of the new range. The non-GAAP operating and net losses were also higher than previously expected on the revenue shortfall. However, the reason behind the revenue short-fall is encouraging and a long-term positive for the company - a higher than expected mix of subscription bookings had a negative impact on recognized revenue, but this revenue will be recognized in future periods as opposed to an upfront license fee. This is essentially the real start of the company's transition from a license-first to a cloud-first business. The new business model assumes collecting recurring long-term revenues as opposed to collecting large upfront license fees, and it is expected to have a negative effect on top line growth in 2015 and 2016. The company and analysts expect single-digit revenue declines in 2015 and 2016 and double digit top line growth should resume in 2017. I think that the market failed to acknowledge that the bad news is good news in this case, since recurring revenues have a higher long-term value for the company and its shareholders. PROS' management revealed in their latest presentation that the company should achieve revenue neutrality in 3.2 years (see the graph below) and that the cloud has a 7-year discounted present value of $3.2 million (from an annual revenue perspective) compared to $2.5 million with the license-first model. The company should reach an inflection point in 2018, and expects to grow revenues north of 20% starting in 2018.Source: PROS investor presentationA look under the surface reveals strong business momentumThe nature of the transition will make the top and bottom line figures distorted in the next couple of quarters and revenue and profitability declines are a certainty. The fact that the company is moving from a license revenue model to a recurring revenue model means that revenues will be spread out over a longer period of time, and since the company collects less and less revenues from licenses, short-term revenue growth will be negatively affected by this transition. However, the long-term implications are positive from both the top and bottom line perspective, and we should expect higher revenue and earnings per customer in three to four years. PROS introduced the bookings metric in Q1 and shared the booking trends in the last five quarters. Q1 bookings increased 24% Y/Y (exceeding the company's annual goal of 18%) and revealed that the underlying momentum of the business is still strong. The move to the cloud should increase the platform adoption and expand the addressable market in the following years.The graph below shows the real fundamental trends under the surface. Subscription revenues are expected to grow between 40% and 50% in 2015, while maintenance revenue will grow in the 10% to 15% range. The 2016 forecast paints an even better picture, and this is the time when the company starts collecting serious recurring revenues on the road to revenue neutrality in late 2017.Source: PROS investor presentationValuation and price targetPROS' management also shared their 2020 goals in the latest presentation: a $500 million revenue run rate and a $100 million free cash flow run rate with approximately 80% of revenues coming from recurring sources. This is an optimistic estimate (but achievable) when looking at the current numbers and translates to significant top line growth after the two-year transition period. This provides a strong basis for the bull case on PROS.Given the lack of profitability, the EPS and EBITDA metrics are not particularly useful for valuing PROS and I will focus on the P/S ratio instead. The company is currently trading at 3.4x its TTM sales, while its forward 2015 P/S ratio is 3.5 due to the expected decline in revenue this year. Looking at the long-term P/S ratio chart below, we can see that this is a very low multiple although it seems justified given the expected lack of revenue growth in 2015 and most likely in 2016. History also shows what happens when growth accelerates (PROS' revenue was up 22% in 2008, down 9% in 2009 and once again up 8% and 30% respectively in 2010 and 2011) and we may see the history repeating itself in the 2016-2017 period. Given the substantial growth in recurring revenues and expectations for long-term revenue growth above 20% and the guided free cash flow margins in the 18% to 22% range, I think that it is reasonable to expect PROS to trade in a P/S ratio range of 4 and 5. This range fits well into the past trends and once we see renewed top line growth, I expect the P/S ratio to expand back to the expected range of 4 to 5. This should happen in 2H 2016 with a more pronounced uptick in growth rates in 2017, but this does not mean that we will wait that long to see share price gains. The company's revenue guidance should speed up that process and the increased guidance in the following months should have a positive effect on future expectations and the share price. My price target on PROS is $27.50, and is based on the middle of the expected P/S ratio range for 2015. Longer term, the company's market cap could reach $2.5 billion, based on the 2020 revenue target and the high end of my valuation range expectations, which translates into almost 300% upside compared to the current market cap of $635 million (the actual gain should be somewhat lower due to the increased share count on share-based compensation and the conversion of notes). The more conservative market cap target is $1.5 billion and translates into more than 100% upside in the next five years.Source: Sentieo.comRisk factorsPROS competes in a fragmented and highly competitive market. Although it does not have a strong competitor on a strategic level (which I believe is one of its major strengths), the company's individual products have strong competitors: Vendavo and Zilliant compete with PROS' pricing solutions while Apptus, Oracle (through its acquisition of BigMachines) and SteelBrick compete with the company's sales effectiveness solutions. Some of these companies (Oracle is the most notable) have more resources, greater recognition and a stronger user base, which might threaten PROS' position. The additional risk is that the potential and existing clients develop their own internal solutions and therefore, do not have the need for PROS' solutions. Given the rapid growth, more competitors are likely to enter the market and the existing competitors may pressure PROS' pricing down in the future.U.S. dollar strength could also hurt the company's performance in the following quarters. International revenue contribution to total revenue was around 56% in 2014 and was partially responsible for the lower FY 2015 revenue guidance (the company estimates the negative impact around $3.3 million for the year).I expect the downside to be limited to a TTM P/S ratio around 3 (the stock bottomed around a P/S ratio of 3 in May and it was lower only in the depths of the 2008/2009 bear market) which translates into 15% to 20% downside from the current price.ConclusionI believe that PROS is a misunderstood growth story. The operating results will take a hit in 2015 and 2016 due to the shift from a license business model to a subscription model, but the new model has a better long-term value from a revenue and earnings perspective. The upside to my base case price target of $27.50 is approximately 30% while the 3 to 5-year upside is north of 100%. My price target is slightly above the analyst mean of $26, but below the highest target of $35, which I believe is achievable in the next 12 to 18 months. A Q2 revenue beat and an increase of the full-year revenue guidance might catalyze the stock higher in the following weeks, and a beat is possible given the strong bookings growth in Q1 and given the stabilization of the U.S. dollar in Q2, which should positively affect the Q2 numbers."

Source: CrunchbaseAccording to a market research report by Zion Market Research, the global online travel booking market was valued at $765 billion in 2017 and is projected to reach $1.96 trillion by 2026.This represents a forecasted CAGR of 12.1% between 2018 and 2026.The main drivers for this expected growth are the ongoing major transformation of the industry due to growing internet proliferation and rapid technological advancements, such as mobile devices that are constantly getting upgraded with new features, as well as the rising disposable income of emerging countries' populations.The Asia-Pacific region is projected to witness one of the highest CAGRs due to the rising disposable income of the population in China and India.Major vendors that provide online travel booking solutions include:Source: SentieoPRO disclosed the acquisition price and terms as ‘approximately $12 million’ and didn’t file a form 8-K or provide a change in financial guidance as a result of the deal.A review of the firm’s most recent published financial results indicate that as of June 30, 2019, PRO had $329.6 million in cash and equivalents and $412.4 million in total liabilities, of which $198.4 million was convertible debt.Free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2019, was a negative ($14.8 million).In the past 12 months, PRO’s stock price has risen 87.3% vs. the U.S. Software industry’s rise of 13.8% and the broader overall U.S. market’s fall of 1.1%, as the chart below indicates:Source: Seeking AlphaEarnings surprises have been positive in seven of the last twelve quarters, as the chart shows below:Source: Seeking AlphaAfter a drop in 2018, analyst sentiment in recent earnings calls has improved and stabilized above parity, as the linguistic analysis shows here:Source: SentieoPROS acquired Travelaer primarily to expand its go-to-market offerings for airline customers.As PROS CEO Andres Reiner stated in the deal announcement,PRO has been seeking to expand its airline business segment, as the global travel booking business shows little sign of slowing down.In its most recent earnings call, PRO highlighted an expanded partnership with British Airways that now uses PRO’s search capabilities and pricing and shopping software to provide a more seamless experience across its various distribution channels.So the deal for Travelaer, while not a large acquisition, provides visibility into management’s focus on increasing its offerings to help companies sell more via their digital platforms.The deal makes sense and appears to be a low cost way to speed up development of its selling optimization offerings to the travel industry."

With losses piling up, a weak competitive position, and expectations of tremendous profitability already embedded in the stock price, PROS Holdings (NYSE:PRO) is in the Danger Zone this week.Losses Are Only Getting WorsePROS' after-tax profit (NOPAT) has declined from $10 million in 2008 to -$47 million in 2015, and even further to -$55 million over the last twelve months. The company's NOPAT margin has fallen from 13% in 2008 to -35% TTM, per Figure 1. Such drastic deterioration in PROS' profitability comes despite revenue growing 12% compounded annually from 2008-2015.Figure 1: PRO's Accelerating LossesSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsPROS Holdings' return on invested capital (ROIC) has fallen from a once impressive 47% in 2010 to a bottom-quintile -68% TTM. Compounding the above issues, PROS Holdings has burned through $104 million in free cash flow over the past five years.Compensation Plan Misaligns Executive InterestsAnnual cash bonuses are paid out based upon the achievement of numerous non-GAAP goals, including bookings, annual recurring revenue, annual contract value, free cash flow and other discretionary goals. By using multiple non-GAAP metrics, management has significant leeway in determining ""business success,"" while ignoring the underlying economics of the business. Equity awards are earned based on the company's total shareholder return in relation to the Russell 2000. In both cases, executives are incentivized by metrics that do little to create shareholder value, and it should come as no surprise that economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, have declined from $10 million in 2008 to -$62 million TTM. Until executive interests are aligned with those of shareholders, expect further shareholder value destruction. The best way to create shareholder value, and align executives with the best interest of shareholders, is to tie performance bonuses to ROIC, as there is a clear correlation between ROIC and shareholder value.Non-GAAP Metrics Understate LossesDiscretion over which items are removed to calculate non-GAAP metrics gives executives the ability to understate losses and mislead investors into believing a company is profitable. See the dangers of non-GAAP metrics for more. Regarding PROS Holdings, here are some of the expenses PRO has removed in the past or still currently removes to calculate its non-GAAP metrics such as non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income and adjusted EBITDA:The removal of these items has a significant impact on the disparity between economic earnings and PRO's non-GAAP metrics. In 2014 PROS removed just over $22 million in share-based compensation expense (12% of 2014 revenue). Through the removal of this equity-based compensation and other expenses, PRO reported a non-GAAP net income of $12 million compared to GAAP net income of -$37 million. In 2015, the company removed nearly $28 million in share-based compensation expense (17% of 2015 revenue) and reported a non-GAAP net income of -$13 million compared to a GAAP net income of -$66 million. Long-term, PROS' non-GAAP metrics present the business in a much better light than economic reality. From 2008-2015, non-GAAP net income declined from $14 million to -$13 million. Meanwhile, economic earnings declined from $10 million to -$53 million over the same time frame, per Figure 2.Figure 2: Discrepancy Between Non-GAAP & Economic EarningsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsWeak Competitive Position: Negative Profitability In A Highly Competitive MarketPROS Holdings' solutions for providing pricing and revenue management pit it against some of the largest tech firms in the world, including Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and SAP (NYSE:SAP). At the same time, PROS faces competition from smaller firms such as Sabre Corporation (NASDAQ:SABR), Vendavo, Zilliant and Apptus. The data analytics market provides plenty of opportunities for a firm to carve out a niche segment. However, with highly negative margins, amidst much more profitable competition, PROS Holdings faces an uphill battle. Per Figure 3, PROS earns an ROIC and NOPAT margin well below three of its main competitors. PROS is at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to pricing power and the ability to reinvest in its operations. With such low margins, it will also have a hard time reaching the lofty expectations baked into its stock price, as we'll detail later.Figure 3: PROS Holdings' Profitability Ranks Well Below CompetitorsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsBull Hopes Imply Cloud Can Cure AllThe market loves a good growth story, particularly a software and/or cloud growth story. Look no further than prior Danger Zone reports on companies such as Box (NYSE:BOX), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) or FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) for examples of how irrational the market can get when valuing tech firms. PROS Holdings, despite operating since 1985, only recently joined the ranks of cloud companies when it switched its business to a primarily software-as-a-service model rather than a licensing model in mid-2015.With this switch came a shift in market sentiment and the stock began trading on non-GAAP metrics such as annual recurring revenue or contract value, while the fundamentals of the firm got pushed to the side. At the same time, bulls will argue this shift to a SaaS model has resulted in the negative profitability. However, this argument ignores the fact that the profitability issues began long before the shift to SaaS and don't appear to be coming to an end anytime soon.To make the argument that a shift to SaaS business model is causing near-term profitability issues, one must show that profits had been growing prior to 2015. However, per Figure 1 above, PROS Holdings' NOPAT and NOPAT margin have declined each year since 2011, and only gotten worse over the last twelve months. Furthermore, the costs of running the business are consistently growing faster than revenues. Since 2012, revenue has grown 13% compounded annually. Cost of revenue, selling & marketing, general & administrative, and research & development costs have grown by 22%, 35%, 28%, and 19% compounded annually over the same time. Worst yet, in 2015, when revenue declined 9%, each of these costs continued to grow year-over-year. The fact remains that PROS Holdings is unprofitable, whether it operates a licensing model or a SaaS model.Market expectations for PROS Holdings are to not only grow revenue at impressive rates (as with many SaaS firms) but also to immediately achieve profitability. Anything less would fail to meet the lofty expectations implied by the current stock price.The largest risk to the bear case is what we call ""stupid money risk,"" which is higher in today's low (organic) growth environment. Another firm could step in and acquire PRO at a value that is much higher than the current market price. However, we see an acquisition as possible only if a firm is willing to destroy shareholder value.Is PRO Worth Acquiring?The biggest risk to any bear thesis is that an outside firm acquires PRO at a value at or above today's price. If the negative profitability and weak competitive position noted above are not enough, we'll show below that PRO is not an attractive acquisition target unless a buyer is willing to destroy shareholder value.To begin, PRO has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, PRO is worth no more than the current share price.At the same time, the chances of another firm acquiring PROS would seem minimal. To provide quoting solutions, Oracle has acquired Big Machines while Salesforce has acquired SteelBrick to compete in the same market. Furthermore, PRO Holdings solutions are already available on many common enterprise platforms from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Dell, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle.Nonetheless, to illustrate just how overvalued PROS Holdings is to any potential acquirer, we can analyze different scenarios to determine what a firm should pay for PRO to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. As with any acquisition, there are limits on how much a firm would pay for PRO to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired.Figures 4 and 5 provide details on how much Salesforce should pay for PRO to ensure no shareholder value destruction.Each implied price is based on a 'goal ROIC' assuming different levels of revenue growth. In scenario one, the estimated revenue growth in each year equals 12%, which is the average revenue growth rate since 2012 and above consensus estimates. In scenario two, the estimated revenue growth rate in each year equals 17% because it assumes a merger with Salesforce could create additional revenue growth through increased cross-selling opportunities.We conservatively assume that Salesforce can grow PRO's revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets. We also assume PRO achieves a 2.1% NOPAT margin, which is CRM's current margin. For reference, PROS Holdings' TTM NOPAT margin is -35%, so this assumption implies immediate and drastic improvement and allows the creation of a truly best case scenario.Figure 4: Implied Acquisition Prices For CRM To Achieve 9% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 4 shows the 'goal ROIC' for CRM as its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or 9%. Even if PROS Holdings can grow revenue by 12% compounded annually with a 2% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is not worth more than its current price of $21/share. It's worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 9% ROIC would be only value-neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal CRM's WACC.Figure 5: Implied Acquisition Prices For CRM To Achieve 10% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 5 shows the next 'goal ROIC' of 10%, which is well above CRM's current ROIC of 2% and above its WACC, which ensures the deal would be truly accretive to shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most CRM should pay for PRO is $6.31/share (70% downside). Even assuming this best-case scenario, CRM would destroy $484 million if purchasing PRO at its current valuation. Any scenario assuming less than 17% CAGR in revenue would result in further capital destruction for CRM.Standalone Valuation Implies Significant Profit GrowthPRO is up over 100% in the past six months alone as investors have been drawn to the ""cloud growth story."" This significant price increase, coupled with continued deterioration of business fundamentals, leaves PRO overvalued. To justify the current price of $21/share, PRO must immediately achieve 6% NOPAT margins (last achieved in 2011 and compared to -35% TTM) and grow revenue by 18% compounded annually for the next 13 years. For reference, consensus estimates expect -10% revenue growth in EY1 and only 6% in EY2.Even if we assume PRO can immediately achieve a 6% NOPAT margin and grow revenue by 12% compounded annually (average since 2008) for the next decade, the stock is only worth $9/share today - a 57% downside. Each of these scenarios also assumes the company is able to grow revenue and NOPAT/free cash flow without spending on working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create a very optimistic scenario. For reference, PROS' invested capital as grown on average $8 million (5% of 2015 revenue) per year since 2008.Market Doesn't Overlook Losses ForeverMany unprofitable firms have seen their valuations soar and PRO is no different. After rising 100% over the past six months, the implications of the valuation defy even the best case scenarios. Barring an acquisition, which we believe would be ill-advised, PRO faces significant downside risk with little to no incremental upside potential.In order to reach the expectations embedded in the stock price, PROS Holdings needs to drastically improve margins while also growing revenue at impressive rates. Maintaining exceptional revenue growth often comes at the expense of margins, as the costs to grow revenue merely grow alongside revenue growth, as alluded to above. On the flip side, to increase margins, PROS Holdings needs to cut costs and risk a slowdown in revenue growth.The market will support firms that face this predicament only for so long. At the end of the day, fundamentals matter and either the fundamentals catch up to the valuation or the valuation corrects to a level more rational when compared to the fundamentals. We've seen this before at firms such as SolarCity (OTCQX:SCTY), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Box, down 60%, 54% and 32%, respectively, since being placed in the Danger Zone. While non-GAAP metrics continue to mask the losses of the business, any crack in the façade could provide the catalyst to send shares downward.Insider Action Is Low While Short Interest Is NotableOver the past 12 months, 35 thousand insider shares have been purchased and 72 thousand have been sold for a net effect of 37 thousand insider shares sold. These sales represent under 1% of shares outstanding. Additionally, there are 2.1 million shares sold short or just under 7% of shares outstanding.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingIn order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and a real shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to PRO's 2015 10-K:Income Statement: we made $19 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $19 million in non-operating expenses (11% of revenue). There were no adjustments related to non-operating income and we removed $19 million related to non-operating expenses. See the adjustments made to PRO's income statement here.Balance Sheet: we made $137 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $107 million. The most notable adjustment was $122 million (69% of net assets) related to excess cash. See all adjustments to PRO's balance sheet here.Valuation: we made $238 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $27 million. Apart from debt, one notable adjustment was $8 million related to outstanding employee stock options. This adjustment represents 1% of PRO's market cap.Dangerous Funds That Hold PROThe following funds receive our Dangerous-or-worse rating and allocate significantly to PROS Holdings.This article was originally published here on October 24, 2016.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style or theme."
2438555,66493,2014-08-20T12:23:25-04:00,"Pros Holdings has experienced double digit growth over the last few years. This double digit growth has continue into 2014 with the help of two recent acquisitions.SignalDemand and Cameleon have both help Pros Holdings gain access to more customers. Yet, Cameleon gives Pros Holdings access to another rapidly growing market.The recent acquisitions have help rapidly grow revenue. However, they have also lead to significant increases in sales, marketing, general and administrative expenses.These acquisitions have made the company's profitability issues worse.Management needs to address the company's profitability issues or the stock will struggle and revenue growth will be wasted.","Pros Holdings Inc. (NYSE:PRO) is a software solutions provider specializing in price optimization and management software. The software helps companies analysis large datasets to more effectively target customers and more quickly make pricing decisions. Management reported strong second quarter revenue growth. Revenue was up 24.9% (GAAP) and 31% (non-GAAP) basis. The second quarter's strong revenue growth has continued the company's recent string of double digit annual growth. During 2010-2013, revenue (GAAP) grew over 21% each year and grew a total of 103.9%. Before 2013, the company's growth was completely organic. Since 2013, revenue growth has been aided by two recent acquisitions.Pros Holdings announced the acquisition of Cameleon and SignalDemand in October and December of 2013, respectively. SignalDemand is a smaller price optimization company which was acquired to help broaden the company's industry customer base. SignalDemand specializes in commodity and resource based price optimization. As a result, SignalDemand's top customers are mainly from the agricultural industry, according to Venture Beat. Pros Holdings lacked a significant presents in this market segment which SignalDemand now gives them. SignalDemand expanded the company's customer base within the same market but Cameleon expands the company's reach into a new market. Cameleon's software is used by companies to quickly configure, price, and quote or CPQ. CPQ software is used by sales professionals to quickly and accurately give customers quotes. These two companies are still being integrated. Yet, can they help Pros continue to grow double digits?Strong Industry GrowthThe need for Big Data analysis has grown over the last several years and should continue to grow. International Data Corporation estimates Big Data Technology and Services revenue will grow at a CAGR of 27% until 2017. The market should reach $32.4 billion by 2017. Additionally, the price optimization and management segment should continue to keep pace due to current managerial trends. Gartner writes in their 2013 Market Scope report ""price optimization has shown steady growth during the past two to three years and has found its way onto the CXO's agenda, aligning closely with executive priorities..."" As more executives see the value of price optimization, the market should continue its strong growth.With the addition of Cameleon, Pros gains access to a new market which is also growing rapidly. Gartner estimated the CPQ market was $240 million in 2011 and was expected to grow 25% in 2012, according to a Forbes article. Additionally, Gartner reports the CPQ industry should continue to gain momentum because of the emerging realization CPQ is essential to optimizing sales (source: Cameleon's 2013 annual report translated by Google(NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL)). With executives realizing the value of CPQ and price optimization, these two markets should continue to grow fast.Solid Organic And Inorganic GrowthThe company's annual growth rate has been well above 20% over the last few years. Before 2013, this growth was organic growth but in late 2013 the company made two acquisitions. In the first half of 2014, these acquisitions are already having a significant impact on the company's revenue. In Q2 2014, non GAAP revenue growth was 31% y/y. Yet, organic growth for the quarter was only 8%. The rest of the company's 31% growth was contributed by the recent acquisitions. Their impact does vary by operating segment but is still significant. In the Q2 conference call, management talked about subscription revenue increasing $4.6 million to $6.6 million or 239% primarily due to the recent acquisitions. These acquisitions are making an immediate impact on revenue growth. In fact, the recent acquisitions accounted for 17.8% of the quarter's revenue.Although inorganic growth is great, management wants more recurring revenue as a percent of sales. This type of revenue is more stable and predictable. In 2014, recurring revenue was able to become a larger part of the company's revenue. On the Q2 conference call, Andres Reiner CEO talked about recurring revenue ""...we expected to increase recurring revenue as a percentage of annual revenue from 38% in 2013 to mid-40% in 2014. Mid-way through the year, we are already at 43%."" Although inorganic growth was higher, organic growth was still 8% in a historically weak quarter. Pros Holdings revenue was $144.84 million (GAAP) in 2013 and the company expects to reach $190-$194 million (non-GAAP) by year end. Although GAAP and non-GAAP are not exactly the same, the range would produce a reasonable annual growth estimate of 31.2% to 33.9%. With solid organic growth and the recent acquisitions, the company's revenue should continue to grow double digits along with the overall industry. Although the acquisitions have increased revenue, they have also been rapidly increasing operating expenses.Inorganic Growth Adding To Profitability IssuesManagement has been able to grow revenue double digits over the past few years. Surprisingly, the company's rapid growth hasn't occurred at the expense of gross margin which has remained relatively flat. Gross margin for the second quarter was 68.1% which is slightly below the company's five year average of 71.7%. Additionally, Reuters estimates Pros' gross margin is well above the industry average of 50.3% and the sector average of 42.0%. The company's double digit growth hasn't impacted gross margin but operating and net income margin have significantly suffered.Since 2009, operating margin has fallen from 10.7% to 2.4% in 2013. Net income margin has fallen from 8.0% to 2.1% over the same period. In 2014, operating and net income margin have continued their downward trend and even turned negative. The company's profitability has been declining for several years. However, management's recent acquisitions are causing even more profitability issues. Naturally, the integration of an acquisition is going to cause operating expenses to increase. However, these two acquisitions have caused a significant rise in selling, marketing, general and administrative expenses compared to past expense growth. In 2011, SMGA expenses grew 5.2% y/y and revenue growth was 36.0% y/y. As the company continued to rapidly expand, SMGA expenses grew slightly over 30% in 2012 and 2013. However due to the recent acquisitions, these expenses have increased even more growing 57.2% y/y in Q1 2014 and 54.6% y/y in Q2 2014.The problem with rising SMGA expenses is they are more permanent than cost directly related to the acquisition. Additionally, Pros' cost might continue to increase above past levels due to possible integration problems with Cameleon. Gartner reports ""Pros and Cameleon have different pricing and product data models, so Pros will have to focus on moving to a common data model for two different tools to reduce integration and product and pricing management efforts for its current and future mutual customers. "" This process should make full integration take longer and be more expensive. As the company continues to integrate these acquisitions, operating and net income margin will continue to suffer. Additionally, Pros Holdings' profitability was declining before the acquisition. SMGA expenses have been one of the main reasons for the decline in profitability. Management will have to better control operating cost because despite solid quarterly revenue growth Pros' stock fell 6.3% the day after earnings were released. Investors appear to want a more balance approach to growth. Management will have to demonstrate the ability to fully integrate these two companies while increasing profitability or the stock will struggle.Need To Fix Long Term Profitability IssuePros Holdings has experience solid double digit revenue growth over the past several years. The company's past growth has been organic in nature. However with two recent acquisitions, the company's 2014 double digit growth has been mainly inorganic. SignalDemand has and will help Pros expand Pros' industry customer base with its commodity and resources knowledge and systems. Cameleon gives the company access to a small but rapidly growing market. Additionally, Cameleon will help the company offer a more complete price and sales optimization solution. These acquisition have and should continue to help drive double digit revenue growth.These acquisitions have been great for revenue growth but have hurt profitability. The acquisitions have resulted in significant increases in SMGA expenses. The increases in SMGA have been higher than past SMGA growth. Before the acquisition, management pursued a rapid growth strategy which hurt profitability but now the company is producing operating losses. This hasn't been well received by investors. Despite the company's rapid Q2 revenue growth, Pros Holdings' stock decline over 6% the day after Q2 earnings was released. Pros Holdings is well positioned to experience double digit growth but will need to focus on increasing profitability or the stock will struggle."
307116,25084,2011-11-10T16:24:48-05:00,,"Pros Holdings (NYSE:PRO) reported excellent, on-target Q3 results. Earnings (excluding non cash stock option expense) advanced 83% to $.11 a share. Sales climbed 34% to $25.2 million. The company still sells its software exclusively on a perpetual license basis. The target market at this point remains large Fortune 500-type customers, with a particular emphasis on international airlines and other customers with a high number of variable pricing transactions. Most U.S. airlines operate their own internally developed pricing schemes. Initial selling prices approach $1.0 million and sometimes expand from there as customers extend the technology to additional business units. Maintenance contracts, which provide the latest software updates when they become available, are 15%-20% of the current selling price. In the September period, more than 95% of the maintenance contracts that came up for renewal were continued. Incoming orders demonstrated greater end market diversification. More industries are adopting pricing (revenue management) software to enhance profitability in a slow growth environment. Pros is already the industry leader and appears to be lenghtening its advantage by boosting R&D and marketing. The company is developing specialized applications for niche markets. It also has boosted the sales force by 50% this year.Momentum is likely to continue in Q4. We estimate full year earnings will rise 40% to $.35 a share. Revenues appear headed for the $96 million mark (+29%). Pros is rolling the dice a bit with respect to 2012. The company does have several large companies nipping at its heels in the pricing space, including Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN). Those behemoths are validating the technology among a far greater customer base than Pros addressed in the past. So the company plans to keep spending at an elevated level next year to retain its competitive lead and capture a lot of new business. All that spending is likely to prevent margins from expanding, however. Pros also is launching a cloud-based computing service aimed at smaller mid-market customers in 2012. That initiative is likely to crimp profitability further. Gross margins on incremental sales remain unusually high, so Pros will have plenty of latitude to work with. Despite the escalated spending plan our estimates reflect a modest improvement in 2012 pretax margins. If economic conditions contract in any serious manner, though, the leverage process could shift into reverse. With the P/E multiple already at a steep valuation the stock could be a volatile performer if economic conditions deteriorate.We estimate 2012 sales will improve 20%-30% to $115-$125 million. Earnings could end up in the $.40-$.50 a share range. The long term outlook remains bright. Economic growth in Japan, the United States and Europe is likely to remain muted for several years. But corporate income promises to stay robust. So companies will have an incentive to apply pricing technology to their relatively slow growing operations. And they'll have the cash to pay for it. Penetration of the mid-market segment promises additional leverage. Sales to emerging markets promise to reinforce the long term trend.Click chart to enlarge:Disclosure: I am long PRO."
4059513,71875,2017-04-03T16:00:00-04:00,"This SaaS company focused on pricing and revenue management solutions is in the middle of a transition to cloud offering which should deliver ambitious growth rates and profitability.I believe though that the future might not be as bright. Mainly due to the fact that the competition in this sector is intense and product differentiation is challenging.Furthermore, PRO is ‘stuck’ in the middle market which might be challenging to navigate without the backing of vertical cloud offering that other players (SteelBricks, BigMachines) now have.Even if the revenue does grow at forecasted rates, margins are needed to ensure the appropriate free cash flow margin. It is uncertain whether they can achieve this soon enough.All this uncertainty is then underpinned by valuation which implies almost 10 years of spotless growth and FCF margins. This does not seem prudent given aforementioned challenges and current situation.","Investment ThesisI believe that PROS Holdings (PRO), a software-as-a-service (SAAS) provider focused on helping companies with pricing, quoting and revenue management, is likely to be overvalued due to the following points:That being said one has to take the following into account;While the uncertainty is likely to be strong and the ‘upside’ risk limited due to current valuation, I would approach PRO with caution as the stock is likely to currently trade at non-GAAP measures such as annualized recurring revenue or optimistic expectations regarding the growth of the overall market where PRO is operating. These factors could support current valuation even if revenue or margins do not move significantly enough.That being said the company could see its valuation drop in the next few quarters should the company continue to fail to increase margins and/or cash flow. The management did set up light guidance which they are likely to beat but they already postponed some of their core targets (free cash flow and EBITDA). Thus investors might benefit from purchasing attractively priced put options with expiry in November which allow exposure to three quarterly announcements in which PRO will have to prove that they are getting closer to achieving their forecasts.Revenue Growth And Market ForcesAs mentioned the first target of the company encompasses revenue growth which they are hoping to achieve because of their product, cloud offering and overall growth in the target market which likely grew by at least 20%+ per annum in 2015 and is forecasted to continue this growth.PRO was founded in 1985 and started with a focus on airlines by building software that helps them to price the tickets, especially for groups. Thus PRO was one of the early ‘revenue management’ companies that try to automate this process as much as possible. This focus never really left the company as even by 2007, when the company went public, 42% of revenue consisted of sales of licenses to the airline industry. In order to grow though the company started to focus on different industries such as manufacturing, distribution and the broader travel industry (hotels etc.)These ‘diversification’ efforts were then solidified by two acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 as PRO acquired Signal Demand (focused on pricing for agriculture companies) and French company Cameleon. The latter gave PRO a larger exposure to the broad ‘Configure-Price-Quote’ (CPQ) market in which they now offer three software packages. One is aimed at selling (mainly for the internal sales force of B2B companies), the other at pricing (more for larger B2C companies that need to adjust prices for their products) and the last is revenue management which is mainly focused on the aforementioned travel and airline industry. While some of these use cases might be described as their own ‘markets’, I will be referring to the CPQ market as a whole due to its unifying focus on helping companies to increase revenue and margins through automating parts of their sales process.While it seems that the company is moving in the right direction I believe that the following three factors are going to pose a challenge;The most obvious issue that PRO will have to face is the intense competition that exists in the CPQ market which does not have high barriers to entry. The core functionality of CPQ software (generating a quote/price) is straightforward and has been replicated by many companies. A good introduction to various players in the industry is this recent research by Forrester in which PRO is shown as a strong performer but with little market presence.What PRO believes that differentiates them from the rest of the pack of these applications and can help them to grow is their ability to perform ‘big data analytics’. This should help customers to determine a better price or quote by at least partially forecasting portion of supply or demand factors (experience of which they gathered in the airline industry). An example of this can even go as far as trying to ‘forecast commodity price moves’ as mentioned by the management during the last conference call.While this is certainly a valid selling point, I believe that there are inherent limitations. It is certainly possible for PRO to leverage customer data to arrive at a better estimate of a price or a quote (which was ‘easier’ for airlines that have vast amounts of data), but another thing is to go beyond this point and forecast data points that are not directly connected to the customer. This amounts to the age-old effort of timing the market which is inherently impossible and if attained it would mean that the company that has this ‘ultimate’ software is going to achieve better revenues and/or margins than anyone else.In fact, I believe that a realistic version of the software which helps companies to navigate possible scenarios and make more researched decisions is nothing that would again be hard to replicate. If you look at PRO’s competitors such as Zilliant or Apttus they are already offering their own solutions to this. Zilliant also mentions that it patented its technology which PRO did as well and thus it is unlikely that one single software would easily be more efficient than rest of the pack.This then leaves PRO in a challenging market position, especially because while their products are likely competitive enough, the ability to easily scale is uncertain. The company will be pressured by major players such as SAP, Oracle, or Salesforce that have their own vertical cloud offerings and can prevent PRO from being able to achieve mass adoption from either the smaller contracts or the large contracts that these platforms are more likely to attract.While their products are integrated into these platforms they are unlikely to be promoted by the companies which enjoy the fact that they act as a place of competition for the smaller CPQ players as mentioned in this article. This also holds true for Microsoft Azure with which PRO recently expanded its cooperation.Thus the company is stuck in the middle market where it has to navigate an environment on its own without a clear growth trajectory apart from spending more on sales and marketing and even here the company is not alone as companies such as the aforementioned Apttus might make this more challenging. Not to mention the fact that some of PRO’s bigger customers have been able to develop their own in-house solutions for some of its products (as was the case in the airline sector).Finally, when I looked over the company’s Glassdoor reviews, some employees have given examples that would support this argument;Source: GlassdoorSource: Glassdoor Source: GlassdoorI understand that one should discount these review for possible ‘disgruntled’ employees but it certainly does increase the uncertainty.The company also mentioned that the fact that they migrated to cloud will support the revenue growth rates. Usually, the main two advantages of the cloud for companies is increased addressable market and a favorable increase in long-term customer value. While I believe that PRO’s cloud can help the company to speed up the lengthy sales cycle due to the ease of implementation and thus increase the addressable market, I am not sure whether the revenue growth (and profitability) is going to alleviate the need for organic growth enough.The idea behind these two cloud advantages is simple. As the cloud is a monthly or annual subscription it will force the company to keep on paying as they won’t have other options which will increase the revenue from each customer as normally companies can price their cloud offering above ‘maintenance’ revenue but below the initial cost for a license to entice companies to switch. A great example of how the cloud can help the company can be seen in the case of Autodesk who introduced the following pricing of their cloud offering which results in the following cost graph for the customer.As you can see in just two years the customer will pay more for cloud (if paid quarterly) than via perpetual license and will pay almost double the amount in seven years. When I saw this I understood why ADSK’s price is holding so well. This graph shows just how much of a pricing power the company holds (due to their clear number one position in the market). Once the cloud transition is done, the cash flow is then likely to increase significantly as in the case of Adobe.While PRO is also showcasing similar revenue projections (regarding ‘break-even’), its long-term customer value forecast is less enticing.As you can see after seven years the undiscounted revenue is indeed higher by almost 40% but that translates to only an average annual increase of about 5.7% and the discounted revenue is smaller at just 28% (or 4% per annum). This means that the company will still have to achieve organic revenue growth of around 15% from increasing its customer base. Moreover, the gross profit impact is even smaller.That being said cloud does definitely leverage the company’s renewal rates which are generally above 90% and show that once they got the customer they are unlikely to lose him quickly.The third factor that could complicate revenue growth is the fact that the company has been trying to enter other markets than the airline industry for quite some time now. In fact, the IPO documents show that their product focus and business efforts are essentially unchanged. While the company did grow since becoming public they refused to break down their revenue since the IPO. Thus no one really knows how successful are they in the other markets.It could be that the airline industry still accounts for a sizeable portion of the revenue and that they have been able to properly tap into other markets only via the two acquisitions in 2013 and 2014. This would mean that they are struggling to grow organically which would be in line with the competitive forces. Of course, it can be that the company already diversified itself and that their current push is successful. The key issue here is that no one knows.The management also comments on sources of revenue growth only via limited notes in their filings. Furthermore, in this Q4 conference call for FY2011 they mentioned that the reason that they do not break out the revenue (and backlog) further is because they ‘think of the company as one company’. This is barely an argument as they know that it would help analysts to measure their success. The fact that they don’t do it makes me side with the more negative outcome that they are unable to break into the other markets and that airlines are still their core.Again several employees did voice this concern as well;Source: Glassdoor (4* review)Source: GlassdoorFinally, the company even actively increases the lack of transparency as for example they decided to stop reporting one of the ‘key metrics of cloud transition’ Average Contract Value (ACV) and another key metric Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) will only be reported annually. It might make sense to stop reporting ARR quarterly due to volatility, but I question the step to stop reporting ACV as it can help get a feeling of pricing. Due to this, the company will be able to say that possibly poor GAAP quarterly results are just ‘temporary’ because ACV and ARR are doing well without reporting the metrics.To summarize the company faces several challenges regarding its revenue growth target. Most importantly it is the uncertainty regarding the competition and product differentiation. The company currently projects to grow GAAP revenues at 20% CAGR as per this recent presentation and forecasts slight growth of 6-8% in this year due to the remnants of the cloud transition. It might be that the company could execute these targets in the near future (2 years) but what I believe is unlikely is that the company would be able to grow at such pace consistently in the next five years.Gross Margins TargetNext important milestone of PRO is to achieve gross margins of roughly 71% which will help to offset operating costs and deliver that 20% free cash flow margins. While I believe that this might be the least challenging target due to the likely positive impact of increased revenue, there are still several uncertainties.The company noted that it will have to expand its data center footprint in order to handle the increased number of customers. This will invariably slow down any expansion in the gross margin and might even pose a long-term challenge as this need is unlikely to go away if revenue growth is to occur. While the company does use part of Microsoft's cloud infrastructure, this is likely not enough.Should the company be unable to achieve scale through revenue growth they might try to increase pricing but due to the intense competition this is unlikely to have a positive effect and thus they rely mainly on top line growth to drive the gross margin.Finally, one has to remember that their license and services revenue is likely to shrink further and as per the latest 10K the company also expects maintenance and support revenue to slowly decline as licenses are not core focus anymore. This will again pressure the company to achieve revenue growth in order to ‘plug’ the hole in the gross margin.That being said these challenges are not something that would be as complicated as the ones connected to revenue growth. In the past, the company routinely achieved 70% margins and above for prolonged periods of time.Free Cash Flow TargetThe last target that the company mentioned is also likely the most important one as this directly impacts the generation of shareholder value. While the revenue growth is important as well gross margins these efforts are not going be worth much unless PRO is able to translate them into free cash flow.The challenges that I see here are two-fold.The more potent issue is that the company will need to focus on reining in on their sales and marketing spending, but so far it seems that the increased growth efforts are connected to the increase in sales and marketing. You can see below that after finishing the two acquisitions and focusing on cloud this cost has rapidly increased.While it went down slightly last year the company said that it is unlikely that they are going to cut it further. In fact, during the last conference call, they said that they will increase the number of sales people and that the cost is likely to increase at the rate of revenue. While this means that the operating margin is not likely to be worse this year, it certainly shows that they are somewhat reliant on increasing the spending. This also means that the nature of the cost is unlikely to be fixed but rather slightly variable.As seen in the previous table the company also spends a significant amount of money on R&D which is unlikely to go down anytime soon either. The company needs to ensure that its products are on the best level possible due to the strong competition.If these two costs then are either unable to be offset by revenue growth or cut, the free cash flow margin is going to be challenging to achieve.The company already postponed two targets connected to the FCF margin as during the last conference call they mentioned that they forecast adjusted EBITDA to be flat compared to last year and that the free cash flow is going to be negative and in the range of -$19 million to -$21 million. Again, I believe that they lower their guidance so that they can beat it but the company already expected to see positive free cash flow in 2017 back in 2015 (as per this presentation). While they did adjust that in the 2016 presentation, it still shows that there is uncertainty regarding the FCF margin which will dictate the generation of shareholder value.ValuationUltimately, as mentioned in the thesis, even if one overlooks all the challenges and applies the targeted forecast to company’s financials the valuation is still not extremely enticing as seen below.Note #1: For 2017 I took the company’s expectation regarding revenue growth and took an optimistic estimate of free cash flow since I believe that they are likely to beat their own guidance. After this, I gradually forecast increases in FCF margins based on current operating expenses and keep the revenue growth constant as per company’s target.Note #2: The company has $52.9 million in deferred tax assets (NOLs) which are currently not on the asset side of balance sheet due to a valuation allowance.This means that investors are currently expecting almost 10 years (the FCF stream would match the expectations late 2026) of smooth growth and significant free cash flow which is not prudent given the volatile transition period and possible challenges with revenue and both gross and operating margins.I believe that a more reasonable scenario could lead to the following free cash flow in that 9-year outlook.This could lead us to a potential price target of around $14.5 per share which would represent almost a 39% downside from the current share price and this is still a scenario where the company will be able to reach its targets.Although this is, of course, a rough estimate. It is more likely that if the company fails to show meaningful improvement in line with their forecasts then the share price is going to be volatile and going to move sharply after quarterly announcements as was the case in early 2016 when the company announced first results of the cloud transition.Finally, I would also point out that in the original presentation from 2015 the company forecasted that by 2020 they expect to achieve $500 million in revenue (at 20% FCF margin). They did not reiterate this target in the updated version of the forecast and it is highly unlikely that they would be able to achieve this.ConclusionThe stock is currently trading at excessive valuation given all the challenges that might prevent the company from achieving its targets. Be it the competitive landscape, possibly inability to scale or issues with operating costs the company faces an uphill battle. More so the stock which is likely unattractive even if one overlooks the issues and applies the desired forecasts onto current financials.As mentioned in the thesis, I believe that November put options could be an interesting way to get exposure to the possibility of downside after quarterly announcements. The option chain is attractive due to relatively low break-even prices as for example in-the-money $25 put option costs only $3.80 implying break even on a roughly 12% move from the current price. Given the past share price jumps this should not be a far-fetched scenario, especially given the current valuation.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

3030816,76425,2015-03-26T11:13:09-04:00,PRO has made key acquisitions.PRO is ready to convert revenue growth into earnings growth.PRO is in a unique position to capture market share.,"PROS HOLDINGS is a BIG DATA software company offering price optimization and revenue management tools. PRO's software solutions provide customers with customized sales and marketing information that has proven to increase profitability. The company has increased revenues mainly due to key acquisitions but has yet to translate the increased sales into profits.My investment thesis: PRO is now in a good position to improve its bottom line due to the expected growth in its industry and that PRO has put itself in a unique position to capitalize on the expected demand.INDUSTRY GROWTH FORECASTPwC's 2015 survey revealed that 84% of CEO's (globally) reported that they valued and planned to implement data and data analytics in their decision making process. IDC forecasts that expansion of Big Data usage will begin to be implemented by all large enterprises in 2015. Silicon Angle predicts increased investment in predictive software for sales in 2015. ""If you are not using Big Data, you're behind the competitive curve.""UNIQUE INDUSTRY POSITIONPRO made two key acquisitions. In December of 2013, PRO bought Signal Demand, a provider of price optimization as well as commodity and resource optimization. Signal Demand's software is used not only to determine best pricing but what also what are the best products to manufacture and market based on commodity and resource data. The Signal Demand acquisition allowed PRO entry into new market segments.In January 2014, it bought Cameleon Software, a company specializing in CPQ (Configure, Price and Quote) software that allows a sales person to put together what products to sell, at what price and provides a quote and order document. According to Gartner IT, ""CPQ systems typically include pricing engines, proposal generators, quoting systems, and rules or constraint engines, and are complemented by approval and authorization workflows.""Gartner has published a study revealing that the price optimization market has experienced only 5-10% penetration. PRO has built its game plan on that premise. Earlier this month, at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, Tim Girgenti, PRO's Chief Marketing Officer said:PRO competes mainly against private companies Vendavo, Vistaar Technologies and Zilliant and many more companies play a smaller role. but PRO is the only company that is able to offer both price optimization and CPQ software solutions. To capitalize on this position, PRO offers new data tools that integrate price optimization and CPQ. The company has also formed new partnerships to exploit this opportunity. I think the most promising partnership is the deal announced in March with SpringCM to offer the complete software package to saleforce.com (NYSE:CRM) customers. Spring CM is the only company that is Salesforce1 contract certified mobile management solution on the AppExchange .BACKGROUND AND INFORMATIONPrice optimization was first used by the airlines in the 1980s. The airline industry began implementing different pricing according to routes, competition, seat and other variables. The success enjoyed by the airlines created interest in other hospitality industries such as hotels and rental cars and has since spread over into most sectors. The original founders of PRO were previously involved in the airline industry with Continental Airlines. PRO was founded in 1997 and went public in 2007.PRO is recognized as one of the top companies in its field. An example of this esteemed position is that the company was a winner of the CRM Watchlist Award and placed in elite status alongside only two other companies, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Salesforce. This award is based not only on prior accomplishments, but on future expectations as well.PRO has enjoyed four consecutive years of revenue growth and in their 4Q earnings report in February reported establishing a company record for revenues, a company record number of new customers, doubling their B2B customers and that the company has been successful in growing their recurring revenues up to 42% of sales from 38% the prior year and licensing revenues up over 100% from the prior quarter.CONCLUSIONDemand for CPQ and price optimization software is well documented with a market that is just starting and many potential customers. CPQ has been slower to adopt here than in Europe. The acquisition of Cameleon has put PRO in an excellent position to penetrate the U.S. market demand for CPQ software. Being the only company that is able to offer a complete suite of solutions, the salesforce.com connection and its recognition as a market leader make PRO a compelling buy. Not everyone is a fan right now. One analyst recently downgraded the stock. New interest for PRO will come if the company is able to convert growing revenue into growing earnings."
4258681,21815,2019-05-01T15:20:20-04:00,"A short thesis on the company was published on SA in 2017 containing an impressive amount of knowledge and research.For quite some time since, it looked like that short thesis could indeed play out.However, it seems that the company is turning around its fortunes, increasing growth, margins and greatly reducing its cash burn.Unless the Q1 surprise was a fluke, for which we see little evidence, the short thesis looks like not playing out.We don't see the shares as an instant buy here as we consider them fairly valued.","PROS Holdings (NYSE:PRO) is a CPQ (Configure, Price and Quote) software provider helps companies produce accurate and highly configured quotes making all of the complex product, pricing, and business rules centralized, automatic and available in real-time, enabled by big data and machine learning, that is, AI.This is an expanding market, but the company is up against strong competition from big software companies like Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and Salesforce (CRM).The excellent article from SA contributor Jan Svenda provides a useful introduction to markets, products and competition, so we refer that article for necessary background. Still, the company has been doing well lately and produced surprisingly strong Q1 figures after which it raised guidance for the year. No surprise that the stock price has shared the enthusiasm:Management isn't afraid of more general AI capabilities that are available through the likes of Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT), and neither is it afraid of the aforementioned software houses (Q1CC):The CPQ market itself is broadening and here is where their advantage lies, according to management (Q1CC):It's no surprise AI plays an increasing role (Q1CC):The company seems to be accelerating growth, although this is at least in part an optical effect from a shift to the cloud (overall revenue growth was 17% y/y in Q1 but subscription revenue growth was 45%). We see a number of promising growth areas:For Airlines revenue, or yield management (the art of keeping planes as close to capacity as possible while exploiting the demand curves of customers to the max) has always been crucial so it's these were first customers. But the product portfolio has broadened with the help of acquisitions to include CPQ with three services, selling, pricing, eCommerce and the aforementioned yield management and includes AI, to name the most important.So there is additional demand from new products and the migration to the cloud for these customers, even for the airlines, with the likes of ANA, Japan's largest airline which has migrated to the company's cloud services RM Essentials Solutions in Q1.But most of the growth came from their B2B solutions where the company also has domain specific knowledge in industries like high tech, food, B2B services, oil and gas and cargo and logistics. Growth came both from existing and new customers in a roughly 50/50 split.Service growth as also pronounced in Q1 and will continue in Q2 from two sources:Service revenue will grow in the mid-30s for the year as the completion of these longer-term projects will subside.As a result of the shift to the cloud recurring revenue as a percentage of overall revenue keeps on increasing, reaching the upper 70s in Q2 and rising to 80%+ for the year.From the earnings deck:The solid results leads to improved guidance, particularly in Q2. Management now expects Q2:Full year 2019:The EBITDA and operational cash flow will also increase for the year but not by the $9.5M in increased revenue guidance, but by roughly $3M each as the company keeps investing some of the additional revenue in S&M and R&D. Free cash flow isn't guided higher at all because there will also be additional CapEx in computer equipment for personnel. Data by YChartsWhat's not visible in the GAAP margins above is that the company experienced a considerable gross margin expansion over the year, their non-GAAP subscription gross margins where up 750pb over last year's Q1 to 71%. Management thinks there is another 100-200pb improvement possible this year. Operational margins are still deeply red, at least on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses increased by 15% y/y, slightly below the 17% revenue growth so there is some improvement on this front. Data by YChartsCash flow is back to more decent levels after deteriorating sharply three years ago, and the company is bleeding little cash and in fact expects a small positive free cash flow this year ($1M at midpoint).The company has splashed out quite a bit on (convertible) debt and one share offering as well. Not a dramatic one (4.37M shares), but still:Data by YChartsThe debt is mostly in relation to acquisitions, like that of Cameleon Software (2014) and Vayant Travel Technologies (2017). Data by YChartsValuation is fairly steep, given the losses and not inconsiderable amount of debt. But this is backwards looking and reduces to a somewhat more moderate 7.7x forward sales. The company has a nice history of earnings beats. It might seem that Q1 was an exception, but these are GAAP figures:Non-GAAP EPS was -$0.11 in Q1 2019 and that was 2 cents better than what analysts expected. Still, EPS estimates are for a loss of $1.43 this year falling to $1.06 next year, these are GAAP figures but still quite substantial. Much of the net loss will disappear on an adjusted basis as share based comp and acquisition related amortization are pretty substantial. In any case, we find cash flow more important.The company seems to be accelerating its growth, margins are expanding and the company is likely to stop the cash bleed this year, but for the moment we find these changes sufficiently valued in the shares. However, if you look beyond this year a future looms where the company could be generating considerable amounts of cash, which would enable them to deleverage (much of the debt will convert into shares this year) or even start to buy back shares and/or make other acquisitions.Profits are also within the realm of possibility (on an adjusted basis), so it's a company to keep an eye on. The short-thesis put forward by SA contributor Jan Svenda put forward in 2017 is losing out, at least so far and it's difficult to see any immediate deterioration to revive that thesis."
99897,21185,2008-10-14T19:16:31-04:00,,"Tuesday I issued a sell recommendation on shares of PROS Holdings (NYSE: PRO).While it is very rare for me to turn around and sell a position in a stock that I had just recently recommended, I believe there are fundamental reasons why it is in our best interests to revisit the PROS story in a few more weeks and liquidate our position now.PROS is a leading provider of pricing and revenue optimization software worldwide in five major markets: airline, hotel, cruise, manufacturing and services.If you’ve ever wondered how hotels, airlines, or other businesses know how to price their offerings to always seem to squeeze the very last dime out of potential customers, PROS is one of the companies responsible by applying revenue optimization software that prices company’s offerings on the fly to maximize revenue.PROS has proprietary pricing algorithms and systems that have been developed and refined over many years of implementation and experience, that provide the company with a distinct competitive advantage over the many rivals that troll the pricing optimization space.This certainly won’t take long to explain.I’ve written previously that PROS is a wonderful business with huge amounts of free cash flow generation, long term reliable and recurring revenue, and a distinct competitive advantage over other companies that also offer price optimization technologies such as Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL), SAP (NYSE: SAP) and others.The reason for my sell recommendation has more to do with the current economic climate, and what I believe will be a slow down, in the business that PROS relies on for their customer base.It’s true that PROS has expanded their offerings to now cover a broad spectrum of markets such as hotels, airlines, cruise, manufacturing, and the service sector, but these are just the sorts of companies that right now, will be pulling back on any extra spending.Yes, even spending that might make them more money, as a result of recent market turmoil and the fact that there is less clarity into the financial and credit markets, let alone their own company’s prospects.Essentially, here are the reasons for my sale:I still believe in PROS holdings, the management team, the business model, and the fundamentals of the company long term.However, upon further diligence, something tells me that PROS is more than likely to miss guidance, and at the very least, provide a more cautious outlook for their future bookings.The pessimism surrounding the market in general, and IT spending in particular, will make it near impossible for PROS’ management team to do anything but be cautious, guide lower, and make sure that Wall Street’s expectations are in line with what will more than likely be, a temporary slowdown in capital expenditures in the marketplace.Selling our 1/4 position today around my previously recommended  purchase price, ensures that we lose nothing, and can wait and see how this situation plays out.If I am dead wrong, and PROS blows away estimates, guides higher, and the stock rockets up, then we will miss out on some upside. That’s a risk I am willing to take.If I am right however, and PROS goes the more likely route of lowering their internal guidance and expectations for Wall Street, we’ll be getting a much sweeter deal on a great company’s stock that is well funded and has a tremendous future either as a stand alone company, or an acquisition target.Because PROS is well capitalized and has plenty of cash in the bank, and generates copious amounts of free cash flow, I am not worried about their future, just their present.Let’s wait and see how this plays out, and more than likely, get in at a much cheaper valuation that allows us a higher risk/reward proposition.Quick Notes:"
2242213,20568,2014-05-28T16:53:48-04:00,,"PROS Holdings (PRO) recently missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates for Q1 on both the top and bottom lines. Although management reiterated its full year revenue guidance, analysts revised their earnings estimates lower for both 2014 and 2015. This sent the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).While shares of PROS Holdings have taken a beating like many other ""high tech"" stocks, valuation still looks very expensive with shares trading at 144x next year's earnings.PROS Holdings is a ""big data"" software company that offers solutions to optimize sales, pricing, quoting, rebates and revenue management across more than 40 industries. Around 69% of total revenue comes from ""License & Implementation"" while the rest comes from ""Maintenance & Support"". Approximately 56% of its revenue comes from outside of the United States.First Quarter ResultsPROS Holdings reported its first quarter results on May 8. Adjusted earnings per share (which still includes share-based compensation) came in at a loss of 12 cents, which was below the Zacks Consensus Estimate calling for a loss of 9 cents.Total GAAP-revenue rose 25% year-over-year to $40.9 million, but it was below the consensus of $42.0 million. The increase was driven by 25% growth in ""License & Implementation"" while ""Maintenance & Support"" increased 14%. The impressive revenue growth did not translate into impressive profit growth, however.One reason for this was a decline in the gross profit margin, which fell from 69% to 66% of total revenue. Moreover, there was a 57% jump in 'Selling, marketing, general and administrative expenses'. These expenses accounted for 55% of total revenue, up from 42% in the same quarter last year.R&D costs totaled 28.3% of revenue, up from 24.1% in the same quarter last year. The company also recognized $4.4 million in share-based compensation in the quarter.One bright spot was cash from operations, which improved from $1.3 million to $3.4 million in the quarter.Estimates FallingIn the Q1 report, management reiterated its full year revenue guidance. But that didn't stop analysts from lowering their earnings estimates for both 2014 and 2015.This sent the stock to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).As you can see below, consensus estimates - and the stock price - have fallen considerably so far in 2014.The current 2014 Zacks Consensus Estimate is -$0.04, down from +$0.14 just 90 days ago. The 2015 consensus is now $0.16, down from $0.27 over the same period.Pricey ValuationPROS Holdings, like a lot of other ""high tech"" stocks, has sold off heavily lately. But the valuation picture still does not look attractive. The stock trades around 576x 12-month forward earnings and 144x 2015 earnings. And its EV/EBITDA multiple is a lofty 80x.This is despite the fact that shares of PRO are down more than 40% from their 52-week high.The Bottom LineWith very little profit, falling earnings estimates, and premium valuation multiples, investors should avoid PROS Holdings at least until its earnings momentum improves.Todd Bunton, CFA is the Growth & Income Stock Strategist for Zacks Investment Research and Editor of the Income Plus Investor service.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

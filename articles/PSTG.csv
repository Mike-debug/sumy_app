An investor could generate double-digit annual returns over the next decade with Pure Storage.I rate Pure Storage a buy at $17.3.","Editor’s note: This article was edited post-publication to remove potentially confusing language in the valuation section.Source: convergetp.comPure Storage (PSTG) is an all-flash storage provider that offers integrated software and hardware solutions in the enterprise data storage market (primarily data-center flash memory). The unique value of Pure Storage's offering is reflected in its particularly high gross margins of ~70%. However, the collapse of NAND prices in 2019, and uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment due to COVID-19, has resulted in Pure Storage trading at a discount to its fair value. As such, investors could generate double-digit annual returns if he/she were to invest at the current price of ~$17.In today's article, I will share a chart showing the recovery in NAND spot prices, discuss some key financial numbers, and provide an estimate for Pure Storage's fair value and expected returns.One of the significant overhangs on Pure Storage's stock has been the pricing pressure faced by the company due to the price collapse in the NAND flash memory market over the last 18-24 months or so. However, NAND spot prices are on the rise with the latest earnings report and guidance raise from Micron (MU) highlighting this fact.Source: finance.yahoo.comI think that the improvement in pricing comes down to the increased demand in data-centers, which was created due to COVID-19 induced acceleration of digital transformation and subsequent mega shift to the cloud.Pure Storage's unique cloud-like offering includes Evergreen, Pure-as-a-Service, and Cloud Block Store solutions (on AWS (AMZN), Azure (MSFT), etc.). These solutions enable companies to use all-flash storage as a service and pay according to their usage, i.e., flexibility. As a result of rapid subscription revenue growth (~37% y/y) in Q1 FY 2021, Pure Storage was able to grow its overall revenues by ~12% y/y in a tough quarter marred by COVID-19.Source: Pure Storage Q1 FY-2021 Earnings PresentationHere's how the company's financials have improved since its IPO:Source: YChartsDespite the apparent improvement in revenues, gross margins, and operating margins, the stock has been a massive disappointment for investors over the last five years, as can be seen below.Source: YChartsThe next few years could be much better for shareholders as Pure Storage is expected to grow at ~13% CAGR over the next three years, and the company is very close to consistent positive free cash flow generation.To estimate Pure Storage's fair value, I will leverage my proprietary valuation model, with which many of you are already familiar. For those of you who have not yet seen it, here's what it entails:Now, let's check out Pure Storage's valuation.Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelAs you can see above, Pure Storage's fair value is $27.75, i.e., the stock is currently ""Undervalued"" by 37.72%.But these are only steps 1 and 2. Let's check out step 3 to determine if we have a high probability of outperforming the market via an investment in Pure Storage.Now, we know that a traditional DCF model illustrates whether a stock is over- or under-valued; however, it does nothing in terms of demonstrating what one can expect in the way of future expected returns. For that, we must employ step 3 of the LASV model, the results of which can be seen below.Step 3 entails a simple process of projecting intrinsic value via the growth of free cash flow per share. In essence, we simply grow the initial free cash flow per share ($1.28 in this case) by the assumed growth rate for ten years; at the end of which, we apply an assumed price to FCF multiple.This creates a target price in 2030, by which we can generate CAGR or annualized return projection.Now, some commenters may take issue with such a lengthy projection, as they might claim we cannot project that far into the future.To remedy the issues associated with projecting ten years out, i.e., variable growth rates, unforeseen technological developments, we employ a financial concept known as ""margin of safety.""There are numerous methods by which one could implement a margin of safety; however, we achieve it simply by using conservative assumptions, i.e., conservative growth assumptions and a conservative price to free cash flow multiple in the year 2030. Thus, we can be very wrong and still be right.Now, with all of this in mind, let's check out what Pure Storage could offer us in the way of future returns.Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelSo, if one were to buy Pure Storage at today's price of $17.28 and hold for ten years, he/she could expect base case returns at ~15% CAGR.The growth of cloud computing and the data centers thereof is expected to continue over the next decade. As the need for speed increases, the transition from disk arrays to flash arrays will continue unabated. Pure Storage has been an innovator in the enterprise storage space with its all-flash storage offerings, and I expect the company to expand its market share in the future.Key takeaway: I rate Pure Storage a buy at ~$17.Please provide your feedback in the comments section below!As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow, and happy investing."
4358047,105757,2020-07-13T01:16:29-04:00,"Pure Storage underperformed the market year-to-date with shares up only about 2% while Nasdaq is up 17%.Remains one of the few hardware companies in tech that is consistently growing double-digits, yet remains unloved and neglected by investors (trading at 1.9x EV/Sales).Pure Storage continues to take market share from incumbents such as HPE, Dell, IBM and NetApp while growing revs 33% in F2019, 21% in F2020, and 12% in F1Q21.Product margins continue to remain around 70% versus legacy vendors at around 50-55%, indicating that customers are willing to pay up for Pure Storage’s products that are considered best in the industry.Its subscription business grew 37%Y/Y in F1Q21 and is becoming a bigger portion of overall revenues (33% of total) and will likely drive growth in C2021 and beyond.","Pure Storage (PSTG), one of the best All Flash Array (AFA) makers in the industry, is a buy in our opinion as it continues to grow faster than market and is taking share from large incumbents such as NetApp (NTAP), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE), Dell (DELL) and IBM (IBM). Yet it is unloved and underappreciated by investors. Customers, however, love Pure Storage’s products (a high Net Promoter Score of 86 confirms the affection) and Gartner and other third party independent analysts also consider the products some of the best in the industry. Despite reporting solid results and issuing positive commentary when Pure Storage last reported results on May 29th, the stock has languished. Given our confidence in its continued ability to take share, out-execute its larger rivals by launching quickly and efficiently products based on newer NAND flash geometries, compelling valuation, and a potential for a catchup trade, we would be buyers of the shares.Pure Storage, despite having one of the best and modern product portfolios in the industry, continues to underperform the broad tech market. Many investors we spoke to believe that majority of the new storage capacity is going to be deployed in cloud and on-premises storage growth is likely to continue to decline. While we agree that majority of the growth will likely be coming in the cloud, a significant portion of workloads (more than 50%) will still continue to remain on-prem. Much of the on-prem storage infrastructure is still based on old spinning hard disk drive technology which is slow and inefficient.Enterprises are upgrading their existing storage infrastructure with newer and modern data arrays that are based on NAND flash. The newer storage arrays are smaller, consume less power, are less noisy and do not generate excess heat in the data center and hence do not need to be cooled. Flash storage arrays in general are cheaper to operate and are extremely fast, speeding up applications. Pure Storage by all accounts makes the best storage arrays in the industry and continues to grow faster than major storage vendors such as NetApp, Dell, HPE and IBM.According to Gartner, Pure Storage’s market share was 12.7% in C1Q20 and was up from 10.1% in the prior year. HPE, NetApp and IBM lost share. According to blocksandfiles.com, AFA vendor market share sizes and shifts are paraphrased below:Pure has been gaining share almost every year since it began selling storage arrays in 2011. According to Gartner, Pure Storage is consistently rated the highest for the completeness of vision as the following chart illustrates.Source: GartnerInvestors we spoke to are concerned that storage is in a secular decline due to workloads moving to public cloud vendors such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure Services (MAS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Investors seem to think that storage companies such as Pure Storage will likely have their business decimated by the movement of applications to public cloud. While Cloud is certainly making the growth of on-prem storage to slow, the impact is mainly being felt by larger incumbent vendors such as Dell, HPE, NetApp and IBM. Each of these companies saw their storage revenues decline last three to four years, given many customers think their products are somewhat inferior to Pure’s products. However, Pure Storage has the distinction of growing its revenue in each of last 9 years.Pure has products to address the growth of Cloud storage as well as products to drive the growth of on-prem storage. For on-prem data center, Pure sells Flash Array to address block storage workloads (for databases and other mission-critical workloads) and FlashBlade for unstructured or file data workloads. On-prem storage revenue is mainly driven by legacy storage array replacement cycle.In addition, the company also sells subscription products such as Pure-as-a-service and Cloud Block Store. Enterprises buy storage from vendors such as NetApp or Pure in the cloud to prevent vendor lock-in by the cloud providers.Despite reporting solid results both in F4Q20 and F1Q21, Year-to-date (YTD), Pure Storage is only up around 2%, while the Nasdaq is up around 17% and the SOX Index is up nearly 11%.Source: Yahoo FinancePure Storage is currently trading at 1.9x EV/C2021 sales versus NetApp that is trading at 1.6x. While Pure Storage is expected to grow around 16%, NetApp is only expected to grow around 2%. The following chart illustrates valuation of hardware peer group.Source: Author based on Thomson Reuters DataSource: Author based on Thomson Reuters DataPure Storage has a history of beating estimates and guiding up. Over the last 20 quarters, the company beat revenue 17 quarters by an average of $4.9 million or about 3%. Out of the three times that the company missed on revenues, once was due to supply constraints at one of its distributors and the other two times were due to Average Selling Prices (ASP) declining faster than the company forecasted. Higher-than-expected ASP declines (due to NAND oversupply) is one of the risks of the storage business. The following chart illustrates Pure Storage’s performance on meeting its outlook.Source: Author based on Thomson Reuters DataAfter the company reported F1Q21 (April quarter) results, the company did not provide formal guidance for F2Q21 (July quarter) citing lack of visibility into its pipeline and potential deal closings. Pure Storage also withdrew its full-year guidance, citing increasing uncertainty with macro and loss of visibility into deal closings. However, the company commented that the “sales will be near flat year-over-year and operating profit will be near break-even” and cautioning investors that these comments should not be construed as formal guidance. Given the aforementioned comments, the Street is forecasting revenue to be around $396 million, essentially flat year-over-year, and EPS of a penny. We believe this guidance is conservative and is more than achievable.A number of companies such as Micron reported recently better-than-expected results and also provided guidance that was ahead of estimates. Given this and our belief that storage is less discretionary than many on the street agree, we believe Pure Storage will likely beat estimates when it reports results on August 19th. We also expect the company will desist from providing formal guidance given the uncertainty surrounding the opening of the economy following COVID-19. Since we believe storage is less discretionary than what many people believe, we are incrementally more optimistic on Pure Storage’s outlook. Therefore, our revenue and EPS estimates are ahead of consensus. Here is the chart of our estimates, when compared to the consensus.Source: Author from Thomson Reuters DataPure Storage competes with some of the stalwarts of technology industry such as NetApp, Dell-EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, Hitachi, etc. These companies control vast distribution networks, have incumbency with many of the biggest storage spenders in the industry, and have strong balance sheets. All of the aforementioned companies also generate solid cash flow from operations and are plush with cash. Time and time again, these large companies have resorted to cutting the price of their products and even selling the products at a loss to lock up certain strategic customers. Many of these large companies also use bundling (i.e. bundle servers along with storage) to foreclose opportunities for smaller competitors. Prolonged and indiscriminate price war within the storage industry could have a negative impact on Pure Storage’s revenue and earnings. Any shortfall in revenue and profits due to price wars or other bundling techniques could lead to a stock sell-off.Pure Storage buys raw NAND flash from OEMs such as Micron, Hynix and Samsung. The cost of NAND is dictated by supply-demand dynamics within the industry. During 2019, rapid NAND price declines impacted revenue and margins for the company. The price declines were abrupt and violent and Pure Storage’s ASPs declined faster than what the company was forecasting at that time. Historically ASPs for storage products declined in high single-digits (around 8-9%) year over year. However, during the early part of 2019, ASP declines were in mid-teens impacting revenue and margins.During the times of supply constraints, NAND Flash OEMs first choose to sell available NAND to their larger customers such as Dell/HPE/Apple, etc. before Pure Storage could get some supply. In those instances, Pure Storage would need to buy supply of NAND on the open market at a higher price. While the company can pass along some part of higher NAND cost to customers, it is not always possible for the company to recoup lost profits. Therefore, Pure Storage is at the mercy of its large suppliers of the storage components.Macro and management execution are always a major risk for most companies that have a fairly large perpetual/Capex based revenue streams. Pure Storage derives a majority of revenues by selling storage boxes, which are a capex line item for most enterprises. VMware's quarters are usually back-end loaded - i.e., a significant portion of the business closes during the last two weeks of the quarter. Any deal slippage for any reason during the last weeks of the quarter could impact revenue and earnings, leading to a stock sell-off.Since the company reported results on May 29th, the stock is down 3% and has underperformed the market. The company is expected to report results of F2Q21 on August 19th. We expect Pure Storage to report results largely in line to ahead of Street estimates and issue commentary that is likely positive. We believe any positive commentary on the subscription business and pure-as-a-service offering will be favorably viewed by professional investors. It is highly probable that Pure Storage may not issue formal guidance for the October quarter, but may issue qualitative comments like it had done for the July quarter. Since we are fairly confident on the company’s longer term prospects and the strength of product line, we would be buying ahead of company’s results. For some unforeseen reason, if the stock sells off, we believe it provides an even better buying opportunity. We would be backing up the truck and buying more shares.Net-net, given that the company is considered one of the best new age data storage companies in the industry, and due to reasonable valuation, we would be buying shares of the company on any dips. In the event the company misses estimates or the stock sells off due to other macro factors, we would urge investors to double down and buy more."

After riding a bullish wave of momentum last year on the back of double-digit revenue growth and a software-driven transformation story, the pandemic has sharply damaged Pure Storage's business this year and put a stop to its revenue growth.After reporting second-quarter results, Pure Storage shares slid more than 10%, bringing year-to-date losses to ~15%. Pure Storage is one of the only technology stocks to be down this year, while the NASDAQ is up an unprecedented 28% thus far in 2020.Data by YChartsWith the market continually notching new all-time highs, it's incredibly challenging to find any true value stocks left - least of all those in the tech sector. Though unpopular at the moment, patient investors who can commit to sticking with Pure Storage through the pandemic may get handsomely rewarded. In my view, there are several key pieces of the bullish thesis for Pure Storage that investors should remind themselves of, especially as the stock is trading so cheaply right now:Go against the current and buy this stock while others are dumping it.Let's now review Pure Storage's most recent quarterly results in greater detail. While of course the print was less-than-ideal, there were also some bright spots to call out that in my view invalidate the ~10% crash post-earnings.The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Pure Storage Q2 resultsSource: Pure Storage Q2 earnings releaseThe bad news is that Pure Storage's revenue growth cranked to a near-halt this quarter. Revenue of $403.7 million grew only 2% y/y, which was slightly better than the $395.3 million (approximately flat) revenue that Wall Street was expecting, but decelerating ten points versus Q1's 12% y/y growth rate - which, in turn, decelerated five points from Q4's 17% y/y growth rate.There is a glimmer of good news here, though. As expected, Pure Storage's overall revenue growth was pulled down by a decline in product revenue. This makes sense as companies aren't exactly rushing to build out backend tech investments during the pandemic. Pure Storage's subscription revenue, however, grew 37% y/y in the quarter - and given this is the company's top focus, we like the fact that Pure Storage is still continuing to grow its recurring revenue at a healthy pace.Sadly, even that boost in subscription revenue wasn't able to counteract a slight decline in gross margins, which clocked in at 69.8% this quarter - slightly better than last year's 69.4%, but down 210bps sequentially from Q1 (last year's Q1-to-Q2 margin seasonality, meanwhile, had been positive). Figure 2. Pure Storage margin trendsSource: Pure Storage Q2 earnings deckStill, we do have to put this into perspective: for a company that sells a mix of hardware and software, the fact that Pure Storage's gross margins are still clinging in the ~70% puts it only slightly lower than most pure software companies in the 70-80% range (all in pro forma terms). Now we can move on to the positive points in the quarter that, in my view, were overlooked. In spite of Pure Storage's decision not to provide formal Q3 guidance, CFO Kevan Krysler still noted that the company still expects strong growth in subscription services through the pandemic. Per his remarks on the Q2 earnings call:Another big highlight: official Q1 market share results published by IDC show Pure Storage as one of the only storage vendors gaining market share. In other words - the pandemic is hitting all storage vendors hard, but at least Pure Storage's piece of the pie is rising. The company gained 0.7% of market share in Q1, at the expense of NetApp (-1.6%) and HP Enterprise (HPE) (-1.1%).Figure 3. Pure Storage market share trendsSource: Pure Storage Q2 earnings deckWe also like the fact that in spite of weaker revenue and a sequential slip in gross margins, Pure Storage's savings on the operating cost side helped the company to still grow free cash flow by 29% y/y to $25.7 million in the quarter, also representing a 140bps increase in FCF margins.Figure 4. Pure Storage FCF trendsSource: Pure Storage Q2 earnings releaseWith shares of Pure Storage trading at <2x FY22 revenues (compared to its usual trend of trading in the mid ~2x range), I think Pure Storage is a very strong ""buy the dip"" opportunity. Looking longer term, if Pure Storage's claim that it can deliver the superior quality of flash storage at lower prices is true, the company has much more to gain in terms of market share and growth. Stay long here."
4351378,103480,2020-06-01T16:01:57-04:00,"Shares of Pure Storage have rallied only modestly despite recently releasing strong results to a coronavirus-impacted Q1.As a company that sells primarily products and not subscriptions, Pure Storage's revenue deceleration of five points in Q1 came in harder than for most other tech companies.However, Pure Storage also delivered nearly ten points of operating margin gains, and bookings growth clocked in at 24% y/y.Pure Storage also believes that the pandemic has increased customers' interest in Pure-as-a-Service, allowing Pure Storage to build up its recurring revenue base.Pure Storage also has a substantial ~$1.3 billion cash balance ($0.8 billion in net cash).","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Pure Storage (PSTG), the flash storage company that is attempting to re-invent itself as a SaaS subscription offering, remains one of my favorite value stocks to invest in during the pandemic. The company tests well against two important criteria: one, despite the near-term revenue hits, the coronavirus pandemic is actually a long-term boost to Pure Storage's technology and demand; and second, the stock still remains below comp valuations.In light of the impact of the coronavirus, Pure Storage recently released strong Q1 results that smashed Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue growth decelerated, as expected, but Pure Storage more than made up for that with a huge corresponding boost in operating margins and cash flow. Still, shares have barely moved since:Data by YChartsStay long here - there's a plethora to like about Pure Storage at current levels.The key thing investors should know is that Pure Storage believes the current pandemic to be an accelerant in the company's long-term goal of becoming a subscription-oriented company. Flash storage has long been a product-oriented business: companies buy the storage units they need, and the only recurring revenue that they generate is perhaps a support contract to service that previous purchase. The coronavirus, however, has increased the need for businesses to be agile and to rapidly scale up and down their infrastructure. As such, on the Q1 earnings call, CEO Charles Giancarlo noted that Pure-as-a-Service had a record quarter:The company began offering a ""first three months free"" promo in Q1 for customers signing up for a contract of longer than 12 months, which is certain to drive additional demand. The reason this subscription transition is important is because, as Pure Storage continues to build up its recurring revenue base (currently only about one-third of the company's overall revenues), in addition to its high software-like gross margins, investors will begin to see Pure Storage more as a software company and less like a commodity hardware provider. Right now, Pure Storage is sitting between the two, and being seen as a software company will provide the multiples expansion that will give shareholders double-digit returns.The other point that investors should be aware of is that Pure Storage currently has a valuation below that of most similarly-growing software companies. At present share prices near $17, Pure Storage has a market cap of $4.49 billion. After we net off the $1.27 billion of cash on Pure Storage's balance sheet against $484 million of convertible debt, we arrive at an enterprise value of $3.70 billion. Pure Storage has withdrawn its guidance for the current year amid demand volatility, but Wall Street consensus has a target of $1.78 billion for the year. We note that this consensus estimate is a tad conservative, representing ~8% y/y growth versus Pure Storage's 12% y/y growth in Q1 (and the very real possibility that demand will re-accelerate in the back half of FY21). Still, even if we apply this low consensus estimate, Pure Storage's valuation is only 2.1x EV/FY21 revenues.That's substantially below (one or two turns) where other ""cheap"" software stocks that are expected to grow in the mid-teens are trading:Data by YChartsNote that, with Pure Storage's Q1 pro forma gross margin clocking in at 73%, there's virtually no difference between Pure Storage and other software companies, so continuing to value Pure Storage as a pure hardware company makes no sense. The only differentiator now is Pure Storage's ability to become a majority-recurring revenue company, which the current pandemic is a catalyst for.Let's also conservatively assume Pure Storage can generate three points of OCF margin growth this year to 14.5% (versus prior-year margins of 11.5%; 1Q21 cash flow margins are already up 750bps). This gives us a $258.1 million operating cash flow estimate for FY21, applying the same consensus revenue estimate. This indicates Pure Storage is also trading at 14.2x EV/FY21 OCF, showcasing that it looks like a value stock from a profitability perspective as well.In my view, as the subscription/recurring story continues to build throughout the year, Pure Storage should be able to ""catch up"" to comps like Box and hit 3.5x EV/FY21 revenues, implying a price target of $26 and ~51% upside to current levels.Let's also dive through Pure Storage's most recent quarterly results in greater detail. See the earnings summary below:Figure 1. Pure Storage 1Q21 resultsSource: Pure Storage 1Q21 earnings releaseAs previously mentioned, revenues did decelerate this quarter, down to 12% y/y growth (five points weaker than last quarter's 17% y/y growth). On the bright side, however, this was significantly better than the $349.3 million (+7% y/y) that Wall Street had penciled in (and perhaps after fully digesting this quarter's beat, FY21 consensus will also shift upward from 8% y/y growth). In addition, Pure Storage's subscription revenues showed much stronger 37% y/y growth to $120.2 million, showing barely any deceleration from Q4's 41% y/y pace of growth. The overall mix of subscription revenues, which investors are also tracking closely, rose six points to 33% in Q1 versus 27% in the prior year quarter.Management's commentary on the exact impact of the coronavirus on Pure Storage's sales was actually rather mixed. From a total bookings perspective (that is, the full dollar amount of deals that were signed in the quarter but not necessarily recognized as current-quarter revenue), Pure Storage actually benefited from customers potentially pulling in demand to satisfy needs linked to a remote work shift, with bookings up +24% y/y and much stronger than revenue growth. This bodes well for revenue growth for the remainder of the year. Note that when Pure Storage began the year, prior to any known impact of the coronavirus, the company had only projected bookings growth of ~20% y/y. At the same time, management has also called out uncertain demand and some customers delaying their purchasing timelines. CFO Kevan Krysler's prepared remarks help to shed some qualitative light on this impact:In any case, Pure Storage's revenue deceleration was also offset by strong margin gains. Thanks largely to lower sales and marketing costs stemming from a stoppage of travel, Pure Storage managed to boost pro forma operating margins by 8.1% to -1.5%, or virtually breakeven - despite the fact that Q1 is typically Pure Storage's worst quarter for profitability.Figure 2. Pure Storage operating margin trendsSource: Pure Storage Q1 earnings deckDitto for cash flow - Q1 is typically Pure Storage's lowest cash flow quarter because the company is moving past the bookings-heavy year-end, but this time around, the company managed ~5x growth in operating cash flows to $35.1 million. Operating cash flow margins jumped from 2.0% in 1Q20 to 9.5% this quarter, while free ash flow also swung from -$17.7 million to +$11.3 million this quarter.Figure 3. Pure Storage cash flow trendsSource: Pure Storage Q1 earnings deckPure Storage's strong profitability trends are yet another differentiator for the company against other tech stocks that makes its below-market ~2x forward revenue multiple untenable.Investors currently still have an opportunity to buy Pure Storage while it's in limbo between being treated as a hardware company and software company by the markets. Strong 37% y/y subscription growth and an ever-growing mix of subscription revenues heavily favors Pure Storage's eventual shift to being a majority recurring-revenue company and earning the richer valuation multiple associated with SaaS. And so far, despite revenue deceleration in Q1, Pure Storage's bookings growth suggests that the hit from the coronavirus this year won't be too bad. Stay long here."

The valuation has already baked in the weakness in the storage space. There is a wide execution window for Pure Storage to surprise the market in the near term. As a result, I have a bullish rating on Pure Storage's valuation.Source: Call SlidePure Storage recorded revenue growth of 15% last quarter. The company is after a rapid market share expansion in a storage space that is recording weaker pricing power by enterprises. Pure Storage is differentiating itself via its cloud and AI-first approach. Though the storage space still faces a broad market drag, its shift towards cloud deployments keeps driving near-term growth.Pure Storage is guiding for revenue of $1.64-1.65 billion (approx. 20% revenue growth) in 2020. This will be driven by demand for its shared storage service solutions and added TAM (total addressable market) in cloud storage.Its expanded TAM means there is a wider run rate ahead of it. As a result, I remain bullish on demand for Pure Storage's solutions in the near term.Management expects pricing to moderate in the near term as FlashArray//C picks up the near-term softness. Remember, FlashArray//C is a cost-competitive alternative to FlashArray//X as reviews on TrustRadius and ITCentralStation indicate the pricing of PSTG's offerings are on the high side.There isn't ample evidence that FlashArray//C, Pure as a Service, or Cloud Block Store will have a needle-moving impact on revenue in the near term. Though, they've helped accelerate Pure Storage's process of getting a foot into the door on key RFPs.Near term, FlashArray//X and FlashBlade remain the key revenue driver. Until FlashArray//C becomes a significant portion of revenue, there will be immense pressure on its shared storage solutions to drive growth. The recent revenue miss, which was driven by not so favorable macro and pricing pressure, is a harbinger of what to expect near term.Lastly, Pure Storage's balance sheet is attractive. The company has a cash balance of $1.24 billion and a total debt of $596 million, giving it a debt to equity ratio of 77%. As an investor, I will prefer to wait for a meaningful ramp in demand for its new offerings before giving the business a bullish rating.The storage space is facing a sector-wide macro headwind from the US trade war and pricing pressure as enterprises demand an improved total cost of ownership on their storage solutions.Source: (Conference Call Transcript)While Pure Storage's cloud/SaaS approach is compelling, the sector-wide pricing pressure hasn't shielded it from guiding softly. Soft guidance for a fast-growth company is a harbinger of a tough execution horizon. Competitors have the same comment about the headwinds. As a result, I am not confident in Pure Storage's macro and competitive positioning.The pricing and macro weaknesses in the storage space are already baked into Pure Storage's modest valuation. At 3x P/S (TTM), Pure Storage is reasonably valued.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)As it stands, investors only enjoy the growth quant factor if they acquire some position in Pure Storage. Pure Storage is not profitable, and its operating cash flow is a function of stock-based compensation. NetApp (NTAP) provides better exposure to key investing factors, given that both companies are exposed to the same macro and pricing issues.Source: Seeking AlphaPure Storage's poor ROIC means it is reliant mostly on its growth factor to drive demand. Until other investing factors improve, Pure Storage will be vulnerable to the mania of growth investors.Pure Storage's double-digit growth suggests little consumer risk. However, cloud platforms continue to dabble in the storage space thereby raising its competitive risk factor while weakening demand. According to the last 10-Q:As discussed earlier, execution risk depends on management's ability to improve ROIC. The recent macro and pricing volatility makes this a tougher feat to achieve. As a result, the investor-driven risk is bubbling.The risk-reward highlights strong positioning for a sharp sell-off if its revenue doesn't meet near-term guidance. Unless you have a strong risk appetite, you should consider trimming your position.I don't expect a rebound in price action until demand from FlashArray//C becomes significant.

4287970,98236,2019-08-26T14:41:21-04:00,"Pure achieved strong operating results in its fiscal Q2.The company guided down revenue growth, primarily because of commodity cost declines and in the interest of prudence.The company did not guide down EPS.Bookings growth, not a metric used by the company, showed growth of 33% and accelerated from Q1 growth.The company accelerated its market share gains from Q1 and has broken into the top 5 external storage vendors, tying IBM according to IDC.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more here.Pure Storage (PSTG) posted impressive results in the July ending quarter. The shares appreciated a bit more than 15% in the wake of the earnings release - and that result included the selling tsunami on Friday. This seemed, at least to this writer, to be more of a relief rally, than a wholesale commitment to the shares. The shares have lost one-third of their value in the past 4 months and are essentially flat year to date. Despite the low value of the shares, the short interest had been a not inconsequential 8% at the end of July, and presumably, a significant component of the buying on Thursday was driven by short covering.Pure Storage is a hardware company, and many investors disdain hardware companies as potential investments. And of course, it is a storage company, and storage companies are supposed to be cyclically correlated to a high degree. I will not suggest that there is no truth to the conventional wisdom. But drilling down, even a bit, suggests that Pure is a highly disruptive vendor with a culture that has developed innovation and market share gains over its history. The combination of low valuation, coupled with continued market share gains and a high level of margin opportunity, encapsulates the case to be made for the shares.Like most IT equities - most equities in general really - Pure is subject to market upsets that have nothing to do with changes in the outlook for the company or with most anything else for that matter. I am not going to try to address the multiple surveys about IT hardware spending and its correlation to economic cycles. The uses to which these surveys have been put to support investment advice come close to taxing the credulity of objective readers. And I am not going to try to address whether or not there is a recession on the horizon, or whether tweet storms of our President or anodyne pronouncements from Chairman Powell have much lasting impact on the economy and thus on Pure's valuation. I have my point of view; there are many others, some of which are discussed at some length in various articles on SA and elsewhere. This is an article about Pure, and I think opinions formed by trying to correlate the performance of this company to cyclical macro issues is not really that helpful.Part of the reason for that is that Pure remains a very small company in its space. Pure has a market share of about 4% - perhaps a bit more or a bit more in this latest quarter - for external storage. The company can overcome cyclical headwinds to a certain degree by taking market share and through innovating and developing new product categories.The latest data from IDC, linked here, that the external enterprise storage market was more or less flat last quarter. That said, the all-flash market (AFA), the space in which Pure competes, grew 17%, And Pure has other solution sets that provide it with further growth opportunities.I have recommended Pure to my Ticker Target investment community for quite some time and have recommended it as well on SA. Thus far, those recommendations haven't worked out. Although the last two quarterly results were judged wanting by the market, there is a bit of sense of vindication that these results were greeted with modest enthusiasm. There was one analyst at a 2nd or 3rd tier firm who raised his rating on the shares; that was balanced by loads of skepticism on the part of many analysts, along with some price target decreases.Despite the decent reaction to Pure's quarterly results, the shares are still selling at what many would consider to be bargain basement valuations. Pure is a hardware company - although much of its value add comes from its software component. Hardware companies, no matter what their attributes, will never enjoy the valuation of software companies. That said, however, at this point, Pure shares are selling at 1.7X EV/S based on my forward 12-month revenue estimate. At that level, the shares are valued at the absolute bottom of the mid-20% growth cohort - the company has forecast growth for the year of about 24%. The company has been able to reach non-GAAP profitability, and its industry-leading gross margins, in part supported by a very high ratio of research and development spending that supports product differentiation, is a strategy that when successfully executed can lead to very high profit margins - see examples in the ratios of Atlassian (TEAM) and Veeva (VEEV) as analogs.Pure's free cash flow is starting to ramp materially. Primarily because of the rapid growth in deferred revenue. We are projecting a 6% free cash flow margin for the current year, and that is about average for the company's growth cohort. The company is likely to lift its free cash flow margin substantially in the coming years, as it gains operating leverage, and as deferred revenue growth persists at substantial levels. We think free cash flow margins can reach double digits sometime in the next year or so.It is my opinion, based on years of looking at the storage space, that trying to pick inflection points and in turn driving investment analysis based on that kind of forecasting is a fool's errand. No one has ever gotten this right over an extended period and through a variety of up and down cycles. My investment judgement is not particularly focused on NAND pricing expectations although they are an important component of what determines reported revenue growth.What impressed me most about this quarter, as reported, was that regardless of headwinds from the macro - if such, headwinds are real and not excuses on the part of competitors - was the cadence and scale of new customer acquisition. 450 new customers in the quarter - a record for Q2 and a 50% increase in the larger deals from Q1, coupled with a 47% year-on-year increase in deferred revenues. These metrics had been somewhat disappointing in the prior quarter; management suggested that its remediation efforts discussed last quarter were working and the statistics presented seemed to validate that contention.I am a great believer that the best way to find the right companies in the tech space in which to invest is more a function of market share gains and losses than any other particular metric, and beyond that, the ability of market share to drive margins. In the storage space, or so it seems to this writer, Pure is and has been the leading share gainer for some time now in the Flash space, and the gross margins it has been able to produce are far beyond those of its competitors. I think when readers try to sum up the balance of pros and cons in evaluating Pure as an investment, it is these two factors, i.e. market share gains, and gross margin levels, that are most encouraging.Pure's results belied the theory that macro headwinds have made it impossible for storage vendors to grow revenues in the face of what are perceived to be strong cyclical headwinds. The company did reduce guidance forward revenue guidance, partially because of prudence and partially because of the NAND pricing cycle. Still, at the growth trough forecast next quarter, the company is expecting to see revenue increase by about 18%, and its current forecast implies re-accelerating growth to 20% in Q4. Management implied, but did not explicitly state, that with an inflection near in terms of NAND pricing, and with significant new product announcements to come next month, it would be likely that results for fiscal 2021 would show growth re-acceleration, above the 20% currently shown by the First Call consensus.Some of the sub-headline numbers seem even more impressive. At least to me, the jump in bookings, which grew by 33% in the quarter, was more than solid. That metric is a marked acceleration from the percentage growth last quarter when bookings grew 31% and suggests that market share gains are accelerating. It is worth noting, I believe, that the headline growth numbers for Pure's revenue growth significantly understate Pure's actual growth, as increasing levels of the company's products are sold on a subscription basis.Services revenue growth in the quarter, which includes product subscriptions grew by 43%, and by 9% sequentially. At this point, Pure does not breakout revenues from product subscriptions from maintenance, but it seems likely that the growth in product, as a component of the services line, is growing rapidly with strong acceptance of the company's cloud data services, and its Evergreen Storage Service (E2S).Pure shares have been controversial, and many analysts do not focus their attention on market share and margins, and focus their attention on the overall storage cycle, and the latest potential macro headwinds. Pure has been gaining market share for years at this point, and by all accounts, it continues to do so. It is not gaining share because of pricing - its competitors - charge less per terabyte than it does, and it wound up with record gross margins exceeding 70% last quarter. In fact, the price itself is rarely the deciding factor in large enterprise decisions. It is one reason, I believe, why it has been difficult for legacy vendors to effectively compete against Pure and why concerns of competitive pressures that are regularly written about in analysis are probably overdone.I have linked here to a recent study that elaborates on how users ought to evaluate the cost of storage. For a variety of reasons, Pure usually winds up showing well when large enterprises conduct a bake-off using the factors cited in this study. The study suggests, rather explicitly, that storage is not the fungible commodity that many investors believe is the case.To prepare a recommendation for the shares that basically ignores that point and focuses instead on so-called macro headwinds is doing most investors a significant disservice. It is likely that Pure would be growing significantly faster than it has forecast if there weren't some macro headwinds, and I would like to catch the inflection point precisely. But as that is unlikely, other than by chance, I think just catching market share inflection can provide readers/investors with positive alpha.I am not going to try to list all of the specific reasons why Pure has been successful in growing its market share consistently. Simplicity, performance, reliability are all factors that seem to have contributed to its success. I would make the observation that some of its success has come at the expense of competitors who seemingly have had problems that involve support, product strategy and sales execution. I have linked here to the latest Gartner review of the flash storage. Pure, as has been the case, continues to lead in evaluations.Another set of factors to note is the advantages Pure has recently enjoyed because of the rapid transition to what is called NVMe. Note that Gartner estimates that NVMe, an area Pure pioneered is showing explosive growth. And note as well that external NVMe over Fabrics, another focus of Pure, is also showing exceptional strength. Part of Pure's market share success has been that it has offered products that turn out to be in the mainstream of industry growth with more emphasis than its competitors, and it usually winds up with a first mover advantage.I have followed the storage market as an analyst since the days when EMC was a hot growth company, and my experience with enterprise storage goes back further than that - loathe though I might be to admit that. Storage demand has seen strong increases for many decades now, and it continues to do so. Last quarter, again according to IDC, capacity growth for storage grew at a 14% rate, and it seems likely that capacity growth for AFA grew at over 30%. Price declines, which are expected as part of the paradigm of this market account for the difference between revenue growth and capacity growth. So long as applications built on deep learning/AI/IoT are being built, the demand for storage will grow at very high rates. For the most part, the digital transformations being so heavily promoted and bought these days require substantial amounts of storage for their consummation.There is a cyclical component to the growth of demand, and beyond that, storage consumption can vary both randomly and based on how ""hot"" users want to run their systems, but I believe that secular trends are far greater demand drivers than cyclical perturbations. There have been many technology cycles in which one company or another leap-frogged the leaders and gained share. What is interesting about Pure is that its ability to gain share against much larger rivals dates back a decade at this point. It seemingly has evolved a culture that fosters innovation - I will be particularly interested in seeing whether the announcements the company makes at its Accelerate Meeting Sept 15th will be such as to the move the needlePure has been on the leading edge of offering all-flash storage now for several years. And all-flash is obviously replacing spinning disc and hybrid storage and will continue to do so until those two technologies make it to museums. Pure has a significantly higher Net Promoter score than competitors, and that is one factor in its market share gains. Another factor is its deployment of NVMe which has enabled it to improve the performance it can offer and change some of the perceived fungibility of storage. I think the opportunity that Pure has to use what it calls Flash Blade along with AI in its Rapid Restore technology is quite large and at the moment, it is a unique offering that involves a partnership with Splunk's (SPLK) SmartStore that was very successful last quarter. The TAM of the back-up storage market, relative to Pure's size is one factor in suggesting that the company's growth could readily return to the 30% area.The company has a variety of partnerships with major software vendors, that extend the reach of its offerings and are likely a factor in allowing its relative sales performance to continue to outpace competitors.Needless to say, all the different vendors spin market share data and have offered different explanations for their performance. The results of NetApp are quite difficult to explain, absent acknowledging some significant issues in ""go-to-market"" and technology. The results of Dell, which continues the process of sorting and rationalizing product families, might also be somewhat difficult to explain. IBM's results, which show substantial share losses, are clearly a function of 'go-to-market"" problems compounded by failure to offer specific feature/function.There is a strong industry trend amongst all storage vendors who are moving to offer subscription models of various kinds. At some point, all vendors are going to have to offer their solutions in the Cloud and to offer a unified subscription model. I don't think it is possible to forecast the cadence of this shift but it is accelerating. Pure, perhaps because of its size, has been a leader in this trend, and part of its market share gains relate to the success of its subscription offers. The Evergreen Storage Service (ES2) is already seeing quite significant acceptance, and the company called out a couple of major transitions to that offering in its conference call script.This is not a commercial for Pure, and it obviously has had its own issues in terms of sales execution in the recent past. But looking holistically, its share gains extending over several years and its very high net promoter score, coupled with very high gross margins, suggest that it really is able to offer differentiated solutions. The basic reason to buy Pure shares is that it has had and continues to have a record of offering differentiated products and differentiated services that have contributed to high gross margins and market share gains. The storage market is not dying and will, over time, regardless of the Cloud, show substantial growth and Pure should grow its share within a growing category.Pure has reached profitability at this point, although its overall operating margins have not yet reached levels of its much larger competitors. The company reported 70% gross margins last quarter, a record for the company and obviously an anomaly. The high gross margins relate to the disparate course of the pricing of NAND vs. the pricing of storage. I have linked here to a study that summarizes NAND price changes. It seems likely, based on this article and the commentary of Pure, that NAND prices should stabilize and at some point, as demand continues to rise, prices for NAND may show an upward bias.Pure's target business model has long been to achieve gross margins in the range of 66-69%. That, in itself, is significantly greater than gross margins for any other enterprise storage vendor. It is important to note that demand elasticity for storage is quite high, although probably impossible to measure. That is particularly true for AFA, as it displaces spinning disc - the relationship between price of the two technologies is key to the cadence of displacement. In any event, as the price of NAND has fallen, Pure and its competitors have decreased their prices in order to capture demand elasticity while maintaining gross margins. Given that it typically takes a quarter or two for accelerated demand elasticity to kick in, this is part of the reason why overall AFA revenue growth is somewhat muted and is why, to an extent, Pure has reduced its revenue growth forecast.Last quarter, Pure notably moderated the growth in operating expenses. Overall, GAAP operating expenses rose 28% year on year, a bit less than revenues, but rose only 6.3% sequentially compared to revenues which rose by 21% sequentially, and bookings which rose faster still. On a non-GAAP basis, the company was able to report operating results just above break-even levels. This result was considerably above its prior forecast operating margin forecast which had been -3% at the midpoint, and this upside mainly related to the 400 basis point improvement in gross margins last quarter compared to Q1.The company has continued to invest heavily in research and development - spending more than 25% of revenues on research and development is a substantial outlier for a hardware company of this scale. Just by comparison, NetApp (NTAP), which is more than 3 times the size of this company in terms of total revenues, spends just double the amount of research and development dollars, or 17% of revenues - and that in a quarter with a substantial revenue miss that drove up percentage research and development spend. Sales and marketing costs rose 29% year on year, this past quarter and rose 11% sequentially reflecting some of the remediation activities that the company had mentioned in its prior quarterly call.At this point, the company is maintaining its margin forecast for the full year, despite the reduction in the revenue guide. The company had already started to moderate the growth in employment in Q2, with a headcount increase of less than 5% sequentially, so it will not be squeezed to accomplish margin objectives in the last months of the year. The current First Call consensus estimates match company guidance, with EPS for the year projected to be $.23.Most analysts are forecasting substantial growth in non-GAAP margins in fiscal year 2021. Indeed, for the first time, it will be possible to speak of P/E as a valuation metric - the shares are now selling at about 34X estimated non-GAAP EPS. As mentioned, I prefer to look at free cash flow, which is likely to reach a 9-10% margin next year as deferred revenue growth from the company's E2S offering continues to drive bookings growth at rates noticeably above the revenue increase. The company's free cash flow generation has reached the level at which the company has authorized a modest share buy-back. While the share buyback, which represents just about 3.6% of current market cap, is minor, it does, I believe, represent a level of management optimism that is not reflected in the current valuation of the shares.While stock-based comp. at 15% of revenues is not an outlier for a tech company, it was more than twice the level of free cash flow last quarter. On the other stock-based comp grew less than 10% year over year and just a few percent sequentially.Pure has attractive margin opportunities that are expressed in part in the consensus EPS estimates for its fiscal 2021. The combination of margin growth and market share gains, coupled with rock-bottom valuation, makes Pure shares a prime GARP pick in the IT firmament, and that should spell positive alpha in the coming year."
4339455,98236,2020-04-23T12:44:51-04:00,Pure Storage shares have been eviscerated or worse long before the advent of the upside down economics of the COVID-19 era.They have not seen a material bounce back since the March lows.The company has both outgrown its peers and has a dramatically greater gross margin than its competitors.The company has converted about 25% of its business to subscriptions.The company has achieved significant differentiation in its offering from those of most storage vendors.,"This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.The last few weeks have seen a strong rally from the depths of despair induced by the COVID-19 panic. Some commentators have made the case that the market has come too far, too fast, or that individual stocks have rebounded without much in the way of operational data to support their moves. This kind of sentiment extends far beyond just the pages of SA; the writer for Briefing.Com has been sounding his alarm bell for the last few hundred points.I am not going to write about my market views in that whatever I think is neither unique nor of all that much importance. For what little it is worth, I think many observers still want to fight the Fed, never the wisest of long-term strategies. And it ought to be obvious to most that the fiscal spigot is turned on full bore with a level of fiscal stimulus far beyond that seen in the financial crisis a dozen years. No budget hawks this time around.The market is discounting the future and has tended to disregard the ugly present. I think there is a fair measure of validity in that assessment, particularly given the level of quantitative easing that the Fed has introduced into the market. It is just hard for an old monetarist, as this writer is, to disregard such actions and ignore the normal consequences of such aggressive Fed policies. But I will leave that debate to others, interesting as it may be.I am, of course, concerned about the devastation in the oil patch, and in the hospitality/transportation space. As a former resident of Texas and Oklahoma, I worry about the 2nd and 3rd order effects of sub-$20 oil. (This is not an article about oil pricing or the lack of storage in Cushing, OK-so I will stick to a sub-$20 handle on the price of oil regardless of the daily quotes for WTI) That will be a harder problem to remediate, and yet when people return to work, they will return to burning fuel and taking trips.This is an article primarily about Pure Storage (PSTG). I have written several articles in the past regarding Pure, and honestly the shares have been a disappointment. The disappointments in the past year were primarily a function of issues with regards to component pricing. And just as those issues started to abate, the COVID-19 crisis emerged to bend the demand curve down.The basic issue for investors now, given the very compressed valuation, is what kind of influence the current state of the economy might have both on demand for Pure's solutions, but how that has and will fit into the overall market for infrastructure hardware and software. Infrastructure can mean different things to different people. I might suggest that some of the observability solutions are what I might define as infrastructure-but at this point, the market has differentiated that business component from storage and converged infrastructure.I would suggest that the relatively weak recovery seen in Pure's share price has little to do with any specific expectations for company operational performance and quite a lot to do with investor concerns regarding the infrastructure space. The other day, Goldman Sachs published a note downgrading Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and double downgrading Nutanix (NTNX) amongst other recommendations. The basis for these downgrades was the results of its proprietary survey of various aspects of demand for IT products and services.The survey, which has been taken at various times over a 16 year span, said that demand for infrastructure solutions had plunged at a greater rate in March than during the financial crisis. I continue to be mystified as to why it surprises some to hear that March demand for tech products showed very substantial declines. Shutting the economy will probably not be seen as a signal for enterprises to go out and accelerate capital equipment purchases. Just the logistics involved in signing contracts without face to face negotiation, and then delivering products is somewhat daunting, although, Pure, at least has a cloud offering that can be activated without any physical intervention. The fact that the demand decline took pace in a single month… well gee, the economy was closed in a single month. What might have been surprising, would have been if results of the survey were actually different and less negative than those that GS published. The GS report said that its purchases component fell to an index value of negative 11.8, lower than the value of -8/-9 observed into the financial crisis.When Pure reported its results at the end of February, the company had forecast fiscal Q1 revenues of $365 million with gross margins of about 70%. It was also forecasting full year revenues of $1.9 billion with expected gross margins of 70%. Currently the Q1 revenue consensus forecast, as shown on First Call has fallen to $353 million, with a low estimate of $313 million. The full year consensus revenue has now fallen to $1.78 billion with a low estimate of $1.43 billion. My guess is that in a situation such as this, investor expectations have probably gone to the lower levels, and that not all analysts have revamped their models in the absence of any guidance from the company. In preparing my valuation table, I chose to use current year revenue estimate of $1.425 billion, down about 13% year on year and actually lower than any published forecast I have seen. That leaves the forward EV/S estimate at below 2, far below average for the company's likely long-term growth cohort.The issue, therefore, isn't specifically valuation, but investor perceptions as to how a recovery scenario might play out for Pure, along with many other vendors of physical infrastructure. Pure shares hit a low in the initial COVID-19 panic of just below $8 on March 18th. Although the recovery from trough to current of more than 50% looks significant, it has left the shares with a loss of 25% YTD, and of 43% over the past year, far below the average for the tech stock performance-IGV index. The IGV is actually up 1% YTD and is up 10% over the past year.Pure shares had a difficult time last year as investors were unable to positively evaluate the trend of NAND prices which drove down revenue growth, although not gross margin dollars. Just as that trend started to abate, and reported revenue growth started to resume levels consistent with the past, the impact of the economy on demand for storage spooked investors and has led to the significant downgrade in expectations for both revenues and earnings seen in the trends on the consensus. I think that the negative news about demand for storage has already been factored into the very compressed valuation and share price for Pure. Basically, investors in aggregate and some cohort of analysts have arrived at a conclusion that not only is the current demand situation compressed, but that recovery will be slow and halting, rather like this spring season in New York.I think to refute that contention, a bit of history is in order-the conclusions I saw being drawn by GS are unlikely, and indeed as I pointed out to subscribers to my Ticker Target investment service, the GS read-through is attempting to find correlations where none logically exist.When the financial crisis struck in 2008, it was focused on financial institutions-the entire banking system was at risk of implosion. That was a very serious impact for storage vendors; at the time financial services were in excess of 15% of the user base for storage vendors and were a larger percent of revenue. In particular, the bursting of the housing bubble had an outsized impact on demand for storage because of the volume of mortgage documentation that had to be stored electronically. When the housing market collapsed, away went much of the demand for storage. And with the extremely dire financial condition of many banks and insurance companies, demand for storage was further impacted.It would take more than 2 years for those impacts to start to ease. Sadly for the storage companies, about the time they started to see recovery from the impacts of financial crisis and the debacle in the housing market, they were hit severely by the advent of cloud based storage from Amazon (AMZN), primarily. Just how much storage moved to the cloud from on-prem is difficult to determine precisely, but demand growth was severely truncated.By early 2016, the storage market started to open up and all of the vendors enjoyed some significant growth. Part of that was the emergence of Flash as the technology of choice for most new applications. Needless to say, this was the background for Pure's takeoff-it always has had the position of offering leadership technologies in flash and it succeeded in moving beyond selling point solutions to achieving recognition in large enterprises.Storage can be economically sensitive, and demands can be cyclical. By 2019 the larger mainline storage vendors started to experience macro headwinds in terms of demand growth. It had really took until the turn of 2018-19 for the emergence of hybrid cloud architectures and for storage companies to offer their solutions on the physical platforms of AWS, Azure (MSFT) and GCP (GOOG). Overall, the storage company's enjoyed significant growth between 2016-18, with cyclical elements hurting demand growth last year. During the 2016-18 period, Pure enjoyed revenue growth in the mid-30% range and that continued until the January 2019 quarter when a variety of events resulted in 28% growth.Pure continued to grow throughout 2019, albeit at rates in the 20% range. It was able to grow by taking market share from the 4 largest storage vendors including Dell (DELL), NetApp (NTAP), IBM (IBM) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company (HPE). In addition, the fact that it has always offered just all-flash storage, and all flash storage has continued to achieve revenue growth despite the cyclical downturn in hybrid and spinning disc arrays. Another element of its growth last year came because Pure started offering some differentiated types that are not available from other storage vendors. I will cover that in detail below. It also offers a broad SaaS consumption model, and it packages some of its arrays in a unique fashion that has yet to be emulated by competitors.In trying to forecast a recovery scenario from these current depressed times it is, I think, important not to import false analogs or to try to force current conditions to fit within a scenario that was in its own way unique and which is more than a decade past. Use cases have morphed dramatically… as storage got cheaper last year that new price point inevitably spawned a host of new uses for flash storage that couldn't have existed in the past. I do not know what the elasticity coefficient for storage might be. The fact that I have been looking at that kind of data for more than 50 years now, and still do not have a metric might suggest that quantification is not something to be found at the corner drug store. What I have learned in that period, however, is that with an appropriate lag for development, lower storage prices mean higher storage volumes.I really think that investors might take a step back from their panic/obsession about how the economy will have a longer term impact on the storage business and try to develop a more nuanced set of assumptions about what the storage market will look like as the economy reopens and as users look to further digital transformations, and look to AI to build new applications that are optimized by use of that technology. It is my contention that the best investment vehicle for investing in these trends is Pure Storage, at a valuation that seemingly ignores its past achievements and future prospects.As most readers will know, IBM announced its results Monday evening while I was preparing this article. I do not propose to evaluate IBM's results in this article-it deserves and will get separate treatment. Obviously, they were disappointing, although not unsurprising elements, in the report that are weighing on the shares.But I will mention that the company reported some unexpected positive results in its storage area. I would be hesitant to entirely read through the specifics of IBM's storage demand as a commentary on the state of overall storage industry demand, or demand for Pure's specific products. IBM is in the midst of a ""Z"" mainframe cycle that often generates storage demand as a concomitant piece of new mainframe installations. But I do think that the ability of IBM to close storage deals at the end of the quarter is a positive sign that the storage business has not dried up and blown away. I am not expecting some great growth story from Pure when it reports results this quarter, but I am hopeful that the results will prove ""better than feared"" and that the recovery period for storage will see a swifter cadence of growth than most are currently expecting.Pure reported its results on the cusp of the economic impacts of COVID-19. At the end of February it has seen no impact on its business from the effects of the virus on the economy. But it described the situation as fluid and told auditors that its forecast did not include any potential impact from the effect of COVID-19 on the economy. Rather than bemoaning the fact that Pure is going to report at least two, and possibly three quarters of non-existent growth and perhaps somewhat pressured margins, I think it makes better sense to look at how the company was tracking before the disaster of the COVID-19 pandemic overtook the overall economy.Generally, of course, I like to look forward and not backward, but these are such extraordinary times, that I think it makes better sense to take a careful look at the trends seen before the advent of the virus and try to evaluate if they will emerge after the next 2-3 quarters. Whether or not one believes all brokerage prognostications, today's forecast from MS calls for a Q2 trough followed by Q3 stability and a resumption of growth thereafter. The metes and bounds of the trough are not easy to forecast, and what will be the first green shoot to emerge in Q3 is obviously a bit indiscernible here in April… but my analysis of Pure's outlook, and indeed the way I have structured my portfolio and the model portfolio I provide to subscribers is based on that kind of schedule for a recovery.Just to recapitulate Pure's results for the past quarter; revenues rose by 17%, gross margins reached 72.1% GAAP and the non-GAAP operating margins were 12%. Free cash flow for the year was $101.7 million, or a free cash flow margin of 6%. The cash flow growth was driven by the reduction in the GAAP net loss and a strong deferred revenue increase. Stock based comp expense was essentially unchanged in the quarter and the year compared to earlier periods.Pure has been a leader in making storage available to users on a SaaS basis. Pure as-a-Service showed particularly strong results last quarter with a concentration of wins in the financial services vertical. Subscription service revenue grew 41% last quarter and is now 24% of total reported revenues. The increasing component of revenues coming from subscription, rather than from product sales, has the effect of decreasing the reported increase in revenues while enhancing the total revenue that will be realized from both a single customer and in aggregate over time. It is, I think, important to note that Pure's subscription business is and will remain at relative levels far greater than seen for the other significant storage vendors. This is an underappreciated difference that enhances the investment case for the shares. Overall, the company leads with its subscription offering, Pure as-a-Service in terms of its new customer acquisition. I think that is a significant advantage in the current economic climate where potential customers are looking for better performance, but are unwilling to make major capital commitments.Pure's gross margins are not fully appreciated by investors in terms of their indication of product differentiation. For example, non-GAAP product gross margins at NetApp were reported at 45% last quarter. Product gross margins for Pure on a non-GAAP basis were almost 73%. I think when looking at EV/S ratios, the fact that Pure has such a substantial advantage in gross margins, further highlights the value of the business. (I don't compare Dell gross margins since essentially that metric for Dell is most greatly influenced by PC and server margins more than storage margins. Reported non-GAAP gross margins for Dell, for those interested, were a bit greater than 32%.) Pure acquired 500 new customers in its January quarter, an all-time record. Some of that success had to do with the FlashArray//C which I discuss in detail below. At the time before the economy tanked from the impacts of the shutdown, users were coming to Pure based on its product differentiation. When the market reopens, I expect that trend to resume.I realize that not everyone likes to read about products-but Pure is a company whose success is a function of its differentiated technology. The first question I am often asked about Pure is: Isn't all storage flash these days. Well, yes and no. Actually, the market for All-Flash-Arrays is just now about equal to the market for hybrid storage in terms of shipment data, and in terms of installed capacity, the non-flash market is still larger than all-flash. That is one reason why the CAGR for flash remains so high, with an estimate linked here of 24% growth through 2026. Global All-Flash Array Market - Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2020-2026.The second question I am often asked is why Pure chooses to price at levels that enable such high gross margins? Doesn't that retard growth and market share gains? The company has said no on many occasions. It maintains it doesn't lose on price. I am not in a position to gainsay its contentions although clearly given how competitive this space is, and the huge gap in gross margins, I might be pardoned for being a bit dubious. The fact is that Pure is able to command premium prices for its hardware because of the performance of its arrays, their form factors, and the fact that their AI capabilities mean that Pure's storage efficiency is probably higher at this point by some measurable difference when compared to the competition. Here is the latest specific answer to the issue of Pure's sky-high gross margins and how the company is able to maintain the price premium that leads to these very high gross margins:""As you know we can use gross margin in two ways: one is to fund the business; and the other of course is to fund pricing declines compared to competitors. Our view is that and we look at this literally every week. And our belief is that in fact it's the software value that we provide that is having our customers paying 10% to 20% premium for our product versus our competition. And we don't really believe that we ever lose a deal based on price. I mean we do lose deals. And when we do the price it might be lower than ours but generally it's for other reasons. And so at the minute we feel like we could win we would certainly trade-off price for more wins but we don't believe that that's what we're seeing right now.""If there is one single reason to own the shares other than their valuation, it is this phenomenon which somehow is not properly appreciated by investors at this point.I am not too sure about the methodology used by cited market research study-I just haven't seen data that supports a 25% CAGR for all-flash arrays from the vendors themselves, but basically it suggests that the market opportunity for Pure is huge relative to its current run rate of around $1.5 billion. At this point, Pure is the third largest vendor of flash and it is growing quite a bit more rapidly than the first and second place vendors, Dell, and NetApp. As mentioned, the move to a subscription model is subtracting several hundred basis points from Pure's reported growth. The 41% growth in subscription revenues probably supports an ""apples to apples"" growth rate in the mid-twenty percent range. At this point, the company has 7500 total customers, including 44% of the Fortune 2000. The company acquired 1700 customers last year. The rapid growth of the company's subscription offering will serve to increase the number of customer nameplates.When analysts look at the market these days there are many sub-categories and nuances. Pure embraced a technology called NVMe (non-volatile memory express) sometime earlier than its competitors and most of its arrays currently use that technology. The company offers what it calls FlashArray//C. The opportunity for that product, is in my opinion, a significant, unheralded opportunity. It is unique in offering flash capabilities for what are Tier 2 use cases-in other words, the product can be used in the back-up and recovery space where as of this writing, it has no flash competition. It has enjoyed very positive reception in the market. The following link describes a 3rd party evaluation of the product. It has been extremely successful since it was introduced last fall. It is the kind of product that allows Pure to offer enterprise users functionality and price/performance that was heretofore not available in the Pure offering. And as the reviewer states, it has a combination of unique features that are not generally available from competitors: Pure Storage FlashArray//C - First ImpressionsThe company offers FlashBlade, a high performance product that has been controversial since its introduction. I suspect the reason it has been controversial is that it has enjoyed substantial success in displacing Dell's Isilon object storage. Isilon was acquired by EMC some years ago and since that time it has been a cash cow. FlashBlade has enjoyed a great deal of success in displacing Isilon because of its performance advantages. The following is a Pure commercial, but it is valid in terms of the data presented. FlashBlade Sets the Bar for the Scale-Out Storage Industry | Pure Storage Blog. It might be interesting for some readers to look at the testimonial linked below. I am not sure what ""blindingly fast"" means in the real world, but this is pretty telling evidence about FlashBlade's capabilities and why it is replacing legacy infrastructure. Cogo Labs Drives New company Launches with Pure Storage FlashBlade | Pure StoragePure also has recently offered a new generation of FlashArray//X. Pure basically offers its users what is called Evergreen technology and subscribers get an automatic boost in performance without replacing anything they have bought: Pure Storage Upgrades FlashArray//X, Plans Unified File/Block Storage Capabilities. This offering was introduced on February 27-about 7 weeks ago, and probably not the most auspicious time to start offering a new level of technology. While I have suggested that Pure's growth in product sales will be below zero this quarter, an offering like this is the kind of solution that might have had a positive impact on improving the growth rate of subscription offerings.Finally, I ought to mention Cloud Block Store, and I have provided a link here for readers interested in details: Introducing Cloud Block Store for AWS | Pure Storage Blog. Cloud block store on AWS is Pure's answer to competition for storage from the various public cloud vendors. It is aimed at those users who are looking for a hybrid solution and who have been sold on Pure's software solution but who want to use AWS as their platform. By definition, Pure block store offering is based on subscription consumption models. I think it is early days for this product but it is the kind of evolutionary offering that allows Pure's customers to migrate partway toward the cloud and it might have a bit more traction in the current environment in which users are probably not looking to make far-reaching cloud transitions. Cloud Block Store for Azure should reach general availability later this year: First Look at the Technical Preview of Pure Storage Cloud Block Store for Microsoft™ AzureAs mentioned, the preponderance of analysts believe that Pure will see revenues come well below the company's guidance that was issued on February 27, and indeed there are estimates that show the company with declining year over year sales in this quarter. It is well to remember that Pure's forecast for Q1 reflected about 500 basis points of adjustment because of a one-time timing event that led to higher than planned growth of Q1 fiscal 2020. The current 1st call estimates show Q2 estimated revenues forecast by the consensus to show some typical seasonality with sequential growth of almost 17%. Frankly, 17% sequential growth in this environment sounds impossible. Pure experienced strong business trends in the 1st month of this quarter; although some states and countries are reopening their economies, I think it would be highly improbable to expect positive sequential comparisons until the end of the current summer season.That said, I was somewhat surprised that Pure continues to hire at a considerable pace. Its current help-wanted board for New York for example shows 22 open positions that have been posted in the past couple of weeks and some significant positions in the New York area have been posted in just the last day or two. pure storage help wanted - Google Search. Pure's development and management is centered in Mountain View, CT. The list of job openings for a company with 3400 employees is quite long, and suggests to me that the company has not materially constrained hiring: Find and Apply for Career, Jobs and Internships | Pure Storage. While I am still more than a bit cautious about how the current quarter and the July quarter will actually play out in terms of revenue attainment, I would be surprised if this company has seen business stop while continuing to hire at such a significant clip.In the full year guidance that the company gave at the end of February, the CFO has suggested that opex growth, which was 14% on a GAAP basis last quarter, would recede to less than 16%, the forecast growth in revenue, during the current fiscal year. The sequential growth in opex last quarter was less than 6%. The growth on a non-GAAP basis was even lower as stock based compensation expense has essentially stopped growing.Overall, the Pure business model, enhanced by its very high gross margins is likely to be much more profitable both now, and in the future compared to its larger competitors. The company will be able to use its higher gross margins to fund research and development expense, to fund sales and marketing cost or to pull levers to enhance growth in periods of slack demand.My best guess is that while Pure will have to revamp its sales outlook to take account for current economic pain, it will be in a position to maintain some level of profitability and to generate cash for what is perceived to be as a cyclical business. That will be an achievement during these perilous times. It appears as though investors are willing to pay up for companies whose results and guidance are not as bad as feared-see today's price action for Manhattan Assoc. (NASDAQ:MANH) for some confirmation.Over the past year or so, Pure shares have been battered and have seen significant losses. Some of the issues were self-inflicted, no doubt, and most of the issues related to pricing of NAND, a transition to a subscription model and currently to fears about the impact of the economy on the overall storage business. That is why the shares are now selling at less than 2X EV/S. The issue with NAND pricing is over, and so, too, are the missteps in terms of sales execution and sales capacity that plagued the company in the early part of fiscal 2020. The overall negative cyclicality of storage demand probably peaked in Q4-calendar 2019. I do not know when the peak impact from the economy will be seen in Pure's demand. My expectation, for what it is worth is that the trough will be seen over the next 90 days, At this point, no one is really in a position to understand the likely shape of the curve relative to the recovery of storage demand-""U"" or ""V"" or some other more exotic shape.My positive thesis for the shares is that the current price effectively discounts most of the negative expectations that are realistic, and some negative expectations that are not very likely. The company has plenty of liquidity with $1.3 billion of cash and it is starting to build a significant RPO balance as it continues to derive more subscription revenues. I feel its product portfolio is well differentiated from its rivals and it inherently enjoys a far better business model than that of its competitors. I think it is worth the plunge, even knowing that the current quarter, and the one beyond are likely to show negative growth in the midst of this economic crisis."
4310299,103480,2019-12-03T13:27:46-05:00,"Shares of Pure Storage have shed more than 20% after a horrific third-quarter earnings release.The company's revenue growth decelerated sharply to 15% y/y, down from 28% y/y in the second quarter. Deceleration has been a consistent worry for investors all year.Pure Storage cited higher-than-expected pricing declines as one of the major factors behind the revenue miss, exposing the company's positioning as a relatively commoditized supplier of flash storage.While Pure Storage still certainly has several positive highlights, its performance is too inconsistent for investors to be invested for the long term, especially in a troubled industry.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.I've long been a fan of Pure Storage (PSTG), but after seeing the results of the flash storage company's most recent earnings, I'm inclined to step to the sidelines. For a long time, Pure Storage has stood apart from the crowd by being one of the fastest-growing companies in the storage space, defying the common knowledge that flash storage is a commoditized industry that will eventually cripple its incumbents. But this quarter, Pure Storage's growth rates took a sharp step downward - hinting for the first time that, in the end, Pure Storage has little differentiation that can save it from the fate of the likes of NetApp (NTAP), its closest legacy competitor.Shares have lost more than 20% since reporting Q3 results, taking Pure Storage's year-to-date gains to virtually nothing:Data by YChartsNow, let's be clear - I don't necessarily believe all is doom-and-gloom for Pure Storage, and there's certainly value left in this name if shares fall meaningfully further. I'm moving to a neutral position on Pure Storage. At current levels, I don't see a particularly compelling risk-reward profile for investors, especially as it seems Pure Storage will need several quarters to work through its issues (if ever at all; a company that has been crippled by price competition isn't likely to see a roaring resurgence).In essence, the best thing to do here is to wait and see. In this article, I'll break out the good and the bad for Pure Storage to update investors on the latest key issues - but in my view, hold off on buying until Pure Storage's shares have dipped low enough to offer a margin of safety.Let's start with the bad news, which is obviously growth. Take a look at the company's latest quarterly earnings highlights below:Figure 1. Pure Storage Q3 summarySource: Pure Storage 3Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew just 15% y/y to $428.4 million. This is tremendously bad on two fronts: first, the company widely missed Wall Street's expectations of $440.4 million (+18% y/y) by a significant margin; second, Pure Storage's revenue growth decelerated thirteen points relative to 28% y/y growth in Q3.In addition, the company's deferred revenue growth - which measures the deals booked that will be recognized as revenue in future quarters - also slowed down to 39% y/y, down from 47% y/y in the previous quarter:Figure 2. Pure Storage deferred revenue trendsSource: Pure Storage Q3 earnings deckIn his prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call, CEO Charles Giancarlo attributed the revenue miss to a challenging pricing environment:Unfortunately this type of remarks has added gasoline to the fire, as a declining price environment is likely to be a permanent state of affairs that will eat into Pure Storage's future growth. Pure Storage has long used its sky-high gross margins (which is still a key element of the company that we'll discuss next) to argue that it's not a commoditized vendor, but the fact that it's facing pricing pressures for its highly ubiquitous flash storage product is cold, hard evidence that its product may not be that differentiated after all.Adding insult to the injury - despite the far slower pace of revenue growth, Pure Storage's pro forma sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues actually rose 510bps to 39.1%, up from 34% in the year-ago quarter - driving a decline in operating margins.Despite the drop-off in growth, however, some elements of the Pure Storage bullish thesis still remain intact - they just don't make the overall story shine as much as they did before, when higher growth rates were in place.The first important factor to consider is Pure Storage's gross margin, which has continued to climb higher and higher. Yes, Pure Storage is a commoditized hardware vendor, but it boasts gross margins that are more akin to that of a software company. Over time, as fixed operating expenses decline as a percentage of revenues, Pure Storage's gross margins will allow the company to generate considerable profits and cash flows.This quarter, as shown in the chart below, Pure Storage's gross margins continued to rise 360bps to 71.7%, surpassing even the company's long-term gross margin target range of 65-70%. It's also a significantly faster climb in gross margins than last quarter's 140bps bump.Figure 3. Pure Storage gross margin trendsSource: Pure Storage Q3 earnings deckAnother point to discuss in Pure Storage's favor is the fact that its issues aren't company-specific, but pertain to the whole industry. Recall that NetApp has begun guiding to revenue declines, whereas Pure Storage is still at least forecasting double-digit revenue growth. A bull may argue that the industry needs time to consolidate and work through pricing dynamics before returning to growth. Throughout this, Pure Storage has managed to continue growing market share.Per Vice Chairman David Hatfield's prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call, Pure Storage is growing substantially faster than its storage peers:Investors also shouldn't forget that, especially after a ~20% pullback from year-to-date highs, Pure Storage boasts a relatively compelling valuation trading at just over 2x forward revenues. With a gross margin profile in the >70% range on a pro forma basis, Pure Storage is more of a software company. Even other ""penalty box"" stocks like Box (BOX) and Dropbox (DBX), which arguably also offer a commoditized online file storage service and are growing at similar high-teens rates, are trading closer to ~4x forward revenues.Data by YChartsIf Pure Storage can control its narrative to focus investors and Wall Street on the software element of its story (as Nutanix (NTNX) did successfully last year), the company could see a bona fide multiples expansion regardless of its lowered growth rates. Investors likely value lower software growth over higher hardware growth, after all.Pure Storage's inconsistency in several of its most recent earnings releases gives me pause on staying invested in this company for the long term. While it's true that Pure Storage is still keeping ahead of most of its storage peers in terms of absolute growth rates, it's unclear whether the company will be able to navigate through an environment that is continually slashing prices on commodity storage.Despite a lowered valuation, I'd wait for a bigger dip before buying in."
4287325,103480,2019-08-22T10:38:39-04:00,"Shares of Pure Storage rallied more than 10% after reporting strong Q2 results that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines.Revenue grew 28% y/y, on par with last quarter. Among storage stocks, Pure Storage has shown the most stable performance amid soft global demand.Pure Storage notes that it is growing 10x faster than competitors, and has shown consistent market share gains.Gross margins also continue to tick up, thanks to a greater mix of software add-on sales.In an acknowledgement that share prices are currently low, Pure Storage also initiated a $150 million buyback program, representing 4% of its market cap.","Times are tough for the storage sector, as U.S.-China trade tensions and softening global demand have caused companies to cut back on IT investments and delay hardware purchases. While many of Pure Storage's (PSTG) rivals have suffered, however, the longtime leader in flash storage has managed to maintain robust growth performance. Pure Storage just released stellar Q2 results, driving the stock up more than 10%:Data by YChartsIn my view, Pure Storage is seeing the beginning of a recovery rally. Investors would be wise to buy and bank on continued outperformance versus the storage sector to lift the stock back to prior-year highs.Make no mistake: despite its post-earnings gains, Pure Storage is still a battered stock. The walloping started last quarter, when Pure Storage reported weak Q1 results that missed the company's own revenue expectations. Pure Storage is still feeling the impacts of being in the penalty box; the stock is still down nearly 10% year-to-date, and is still ~45% lower than its 52-week highs near $29.Last quarter, however, investors had assumed that Pure Storage's top line would continue to see deceleration. Instead, Pure Storage showed stable growth this quarter, and it's a huge relief. The fact that Pure Storage has managed to maintain its high-20s growth rate amid veritable weakness in its sector is an indication that Pure Storage's penetration into its target market is still small - unlike, for example, its legacy competitor NetApp (NTAP), whose business largely revolves around storage hardware.NetApp's second quarter results were diametrically opposite to Pure Storage's. Revenues declined for the umpteenth sequential quarter, driven by weakness in U.S. enterprises - while its growth products such as flash, which were supposed to counteract the declines in the legacy business, saw deterioration as well.Unsurprisingly, Pure Storage has been a big beneficiary of other storage providers' troubles. The company has seen continuous market share gains, as shown in the chart below from its second-quarter earnings deck:Figure 1. Pure Storage market share trendsSource: Pure Storage 2Q19 earnings deckAnother powerful statistic from this slide: Pure Storage is growing 10x faster than most major competitors. In a way, the carnage in the storage sector, while weakening all players, has somewhat benefitted the faster-growing Pure Storage in allowing it to claim higher market share.Importantly, Pure Storage's leadership has messaged that the macro issues that storage competitors are running into aren't affecting Pure Storage in a meaningful way. Charles Giancarlo, Pure Storage's CEO, noted as follows on the Q2 earnings call:Let's now dive into Pure Storage's second-quarter results in greater detail:Figure 2. Pure Storage 2Q19 earnings highlightsSource: Pure Storage 2Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 28% y/y to $396.3 million, which as previously mentioned matched last quarter's growth rate while beating Wall Street's expectations of $392.3 million (+27% y/y). The company achieved 450 net new customer adds in Q2, a record number for any Q2 in the company's history, and ended the quarter with a total base of ~6,600 customers (+28% y/y).David Hatfield, Pure Storage's president, also called out strong sales execution in the second quarter, which stands in stark contrast to many technology and software companies that have reported sales execution issues due either to slowing macro trends or insufficient sales hiring/coverage. Per his remarks on the Q2 earnings call:Also important to note is the fact that Pure Storage continued to build deferred revenues at a 47% y/y pace in Q2. In fact, this represents acceleration over Q2's deferred revenue growth of 45% y/y. Accelerating deferred revenues is a leading indicator of robust revenue growth in the quarters to come:Figure 3. Pure Storage deferred revenue trendsSource: Pure Storage 2Q19 earnings releasePure Storage's top-line strength also translated well into bottom-line gains. This quarter, pro forma gross margins rose 140bps to 69.4%, which is also already higher than the company's long-term target of 68.0%:Figure 4. Pure Storage gross margin trendsSource: Pure Storage 2Q19 earnings releaseThe company's pro forma EPS of $0.01 also smashed Wall Street's expectations of -$0.04, driven by an operating margin of -1% versus consensus expectations of -3%. In addition, Pure Storage lifted its free cash flow to $19.9 million, representing a 5% FCF margin versus a loss of -$11.9 million in 2Q18.The only disappointment that Pure Storage offered was in its guidance:Figure 5. Pure Storage guidanceSource: Pure Storage 2Q19 earnings deckThe company is calling for $434-$446 million in revenues in Q3 (representing a growth range of 16-20% y/y), missing Wall Street's expectations of $466.2 million (+25% y/y). However, the fact that NetApp's own guidance announcement had preceded Pure Storage's somewhat eased the blow, as investors were already prepared for guidance softness across the sector. Unlike NetApp, which reversed an earlier expectation of ""low mid-single digit growth"" instead to -5% to -10% y/y declines, Pure Storage is at least still maintaining double-digit growth rates.Pure Storage has likely also learned the pain of guiding too aggressively, as it did in Q1. Given the company's 28% y/y growth in Q2 and its strong 47% y/y growth in deferred revenues, it's actually unlikely that Pure Storage will notch just high-teens growth in Q3. In effect, Pure Storage's conservative guidance for Q3 is setting it up for another big beat.As another incentive to investors, Pure Storage has also announced a fresh $150 million stock buyback program, an implicit signal that management believes Pure Storage's stock is currently undervalued. At current share prices, this buyback would cover ~4% of Pure Storage's market cap.The bottom line on Pure Storage: compared to other storage vendors, Pure Storage is bucking the widespread macro weakness and growing far faster than peers, picking up market share in the process. Having fallen by nearly half over the past year, Pure Storage is long overdue for a rebound."
4335020,103480,2020-03-30T14:07:12-04:00,"Shares of Pure Storage have fallen ~30% year-to-date, stemming from concerns about the company's underlying demand trends for flash amid the coronavirus.Pure Storage's growth was already a concern for investors before the coronavirus hit, with growth rates falling to the high teens from a previous ~30% y/y rate.The markets are now more willing to forego high growth rates, however, in search of stable, high-margin, and cash-rich businesses.Pure Storage should now be thought of as a value-oriented, cash flow play. The stock is trading at just ~11x trailing operating cash flows, a bargain even against a distressed market.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Perhaps it's no surprise that Pure Storage (PSTG) has not been immune to the broad declines in the stock market. The provider of raw flash storage has been assailed by concerns about global demand for flash amid an expected downturn in both consumer electronics and enterprise infrastructure. These macro headwinds exacerbate an existing concern on growth, which pummeled Pure Storage shares to the tune of ~20% last quarter when the company reported a huge deceleration in revenue growth from 28% y/y to just 15% y/y.The coronavirus selloff has extended these losses, bringing shares of Pure Storage down -30% year-to-date and down more than 50% from all-time highs reached in late 2018. The question for investors now is: is there any hope for a rebound for Pure Storage, or is this company doomed in a recession scenario?Data by YChartsFirst, we should answer the burning question on investors' minds: Pure Storage is in no immediate danger of bankruptcy, unlike the many small-cap stocks at its size. In contrast, Pure Storage's balance sheet (which we'll dive into in depth in this article) actually contains a trove of cash that will preserve the company through many quarters of depressed sales.Second, I believe the cautious stance taken on by the markets during the coronavirus selloff actually gives investors a chance to re-evaluate Pure Storage from a value angle, rather than growth. For two quarters now, the overwhelming criticisms on Pure Storage have been around its growth: investors worried about the sharp declines in revenue growth, as well as general concern for flash storage pricing and competition. Now, however, the markets care principally about a safe balance sheet and strong cash flow generation to weather the current storm, rather than growth.Though I removed my bullish recommendation on Pure Storage last quarter due to flailing growth, the stock's deep declines since then amid robust cash flows have turned me bullish again. Investors won't be able to ignore this high-margin, cash-flowing business for long - especially as growth conversations fade into the background.Let's address the question of Pure Storage's balance sheet first, as it is often the foremost concern for investors at this moment looking for safe small-cap stocks to buy.Luckily, there's a lot to like about Pure Storage's balance sheet:Figure 1. Pure Storage balance sheetSource: Pure Storage Q4 earnings releaseThere's $1.30 billion of cash and marketable securities sitting on its books, alongside $477.0 million of convertible debt - making for a net cash position of $823.0 million. Of all the debt instruments out there, convertible debt is among the most patient, requiring no immediate repayment in a time when businesses are racing to preserve cash.We'll cover Pure Storage's cash flows in a moment, but here's one easy gauge by which we can assess Pure Storage's liquidity. In FY20, Pure Storage incurred $1.32 billion in GAAP operating expenses. If we add back $208.6 million of stock-based expense and $116.9 million of depreciation and amortization costs, we arrive at roughly $994.5 million of cash operating expenses per year. This means that, even if Pure Storage were to suffer a period of zero sales, its current cash balance would be able to tide it over for more than a year.That's certainly not a bad spot to be in, especially as many small and mid-cap retailers, restaurants, and other businesses (mostly in the consumer space) are facing very real and very near-term concerns on payroll and rent.Now let's address the new, core bullish thesis behind Pure Storage: the company has just gotten too cheap on a cash flow basis to ignore. Investors' prior disappointments in the company's declining growth rates should be superseded by the company's growth in margins and its huge cash flow generation potential.In FY20, as we can see in the chart below, Pure Storage generated $189.6 million in operating cash flows at an 11.5% margin:Figure 2. Pure Storage cash flowsSource: Pure Storage Q4 earnings deckFor the full fiscal year FY21, Pure Storage has guided to $1.90 billion in revenues. If we assume that Pure Storage can even maintain its 11.5% operating cash flow margin (which is conservative, given the company's constant improvements in its gross margin thanks to its growing pivot to subscription sales), we arrive at an estimated $218.5 million in OCF for FY21.At present share prices around $13, Pure Storage trades at a $3.30 billion market cap. After excluding the $823 million of net cash on Pure Storage's balance sheet, its enterprise value is $2.48 billion. This means that Pure Storage is currently trading at a valuation of just 11.3x EV/FY21 OCF.Now here's a look at various other enterprise technology businesses and where they trade relative to operating cash flows - among both lower-growing (Oracle, Microsoft) and faster-growing (Adobe) names, Pure Storage trades at quite a discount.Data by YChartsKeep in mind that simply holding Pure Storage's OCF margin flat to last year also ignores the fact that Pure Storage has been consistently building up its gross margins via increased software sales.There are two strengths we want to point out in Pure Storage's most recent Q4 results. First off, we note that Pure Storage has continued to drive improvement in its gross margins, which is an important driver of cash flow growth in the future.As we can see in the chart below, Pure Storage's gross margins in Q4 reached an all-time high at 72.1%, on a pro forma basis. That's up 450bps year-over-year. In the full year FY20, Pure Storage improved margins 290bps to 70.5%.Figure 3. Pure Storage gross margin trendsSource: Pure Storage Q4 earnings deckAs previously noted, Pure Storage has achieved this margin expansion by means of emphasizing the software elements of its product. This has been a key distinguisher for Pure Storage versus other raw storage providers, and in response to an analyst question on the Q&A portion of the Q4 earnings call, CEO Charlie Giancarlo has even noted that Pure Storage's customers are willing to pay Pure's pricing premium for its software capabilities:The second strength we want to point out is that, after Q3's disastrous decline in growth rates, Pure Storage's revenue growth seems to have stabilized in the high teens. Revenue growth accelerated two points to +17% y/y in Q4, slightly beating Wall Street's expectations for +16% y/y growth. Pure Storage's guidance for FY21, at $1.9 billion, also implies a +16% y/y growth rate - seeming to suggest the company's deceleration will get no worse from here.Figure 4. Pure Storage revenue trendsSource: Pure Storage Q4 earnings deckThat, of course, doesn't factor in any coronavirus impact. We do expect demand in many end-markets to fall as a result of the coronavirus and enterprise businesses pulling back on demand. We do note, however, that fellow memory company Micron (MU) recently reported data center strength in spite of the coronavirus, a huge end market for Pure Storage as well.Any demand shock from the virus, however, is agreed by most analysts to be only temporary, and we're additionally comforted by the knowledge that Pure Storage has ample liquidity to weather even an extended coronavirus shutdown.Though Pure Storage was always viewed previously as a growth stock, the fact that growth has taken a back seat in the coronavirus bear market helps Pure Storage to advance its case as more of a commodity, cash-flowing company. Trading at just ~11x forward OCF, with richly expanding margins and stable mid-teens revenue growth, Pure Storage is a perfect mid-cap stock to catch for a rebound."
4255463,98236,2019-04-19T11:12:30-04:00,"Pure shares have languished for many quarters now, while the company has continued to achieve 30%+ top-line growth.The company's newest offerings, which include ObjectEngine, Direct Flash Fabric and ES2, seem to be dramatically underappreciated by many industry analysts.The company announced one of the largest orders in its history with a Global System Integrator, ordering over $100 million of product to be delivered over the next two years.The company is starting to a quickening of the growth in its deferred revenue balances as users pick up on the company's software and subscription offerings at rates higher than had been expected.Pure has not seen the growth slowdown advertised by some of its competitors. It is still a small company in a large market, and it has plenty of market share opportunity that can be realized.","Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) announced its quarterly results just about 6 weeks ago at this point, and we recently had the opportunity to catch up with management in a one on one session. The shares have appreciated by about 10% since the company announced its results, even though those results were headlined by a noticeable revenue and EPS miss. In our view, much of the most recent appreciation had to do with guidance which was relatively strong and to the company's relatively constrained share price performance over the past year. Further, the company also announced one of the absolute largest deals in its history with a Global System Integrator (GSI) who has made a 2-year, $100 million commitment.We have been moderately positive on the name over the past year, during which the shares have significantly under-performed the average technology shares. For the last 12 months, Pure shares are up about 15%, while the IGV has appreciated by about 27%. For those readers interested in such things, Pure shares went public in the fall of 2015 at a price of $17/share. Its revenues back then were about $175 million on a trailing basis. Now, its trailing revenues are around $1.4 billion, but its share price has only appreciated a bit more than 34%. It has been a rare occurrence in the IT space to see substantial growth, coupled with a material contraction in valuation. To my mind, that is a valuation anomaly worth pursuing.Why has the share price performance been that poor? - in one word, the fear of the Cloud. In a second word, fear of a cyclical storage downturn. Most investors, if they think about such things, will tell interlocutors, that their concern with storage companies is that demand will be compromised as more workloads migrate to the cloud, as, for the most part, cloud vendors will not wind up buying branded storage from companies such as Pure. It is a debate that has gone on for some time now - I will never be able to resolve the debate myself, and I therefore will not try. Yes, workloads are moving to the cloud, and the growth rate for storage is almost certainly substantially less than it would be were this not the case. I will simply remind readers that the hybrid cloud has continued its emergence as the architecture of choice for the preponderance of workloads, that the replacement of spinning disc has a long way to go, and that Pure continues to gain market share.Over the past year, many analysts have been waiting for a substantial cyclical downturn in the storage market and stronger performance from Dell as it escapes the turmoil of its merger. The downturn has come and Pure has continued to gain market share. In fact, Pure is still forecasting 30% top line growth for the current fiscal year. On balance, the combination of Pure's decent operational performance and under-performance of its share valuation has left a rather substantial valuation anomaly. Pure's last quarterly report was a miss - often a death curse for highly valued shares.But Pure, despite its growth rate, is anything but a highly valued company. In fact, one reason why the quarterly miss was not met by an orgy of selling and downgrades is that the shares already reflected a negative perception of the company. Is that negative perception based on reality - or is the reality something quite a bit different. This article is designed to illustrate that Pure's outlook is far stronger than might be suggested by the company's valuation. It is my contention, therefore, that the valuation anomaly is likely to be lessened, and that, coupled with continued reasonable operational performance, will enable the shares to enjoy positive alpha going forward.The core of our discussion with Pure management was about the company's future in the flash storage market. The company made what I thought to be a compelling case as to its differentiation and its ability to continue to gain share. Overall, our discussion with company management could best be characterized as that of ""the cool confidence of a Christian with 4 aces."" For those of you who either do not play poker or have avoided regional expressions, it means that we thought the body language was positive. We came away somewhat more positive regarding the case that the shares have a fair level of relative upside, and we might suggest them to subscribers who are looking for low-valued growth and have the patience to deal with what is still a set of negative perceptions.To an extent, when readers deal with hardware companies, the first thing they want to know is how/what might be the competitive moat. It is never an easy question to answer - storage is supposed to be fungible, more or less. But even in the storage space, there are nuances based on technology of various kinds and based on adjacencies. Currently, Pure is making the case that it is offering users a better brand of what is called NVMe (Non-volatile express) through the use of parallel media. Is that really the case - most likely. Is it terribly important - well that depends on who one talks to. I certainly do not want to represent that I have the ability to rate storage vendors based on technology.But if I do not have that capability, some buyers who understand the technology have made notable bets on Pure's most recent product offering in the storage market. While a single transaction is never really dispositive in that regard, one transaction of interest that happened at the start of this current quarter was a purchase of $100 million of storage by a GSI. That is a very large buy for any individual customer, and particularly for a company the size of Pure. GSIs are professional buyers and can bring to bear lots of understanding of competitive offerings. Obviously, given all that goes into that kind of procurement, the GSI who made this commitment must have concluded that Pure is offering something quite a bit better than its larger competitors.In our discussion, Pure talked about its competitors having large SSDs at both end of an array as their version of NVMe. That is not true NVMe, and the results of using that kind of architecture show up in price/performance differentiation. Pure maintains that, when it comes to true NVMe, its competitors really cannot offer the performance the technology supports and that less than 10% of what it faces in the market relates to the kind of product it sells these days.Yes, I know companies always provide analysts with commercials - and many of us, accept the commercials, but at the end of the day, there has to be some reason as to why this company has been able to both enjoy higher gross margins and grow market share when its competitors have talked about deteriorating fundamentals in the storage space.Some readers might remind themselves of the days of multiple storage vendors in the first decade of this century-and the fact is that NetApp (NTAP), through its clever use of software, was able in those years to parley its technology into the stuff necessary to build a large company. Is Pure's NVMe differentiation similar to that once offered by NetApp through the use of OnTap? I would like to say I absolutely know - but I think that would not be the kind of conclusion that I can reach absolutely - at least at this point.Most recently, as has been broadly publicized, NAND (the basic building block for flash arrays) component prices have fallen quite dramatically, and that trend is expected to persist throughout the balance of 2019 - see the article linked here. There are those who speculate that this decline in component costs is going to help Pure more than its competitors. The company has a rather unique approach to NAND flash management that it calls DirectFlash. I have linked here to a blog and a commercial that details the technology. I have also linked here to the Gartner report on the all-flash array space.DirectFlash was introduced a couple of years ago and its further evolution, DirectFlash Fabric was released in February. The company obviously spent lots of time trying to educate this writer on the benefits of the technology and how it is being leveraged to gain market share. I have no real reason not to believe their claims which seem to be substantiated in both 3rd party studies and market share statistics. Management has suggested both to us and elsewhere that the very high growth in the deferred revenue balance is a function of this technological innovation. In the most recent quarter, Pure's deferred revenues grew by 61% from year earlier levels, the strongest percentage growth in that metric in the last fiscal year. Pure maintains that its latest announcement has brought the benefits of the hyperscale architecture to the enterprise.OK, Pure is a hardware company, and most investors think that hardware companies are doomed to poor performance and a sticky end. It is hardly news to suggest that HP (NYSE:HPQ) and IBM (IBM) have had their struggles, while Oracle's (ORCL) acquisition of Sun has not had lots of visible financial benefits. The storage business has seen its share of high-profile failures and the most recent experience of flash memory vendors is not edifying for investors. The sagas of both Fusion-IO and Violin, although a few years in the past now, are obviously still on the minds of some investors. But the point is: Everyone is well aware of the issues involved in building a hardware company. And indeed, the nature of the hardware world is that attempts to build a competitive moat are difficult, and most hardware companies are challenged when it comes to margins and long-term growth. But not all.Our high-growth portfolio was recently invested in Ubiquiti (UBNT), a more or less ""pure"" hardware company-pardon the pun. It has enjoyed great results and better share price performance. Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), while not in our high-growth portfolio, has been a long-time recommendation, and we still find its prospects and its risk/reward ratios very positive and investment worthy. There can be IT hardware vendors that meet the criteria for both long-term growth and differentiated margins. It is my belief that Pure qualifies in terms of its technology as a company that can sustain strong growth and strong gross margins. Overall and in the wake of conversation with Pure management, I think that it is time to reinforce my prior recommendation.It is important to note that until this last quarter, Pure had consistently beaten its forecasts since it became a public company in the fall of 2015. That is true for many recent IPOs - the difference is that most other recent IPOs do not sell with a valuation of 2.6X EV/S. Our own valuation chart, which we use as a tool to look at relative valuations related to growth, is based on Pure attaining a 3-year growth of 29% and with a current free cash flow margin of 7.5%. The EV/S metric is exceptional, the cash flow margin is a bit less than average-although the strong growth in deferred revenue additions is an encouraging sign for forward free cash flow margins. That said, the company is expecting a sharp improvement in profitability after the stumble in this last quarter.With that as prologue, I will summarize some of the specifics that Pure management made during the course of the interview. First things first - the company had a rather noticeable process breakdown that lead to a product revenue miss of some magnitude last quarter. According to management, the hardware was on the truck and awaiting some kind of clearance to go to users with POs that were signed and had gone through all the necessary approval processes. Software, which is separately billed and downloaded, had shipped but hardware was left on the dock of the company's contract manufacturing vendor. It was this process failure that was the vast preponderance of the miss. At this point, all of the items that were supposed to ship have - they will count for revenue in Q! that ends at the end of April. It should be noted, therefore that the 30% growth forecast for this quarter is going to include items that really should have been shipped and accounted for last quarter. This was a topic that was not discussed in detail - one might suggest that 30% growth for this quarter might well be a sandbag.The company has forecast that it will achieve 30% growth for the full year and that is the current revenue consensus as published on 1st Call. Since it started the year out with 24% growth as reported, reaching its forecast is going to require growth acceleration over the next few quarters. The product identified by management as something that could move the needle in that regards in terms of forward growth is what is called ObjectEngine, essentially a combination of StorReduce and FlashBlade.A couple of years ago, Pure introduced Flash Blade, the first new competitor in the object data storage space in some time. Flash Blade competes against Isilon, which EMC had acquired at the end of the last decade. Initially, there was a great deal of skepticism regarding the potential for that product but at this point it is one of the demand drivers for Pure. Flash Blade continues to gain share in its traditional market segment, basically for the reasons suggested in the prior linked article. I think it is fair to say that if Pure can accomplish its goals in the back up/recovery and data protection space, as it has advertised and spoke about during our interview, its valuation paradigm should see a substantial change.Pure bought StorReduce last August. Fast forward a few months and the StorReduce technology has been incorporated with Flash Blade and is now offered as a solution called ObjectEngine. ObjectEngine is advertised as the industry's first F2F2C solution (that means Flash to Flash to Cloud, and no, I didn't think it up - that is what people call the technology). I have linked to the Pure Commercial and to the Gorilla Guide to Rapid Restores with Flash and Cloud. I am sure that most readers will ignore the links - but the business opportunity to replace current technology with this solution is immense.Regardless of the cloud, users simply have to continue to have back-up storage in the event of catastrophic events and to satisfy regulatory mandates. And back-up, given the volumes of data involved, can only be facilitated through a process known as deduplication. Some years ago now, EMC bought a company called Data Domain. Data Domain, as it was in 2009 when it was acquired in a bidding war, has remained the industry leader when it comes to deduplication. Users have to manage the amount of data they back up, and deduplication is by far the most practical way of limiting back-up volumes. Given the recent history of EMC and Dell, it should be of little surprise to find that Data Domain has become something of an extreme cash cow for the company, and it has not really updated the technology it had when it was acquired - it hasn't been under competitive pressure to do so.ObjectEngine, as it is advertised, is a radically different paradigm than the appliance-based architecture that is sold by Data Domain/Dell. I am not going to try to enumerate all of the advantages inherent in ObjectEngine. But it is cheaper to acquire, its cost of ownership is less, and the data recovery process is far more rapid - no more rehydration bottlenecks. Data Domain and the other ancillary Dell backup and recovery solutions probably have revenues of more than $3 billion a year, most of which would be ripe for replacement by this type of technology.It is the combination of Flash Blade and the StorReduce technologies that have enabled Pure to offer a subscription-based solution for the data protection market. Overall, the data protection market is said to have a TAM of $8 billion, which is a substantial addition to the TAM for which Pure has previously competed. While Pure has not made a specific projection with regard to ObjectEngine, it has suggested that it will be a noticeable revenue contributor this fiscal year. It would be my guess that ObjectEngine is a principal factor in supporting Pure's 30% revenue growth guide - if ObjectEngine is successful, it is almost certainly going to bend realistic expectations for this company's growth upward for at least a couple of years.The final point of our interview related to the launch of the ES2 subscription offering. ES2 is one of those offerings that is attempting to bridge the difference between hardware and a service offering. Essentially, the offering is an attempt by Pure to provide its customers with an offering for both private and hybrid clouds that is based on usage and doesn't require any hardware purchase. In that regard, it is similar to the storage service that many users procure from Amazon - but this service is focused available for the private and hybrid cloud and can be obtained for terms as short as a single year based on capacity. This is an interesting offering - it is based on the effective capacity computed daily and is not based on provisioned capacity.As mentioned, one reason for Pure's modest valuation is the concern that Amazon, and its cloud storage service, will wind up undercutting the traditional storage market. With this offering, Pure is providing its users with the same kind of experience as they can get using Amazon (AMZN) - albeit for the hybrid and private cloud. The new service is one that is billed annually, and it is part of the reason why the increase in deferred revenue has been so strong in the past few quarters. Notionally, at least at some juncture, the commitment users are making to Pure using the ES2 model ought to have a positive impact on cash flow and valuation, although clearly that consummation is a future hope rather than a present reality.The company didn't provide any specifics of the magnitude of the ES2 offering and the extent to which it is impacting the forecast for the current year, and we didn't get a specific view of those metrics during our interview. In addition to the E2S offering, the company has introduced a service called Cloud Data Services which are meant to run on AWS - and eventually other public cloud providers. I think it might surprise some readers to discover that Pure is in the position of providing software to run on AWS. I have linked here to a product tear sheet for those interested in the capabilities. At the moment, the Pure Cloud Data Service is in what is called Beta2, and it will probably not provide noticeable recognized revenues this year, as it is a subscription product.There is a fair amount of skepticism regarding Pure's ability to continue its ability to achieve leading gross margin performance in its space. Most often, it might be anticipated that a relatively smaller vendor such as Pure would not be able to achieve the highest gross margins in its space, but that has been the case, basically since this company has been public. There are some key reasons for that, and in particular, Pure architecture has allowed it to use merchant silicon. Going forward, the architecture of its flash fabric should allow the company to achieve a disproportionate benefit from the decline of NAND costs. Last quarter saw non-GAAP gross margins at almost the top end of the company's guidance despite the fact that its shipments were below plan due to the process problems discussed earlier in this report. In fact, were it not for a mix shift which saw shipments of Flash Blade grow more strongly than the company's Flash Array, gross margins would have been above planned ranges.Overall, Pure has quite a bit of margin flexibility that it can use to invest in new products and in hiring sales teams to better take advantage of opportunities. Pure sees itself with a variety of opportunities based on some of the product initiatives that I have tried to outline above. The consequence of that is that the company is not trying to achieve operating margin leverage. The company is forecasting operating margins for the full year of 3% to 7%. In fiscal 2019, the company reported non-GAAP operating margins of 3.7%. Most analysts are anticipating that operating margins will be toward the top end of the guided range.As mentioned, cash flow growth was substantially greater than the growth in both operating income and revenues. Much of that had to do with the 69% growth in the deferred revenue increase. Just about all of the company's operating cash flow came from deferred revenue growth for the full year; in Q4, the percentage contributed by the growth in deferred revenue reached 123%. Based on management projection, and the anticipated growth from products that are exclusively sold on a subscription basis, it seems reasonable to anticipate that cash flow growth will continue to grow more rapidly than revenues. The free cash flow margin last year was less than 4%. I would be surprised if the free cash flow margin didn't double this year, and it could well reach double-digit levels.There are not many cheap names in the IT space. The space has certainly been picked over by investors. Pure is one of those rare companies whose growth is still at hyper-levels but whose valuation is far less than might be anticipated for its growth cohort. Yes, it is a hardware company, and it is a storage company, but those are not necessarily fatal impediments to continued strength in operating performance and even valuation expansion. It is definitely an interesting alternative in the IT sector without the sky high multiples of some other names."
4228245,101850,2018-12-13T19:48:39-05:00,The firm’s near and long-term growth depends on new products with specific focus on their cloud-based solutions offering.The FlashBlade platform will enable applications in AI and Big Data.FlashBlade shaped the firm’s growth in the last quarter with record revenues and is expected to pave the way forward.Falling input prices have been beneficial to their top line margins while the new corporate tax regime continues to benefit PSTG’s bottom lines.,"While we like Pure Storage's prospects, we remain on the sidelines for now and await a more attractive entry point. The stock isn't cheap on valuation at ~41x P/E and with financing needs on the rise, there isn't a lot of margin for error at these levels.New products will shape a significant part of Pure Storage’s (PSTG) future over the coming decade. Current demand for unstructured data has been gaining momentum as companies seek to harness this to boost their personalization of products and this has consequently driven to the entry of new data analysis applications. The entrance and consequent dominance of applications such as artificial intelligence and big data which are shaping and revolutionizing the technology sector have come with a rise in demand for new technology atop which to run them.It is upon this backdrop that the firm’s innovation, sales, and marketing expenditures for the coming year are estimated to rise by 1.5% and total about $1.04 billion. Continued investment in this space has created momentum especially for their new products, top of which are FlashBlade and hybrid cloud services. PSTG’s FlashBlade solution not only ensures faster execution of programs but also ensures that applications such as AI and big data analysis run efficiently.While riding on the value proposition of replacing legacy technology along with enhancing operations, its sales have seen it rise to become PSTG’s star as the division’s revenue grew 93% year over year (YoY) to close the quarter at a record $48 million position. The firm has also ventured into the hybrid cloud services which will allow individuals and institutions to run critical applications on their public cloud; a service which is poised to see more logical, dynamic and seamless integration of any firm’s data over the cloud while allowing for faster analysis of this information.It is, however, clear that the above are recent products. Therefore, long-term investment and commitment are expected to facilitate their eventual takeoff. The outlook, however, remains optimistic as the primary driver for this demand – unstructured data – continues to increase.While the above mark the future of PSTG, the present paints an even clearer story for the firm. Current revenues, margins, and growth rates have continued to paint a positive picture of the firm’s near-term success. Over the last quarter, record revenues marked the recent financial release by Pure Storage. While consensus estimates placed the firm’s expected revenues at $367.4 million, the firm outperformed this by over 110 basis points (bp), recording revenue of $372.8 million. Additionally, the segmented revenue figure painted a growth picture as the firm’s product revenue grew 31% YoY to $298.9 million, beating consensus estimates by 173 bp and their service revenues also rose by 35.7% YoY – 9.1% quarter over quarter (QoQ) – to close the quarter at $73.9 million.Falling global NAND prices have negatively affected producers. However, declining prices benefit PSTG. With prices remaining on a downtrend, the firm has enjoyed boosted gross margins and, in addition to improved memory pricing, an increasing software mix also carried over to the firm’s bottom line.As a result, the firm reported their highest ever gross margins of 68.1% which also exceeded the 67% announced in 2Q18, and as a result, their operating margins rose from 0.3% in 2Q18 to 9.1% in 3Q18. With regards to the former, the trend has continued to be more evident with every quarter as the gross margins continue to rise. The past three quarters have seen the firm’s efficiency continuously rise, and therefore seen them record the following numbers: 68.1%, 66.6% and 65% for 3Q18, 2Q18, and 1Q18, respectively.The implications of this ever-increasing efficiency, coupled with the drop in corporate taxes akin to the new tax regime, on the last quarter were a $.13 earnings per share figure which outperformed consensus estimates by $.04, ensuring that the firm beat consensus estimates for the fourth quarter in a row as shown in the chart below:Source: Yahoo FinanceWhile all the above remains positive, the firm’s product pipeline will require a significant capital injection to take off. The expected capital and operating expenditures of $1.04 billion for 2019 would thus otherwise have been a considerable strain on the financial position should the firm’s cash flow position not been as strong as is. PSTG has not only been growing their earnings base but also their cash position with operating cash flow position of $57 million in 3Q18, higher than the $8 million reported in 2Q18 as well as the $28.3 million reported in 3Q17. Finally, their cash and cash equivalents totaled $1.144 billion which is enough to sustain their expected expenditures.PSTG’s investment in both FlashBlade and the hybrid cloud services should pay off on the back of continued big data-driven demand. With the firm’s cash position surpassing their estimated expenditure, new products growing at near triple growth rates and declining input prices supporting margin growth, its growth trajectory should continue for the foreseeable future. However, we think it might be best to wait for a better entry point given the massive near-term financing needs (expected capital and operating expenditures of $1.04 billion for 2019), coupled with a premium valuation at ~41x P/E."
4223668,103480,2018-11-20T15:34:34-05:00,"Pure Storage shares rallied 8% after reporting Q3 results, reversing an earlier decline.The company beat Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom lines.Despite fears of a slowdown in flash memory demand, Pure Storage still managed to grow at 34% y/y.As a further testament to strength, Pure Storage also noted a slight bump in gross margins year over year, indicating that it hasn't slashed prices (yet) to drive unit sales.A larger mix of value-added software has allowed Pure Storage to maintain its margins, despite declining flash memory trends.","It's been an ugly couple of weeks for stocks in the chip and storage sectors, but growth star Pure Storage (PSTG) reversed the recent trend by posting great Q3 results. Bypassing widespread concerns that flash memory demand was on the wane, Pure Storage managed to grow revenues at 34% y/y this quarter, beating Wall Street expectations by a comfortable margin and showing minimal deceleration from last quarter's growth rates.Pure Storage has the uncomfortable distinction of being in two bear categories at the moment - growth stocks and storage stocks. Like most of its peers, Pure Storage is down 40% from its peak - but I believe the post-earnings lift could be the beginning of a rebound.PSTG data by YChartsPure Storage's push into providing cloud-native storage hardware is a likely contributor behind the storage company's relative success, whereas other memory stocks are seeing contractions in revenue and margin pressures. Pure Storage has built out a full lineup of software-driven offerings under its new Pure Storage Cloud Data Services Brand, hosted on AWS. Per a recent article on ZDNet, Pure Storage is capitalizing on the shift to the so-called ""hybrid cloud"" - wherein enterprises may choose to run some workloads on public clouds like AWS, while retaining more sensitive workloads on home servers. Pure's new offerings sit well with customers who want to run both options, with additional services like data replication, deduplication, and security layers on top.In this way, Pure Storage has been able to somewhat escape the fate of the more commodity-bound storage names, such as Western Digital (WDC), that have recently been hit by perceived weakness in memory prices. Even end-product maker NetApp (NTAP), in its earnings call last week, noted that it might have to slash prices to remain competitive with pared-down raw memory costs - though NetApp also said it wouldn't be the first mover to drop prices. But by packaging its hardware solutions with value-added software, Pure Storage has been able to maintain its margin premiums and keep its growth streak alive. Customers of Pure Storage aren't just buying commodity hardware, they're buying a packaged data solution.In that sense, we can't view Pure Storage fully as a hardware company - after all, with gross margins in the high 60s, it more closely resembles a software company. While Pure Storage still is primarily a flash storage vendor, it's moving closer to the Nutanix (NTNX) model - where customers are increasingly paying for the value of the software, while the hardware itself can be brand-agnostic. Viewed from this lens, Pure Storage's 2.8x forward revenue multiple is downright cheap when considering that the company has software-like gross margins and a high growth profile to boot. Over time, Pure Storage's valuation should decouple from hardware-focused stocks like NetApp and converge closer to Nutanix.NTAP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe strength of Pure Storage's Q3 results provide plenty of impetus to buy this stock while it's still in a bear market. Pure Storage is one of the brightest spots of refuge in an otherwise scary memory/storage sector, and in my view, the stock will see inflows in the near term as investors shore up on high-quality names that have less exposure to commodity price declines in 2019.Here's a look at Pure Storage's most recent quarterly results:Figure 1. Pure Storage 3Q18 resultsSource: Pure Storage investor relationsRevenues grew 34% y/y to $372.8 million, surpassing Wall Street's estimates of $367.3 million (+32% y/y) by a comfortable two-point margin. Tim Riitters, Pure Storage's CFO, attributed strength in the quarter to ""strong FlashBlade execution."" FlashBlade is one of Pure Storage's core product lines, specially tailored to handle complex unstructured data sets.Riitters also called out in the Q&A portion of the earnings call that customers were signing up for ""elongated"" support contracts, which had the effect of building up Pure Storage's deferred revenue balances. As Pure Storage shifts more into a subscription-oriented, recurring-revenue model, its billings (the sum of revenues in the quarter plus deferred revenue buildup) will become an even more important indicator to watch. Per Riitters' comments on the earnings call:Deferred revenue balances effectively create a ""backlog"" from which Pure Storage will eventually recognize as revenues. A 40% y/y increase in deferred revenues is a strong leading indicator of continued growth for the company.Perhaps more important this quarter, however, was Pure Storage's execution on the bottom line, especially with concerns around memory pricing eating into margins. If there are issues elsewhere in the sector on margin performance, it isn't happening at Pure Storage: on a GAAP basis, gross margins rose 130 bps to 66.8%, and on a pro forma basis, gross margins rose 170 bps to 68.1%. In both cases, the rise in gross margins was due to an uptick in both product and support gross margins.Figure 2. Pure Storage gross margin trendsSource: Pure Storage investor relationsAs opposed to the rather non-committal answer that NetApp's management had on flash pricing on its earnings call, Pure Storage was a little more upfront in stating that flash pricing declines would likely have little impact on the business. Again in the Q&A portion of the call, Riitters noted as follows (key points highlighted below):This commentary gives us reassuring feedback that unlike more commoditized peers like Western Digital and Micron (MU) that are makers of raw memory and thus more exposed to pricing cycles, Pure Storage's value-add approach gives it a bit more of a buffer that will protect its profitability in the down cycle.Pure Storage also showed good cost discipline on the operating expense side, which rose just 31% y/y to $276.3 million this quarter, versus 34% y/y revenue growth. Pro forma operating margins, as a result, bumped up 540 bps to 9.1% in the quarter, and Pure Storage's pro forma EPS of $0.13 beat Wall Street's consensus of $0.09 with 44% upside.In addition, Pure Storage was also able to deliver impressive free cash flow growth, up approximately 2x to $28.5 million, and achieving 260 bps of additional FCF margin:Figure 3. Pure Storage FCFSource: Pure Storage investor relationsShares of Nutanix saw a massive spike when it announced it would be cutting off ""pass-through hardware"" revenues and analysts began to view it as more of a software company. Though Pure Storage will likely always retain hardware as a part of its business, it has clearly undergone a noticeable shift to value-added services packaged with its hardware that has allowed it to maintain its premium margins, even in the face of memory pricing declines.Once investors begin to dissociate Pure Storage from its commodity hardware peers, it is likely to see a similar multiples expansion that can propel the stock into a rebound. Pure Storage seems to have found a bottom - investors should consider getting in now."
4214915,104099,2018-10-26T12:53:45-04:00,"I think shares are overpriced at this point, and I recommend that those who own this name take the money and run.There's a negative relationship between sales and net income, prompting the question: if growing sales won't improve the bottom line, what will?!For those who insist on staying long the name in hopes of benefiting from further manic price action, I recommend switching to calls.","Over the past year, the shares of Pure Storage Inc. (PSTG) are up about 26%, and I think investors would be wise to take the money and run at this point. I think the shares have more downside than upside ahead of them and I’ll go through my reasoning below by looking at the financial history here and by looking at the stock itself. I’ll conclude with a less risky alternative for investors who insist on maintaining a long position here.Pure Storage is a company that seeks to empower its customers to maximize the value of their data. The company’s solutions replace storage systems designed for mechanical disks with all flash systems optimized end to end for solid state memory. The company’s ""Pure1"" cloud-based support and management platform allows for greater flexibility in data management, and the solution also spots problems before they are noticeable by users.The company currently boasts a roster of ~4,500 customers, including over 30% of the Fortune 500. At the moment, the company generates about 25% of sales outside of the United States. Significantly, the company states that they plan to continue to invest significantly in R&D, sales, marketing support etc. into the foreseeable future and those investments may result in ongoing operational losses.Recently, a Goldman Sachs analyst exemplified the expression “damning with faint praise” when he upgraded the company from a “sell.”A quick review of the financial history here suggests that the company is quite popular, showing revenue growth at an eye-watering CAGR of 85%. That is obviously an impressive feat. The problem from my point of view rests with the fact that everything below the top line seems far less impressive. While sales have grown spectacularly, losses have also ballooned. In fact, I ran a correlation analysis on revenue and net income and discovered a fairly significant (r=-.56) negative relationship between sales and profit.The trend has continued this year, with revenue up a massive 38% in the first six months of this year relative to the last, while losses also expanded by 8%. This prompts the same question of this company as so many others: if growing sales don’t lead to profits, or at least reduced losses, what will? This is a problem, especially in light of the fact that management is signalling more of the same in future.Investors have also suffered from fairly massive dilution over the years, with shares outstanding growing at a CAGR of about 50% since 2013. Investors can take some consolation in the fact that the expanded losses and the dilution has resulted in better (i.e. less bad) EPS numbers.Source: Company filingsI’ve maintained that it’s possible for what I would consider a troubled company like this one to be a good investment if the price is right. It may be the case that Pure Storage will eventually be a very profitable firm in the relatively distant future. If we pay a sufficiently high discount on the shares, they may represent good value going forward. The problem is that, although they’re much less expensive on a price to free cash flow basis, the shares are trading at a significant premium to an already expensive market.Source: GurufocusAt just under 120 times future free cash flow, these shares are very optimistically priced in my view.I think those who insist on remaining long at this point would be wise to switch from shares to calls, given that there's no opportunity cost from doing so in the form of a lost dividend. To paraphrase a politician whom I confess to disliking intensely, “let me be clear,” I’m not suggesting that buying calls is a good idea at this point. I think the combination of ongoing losses and expensive stock is a dangerous combination that will harm investors at some point. I state that to head off complaints from some readers who will interpret my risk minimization strategy as somehow bullish. I am not bullish. I am quite bearish on this name.I must acknowledge, though, that the market is sometimes disconnected from reality, and that speculative manias last much longer than I expect. Obviously, investors had access to the same data as me, and decided to drive the shares higher. It’s to those people that I am expressing an alternative. If you insist on maintaining a bullish stance here, you’d be wise-selling the stock and using call options as a proxy for the stock. These give you most of any upside the stock might enjoy from these levels at far less risk.In particular, if I were long this name I’d sell my shares and buy the May call with a strike price of $22.5. At the moment, the ask on these calls is $2.60. This means that for risking only 12.5% of the capital that is currently at risk, an investor can capture most of any further upside from this name. That means, of course, that they can take 87.5% of their capital and can invest it in something much safer. This strategy gives most of the benefit at far less cost in terms of risk.I think investors would be wise to sell these shares at these levels. The stock is very expensive, and the company shows no signs of being profitable. That said, I think it’s possible for mania to remain in place for some time, and I think speculators who are loathe to abandon this name would be wise to switch to calls. For a fraction of the capital employed, they get access to any upside the shares will continue to generate. To most people I recommend selling this name. I urge those who don’t find my arguments compelling to at least strongly consider switching to calls. I think doing so will end up protecting investor capital."
4189656,104556,2018-07-24T17:34:43-04:00,"Pure Storage is a technology leader in solid-state drives.The company's disruptive business model has resulted in happy customers.Though the company has been very innovative, fears of commoditization allow the stock to be bought for a reasonable valuation.","Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG), maker of flash-array storage devices, is a solid investment because of its disruptive business model, high customer satisfaction, and reasonable valuation.Pure Storage sells solid-state drives (SSDs), sometimes known as flash-arrays. SSDs have no moving parts compared to its counterpart, the spinning hard-disk drive (HDD). This enables faster recall of your data, resulting in faster processing speeds and more storage space. In short, SSDs are the superior technology.According to this article, the difference is night and day. An HDD is like walking across the room and opening a book to find information, whereas an SSD is more similar to the internet in that information pretty much just appears.Unsurprisingly, most data centers have switched to SSDs and a lot of new laptops will contain this storage technology. One may guess that, as SSDs become more universal, they will become commoditized as a piece of hardware. But Pure Storage has gone great lengths to fend off this potential problem.The company's software, called Purity, allows IT professionals to manage storage operations from a cloud-based environment. Similar to how Arista (NYSE:ANET) focuses on software-defined networking switches, Pure Storage puts a big emphasis on its software as a differentiator.But that is just the beginning. The company also provides an Evergreen model where customers subscribe and get automatic storage updates since the software is cloud-based. This model is pretty disruptive in the SSD space and it has earned Pure Storage a top spot by Gartner (NYSE:IT).Source: Analyst Day PresentationBut the company hasn't stopped there. A recent announcement about container storage-as-a-service shows the company is not slowing down anytime soon. This isn't to mention the company's somewhat new product, FlashBlade, and its emphasis on AI infrastructure while teaming up with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).All of these innovations have resulted in happy customers. The company boasts an 83.7 NPS (net promoter score), a proxy for customer satisfaction. To put this number in perspective, the industry average is around 23. Peer review sites also give the company 4.8 stars.What's more is that Pure Storage's top 25 customers spent about 11x their initial purchase amount within 18 months. Once customers see what Pure's software-defined SSDs can do for them, they continue buying more.This has surely shown up in the financials as well. The company grew revenues 40% to $256 million. To break that down, product sales, which make up about 80% of total revenues grew 37% whereas support services grew at a faster 52%. Interestingly enough, gross margins came in at 65%. Clearly, the company's product has not been commoditized. To give some context, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) gross margin is usually around the mid-to-high 30%s. So just from the numbers, you can see Pure's pricing power.Source: Q1 PresentationIn the last three years, Pure's revenues more than doubled to over $1 billion. At the same time, operating losses have narrowed immensely. Last quarter, non-GAAP operating losses shrunk from 14% of sales to 6% and free cash flow was almost at breakeven compared to -15% of sales in Q1 of last year. The company non-GAAP profitability this year and I believe they will continue to show operating and cash flow leverage.Source: Q1 PresentationPure Storage, for fears of it just being a hardware provider, trades at a reasonable valuation, when taking into account revenue growth and operating leverage. The market cap is $5.5 billion, but backing out the $1.1 billion in cash on its balance sheet, the enterprise value comes out to $4.4 billion. Full-year sales estimates come in at $1.35 billion, but that will likely prove conservative. This results in a 3.2 forward EV/sales ratio, a bargain by many measures. Since the company is not profitable on an earnings basis, a forward EV/sales is a good valuation metric. The enterprise value backs out cash which is more appropriate and the market is generally forward looking, so this is why I like using this metric.Source: Q1 PresentationIf the company can continue to become more profitable and bring down its sales and marketing costs, which most recently were 48% of sales, the valuation will look even better.Though Pure Storage has been successful in garnering customer's thus far, the company faces tough competition. NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) is a relative giant in the storage space with a market cap of over $21 billion. It focuses on all sorts of cloud-based environments and its flash-arrays portion of sales has been growing very quickly as of late. The company is placed below Pure by Gartner in the Magic Quadrant which is telling considering NetApp's quantity of resources.The company also does face the supposed risk of commoditization and proprietary hardware. Most customers do not like being locked into specific hardware deals, so that will be something to watch for in Pure's future product announcements. If management focuses more on proprietary hardware than the differentiation within its software environment, that might be an indicator of possible greed. The NPS score should reflect customer dissatisfaction but a decrease in this score will likely be hidden by the company rather than put in plain view.That is all to say, if Pure doesn't focus on the customers, it likely will become commoditized. However, I believe the company is in good hands, especially with its relatively new CEO Charlie Giancarlo, former Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) exec.Pure Storage is an innovative company, whose disruptive business model, high customer satisfaction, and reasonable valuation make for a solid investment. The company is on the cutting edge of storage, an under-loved portion of IT that has real ramifications for performance. I recommend buying the shares at this price and think investors will be rewarded in the long run.Author's Note: Please scroll up and hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button so you can get these articles before they hit the paywall.

4201125,103480,2018-08-22T05:25:59-04:00,"Pure Storage soared nearly 10% after reporting Q2 results, the first time in three quarters that investors have cheered an earnings release from the company.Revenues grew at an impressive 38% y/y, continuing last quarter's rapid growth pace and beating Wall Street expectations by a respectable margin.Gross margins also reached a record high in the quarter, and the company achieved a massive trimming of operating losses.Pure Storage also modestly raised its guidance range for the year.","It's been a while since we've had a positive earnings reaction for Pure Storage (PSTG), the fast-growing vendor of flash storage products. The company has never failed to beat Wall Street expectations (see Pure's perfect earnings track record below), yet investors typically dump the stock post-earnings. This time around, a combination of strong growth and impressive margin progress was able to woo investors into being more positive on the name.Figure 1. Pure Storage earnings recordSource: Seeking AlphaHardware stocks - and especially, those rooted in the storage industry - are inherently cheaper than their software and internet peers. This isn't without reason - hardware companies are much more difficult to scale, and even at larger revenue sizes, hardware companies' ultimate profitability potential is much less than a software or internet company's potential due to the latter's high margins.But with Pure Storage, we have to ask whether the company belongs strictly to the hardware realm. Certainly, the company's gross margins in the high 60s (which, thanks to an increase in support gross margins, hit a record high this quarter) is far more akin to a software or internet company's gross margin than it is to a commodity hardware producer. ~70% gross margins indicate that Pure has tremendously valuable IP that can scale up into immense profitability. Furthermore, Pure Storage also boasts fast growth near 40%, which is also much closer to a software or internet company's growth rates rather than a bona fide, ""legacy"" hardware vendor.Yet, despite Pure Storage's obvious advantages among its hardware peer group, the stock has perennially traded at cheap multiples. Even after accounting for Pure Storage's post-Q2 rally, the shares are currently still trading about flat to where it was last quarter, despite the progress it's made on both the top and bottom lines.PSTG data by YChartsIn my view, with shares just trading at barely over 3x forward revenues, there's plenty of opportunity for Pure Storage to ride higher. Note also that Pure Storage has just nudged its guidance range for FY18 higher - up to $1.35-$1.38 billion in revenues, raised by $10 million from a prior guide of $1.32-$1.37 billion and higher at the midpoint than Wall Street consensus of $1.36 billion.Figure 2. Pure Storage guidance updateSource: Pure Storage investor relationsOn the qualitative side, this is a Gartner award-winning storage vendor that has won the love of its customers and the support of the IT community - and on top of that, its financial profile and margins are extremely attractive, with GAAP losses slimming and operating cash flows expanding rapidly. Sentiment on this stock is far less enthusiastic than the company deserves.Stay long on Pure Storage - the company has demonstrated an incredible track record for sales execution as well as discipline on the cost front, and the company also manages to stay ahead of the technological curve in dominating the flash storage space. This is a hardware company to bet on for the long haul.Here's a look at Pure Storage's Q2 results:Figure 3. Pure Storage Q2 resultsSource: Pure Storage investor relationsTotal revenues grew 38% y/y to $308.9 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $301.2 million (+34% y/y) by a solid four points. Last quarter, revenues had grown at 40% y/y, beating Wall Street expectations by two points - so Pure Storage is largely continuing the strength it saw last quarter.The company enjoyed a significant customer expansion in the quarter, adding 400 net new customers to end the quarter at 5,150 total customers. Tim Ritters, the company's CFO, called out ""solid business fundamentals"" and ""strong execution by our go-to-market teams"" as the major drivers of the outperformance.Perhaps even more important, however, was that Pure Storage hit an all-time gross margin high in the quarter, up to 66.7% on a GAAP basis and up 170 bps from 65.0% in the year-ago quarter. Support margins, in particular, leaped ahead by 650 bps from 2Q18 to 2Q19, reversing the lower-margin segment of Pure Storage's business.It's important to note that a dip in gross margins was one of the reasons Pure Storage's shares tanked last quarter. In Q1, total gross margin of 66.3% represents a 10 bps year-over-year drop and a 130 bps decline in product gross margins.On a pro forma basis, Pure Storage's gross margin of 68.0% hit the company's long-term gross margin target at exactly 68%. Here's some additional color from the company's CFO on gross margin performance, made during the prepared remarks on the earnings call:It wasn't just gross margin that outperformed on the cost side this quarter, however. Operating expenses also declined by 980 bps as a percentage of revenues, driven primarily by a huge downsizing of sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue:Figure 4. Pure Storage opex reductionsSource: Pure Storage investor relationsPro forma operating margins rose to 0.3% in the quarter - the first time Pure Storage has hit a positive operating margin in the second quarter, and up 1,060 bps from -10.3% in 2Q18. Cash flow from operations also hit a positive $8.5 million in the quarter, a reversal from a loss of -$0.2 million in 2Q18.Pro forma EPS also hit $0.01 in the quarter, a surprise for Wall Street analysts whose consensus target pinned EPS at -$0.06.Pure Storage might be a hardware company, but it certainly scales like a software or internet company. By this, I mean that the company is able to produce strong top-line growth along with large margin expansion. Though Pure Storage still has room to improve its profitability (its pro forma operating margins of 0.3% is still beneath its target state of 15-20%, though the majority of the difference lies in sales and marketing expenses), we can certainly be comfortable with Pure Storage's margins lagging behind long-term targets when growth is still hovering near 40%. And in any case, the ~10 point year-over-year improvement in operating margins this quarter isn't shabby to begin with.The strength of Pure Storage's Q2 results will hopefully help investors to see the company in a more positive light. The company is riding tremendous momentum from both a product and financial perspective, and bullish investors should stay the course."

The company had just reported earnings on May 21st and the stock had sold off sharply on conservative revenue guidance, creating an opportunity to pick up shares of this secular grower. The timing turned out to be particularly fortunate and the stock quickly ran up more than 22% through June 14th. The recent broad market sell-off has created an attractive secondary entry point, as PSTG has pulled back to the mid-May highs and short-term technical support.Source: eSignalPSTG provides software-defined all-flash storage solutions for enterprise scale customers. Their technology replaces traditional mechanical disk storage systems with a flash based solid state memory and was built for today's modern cloud-based environment. The practical implications for users is 5x faster performance, 100x less space for equipment and significantly lower latency when accessing data. This technology is well suited for artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, big data, internet of things (IoT) and cutting-edge computing.You may be familiar with Gartner, the well-known research and advisory firm for the technology sector. Gartner is famous for their ""magic quadrant"", in which the company analyzes industry peers and plots them into four quadrants. As can be seen in the chart below, PSTG is well positioned in Gartner's opinion.Source: Gartner, Link to ArticlePSTG has partnered with key technology infrastructure players such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and cutting-edge product companies such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Their partnership and cross-selling with such well admired and capable companies speaks to the performance and innovation of their product offering. PSTG is a disruptor in its industry and is taking market share from larger competitors.Source: PSTG Corporate PresentationThe opportunity set for PSTG is large, with a total addressable market (TAM) of $35 billion.Source: PSTG Corporate PresentationOn March 1st, PSTG reported earnings (Q4 2018) of $0.13 on revenues of $338 million. Earnings were almost double estimates and revenues were better than expected. This was a significant profitability milestone for the company and set them on a path for full year profitability in fiscal 2019. Revenues also hit a milestone, eclipsing $1 billion for full year fiscal 2018. This also helps put the $35 billion market opportunity I highlighted above into perspective, i.e. they are still a very small in the grand scheme of things.The company was founded in 2009, IPO'ed in 2015 and has not been profitable until Q4 2018. Another significant accomplishment in 2018 was the company generated full-year positive free cash flow for the first time.Source: PSTG Corporate PresentationThis is a significant development, as often companies that are still early in their life cycle like PSTG will post positive earnings but have negative free cash flows. This indicates PSTG has a powerful business model if the company can continue to execute.PSTG reported fiscal first quarter 2019 results on Monday May 21st, after the close. The company beat estimates by $0.05, posting earnings of $-0.07. Revenues grew 40% to $256 million, beating estimates by $4.3 million.The company essentially maintained full year fiscal 2019 revenue guidance at a mid-point of $1.35 billion (+32%) with modestly positive operating margins (0-4%). At that time, the street was forecasting full year earnings of $0.15, which implies the company hits the mid-point of its operating margin target of about 2%.Source: PSTG Corporate PresentationThe stock fell more than 12% the week of earnings, as the market was disappointed with full year 2019 revenue guidance. The company beat by $4.3 million in the quarter but only raised full-year guidance by $1.5 million at the mid-point. On the earnings call, analysts were clearly disappointed with management's conservativism and were probing for the underlying reasons. Management toed the line, citing how pleased they were with 40% revenue growth, etc. I believe this is how PSTG's management ""plays"" the earnings game, under promise and over deliver.The company hired 200 people in the first quarter, which was on plan and may help address some of the concerns around full year sales growth as those employees ramp up into productive roles.Here are some of the key highlights from the conference call.Source: PSTG Corporate PresentationThe company has a market cap of roughly $5.6 billion and $1.1 billion in cash and equivalents. In April, the company issued $500 million in convertible notes to give themselves plenty of flexibility to invest in growth or through acquisition. This was an opportunistic cash raise at attractive levels for the company.The company is in the initial stages of scaling the business and should see significant cost reductions as the business matures, allowing for solid operating margins in the long run.Source: PSTG Corporate PresentationPSTG should also be a beneficiary of the pick-up in corporate CAPEX spending that has been a theme from the first quarter earnings calls. Companies are flush with cash and are spending to upgrade their technology infrastructure. This is one near-term tailwind that the market may not have fully embraced or understands yet.PSTG is a relatively recent ""busted"" IPO, i.e. the company IPO'ed at $17 in late 2015 and almost immediately fell below that level for a sustained period of time. The stock traded below $10 as recently as May 2017 but has now recovered and just exceeded the old 2015 highs in early 2018.Source: eSignalThis is a significant amount of ""base building"" and gives the stock a very favorable technical setup. The company has had to prove itself to the investment community and the fact that the company just printed its first profitable quarter is very significant. This newfound success will attract the attention of new investors who would not typically invest in a company that is not profitable.The stock trades at 2.96x 12-month forward Enterprise Value/Forward 12-month Sales (EV/Sales), which is a significant discount to the 4.34x for peers. Peers include NTAP, NTNX, ANET and JNPR. I believe the company trades at a discount to peers due to concerns about its sustainable competitive advantage vs. larger and more diversified competitors such as NetApp and Dell EMC.Source: Thomson ReutersCharles Giancarlo, who had experience at Cisco and private equity firm Silver Lake Partners became CEO in August 2017. A new CEO is often a positive development, as the company's board brings in someone with the skill set to take a young, fast growing company to the next level. The past two quarters appear to validate this thought process.PSTG is a volatile stock and not for the faint of heart, but the ""setup"" for PSTG is attractive from a fundamental, technical and valuation perspective. This makes PSTG an attractive portfolio candidate for investors who can tolerate the risk of a mid-cap, high beta technology stock."
4162116,98236,2018-04-10T12:25:00-04:00,Pure recently sold a substantial issue of convertible debt.The interest rate was 0.125% with a premium of more than 32% at the time the debt was sold.Pure's valuation continues to languish at levels suggesting a murky future for this high-growth company.All indications continue to suggest that guidance will prove conservative and growth will remain at elevated levels.This is one high-growth company that's showing noticeable increases in profitability due both to growth and strong expense discipline.,"Last week, there were two interesting developments in the enterprise storage space. One of those events was the NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) analyst day. The presentations portrayed a business emerging from a transition and achieving moderate long-term growth with strong margins and cash flow. The company announced that it was doubling its dividend, ratcheting up share repurchases and raising guidance for both revenue growth and earnings. The shares reacted positively in the context of the grim market action at the end of last week.The other event probably has slipped from the news headlines without many dots being drawn. Pure Storage (PSTG) announced that it was selling $500 million of debt (possibly $575 million depending on over-allotments) convertible at a price of $26.27/share. After Friday’s price action, the premium is 42%. The offering closed on April 9 and was the company’s first foray into the convertible debt market. The offering is uncannily similar to a similar transaction that Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) made a few months ago. Of course, these kinds of offerings are not unknown in the tech space with companies such as Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow (NOW) recently selling convertible debt that featured a zero interest rate and a large premium. At the time of the Nutanix transaction, its debt offered buyers a conversion feature with a 33% premium.Some investors look at dilution in considering offerings or convertible debt. The problem with that kind of analysis is that no one knows what Pure will do with the capital raise. Since it is cash flow positive and has about $600 million of cash and equivalents, it doesn't need the money for operational purposes. It almost will surely use the funds to buy other companies and hence accelerate growth. So, dilution is really not an appropriate concept to consider in this situation. That being said, potential dilution in terms of an increase in outstanding shares would be a bit less than 9% - of course, for that to happen, the shares would have to reach more than $26/share at which time I doubt there would be much interest in dilution.It has been nearly six months since I last wrote about Pure. The shares are up by about 25% since that time. The IGV index has appreciated 12.5% over the same time span. Despite the appreciation, the shares have actually seen valuation metrics compress a bit because of the company’s rapid growth and substantial turn to profitability and to positive free cash flow. So, given the announcement of the offering, which I think is an interesting signpost, I thought it would be interesting to write about the company again. My conclusion at this point is essentially the same as my conclusion six months ago. Pure is an under-appreciated business, with excellent prospects within a market that has started to show encouraging growth. Pure continues to gain share and has exhibited signs of achieving leverage at scale. At this point, it's starting to generate positive free cash flow, significantly sooner than had previously been I expected.All that said, I do not expect that Pure shares will match the performance of Nutanix in the wake of its offering. But then, I didn’t know that Nutanix shares would appreciate 50% after the close of its offering, either. I do not have that kind of second sight. While both companies are both considered to be part of the overall enterprise storage space, they really do not compete.Overall, I suspect that HCI, for many reasons, probably has a bit more potential in terms of percentage growth, compared to enterprise storage. That said, the latest sales figures for All-Flash Arrays, the market category in which Pure competes, grew by more than 38% year on year, according to IDC, which provides the most widely accepted compilation of such statistics. The $1.6 billion of revenue reported last quarter for AFA is still less than sales of hybrid flash arrays, which were $2.3 billion in the period. And overall, IDC reports that enterprise storage sales last quarter were $12 billion. I think it's reasonable to assume that all of the hybrid revenues will disappear and that AFA will command the market in the next few years. So, there's plenty of growth opportunity for Pure, even within its current space, and it will be certainly expanding its TAM through acquisition and through the exploitation of “adjacencies.”Pure’s current revenues are only a bit more than $250 million/quarter, which might suggest the magnitude of its opportunity. At this point, Pure is not even within the top five of enterprise storage vendors in the IDC compilation. The top five currently, based on share ranking, are Hewlett Packard (HPE) and its Chinese partner, the New H3C Group, EMC/Dell, NetApp, IBM (IBM), and Hitachi (OTCPK:HTHIY).Just by the way, the title of this article comes from the last song composed by George Gershwin, ""Our Love is Here to Stay."" The current revenue for forecast for Pure is for 38% revenue growth this current quarter, moderating noticeably to 31% for the entire fiscal year and to 26% for fiscal year 2020 (ends 1/31). At some level, current estimates do not mean a great deal. Estimates have been steadily rising for both revenues and for earnings. The company has been public for almost exactly a year, and it has beaten its forecast in all of the quarters it has so far reported. Despite operational performance that has consistently beat prior estimates and despite strongly positive trends in the forecast for both earnings and revenue growth over the past several quarters, Pure shares haven’t been able to attract a preponderance of favorable analyst commentary. At the moment, of 22 analysts who cover the name, according to First Call, there are 12 buys and 10 holds/sells. About two months ago, Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall initiated Pure with a sell rating. About one month ago, Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini lowered his rating from buy to sell.The GS analyst simply refuses the evidence that Dell remains as it has been since its consolidation, a market share donor. He continues to feel that rhetoric, particularly about pricing and sales execution, is a substitute for product benefits. Dell may have hired storage sale specialists and it continues to talk about its “refuse to lose” initiatives, but lose it does. The fact remains that the EMC/Dell combination, with its mountain of debt and rather complex ownership structure, is not optimal for a competitive market. Dell is restructuring, consolidating and attempting to remediate costs - because it has to do so in order to generate cash flow to pay off its mountain of debt. It is a large company, and it is not run by inept leaders - but at this point, its focus is not on market share but trying to defend its turf while still generating cash. Part of Pure’s current success and likely future share gains simply has to do with that phenomenon, and it can’t be changed by posturing.One can readily argue about the valuation of Pure, particularly given the guidance the company provided, regarding its second half. I think Pure will substantially exceed its guidance. Others may not wish to have such an optimistic forecast. On the other hand, the assertion that Dell is about to land competitive blows on Pure, simply because it is hiring storage sales specialists and saying that it will, is without any more substantive foundation than my assertion that I will lose 100 lbs. And I will leave it at that.The company’s shares fell about 7% a month ago in the wake of its earnings report because of its guidance, which was only in line and represented slowing growth. The strong growth acceleration the company achieved last quarter and its significant turn to profitability were basically ignored by investors and by most analysts because of the view of many that guidance was less than hoped. Most recently, Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron raised the shares to a “Top Pick” with an upside potential of $40 and a price target of $24. Well, let’s not get carried away - the upside potential is based on an EV/S estimate of 5X, which is probably more than a hardware vendor is likely to achieve in the foreseeable future.Investors remain very dubious about the prospects for enterprise storage. And investors remain dubious as well that Pure has built or will be able to retain a competitive moat in what's perceived as a highly competitive space. There are reasons for those views that relate to historical performance in this sector. And while history is often an appropriate guide to the future, in this case, one needs to evaluate history a bit more carefully before making analogies and correlations.Just for the record, the storage space historically was considered a growth wunderkind and spawned many companies that were either acquired at substantial premiums or whose stocks were once market darlings. It may stretch the memory of some readers, but even a company that nowadays languishes in valuation purgatory such as NetApp was once considered a high-growth vehicle. Of course, that was before the cloud came along and upset everyone’s growth calculations.There are several revolutions that have rocked the storage world. The first of these was the advent of flash. For decades, users had employed spinning discs in various configurations and with a variety of technologies for back-up and recovery. And then, at the start of this decade, all-flash-arrays became practical from a cost standpoint. Initially, flash was mainly used as part of a caching scheme or in hybrid configurations. But at this point, it seems evident that within the next few years, almost all deployed storage will be flash - it is cheap, reliable and has advantages in terms of size, power consumption and heat dissipation that make it the medium of choice for the foreseeable future. That transition nearly did in NetApp and spawned quite a few vendors, most of whom were not particularly successful. Anyone remember Fusion-io or Violin? It is these sad stories of failed storage ventures, along with a few others with mediocre endings such as 3-Par, that have led some observers to their belief that the environment these days is not conducive to the ultimate success of start-up storage vendors.But in addition to the advent of flash, and most lately, the advent of NVMe technology as well, came the cloud. Prior to a few years ago, users kept essentially all of their storage on-premise and storage volumes grew at prodigious rates. The percentage growth in storage volumes hasn’t waned particularly. Last quarter, IDC estimated that capacity shipments were up by 22% year on year. The increase in capacity shipments has actually shown a bit of accelerating growth with the advent of Big Data and AI. But what has changed is that much of the growth is being captured by what are called the “hyper-scalers.” These are the businesses such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Facebook (FB), Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and others that have built hyperscale data centers and use what are called original design manufacturers (ODMs) that sell their products directly to these vendors. These ODMs are mainly Taiwanese vendors such as Quanta, Wistron, and Inventec that can survive on 6-7% gross margins. They sell “white boxes,” and because of their business model, they offer the largest of the hyperscalers significant cost savings.So, last quarter, the hyperscalers accounted for about $2.7 billion of storage purchases, and that was up by about 55% year on year. In the meantime, external storage shipments only grew by 4% but accounted for $5.6 billion of revenues. Pure does derive some revenues from some hyperscalers in particular use cases, but it is not ever really going to play in the white box/ODM market, nor should it.Finally, within the top five vendors, EMC/Dell continued to bleed market share at a substantial rate, losing 250 basis points of share and seeing a 4% revenue decline year on year. Hitachi lost about 90 basis points of share and saw revenues decline 5.4% while the other two of the other leaders managed a bit of growth, and NetApp showed 19% growth and a gain of more than 150 bps in its market share.When analysts write about this segment, and rate Pure as a sell, they do so because of their concerns about the 4% growth in external storage and fears of a resurgent Dell cutting prices and engaging in aggressive promotions in an effort to ward off further losses in market share. From my perspective, the logic in that kind of a call is badly flawed. The storage segment has been hotly competitive in all of the time I have ever known about it, and that extends back for several decades. Pure has had an “x” on its back so far as Dell has been concerned for some period of time now. The results, as compiled by IDC, speak for themselves.And there's a reason for that. Storage is not as fungible as some observers may believe. I do not propose to go into all of the reasons why users choose storage. But price is most certainly not the only, or even principal, consideration. Usually, bake-offs come down to a set of feature/function items that provide differentiation, and almost always price is computed based on total cost of ownership. As a smaller vendor, Pure has to have advantages in order to be considered in a competitive situation. Some of those advantages, or the competitive moat if you prefer, are likely to be of long standing.There are several elements in evaluating the investment case for Pure shares. One key factor is whether or not the company has developed a defensible and long-lasting moat. When Pure started, it was somewhat unique in never offering anything other than All-Flash-Arrays. At this point, everyone who competes credibly in the storage space has a similar offering. Pure has been rated the leader in solid-state arrays by Gartner for four years now, and I have no reason to imagine that it will be displaced from that rating when the new Gartner report on solid-state arrays is published in July. Without getting involved in the details, Pure offers what it calls an Evergreen Storage Gold program that makes changes and upgrades to its storage substantially easier than is the case for most of its competitors, and in particular Dell. The company also provided its users with an upgrade path to what's called NVMe that will prove to be simpler than that provided by most competitors.Pure is a partner with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) (the offering is called FlashStack) that provides the storage Cisco uses in its HCI offering. Just how substantial this opportunity might be is difficult to say at this point. The partnership was announced a few years ago, but Cisco has been rather slow in ramping its HCI effort. That said, at this point, Cisco/Pure have 1,400 cumulative customers, and it has allowed Pure's growth to be bolstered by the burgeoning of the HCI market. Clearly, even after several years, a company such as Pure needs validation in the market space from a vendor like Cisco as it moves up-market and sells to the largest enterprises.Pure also is a partner of Nvidia (NVDA) in which Pure’s storage is used to enable AI and analytic solutions. In addition, the companies collaborate to create an architecture that facilitates what's called GRID, a solution that's used to create workstations that facilitate so-called virtual, rich graphics. The partnership is apparently creating some higher-profile wins with users such as Volvo and Autoliv.Over the past year, Pure delivered the first NVMe FlashArray. Just what kind of a lead Pure has in this technology is surely a contentious issue and one subject to claims and counterclaims. At this point, NVMe technology is 20% of Pure shipments and rising fast. I simply do not know how that compares to other NVMe offerings at this point.But I'm inclined to believe that the success Pure has achieved in the market has something to do with being perceived by users as a technology leader. Pure also developed an active cluster technology. How does its cluster technology compare to that of its competitors? I think it would be foolish for me to claim to be able to evaluate that technology and compare and contrast it to alternatives. The company has claimed some early commercial success in offering both of these capabilities - they are differentiators, although ones that will certainly be challenged over the coming quarters.Some comments on FlashBlade seem almost de-rigueur for anyone writing about Pure and its product differentiation. FlashBlade has engendered a substantial amount of controversy among some observers who doubt its ability to be successful. For those unfamiliar with the offering, it provides storage for performance intensive, unstructured data workloads, which are key elements in facilitating AI and machine learning. The solution also is used as part of back-up solutions where users want almost instantaneous data restoration capability. FlashBlade is often sold alongside of or as an adjunct to FlashArray, and taken together, do offer the Pure solution something of a competitive moat. Most large storage vendors offer unstructured data solutions. Some years ago, EMC bought Isilon. The opportunity for Pure is that Dell has under-invested in Isilon and FlashBlade has a competitive opportunity.Does Pure have a level of differentiation and technology leadership that can stand up under competitive pressures? I believe it does, an assertion validated by the company’s rapid ascent and market share gains. The company spends 22% of its revenues on a GAAP basis on R&D and that's actually down significantly from former spend ratios. They appear to be getting a significant bang for their buck, and I expect that will continue to be the case.As mentioned earlier in this article, were Pure to see growth at the level it has forecast, it might be concerning, and that's why the shares reacted poorly to the earnings release. If the company has differentiated solutions as I believe to be the case, and partnerships that are bearing fruit as well, it will continue to exceed its forecast by a noticeable amount, and that will be particularly true in the last of the current fiscal year. I'm inclined to imagine that the demand for Pure’s convertible debt and the terms it was able to achieve are a function of the company’s most updated forecasts and intimations of the market opportunities it is pursuing.Last quarter, Pure achieved non-GAAP profitability. That really was overlooked in the furor over the company’s growth projections but is significant nonetheless. Overall, in the quarter, the company achieved an improvement of 1,300 basis points in operating margins on a GAAP basis. Almost all of that is a function of an improvement in operating expense ratios as gross margins remained at about 65% last quarter. Management has forecast that it will achieve some moderate growth in gross margins this year, particularly based on scale improvements in the cost of support. Product gross margins can be volatile due to mix and the faster growth from FlashBlade revenues can marginally impact product gross margins.Over the past fiscal year, the company saw operating expenses fall from 152% of revenues to 126% of revenues and the growth of GAAP operating expenses was 19%. Based on extrapolations from company guidance, operating expense growth is expected to be more or less comparable in dollars, and of course, lower in terms of percentages this current fiscal year. If revenue growth exceeds the current guidance of just greater than 30%, the opportunity for substantial margin expansion is substantial.Stock-based comp was not a material factor in the company’s margin improvement in Q4, although it was a considerable factor for the fiscal year as a whole. Overall, stock-based comp rose by 13% last quarter, and by 29% last year.The company doesn’t forecast free cash flows at this point. Last year, operating cash flow went from negative to positive, and it increased by 57% last quarter. The improvement in cash flow was mainly a function of the improvement in profitability and the growth in deferred revenue. Receivable growth was actually elevated last quarter in dollar terms because of the seasonal and secular growth in revenues.Overall, the company had a negligible annual free cash flow margin for the full year although, in Q4, its free cash flow margin reached 11%. I expect, based on looking at the sources of cash flow, that free cash flow margins will continue to exceed non-GAAP operating margins by several hundred basis points on an annual basis. My guess, which is all that it can be, is that free cash flow margins next year will be in the 7%-8% range and that free cash flow dollars will reach about $110 million.Yes, Pure is a hardware company, and notionally, hardware companies have had far more compressed valuations than software companies. The age-old question of differentiation and competitive moats is the major factor for that discrepancy - the question of how wide it should be is not susceptible to substantive resolution. I'm certainly not likely to settle that argument in this argument in this article.Based on a slightly more positive growth estimate for this company for this year, my belief is that the EV/S ratio is currently at 2.4X. I think a 2.4X ratio, even for a hardware company, is quite modest given the strong improvements the company is achieving in profitability and cash flow.At this point, the P/E ratio is still not meaningful, although again, operating margin improvement will be more substantial than the currently forecast First Call consensus if revenue growth is better than currently projected - a consummation I anticipate.Based on my projection of $110 million of free cash flow, the current free cash flow yield is about 3.2%. That is, perhaps, an average value for that metric, for a company growing at close to 40%, but the substantial improvements in both GAAP profitability and deferred revenue growth are going to drive that number strongly higher for the foreseeable future.Pure shares continue to be undervalued, and less regarded than they should, in the opinion of this writer. Currently, as previously mentioned, First Call is reporting 12 buys and 10 holds in addition to the GS sell recommendation. This company has strong operating momentum in a space that's coming back to life. I expect it to produce strong positive alpha in the next year."
4176071,103480,2018-05-22T04:50:47-04:00,"Pure Storage dropped yet again after another earnings beat, losing nearly 10% in after-hours trading.Revenues grew 40% y/y and outperformed analysts' expectations by two points.Investors bristled, however, as gross margins dipped slightly and Q2 guidance came in-line with expectations.Earnings dips have historically proven to be timely buying opportunities in this undervalued storage stock.","It's the same old story with Pure Storage (PSTG): earnings beat, lackluster guidance, huge post-earnings drop. You'd think that investors would have gotten used to the pattern by now - fortunately for opportunists who can see longer term, recent history tells us that Pure Storage is almost always a strong buy on earnings dips. Last quarter, Pure Storage's Q4 earnings beat and in-line Q1 guidance caused the stock to tank by almost exactly the same amount - yet the company quickly recovered to flat and over the course of the quarter, shares appreciated by more than 20%.In my view, as long as we're comfortable with the results that Pure Storage posted in Q1, then we ought to be brave enough to keep adding shares for the long term. I'll admit that the slight drop in gross margins in the quarter is somewhat concerning, as it indicates a much more competitive industry (one of the biggest banes of the storage sector, which many investors fear is becoming more and more commoditized). But on the other hand, a 10bps drop in total gross margin and 130bps drop in product gross margin is small enough to be a fluke. As Elon Musk said on the Tesla (TSLA) earnings call, let's not make a federal case out of it.Shares of Pure Storage dropped nearly 10% in after-hours trading in response to the gross margin weakness as well as in-line Q2 guidance, creating yet another timely buying opportunity in this perennially volatile name:PSTG data by YChartsOf course, large pullbacks after strong earnings have been a common theme this quarter - but typically among overvalued stocks, where perfection has been priced in and investors expect the companies to perform well enough to justify their premiums. In Pure Storage's case, however, the company is far from being a high-flyer on the valuation front.Pure Storage's most recent share count, as of its March 10-K filing, is 229.2 million shares. At the company's post-earnings price of ~$22 per share, Pure Storage has a current market cap of $5.04 billion. If we net off the $1.11 billion in cash on Pure Storage's balance sheet, and add back $430.3 million of debt, the company has a current enterprise value of $4.36 billion.Against the midpoint of Pure Storage's refreshed FY19 guidance of $1.32-$1.37 billion in revenues (representing a growth range 29-34% y/y), Pure Storage has a valuation of 3.24x EV/FY19 revenues. That's exceedingly cheap for a company with a growth range in the mid-30s and a gross margin approaching 70%. It's true that the storage sector typically doesn't have highly valued comps against which to benchmark Pure Storage, but on a holistic basis, the company looks extremely attractive - especially when we consider that Pure Storage just turned free cash flow positive last year and should continue to expand FCF this year.Figure 1. Pure Storage guidanceSource: Pure Storage investor relationsHere's a good juncture to insert a note on Pure Storage's guidance - even though Q2 guidance of $296-$304 million appears underwhelming against Wall Street's expectations for $299.4 million, Pure Storage has been a predictably conservative giver of guidance.Originally, Pure Storage had guided to $246-$254 million in revenues for Q1 (35-39% y/y), against consensus expectations of $247.6 million. Yet when the company actualized Q2 results, its revenues of ~$256 million came in over the high end of its original guidance.Just like last quarter, consensus expectations landed in the middle of Pure Storage's guidance range - but if history holds, Pure Storage will likely exceed against the top end of that range. For a stock that's able to execute with this amount of consistency, it deserves to trade at a revenue multiple far in excess of 3.2x.Here's a look at Pure Storage's results in the first quarter:Figure 2. Pure Storage Q1 results and supplementary dataSource: Pure Storage investor relationsRevenues grew 40% y/y to $255.9 million, which as previously mentioned exceeded the top end of Pure Storage's Q1 guidance range, as well as exceeded analysts' expectations of $251.5 million (+38% y/y) by two points. The beat margin is roughly the same as the three-point beat Pure Storage had to consensus expectations in Q1. Admittedly, however, revenues showed a fairly significant deceleration from the 48% y/y growth that Pure Storage had in Q4.The fourth quarter, however, typically is a strong quarter for IT buying activity as IT managers dump the rest of their budgets, so the slowdown in Q1 might be an adjustment to strength in Q4 rather than a true deceleration that will trend forward. It's more than likely that Pure Storage can retain ~40% growth in Q2, and in any case, the company's full-year guidance only calls for total growth of 29-34% y/y, so it still has room to decelerate in the back half of the year and meet its revenue targets.Where investors really zoomed in, however, was on the loss of 10bps of total gross margin and a 130bps drop in product gross margins. Here's the commentary that Pure Storage's CFO shared on the topic during the earnings call:If we take his comments at face value and chalk up the slight gross margin decline to some seasonality effects, then we have justification in hoping that the issue will rectify by Q2. In any case, a 130bps y/y drop and 20bps sequential drop is not significant enough to drop a stock by 10%.On the bright side, Pure Storage was able to scale down all components of its operating expenses as a percentage of revenues to drive expanded operating margins, despite the small gross margin declines. Total operating expenses grew only 29% y/y to $228.2 million to support 40% of revenue growth. As a result, pro forma operating margins saw a huge 790bps lift to -6.0% from -13.9% in the year-ago quarter, essentially putting Pure Storage at very close to break-even. Pro forma EPS of -$0.07 also represented a strong beat over Wall Street's expectations for -$0.12.In my opinion, the 790bps of improvement in the operating margin far outweighs the concerns of a 130bps drop in gross margin. Furthermore, Pure Storage managed to turn an operating cash flow loss of -$14.3 million in 1Q18 into a gain of $18.6 million this quarter. With margins consistently tracking higher quarter after quarter with robust growth still in the 40s, Pure Storage is becoming a strong cash flow story as well:Figure 3. Pure Storage Q1 operating cash flowsSource: Pure Storage investor relationsIn my opinion, Pure Storage's pullback will be just as short-lived as it was last quarter. A 10% earnings decline should be reserved for true misses - when in fact, Pure Storage's quarterly results were more mixed. Growth came in ahead of expectations, while operating margin improvements offset small losses on the gross margin side. And on the guidance front, we've already seen from past history that Pure Storage typically exceeds even its high guidance.Buying Pure Storage on pullbacks has almost always been a wise move. With results still tracking well in Q1, I'm sticking to my guns and adding to my position."
4265776,103480,2019-05-22T10:28:18-04:00,"Shares of Pure Storage cratered approximately 10% after reporting dismal Q1 results that missed Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines.Despite revenues clocking in lower than Pure Storage's guidance ranges, note that growth actually accelerated several points relative to Q4's growth rate of 24% y/y.Pure Storage's EPS miss was also primarily driven by a jump in sales and marketing spend, which may spur accelerated revenue growth in future quarters.This is Pure Storage's second consecutive earnings disappointment.Despite near-term challenges, Pure Storage's rich near-70% gross margin is still best-in-class in the hardware sector, giving investors plenty of reason to buy.","If last quarter for Pure Storage (PSTG) was bad, this quarter got much worse. After missing top and bottom line estimates in Q4 as well as guiding softly for Q1 in March, Pure Storage ended up generating revenues below the low end of its Q1 range, as well as repeating a dour outlook for Q2. Unsurprisingly, shares were battered as a result: Pure Storage lost 10% in the immediate after-hours response to the quarter, slamming the stock well below $20:Data by YChartsThe question for investors now: is Pure Storage a buy after its fall from grace, or have fundamentals shifted for the worse?Certainly it's not just Pure Storage facing secular headwinds. Over the past several weeks, China-related drama has weighed heavily on the hardware/storage/chip sectors. Leading NAND flash supplier Micron (MU), for one, has lost approximately 20% of its market value since Trump announced that trade talks were stalling. Similarly, Pure Storage has now lost more than 30% relative to its April highs, driven in large part by fears that large Chinese OEMs will halt their purchases.And then there are non-macro factors at play. Pure Storage has missed revenue expectations for two quarters in a row now, suggesting that its greater scale has put the company at a point of saturation. After all, Pure Storage operates in a largely commoditized market that has seen many smaller incumbents, like Tintri, fold and go bankrupt. Among the power players still remaining in the space are NetApp (NTAP), another huge memory vendor. In short - it would be a mistake to think that Pure Storage dominates its space and is immune to competitive pressures.That being said, I believe the reasons to be long Pure Storage handily outweigh the bearish factors, especially at Pure Storage's new attractive low price. I'd point to Pure Storage's margins as a key bullish driver here - Pure Storage hit gross margin records this quarter as well as a seasonal high for a Q1 period. Note as well that though we typically think of Pure Storage as a commoditized vendor of storage hardware, its near-70% gross margin suggests otherwise. Clearly, Pure Storage's value-add to customers has allowed it sustain a premium software-like margin for years.While we are concerned about the prospect of near-term deceleration, it's fair to say that expectations for this stock are now low (given two consecutive quarters of earnings and guidance misses), and there is far more upside risk than downside.Next quarter's guidance, for example, isn't as bad as the initial reaction might suggest. Pure Storage is pointing to $389-$401 million in revenues, representing a growth range of +26-30% y/y - more or less bracketing this quarter's growth rate of 28% y/y. The $395 million midpoint of this range is more or less in-line with Wall Street's expectations of $396.6 million (+27% y/y).Figure 1. Pure Storage Q2 guidance rangesSource: Pure Storage Q1 earnings deckThe factors driving this quarter's miss may be temporary headwinds, and with expectations muted, Pure Storage has an opportunity to come out on top. Stay long here.Here's a look at how Pure Storage performed in the first quarter:Figure 2. Pure Storage 1Q19 resultsSource: Pure Storage Q1 earnings releaseRevenues grew 28% y/y to $326.7 million, missing the low end of the company's stated guidance range of $327-$339 million by $0.3 million. The company also missed Wall Street's expectations of $333.1 million (+30% y/y) by a punishing two-point margin.There are several bright spots to note here, however, that can help to take some of the sting off the revenue miss. It's quite possible that Pure Storage guided too aggressively for Q1, causing the revenue miss. In Q4, Pure Storage's revenue growth had clocked in at just 24% y/y - so despite the miss, the company actually saw growth accelerate by four points. For a company generating revenues at a >$1 billion annual run rate, this is no small feat.The other bright spot to point out is the fact that Pure Storage is still building deferred revenues at a strong pace. This deferred revenue - which more or less represents the company's revenue ""backlog"" - ensures us that Pure Storage has a robust pipeline to draw on for future quarters.As seen in the chart below, deferred revenue balances hit an all-time high at $564.3 million this quarter, up 45% y/y - and again, that's a two-point acceleration relative to 43% y/y deferred revenue growth in Q4:Figure 3. Pure Storage deferred revenue trendsSource: Pure Storage Q1 earnings deckWhen we move aside from the top line, we also find encouraging points to note in Pure Storage's gross margins - long the highlight of its investment thesis, Pure Storage's near-70% gross margin is one of the best margins within the hardware sector.This quarter, Pure Storage's pro forma gross margins hit both a seasonal (Q1) and all-time high of 68.1%. Note also that Pure Storage's internal long-term goal for gross margins is already at 68.0%, indicating that Pure Storage performed well above its best-case scenario. Versus Q1 of last year, Pure Storage managed to boost margins by 170bps - an incredible accomplishment for a company that has essentially already hit its long-tern target margins.Figure 4. Pure Storage gross margin trendsSource: Pure Storage Q1 earnings deckUnfortunately, despite the gross margin gains, Pure Storage still missed Wall Street's botton-line expectations, due to both the top-line miss as well as a weakening in operating margins that more than offset gross margin strength. Pro forma EPS of -$0.11 missed Wall Street's manure of -$0.08, while free cash flow losses widened to -$17.7 million (from FCF of -$3.7 million in the year-ago quarter, and representing a 400bps weaker FCF margin).The primary driver of this operating margin decline, however, was a 36% y/y jump in sales and marketing spending to $136.6 million. On a pro forma basis, excluding the stock comp component, Pure Storage spent 45% of its revenues on sales and marketing, up 300bps relative to the year-ago period. This drove Pure Storage's operating margins down to -9.6%, 360bps worse than -6.0% in 1Q19.Figure 5. Pure Storage opex breakdownSource: Pure Storage Q1 earnings deckThe silver lining in this is that sales and marketing spend can be thought of as an investment. It's an incredibly ""productive"" expense category. Pure Storage's strategy of adding to its sales headcount and increasing its marketing levers may have the effect of stimulating accelerated revenue growth, which is the company's top near-term issue. As the company begins to diversify away from its legacy flash array products and focuses more on cloud storage and cloud services, a better-fleshed out sales team can help to drive the revenue growth needed to counteract the misses we've seen over the past several quarters.Of course, even the hardiest of Pure Storage bulls have to acknowledge that we've seen concerning growth trends over the past two quarters. Some of this revenue weakness may be macro-driven (China), sone of it could be competition, and some of it could be pushed-out demand (as the deferred revenue builds would suggest). However, there are important silver linings to keep in mind:Overall, I'd say the ~10% decline in Pure Storage shares offers reasonable recompense for investors who are willing to be patient and absorb the loss of sentiment over two quarters of poor results. Pure Storage's cloud-focused storage solutions make it an undoubted best-of-breed vendor in the storage space, and large dips such as this one represent well-timed buying opportunities."
4153161,103480,2018-03-05T09:00:00-05:00,"Pure Storage pulled back after reporting FY19 guidance that was in line with analyst consensus.The company has a history, however, of guiding conservatively and smashing targets later.Revenue growth accelerated to 48% y/y in Q4, a huge jump over Q3's growth rate of 41% y/y and solidly beating Wall Street's expectations.For being one of the fastest-growing pure-play storage companies in the market, Pure Storage is still modestly valued at 3x forward revenues.","Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) is no stranger to seeing a sharp dip after reporting quarterly earnings. In fact, despite barreling past Wall Street's expectations in both this quarter and the previous quarter, Pure Storage has sunk post-earnings. This time, the company recovered most of its losses (at its worst point losing -9% intraday) and closed down 2% the day after reporting earnings, but the company still isn't getting as much respect as it deserves. While it's true that Pure Storage has performed remarkably well year to date after a late December correction, the company is still relatively undervalued at 3x forward revenues:PSTG data by YChartsThere's plenty of secular support for Pure Storage's robust growth. Underpinning the positive backdrop for the company is the well-known fact that the rate of data creation is exploding - with businesses all craving data-driven insights and aggressively treating proprietary data as an asset as valuable as cash. This material, obviously, has to be stored somewhere. Pure Storage, which specializes in modern, high-performance flash storage solutions (others in the space include the startup Tintri (TNTR) and the much older and larger legacy vendor NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP)), is one of the fastest-growing and best-regarded vendors in the space.Post-earnings, Pure Storage carries a market cap of $4.64 billion. Netting out the $597 million of cash the company has on its balance sheet (it generated massive free cash flow growth in the quarter, by the way), it has a current enterprise value of $4.04 billion. Against the company's FY19 guidance of $1.31-1.36 billion, Pure Storage has an EV/FY19 revenue multiple of just 3.03x based on the guidance midpoint of $1.335 billion, a huge discount for such a rapidly growing stock with improving bottom-line margins. I'm retaining my previous opinion that Pure Storage is worth at least 3.5x EV/FY19 revenues (which, relative to a 40%-plus growth rate, is still modest) implying a price target of $25, or 17% upside from current levels.Of course, Pure Storage's recovery in early 2018 makes it less appealing as a rebound play than when it was plunging in December, but there are still gains to be had in this fast grower.Turning to Pure Storage's fourth-quarter results, we can glean a lot of bullish data for the company. See the company's earnings results below:Figure 1. Pure Storage Q4 resultsSource: Pure Storage investor relationsPure Storage grew revenues by 48% y/y to $338.3 million, outpacing analyst expectations for $331.5 million (+45% y/y) by three points, a healthy beat margin. Equally impressive to note is the fact that the company had only grown by 41% y/y in Q3. As a company with greater than a billion-dollar run rate, the fact that it can manage a seven-point acceleration (despite the fact that it was in the seasonally strong fourth quarter) is a huge bullish indicator.The top-line results are truly a validation of Pure Storage's dominant positioning in the flash storage market. The company has been the top-ranked leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for several years, a distinction that gives it plenty of weight with IT buyers - despite going up against much larger companies with infinitely more vast resources like Dell-EMC, IBM (NYSE:IBM), and even NetApp.And for a company that is essentially a provider of a ""commoditized"" offering (though Pure Storage certainly has differentiations in its storage products), its gross margin is extremely high at 65.1%. We note that though Pure Storage experienced a 20bp drop in product gross margins on a y/y basis, this is essentially due to a continued supply tightness in the NAND flash market (the raw input into flash storage products), which Micron (NASDAQ:MU), one of the leading NAND suppliers, expects to ease by the end of calendar 2018. Having a high gross margin supports a high valuation for Pure Storage's revenue stream - given a continuation of its strong execution, it's possible to see its revenue multiple tick up to 4x or 5x, more in line with the likes of Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), a hyperconverged infrastructure and storage vendor that has recently rallied on the back of its pivot to becoming more of a software play.Note also that Pure Storage slimmed down its GAAP operating losses to just -4.7%, essentially breakeven - a massive 1390bps improvement from -18.6% in 4Q17. Typically, a company that's growing at Pure Storage's ~50% clip is sacrificing margin efficiencies to do so, but in this case, the company seems to be having the best of both worlds. It managed to flatten its R&D expenses and taper down its sales and marketing expenses (the largest component of the company's costs) to a lower percentage of revenues, allowing it to inch closer to breakeven. In fact, on a pro forma basis (stripping out stock-based comp), Pure Storage is guiding to an operating margin of positive 0-4% in FY19. A continuation of trends seen in this quarter might even lead to positive operating margin on a GAAP basis as well.As such, Pure Storage's pro forma EPS in the quarter of positive $0.13 (Q4 is typically the best quarter for profitability, as IT buyers load up on purchases to empty out their budgets in the November-December time frame) beat Wall Street's expectations of $0.07 by 6 cents. Given Pure Storage is still in the nascent stages of profitability, the top-line beats are much more meaningful than the bottom line, but still the ~100% upside to earnings targets is something to take note of.The less-than-enthusiastic response to Pure Storage's earnings was due almost entirely to what investors viewed as lackluster guidance.For FY19, as previously mentioned, Pure Storage is pointing to revenues of $1.31-1.36 billion, only $50 million over consensus expectations of $1.33 billion, as well as a pro forma operating margin of 0-4%. The top line guidance implies a full-year growth range of 28% to 33% y/y - clearly much slower than the 48% growth Pure Storage saw this quarter and the 41% growth in the full FY17.Of course, having difficult comps in FY17 will make strong y/y optics more difficult for the company in FY18 - perhaps the reason for a soft guidance. Pure Storage's history, however, suggests a company that has always leaned to conservative guidance. Take this quarter as an example: in Q3, Pure Storage had issued Q4 guidance of $327-335 million (shepherding analysts into their consensus target of $331.5 million), but actually achieved $338.3 million - a full percentage point higher than the high end of its issued guidance.Pure Storage has jumped over its guidance hoops and beat top-line expectations in every single quarter of FY18 - with a strong backdrop for the storage industry in 2019 and a successful showing in Q4, there isn't any cause to believe Pure Storage's momentum will slow down going into the next year.The bottom line for Pure Storage: take every dip as a buying opportunity, at least until the shares reach a more ""fair"" value around 3.5x forward revenues. A company that's growing this quickly, achieving this level of margin improvements, and generating $38.2 million in cash flow in its most recent quarter (an 11% FCF margin) should be worth a much higher revenue multiple."
4131006,103480,2017-12-11T08:09:20-05:00,"Pure Storage recently reported Q3 earnings which showed growth and earnings above consensus expectations.The company broke even (on an adjusted earnings basis) for the first time in Q3, even as the top line showed accelerating growth of 41% y/y.Guidance also showed meaningful upside ahead of consensus.A recent drop in NAND prices, a key raw input to all-flash arrays, should also help Pure Storage's margins.Despite the good news, PSTG has pulled back since reporting earnings, creating a tactical buying opportunity.","Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG), a leader in all-flash storage arrays and SSD technologies, has seen a surprise pullback after reporting a favorable earnings quarter in Q3. To be fair, it's not the only technology company that's seen a selloff after beating on earnings - investors seem to be rotating out of growth technology stocks this quarter regardless of performance - but Pure Storage's combination of improving margins, break-even pro forma earnings, and rapid growth in the usually sleepy storage industry makes for a compelling long thesis.Make no mistake, Pure Storage has already seen its fair share of outperformance this year: year to date, its gains of ~50% are still far outpacing 27% and 18% YTD gains for the NASDAQ and S&P 500 indices, respectively. The sharp pullback in early December post-Q3, however, presents a well-timed opportunity for investors to buy shares as they consolidate and prepare for a run in 2018.PSTG data by YChartsAt its current market cap of $3.7 billion and enterprise value of $3.1 billion (netting out Pure Storage's cash balance), the company trades at a reasonable 2.4x EV/CY18 revenues, assuming a ~30% revenue growth rate in 2018 for an estimated revenue of $1.3 billion. Given the company's superior growth profile relative to storage competitor NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), which is trading at ~2.1x EV/FTM revenues but growing in the low teens, I believe Pure Storage to be worth at least $24, implying a valuation of 3.5x EV/CY18 revenues. Note that this is still below Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), a related competitor for hyperconverged infrastructure appliances and software that is trading at ~4.2x revenues, with a higher growth profile but lower margins.In addition to the good news coming out of Q3, Pure Storage also stands to benefit from a recent surprise drop in NAND and DRAM pricing, as reported by SA News. NAND and DRAM flash are raw inputs into solid-state arrays, and due to tight supply in the flash chip markets, producers of end-appliances like Pure Storage are often price-takers in NAND and don't have much control over margins as flash prices spike. Pure Storage noted in its 10-K filing that ""our gross margins [...] are subject to variation from period to period and are difficult to predict,"" citing NAND and DRAM flash prices as a top risk factor for margin variability.NAND prices fell 1.5% and DRAM prices fell 1.1%, reversing an uptrend that has seen NAND and DRAM prices rise 5-10% in the last quarter of 2018 alone, as noted on Hewlett Packard Enterprise's (NYSE:HPE) earnings call - a company that has also been victim to rising component prices. Pure Storage's margins improved in Q3, contributing to the upside in earnings, and will continue to see further increases as the prices of its key inputs drop.Overall, Pure Storage looks structurally well positioned for outperformance in 2018. Many bears criticize Pure Storage for its failure to live up to Nutanix in the hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) offerings, but I view the two companies as having entirely different specialties, and am bullish on both. Pure Storage is the Gartner-designated leader in solid-state arrays, and while it faces plenty of competition, its 40%-plus growth rate speaks to its ability to gain share in a crowded market.Pure Storage posted revenues of $277.7 million in Q3, up 41% y/y and beating consensus of $272.4 million (+38% y/y). The below chart, taken from Pure Storage's earnings release, recaps the highlights from Q3:Figure 1. Pure Storage Q3 earnings summarySource: Pure Storage earnings materialsThere are a couple key items to note on the top line. Pure Storage's revenue actually sequentially accelerated to 41% y/y growth this quarter from just 38% y/y growth in Q2. For a company at this scale, acceleration of any amount - let alone three points - is an accomplishment to be celebrated. This is also the first quarter that Pure Storage surpassed a $1 billion revenue run rate, making it a large contender in the storage market.The company added 300 new customers in the quarter, increasing the total customer count to 4,000+.Pure Storage also lifted its revenue outlook for the full year to $1.012-1.020 billion, representing a midpoint that's up from the $0.985-1.025 view given in Q2 and a full-year growth rate of 40% over 2016 revenues. Analyst consensus placed full-year revenues at $1.01 billion, marking a beat in guidance as well.Gross margin also saw 70bps of improvement in the quarter, driven primarily by an increase in support gross margins as well as a small lift in product gross margins. As previously mentioned, a decline in NAND and DRAM prices should contribute to a meaningful gross margin increase in Q4 and beyond.Pure Storage also achieved a major operating margin boost to just a -15.1% margin, up from -39.7% in 3Q16 (though $30 million of operating expenses in 3Q16 owed to a one-time legal settlement - excluding this charge, operating margin in 3Q16 would have been -24.5%). This indicates that the company is closing in on profitability despite the rapid growth it's still seeing on the top line.Adjusting for stock comp, Pure Storage's pro forma EPS of -$0.01 (essentially breakeven) was a 2c beat over consensus of -$0.03. Given that Q4 is typically the strongest quarter for any IT stock, Pure Storage will likely continue to be profitable on a pro forma basis, with GAAP net income to follow shortly (GAAP net margin of -15% is also closing in on breakeven, if Pure Storage's operating margin improvements continue at the same pace).Pure Storage also generated impressive cash flow in the quarter. OCF in Q3 was $28.2 million, a huge boost over 3Q16's OCF of -$47.3 million. Netting out capital expenditures of $14.3 million, Pure Storage also generated free cash flow of $14.0 million.Figure 2. Pure Storage Q3 cash flowYear to date, the company has generated $13.7 million in operating cash flow. Though it's too early for Pure Storage to have a basis for valuation support in cash flows, its huge jump from steep losses to positive cash flows (a 10% OCF margin in Q3) indicates that PSTG is a maturing company that is balancing its growth well with margin and cash flow improvements.The storage industry has made a comeback in the back half of 2017, after trading sideways for much of 2016. Given Pure Storage's sudden pullback despite good earnings results, it's a prime candidate to bet on going into 2018, as growth remains strong and component prices ease.Incidentally, Tintri (TNTR), another small-cap all-flash array competitor, will report earnings on December 13. Tintri has a history of earnings volatility since its IPO earlier this year, and disappointing results in that company (though likely isolated to Tintri itself) may take Pure Storage down with it, creating a further pullback opportunity. Tintri has a growth profile that's far inferior to Pure Storage (its growth sits below 30%, despite being an eighth of Pure Storage's size) and a terrifying margin profile, and liquidity issues are a serious concern for Tintri and its precarious balance sheet. IT buyers tend to notice and back away from vendors with teetering financials for fear that product support will evaporate as the vendor goes under, so it's likely that a lot of Tintri's business can shift over to Pure Storage in the near term. Also important to note is that Pure Storage's position in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Solid-State Arrays is leagues ahead of Tintri (Tintri isn't even in the Leaders quadrant, as of the July 2017 version), highlighting Pure Storage's superiority from a technical product perspective.Trading at just 2.4x EV/FTM revenues, Pure Storage carries a highly favorable risk/reward profile. If the company happens to drop to 2.1x EV/FTM revenues ($15.50), in line with its slow-growth peer NetApp, a long position in Pure Storage is a simple no-brainer."
4135324,98236,2018-01-04T11:50:35-05:00,"Pure shares have compressed noticeably since it reported earnings at the end of November.The results reported were another beat and the company raised guidance for this current quarter.The consensus growth projection for fiscal 2019 that starts on 2/1 is quite modest and very likely substantially less than the company is likely to attain.The company's margins are undergoing substantial improvement and it should reach non-GAAP profitabiity, both this current quarter and for the full year of fiscal 2019.The company's product initiatves, both in terms of its use of NVMe componentry and its disruption of the file and object storage market with FlashBlade should enable the company to continue to gain market share for the foreseeable future.","2017 is now in the books and it was a heck of a party for most investors in technology names. It is a new year and with it brings new challenges. Although the IGV is only trading down marginally from its all-time record set in late November, many smaller, hyper-growth names have experienced a significant valuation contraction. That contraction is a function of both an absolute decline in share prices coupled with a broad improvement in the outlook for the enterprise IT sector.One such name is Pure Software (PSTG). Pure reported another very strong quarter in late November. And from the perspective of this writer, its success with Krispy Kreme is a major milestone-how bad could things really be at Pure if my favorite junk food purveyor is now a customer. That said, the shares have contracted by about 13% since the high they made in the wake of the company’s earnings release on 11/28/17.Revenues rose by 41% last quarter, with a non-GAAP EPS loss of $.01. Both of those results beat previously published First Call expectations, revenues by 2.5% and EPS by $.02/share. Further, the company issued a forecast that surpassed prior expectations, both for revenue and also EPS. At this point, more than a month after the company reported and provided guidance, First Call consensus estimates have been adjusted to match company guidance.Expectations from analysts for periods after company guidance represent a significant compression in terms of the forecasted percentage growth, based mainly on the company’s most recent investor presentation. That presentation looks at a scenario in which Pure’s revenues are forecast to double in 3 years. I don’t think it was intended to be a specific forecast for likely revenue growth in fiscal 2019. There is certainly no evidence of revenue growth slowing in the short-term, as the forecast top-line growth for Q4 is 45%, and it seems likely that the combination of market share gains and a strong storage market will drive percentage growth above the levels implied in the particular presentationPure Storage as a company, seems to enjoy plenty of respect from market research analysts and its customers. It shares, however, seem to reflect a different perspective. Indeed, Thompson-Reuters reports that at this time, 10 of 22 analysts who publish their ratings, have rated the shares as a hold. Many investors are concerned about potentials for commoditization in the storage space. They are also concerned about alternative storage solutions delivered through the cloud and about future demand growth for flash storage once the wave of replacement of spinning disc is completed. While there are, to be sure, elements of validity in these concerns, for the most part they are overblown and are based on historical experience that is no longer as relevant as in the past. Pure shares currently trade at about 2.5X forward 12-month revenues, with growth projected to be 40% this year, i.w. fiscal 2018.The company has started to generate significant levels of cash flow from operations (CFFO), based on a combination of positive trends in GAAP operating losses, coupled with a strong increase in deferred revenues. The balance of this article will explore the issues that plague the shares and handicap the future for investors.By most objective measure, the results posted by Pure in the quarter that was announced on 11/28 would have to be considered a success. Most all of the metrics that investors look at exceeded expectations, particularly those regarding profitability and cash generation. Part of that has been the result of a relatively benign pricing environment in the storage market. Selling storage has been and remains a very competitive activity characterized by price competition; users understand how to optimize their procurement leverage, but there doesn’t appear to be any threat to the attainment of Pure’s non-GAAP gross margin target range in the mid to high 60% area. To a certain extent, the expected decline in SSD costs in 2018 are likely to produce a tailwind in terms of gross margins, both for Pure and for all other flash storage market participants, although during Pure's conference call the CFO suggested that part of that tailwind might be used to fund market share gains.Overall, GAAP operating expense, my preferred metric for cost analysis, was up by 27% year on year while revenues increased by 41%, which had the effect of driving GAAP operating losses down to 15% of revenues, compared to 24% of revenues in the prior year. (I have excluded a $30 million legal settlement recognized in the prior year’s period for the sake of comparability.) In particular, GAAP research and development expense fell from 31% of revenue to 25% of revenue although the CFO said, that the latter figure is likely somewhat of an anomaly-indeed research and development expense dropped sequentially despite the company continuing to hire developers.I am not going to enter into the debate as to whether Pure can achieve profitability in its fiscal Q1, a subject seemingly of significant concern to many participants on Pure’s last conference call. The current First Call consensus calls for a loss of $.14, based on revenue growth of 35%. I think current trends suggest that there is a likely upside to both numbers, and particularly if revenue growth remains as strong as management seems to believe might be the case, then there is the opportunity for significant EPS leverage.Pure continues to use a significant level of stock based comp and I doubt that this will change anytime in the foreseeable future. Last quarter, atock based comp was 13.6% of revenues last quarter and was 136% of CFFO. Those metrics compare to 14.2% of revenues in the prior year with no meaningful figure for cash flow, as it was a negative in the prior year period.The company’s increase in deferred revenue accelerated sharply this quarter, reversing trends seen earlier this year. Overall, deferred revenue growth reached more than 50% last quarter, primarily as a function of the Pure’s increase in its installed base coupled with its sales to more enterprise customers who tend to pay maintenance a year in advance. On the balance sheet, DSO and inventory both declined, metrics that suggest that this past quarter was front-end loaded and perhaps capacity constrained. The CFO declined to comment on that proposition, further enhancing my own belief that it happened that way.About the only negative I can see in the quarter that was reported this past November is that there were no negatives-the beer isn’t likely to be get much colder-although from my perspective, the opportunities that Pure has with both component costs and because of a rising demand tide are probably underestimated.About 5 years ago, the cloud emerged as a major demand phenomenon. Over the course of time, it has upended many age-old demand patterns in the enterprise IT space, and in particular, the storage market. Competitors such as NTAP (NTAP) confronted near-death experiences (although that had more to do with NTAP’s management at the time being flash-deniers as much as anything else). It isn’t so much that demand growth for storage per se was waning during that time, but that a significant amount of demand was being filled by workloads moving to the cloud.Because the advent of the cloud as a major factor in the storage market, coincided with the advent of all-flash arrays as the dominant technology in the space, it is difficult to say just how much demand growth was actually taken by the cloud. Further, during this period, the largest vendor in this space, EMC agreed to a merger with Dell that has been very disruptive to the new company’s competitive positioning, and by all reports continues to be so. Therefore, lots of market share and market growth data has been garbled for at least the last couple of years, and perhaps longer.But one of the more interesting statistics discussed during this conference call had to do with the relationship between cloud storage and the entire available market. This quote comes from Dave Hatfield, Pure’s President Mr. Hatfield suggested that the forecasts that he looks at ""indicate that the demand for storage capacity is supposed to reach 40-50 zettabytes in the next few years and that Internet storage capacity will be in the range of 2.5 zettabytes to 3 zettabytes."" Now I have a confession to make-I have no real concept of how much storage a zettabyte might be-other than it is 1 billion terabytes. There are some numbers like that which simply dwarf my comprehension beyond knowing they exist.And when I read that there is to be a demand for 40-50 zettabytes, it is hard to relate to anything really comprehensible. The IDC study linked here says that last year, the market size was 16 ZB and that the market will actually reach 163 ZB by 2025. It might be interesting for those interested in understanding demand for storage to take a look at this white paper. While I will return to demand drivers shortly, what is worth noting at this point, is simply that the concept that the internet will capture all of the growth in demand for storage seems very far-fetched. Just how much demand will be captured by companies selling storage to enterprises might be hard to calculate. But the speculation that Pure’s overall market opportunity will diminish greatly when the wave of replacement of spinning disc comes to an end is not really born out by the data from market research analysts.A second issue plaguing Pure’s valuation is the perception that its products are not really differentiated. After all, storage is storage is storage, isn’t it? While it is true that there are really no competitive moats in storage as many people use that term, and that is not likely to change, there is differentiation. For a look at the latest Garner study which evaluates vendors and does so based on differentiation, please see the link here. For example, EMC does not yet offer deduplication, even as a feature, in its all flash array offering. For many users, that omission is pretty much a show-stopper since they will not want to go and buy a separate box to perform what today is a basic function. (For readers unfamiliar with dedupe, it is a technology that eliminates the need to store duplicate record in multiple files and therefore reduces the amount of storage required. The reduction in storage requirements is obviously very dependent on specific workloads but the technology is pervasive, these days. I assume the reason it is not offered as a standard component of the EMC flash offering is that EMC own a company called Data Domain which makes its own dedupe solutions. I assume EMC is reluctant to kill its own child, especially given how much it paid to buy that child).There are many other factors that are important to users in evaluating different storage alternatives. Amongst these are compression technologies, upgrade pricing models, and the advent of NVMe. Pure has been the first storage vendor to offer NVMe in its product family, and presumably this has and will continue to help the company gain share. Pure offers a product called FlashBlade which has, at least according to Gartner, disrupted the market for high-performance computing. According to Gartner, as flash costs continue to lower, “Pure Storage will disrupt the file and object storage market in the same way that the Pure Storage block protocol storage arrays disrupted the traditional hybrid array market…”. FlashBlade, if I may be pardoned for a pun, has been a flashpoint of contention in evaluating Pure’s operational performance. While management suggested that the relative growth of FlashBlade was lower in Q3 than in prior quarters, it is still tracking to the company’s plan. Without trying to evaluate the specifics of the FlashBlade architecture, it has been designed for use with modern workloads, particularly including machine leaning and analytics. I feel very convicted that it continues to be a differentiator and a demand driver for Pure.I do not expect Pure to be able to offer a software only solution any time in the near future. If differentiation is thought to mean software only, then Pure, while spending most of its development dollars on software, will probably not be able to satisfy a certain cohort of observers. And every differentiator that I mentioned, will, in time, be replicated by competitors if the market for the solution is large enough. Right now, it is likely that differentiators are being created by Pure and partners in optimizing storage that is used for machine learning and artificial intelligence. And, as the data created by IoT deployments starts to become pervasive, it seems likely that Pure will develop specific and differentiated offering that are optimized for those kinds of use cases. During the course of the conference call and prior to that during the company’s investor presentation, Pure has talked about a 30% growth rate plan for the next few years. Obviously, the valuation that ought to be assigned the shares really does rest heavily on top-line growth expectations. As I mentioned earlier, I do not imagine that the forecast is meant to be taken literally as a model for every quarter. And the CFO, while cautioning that the 45% growth guided to for this current quarter would not be an expectation to use in modelling fiscal year ’19, also said that there were circumstances in which growth for the company would exceed 30%.I have linked here to the latest IDC study on the storage market that covers Q3 of 2017. It has been true at times in the past, that an increase in 40% in shipments of storage in a year has only lead to a 5% increase in storage revenues. But the latest IDC statistics show that because of the sharp increase in storage demand, and the lesser increase in vendor capacity, that relationship is far more supportive of growth than in the recent past. Overall, as this IDC study shows, in Q3-2017, storage revenues-not shipments-rose by 14% overall, far faster than the rate of growth seen earlier in 2017. Shipments were said to have grown by 22% year on year.Yes, the growth is fastest in that market segment which IDC calls original design manufacturers who sell directly to hyperscale data centers. That market segment actually grew by 54% in Q3, year on year. But where some observers have it wrong is the concept that Pure doesn’t play in that space. About 25% of Pure’s business comes from that segment, and that segment of Pure's revenue has been relatively constant proportion of its business. It would not surprise me, particularly, given just how fast that market segment is growing and is likely to grow, to see more of Pure’s revenues come from that market segment. If that happens, it will, place a headwind on gross margins to be sure, while concomitantly improving sales and marketing expense ratios.Another point to make in looking at this study is that Pure is still not in the top 5 storage vendors. Is that good or bad. In terms of projecting potential growth, the fact that Pure is still significantly smaller than older storage vendors with competitive issues is a good thing. Pure is doing well, and yet it has by no means done so strictly by gaining market share from its larger rivals.Another ancillary point is that as Pure has become larger, it has been able to compete more effectively for larger, enterprise procurements. In other words, not only does Pure have high win rates, but it is now entering more competitive engagements with larger enterprises.I think it is fair to say that IT spending is probably showing greater growth now than it has in the recent past. And I think as well, that the spending on IT is driving demand for storage. All in, the growth cocktail formula for Pure is pretty heady-market share gains, new products, focus on the use cases with the fastest percentage increase in storage requirements and a strong tide in terms of IT expenditures. I think it would be reasonable to believe that Pure can at least maintain 35% growth in its fiscal ’19 year and that in turn will lead to higher profitability than is currently forecast.Hardware companies are worth less than software companies-whether they should be or not, they have been valued at a discount for many years now and certainly my opinions are not going to change that paradigm. Once upon a time, storage vendors got some premium because the space was so hot-now the space is hot and they get a discount. No, I can't link to some graven tablet that says this is a given-it is just the experience of the past several years. I am not really going to change that either. But all that considered, I think Pure’s valuation is excessively constrained based on the company’s progress in terms of market share and its ability to use its products to penetrate new use cases.The company’s fiscal 2019 will start in about 4 weeks. I think that it is reasonable to expect given the environment that I have described that the company will be able to generate about $1.4 billion of revenues. The company’s current market capitalization, based on its projection of 243 million fully diluted shares at profitability, is about $4 billion. (Other calculations of market capitalization are based on outstanding shares in net loss status and are not appropriate given current projections for positive earnings). The company has a current cash balance of $550 million, leaving an enterprise value of a bit less than $3.5 billion. That yields an EV/S ratio of just 2.5X on a forward basis, clearly reflecting investor concern about Pure's ability to continue to disrupt the storage market that is not related to any currently discernible negative business trends.The current First Call consensus forecast for EPS is $.07 for fiscal 2019, which would be an improvement of about $63 million from the current consensus for the fiscal year that will be over the end of this month. That is not very likely outcome, given the statements made by the CFO on this latest conference call and any kind of basic trend analysis. The company is likely to at least maintain gross margins next year and there are certainly tail winds that could take gross margins above the consensus, and above the range targeted by Pure. Overall, I think that if revenues increase by $350-$360 million, then on a GAAP basis, the operating loss will probably improve by about $80 million. On a non-GAAP basis, I would expect profits to rise by about $135 million, overall. That would take non-GAAP operating margins to about 7%, still substantially below the company’s longer-term model of non-GAAP margins in the range of 15%-20, but an increase of about 1000 basis points year over year, approximately equivalent to 3rd quarter operating margin improvement. That suggests earnings per share next year could be as much as $.35 non-GAAP depending on tax rate accruals and the trajectory of other income. But even at EPS of $.30, the P/E for fiscal 2019 would be at less than 50X, not a bargain, perhaps, but quite modest as well if the company can sustain growth in the mid 30% range.Pure doesn’t forecast CFFO or free cash flow, leaving it to analysts and writers to attempt to make a projection. Cash generation was positive last quarter and is now positive for the year to date. A significant part of that improvement came from the relatively strong compression of GAAP losses both last quarter and for the year to date. In addition, the company improved DSO (most likely a function of better intra-quarter linearity) and continued to grow stock based comp. The company’s increase in deferred revenue, as mentioned earlier grew by more than 50%-year on year. My projection, based on the trend of major cash flow items is that CFFO could reach the range of $150million-$160 million next year with free cash flow slightly above $100 million. That is a projected free cash flow yield of 3%. Again, not in bargain territory, but quite reasonable given the company’s prospects for growth and rising profitability.I do not own Pure shares at the moment-because my portfolio includes other storage names such as Nutanix and NetApp and I do not want more of a concentration than that in the storage area. But I do think that this is a reasonable entry point in Pure and reasonable timing as well.Current expectations for fiscal 2019, and particularly Q1 2019 are quite modest based on trends in the storage market. While I certainly do not expect that management will give anything more than prudent guidance for 2019, I do think that prudent guidance is for results noticeably above 30% growth with very modest margin improvement. At some point, sustained quarters of beat and raise performance are going to be rewarded. Pure shares are up by 47% over the past year. I am not suggesting that they can reprise that kind of performance, precisely. But I do believe that they will continue to produce positive alpha as investors become comfortable with investing in the storage segment of the IT space."

Then, a little more than a week ago, it was trashed by Morgan Stanley with a price tag of $12, down from $17 - an almost 30% discount. The reason was an industry survey that stated higher competition and low traction for Pure Storage's new product, the FlashBlade. As a result, the stock fell back to 10$.Last night's earnings call proved Morgan Stanley wrong. Pure Storage delivered solid beats on all fronts. FlashBlade seems to perform well for reasons laid out in my first piece on Pure Storage, Pure Potential: An Introduction To Pure Storage For Non-Techs when the stock was trading at around $10.20.The numbersPure Storage's guidance was $171M to $179M in revenue for the first quarter. Revenue came in at $182.6M. The new guidance for Q2 is $214M to $222M, which should put the $1B goal in revenue by the end of 2017 in reach under the assumption that revenues continue growing by around $30M a quarter from Q2 onwards.The launch of FlashBlade was a success because in terms of revenues it performed better than twice as good as FlashArray when it was first launched. The $80M full-year guidance for Flash Blade is probably conservative at this point.Also margins outperformed guidance: gross margins (non-GAAP) were to be expected to be between 63.5% and 66.5% and came out 66.4% (GAAP: 65.2%). The guidance for operating margins (on-GAAP) was -27% to -23%, and came out -16.7% (GAAP: -34.7%). The guidance for 2018 is a single digit negative operating margin (-9% to -5% non-GAAP), which puts a small profitability in reach, should the company continue to outperform.Competition lags behindDuring the call, the management reiterated once again that it is quite shielded from competition. The reasons cited are:Morgan Stanley vs. Seeking AlphaAs a statistician by training, I'm curious what went wrong at Morgan Stanley. The reason for the downgrade was a survey involving value-added resellers. Results pointed at a tougher competitive environment and little traction for Flash Blade, particularly in the lower end of the market. Possible reasons behind the inaccurate results are at least two:In stark contrast to Morgan Stanley, SA contributors with a long-term horizon wrote mostly positive about Pure Storage during the past months. Interesting discussions among readers confirmed that the bull thesis for Pure Storage was solid. In short, it seems the SA crowd-sourced opinion is keeping up with Wall Street analysts.Looking aheadIt is still difficult to predict where the stock will be heading in the coming weeks because it still depends on what analysts think - and opinions have been little aligned so far.But apart from that, the earnings call suggests that the long-term potential for the stock is stronger than anticipated by most. I'm particularly excited about some speculation regarding Pure's newest customers. They weren't mentioned by name during the earnings call, but there is one using FlashBlade ""to power one of the largest AI platforms in the world"". Others use Pure's products for analyzing data from rockets and for improving autonomous driving. This is just guessing for now, but there are not too many companies that are engaged in the above activities - names like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Space X (SPACE), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) come to mind, even though until recently it seemed to be unlikely that DIY-hardliners like Google would become customers.Disclaimer: The article reflects my personal opinion and reality to the best of my knowledge, but I can't guarantee for content or outcomes.

4107756,102714,2017-09-18T15:49:49-04:00,"After Q2 earnings Pure Storage's stock price has jumped.The the hiring of a new CEO is a positive.Given the company's potential and relatively low risk of permanent loss, the stock is still a bargain.","I wrote the first time about Pure Storage (PSTG) in April, when it was trading at around $10. Today, it is trading around $14. The investment thesis back then was that investors were avoiding the company for the wrong reasons despite undeniable potential. After a 40% increase in the stock price, it is legit to ask whether the gap between intrinsic value and market price is closing. What follows are some comments on the latest developments and an attempt to answer that question.The biggest news from the last earnings call was the stepping down of Scott Dietzen in favor of Charles Giancarlo. The management justified the hiring of Mr. Giancarlo with his ability to scale $1 billion revenue companies to multi-billion market leaders. Overall, I believe that this was a good move, even though I don't have enough information to judge whether Mr. Giancarlo is the perfect fit.Giancarlo joined Cisco in 1994, where he lived through the company’s boom and bust years. First, as a vice president managing the company’s mergers and acquisitions, and after the dot-com bubble, as a chief technical officer and later as a chief technology officer. Mr. Giancarlo left Cisco in 2007 to join Silver Lake Partners as a managing director and ""head of value creation."" Silver Lake Partners is a private equity firm that focuses on providing mature technology companies with growth capital. Mr. Giancarlo's publicly available interviews and presentations suggest he has expertise in M&A and in turning around tech businesses. In other words, he is not a direct hire from a growing multi-billion tech enterprise, as one would expect given the reason for which he was hired.Nevertheless, investors should welcome the change in management. Switching the CEO even when things go well is a sign of humbleness and willingness to do what it takes to achieve the next milestones. Also, Scott Dietzen remains as a full-time chairman. This means that the hiring of a hardware veteran like Charles Giancarlo equals to allocating more expertise and brainpower to Pure Storage's management. Charles Giancarlo received 464,745 shares (close to $6M market value) of Pure Storage’s stock plus options before the earnings call.The earnings call also confirmed that Pure Storage is on a steady growth path. The management is confident that it will reach around $1B in revenues by the end of the year and expects to have its first profitable quarter ever in Q4. Revenues were up 38% Y/Y, while the number of customers grew by 60% Y/Y. Flashblade has contributed better than expected to this result. Free cash flow was a negative $17.5M, which is a small number compared to the $523M that was left in the bank by the end of the quarter.A common narrative among skeptics is that cloud storage is replacing on-premise solutions. During the earnings call, the management stressed on several occasions how a substantial part of Pure’s customers is actually cloud-based companies. A second point that was made regarding demand was that Flashblade is a preferred piece of hardware when it comes to building infrastructure for AI applications. From that perspective, it appears that Pure is selling shovels during a gold rush.The latest addition to Pure’s product portfolio is the FlashArray//X. The //X is a premium version of the FlashArray and sets itself apart from the previous //M versions because it is fully NVMe based. NVMe is a set of new standards aimed at increasing the speed in which data can be stored and accessed by reducing latency alongside increasing bandwidth. The company claims that the FlashArray//X beats older versions by a factor of two in terms of lower latency and larger bandwidth. Its specs and easy integrability with predecessors hoist the entire FlashArray product line on a whole new level in terms of performance. When I first wrote about Pure Storage, the hypothetical reasoning was that if Pure Storage decided to stop financing growth by the end of 2017, it probably would generate around $1B a year and roughly $97.5M in net profits. With the shares trading at around $10 back then, this result led to a PE ratio in the mid-twenties. Thus, the conclusions of this hypothetical reasoning was “you can get the current company at a fair price, while the future growth is for free.” Today, with the share price at $14, the same line of reasoning would lead to a PE ratio of $35. So, future potential isn’t for free anymore.On the other hand, the last quarter has removed a substantial part of the remaining doubt regarding the company’s growth potential: Flashblade turned out to be a success and the dip in revenues in Q1 with respect to the previous quarter really was just seasonality, as the management had claimed. Technology wise, Pure Storage seems to be ahead of the pack by a couple of years. Its superb net promoter scores and the Evergreen solution (which allows upgrading storage hardware without interrupting operations or needing to replace hardware) are difficult to copy. Right now, there seems nothing on the horizon that may throw the company off its growth path or impact its financials negatively in any significant way.The enterprise storage market is a $35B market. Pure Storage claims that potentially it can address 80% of that market, or $28B. This means 28 times current revenues. The current stock price is a bargain even if Pure Storage captures only $2-3B of the market while reaching its mid/long-term goal, i.e. an operating margin between 15 and 20%.Becoming profitable in Q4 might turn out to be an important catalyst for this overlooked stock.

4102967,98236,2017-08-30T10:38:22-04:00,"Pure Storage reported the results of its fiscal Q2 last week.The results were a convincing snap-back from the relatively muted results of Q1.The company achieved stronger than expected revenues, gross margins, and EPS, and came close to cash flow break-even.The company is seeing excellent early results for its newest product family and is starting to achieve material success with offerings as part of its Cisco partnership.The company appointed a new CEO, Charles Giancarlo, who has a wealth of experience at a prominent venture capital firm and at Cisco.","Late last week, Pure Storage (PSTG) reported the results of its fiscal Q2. The results were significantly above the company's prior forecast, and the company raised guidance as well. One veteran analyst wrote a curious note to the effect that investors should take a fresh look at the company. The problem, at least for this observer, is that his research note kept a hold rating on the shares with a $15 price target - why take a fresh look when the shares closed at $14.25? Hard to understand that type of logic.The company now has a new CEO who has enjoyed a long and successful career with stints at Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and at Silver Lake Partners, a well-respected VC firm. Pure has been one of the leaders in flash for some time now, and its results simply affirm that it is achieving consistent success in the space. The quarter also contained positive news with regards to the market penetration of FlashBlade, a key product initiative.I too think investors who have not done so might do well to take a look at the shares of Pure. The only difference between me and the analyst at Barclays is that I believe investors should take a look at Pure with a view toward owning the shares. Even in the wake of the share price spike last Friday, the company's valuation remains attractive, and more so in that, the increase in guidance was actually greater than the increase in share price.The headline results were as follows: The company had quarterly revenues of $225 million, 3% higher than the mid-point of prior guidance. The sequential growth in revenues was 23%. The company had GAAP gross margins of 66% compared to 65% the prior quarter. The company's quarterly GAAP operating margin was (29%), a 600-basis point improvement compared to the prior quarter and an 800 point improvement compared to the prior year. The company is forecasting sequential revenue growth of 20% this quarter and a further sequential revenue growth 21% in its fiscal Q4. If the forecast is realized, Q4 revenues will be up 44% from those reported in the prior year's comparable quarter. That might suggest to many that the current First Call consensus forecast that shows growth of 30% in the next fiscal year is significantly understated.The company had 350 new name accounts last quarter up from 300 in fiscal Q1 and comparable to the number of new name accounts closed in the prior year. Pure's go-to market strategy is very much land and expand, and the number of new name accounts is a key indicator in forecasting the company's forward growth. A large cohort of revenues comes from users who buy more from Pure after their initial installation is successfully deployed.While the company does not forecast GAAP margins, it beat its forecast for non-GAAP margins by about 200 bps this past quarter. It increased its full year expectation for non-GAAP margins by 200 basis points as well. The cadence of margin improvements suggests that the company will be non-GAAP profitable by a small amount in its fiscal Q4. It is still some time away from achieving GAAP profitability, and as detailed below, stock based comp is still rising at just less than the pace as revenues.One thing that the conference call illuminated was just how difficult it has been for those analysts who had, perhaps, reveled in the disappointments of Q1 to accept the results of Q2. There was still more than a little skepticism during the call expressed about various points relating to demand, particularly as regards to the FlashBlade product and to the success of the land and expand strategy and more apparent skepticism regarding the trajectory of margins. I will return to some of these points further on in this article.There were no holes or spots on this quarter. The company over-achieved on all key metrics and forecast faster growth and greater profitability by substantial margins than had been embedded in the prior consensus. In the wake of the spike, Pure's year to date and one-year performance is still lagging the performance of some indexes. Pure shares are up about 26% YTD. That is a bit better than the appreciation of the QQQ, up by 22% and noticeably below the results of the IGV, which has seen 32% appreciation so far this year. It will be hard for Pure shares not to catch up to and exceed the performance of the IGV index if its quarterly performance continues to be as positive as were the results of this past quarter.As the saying goes, not all storage is born equal. I have written about this subject on several occasions and with regards to several companies. I suspect I will find myself writing about it again when I review the results of the Nutanix (NTNX) quarter at the end of the week. Storage differentiation has always been about software content and that remains the case. NetApp (NTAP) has an operating system called ONTAP that has long been acknowledged as a major competitive advantage, and after many years, ONTAP remains a substantial competitive moat for NTAP. To a greater or lesser extent, the storage solutions that Pure sells are mainly differentiated by the software content of the offering.Why has Pure been successful, and why is it gaining share and displacing competitors? The answer is pretty straightforward. Pure sells storage solutions that are quite differentiated from the AFAs offered by competitors. In some cases, Pure wins deals for new workloads, but probably, most often, it poaches customers from legacy storage vendors when they replace their installations of spinning discs as is happening at an increasing cadence.The latest Gartner report on the flash array market was published on July 20, 2017, and I have linked to it here for the convenience of readers. Once again, Pure is listed as the leader in terms of both execution and vision. Gartner is disdained by some readers as not the end all and be all of third party research. I understand that concern, but I think that its commentary with regards to Pure is spot-on and well worth the time it takes to read it. I will quote a couple of comments from this report, again for the convenience of readers. ""Pure Storage had a vision and a plan to move SSAs (Solid State Arrays) into new market segments and create a broader product portfolio and it has successfully achieved its goal."" ""Even though FlashBlade is a file protocol array, it has, and will cause competitive disruption in the high-performance computing (HPC) file array segment. As flash costs continue to lower, Pure Storage will disrupt the file and object storage market in the same way that the Pure Storage block protocol storage arrays disrupted the traditional hybrid array market by offering storage that is easier to purchase, own and upgrade, and that is faster, smaller and simpler to use.""I think it is equally telling for readers to understand some of the issues that plague Dell/EMC outside the ones connected directly with putting together an organization post-merger. Gartner says that while the company offers very competitive discounts with increasingly aggressive purchase terms, new and existing customers often require extra purchase to provide integration. In addition, many of Dell's (DVMT) products do not support data deduplication which is almost a mandatory capability for users and the company does not match the evergreen migration guarantee of Pure. Those are not competitive weaknesses that can be remedied either easily or quickly. Pure simply is offering users the kinds of storage solutions that are most in tune with what users need at this time - at least according to Garner.At this point, Pure has announced a new, low-latency, all NVMe array called FlashArray/Xseries. This is generally thought to represent a significant differentiator and demand driver for the company, and it seems likely that Pure really does have a leadership position in regard to the evolution of all flash arrays to NVMe. (""Non-volatile Memory express is an interface specification that allows host hardware and software to fully exploit the levels of parallelism possible in modern SSD's. As a result, NVMe reduces I/O overhead and brings various performance improvements…"") In other words, it is faster and more capable than the prior technology. It will wind up having a significantly lower cost of ownership for most users and will eventually become pervasive. Pure will derive market share advantages by being first to the party.I have mentioned FlashBlade a couple of times in this article. FlashBlade is considered by some brokerage analysts to be a make or break product for this company. The retiring CEO made a commitment that the company would generate $80 million of revenue from FlashBlade this fiscal year. So far, the CEO and the CFO have said that revenues for FlashBlade are tracking ahead of plan. Why is FlashBlade important? It substantially widens the TAM for this company. I have linked to several reviews of the product by real users. The reviews are quite impressive. FlashBlade is a platform that is designed to store petabytes of unstructured data. Most users will deploy the product to address large-scale analytics workloads. At this point, the primary competition for FlashBlade is a descendant of the Isilon technology that EMC bought years ago. I have linked here to a couple of studies, one from Pure and one from a third party that compares FlashBlade to a NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) legacy product. I am surely not the person to evaluate claims. The blogs here have a point of view. But by now, I think it is fair to make the case that the FlashBlade technology is more suited for its role in storing unstructured data with high performance and low cost when compared to Isilon Nitro. And, at the end of the day, that is not terribly surprising. For many years, EMC has competed quite successfully for much of the time, with a strategy of offering paper tigers. EMC may be part of a new organization, but it apparently hasn't changed that part of its strategy, and it simply may not have the resources to provide users with the level of price/performance necessary to compete in this space. By all accounts, it has been starved of resources since the merger was finalized, and the results have been that EMC/Dell, for the most part, has been a consistent market share donor across much of the storage universe. Capturing market share from EMC/Isilon would seem to be a fraught strategy to some - but, in my opinion, it makes perfect sense with this product at this time, and the reviews linked here suggest that Pure is executing well on its strategy.Pure and Cisco have partnered to provide a solution that integrates the Cisco UCS with FlashStack. The partnership was formally announced in March of last year, and at this point, it is starting to be a factor in Pure's revenue growth. While the world is changing and hyper-converged infrastructure will inevitably become a standard for many workloads and in many data centers, there are many workloads where converged infrastructure (CI) remains the preferred architecture that optimizes user results. Again, I do not purport to try to disentangle the arguments over which infrastructure has the most utility for which workload. There is plenty of market to go around.Most of Pure's revenues today come from FlashBlade and FlashArray. But it appears likely that FlashStack and the partnership with Cisco is going to be the focus of both additional product development and that it is to be ""a key part of our selling cadence. We see tremendous opportunity around the segment of data platforms that we are playing in. Data is such a core value to the market today. But I'm afraid, we are not going to tip our hand on future products.""One of the major reasons why forecasting growth above 40% for Pure is not a particularly bold forecast is that that the all-flash array market continues to grow at close to 50%. The Dell'Oro Group, in a report linked here, has forecast 40% growth this year. Pure only has a 12% share. So, Pure can grow handily by simply matching market growth rates, and it grows at hyper rates by gaining market share in the space. The market has probably actually been constrained over the past year by the shortage of and high prices for 3D NAND chips. Again, the article linked here suggests that there will be a manufacturing breakthrough over the next year that will dramatically lower the costs of chips and enable the AFA suppliers to lower prices further, increasing their displacement of spinning disc.One question that might be concerning investors and analysts is what happens to the growth of the all flash market when the wave of replacement of spinning disc and hybrid storage comes to an end. I suspect that fears of the future after the market evolves are a significant factor constraining Pure's share price valuation. I do not purport to be a futurist or to have a crystal ball. Pure today does not compete for all of the available storage market and, over time, is likely to evolve its product line - perhaps in the directions foreshadowed by the company's old CEO on this latest conference call. It would not surprise me if one of the reasons behind the CEO transition turned out to be the experience of Mr. Giancarlo in pushing multiple products through development simultaneously. While I doubt that Pure will achieve a CAGR of 40% after 2020 - its valuation is far below levels consistent with that kind of performance. At the moment, the company appears to have a product strategy that is being well accepted in the market, and I have no way of telling what its future product strategy might be or how successful will be its execution and market acceptance.For the next couple of year, it seems highly likely that Pure will continue to grow rapidly. A combination of better products, better customer service, an increasing breadth of product offerings, and a market still showing explosive growth ought to be reason enough to forecast future success.As part of the earnings release, Pure announced that the company's longtime CEO was taking a role as Chairman of the Board and that the company had hired Charlie Giancarlo as its new CEO. At least on the call, the transition seemed to be a love-fest, and Mr. Giancarlo was described as a model ""Pureite"". I have no specific idea if Mr. Giancarlo was brought in to consummate a transaction, or if his Cisco background means that the Pure/Cisco partnership will lead to an ever-closer association between the two businesses. I think that many companies that are scaling up have found it expedient to hire different types of managers as they reach a certain size. I think companies of a certain scale who don't seek different managers leave themselves open to operational miscues and to failing to continue to execute at high levels. The firmament is littered with examples of how that works. This is a company that has a fairly deep senior management team that has been together for some years, and the addition of Mr. Giancarlo is likely to add to the ability of the company to execute and perhaps most importantly to expand its vision.The storage business can be quite profitable, but Pure is still focused on growing market share and is still a bit smaller than might be required to be consistently profitable. The major issue for Pure in terms of reaching profitability is to constrain sales and marketing expense. That hasn't happened yet and probably will not happen for some quarters to come. On a GAAP basis, sales and marketing cost rose by 38% year on year in this last quarter, almost precisely in line with total revenues. Sales and marketing costs rose by 24% sequentially, just a bit greater than the 22% sequential growth in revenue. While not explicitly called out during the conference call, this cadence of sales and marketing expense growth is probably not sustainable for any extended period. Some of it doubtless has to do with the company's series of product initiatives such as FlashBlade, and some of it probably relates to various specific sales initiatives, in particular, verticals such as healthcare. Given the technology that Pure offers, it has made a significant push in terms of selling storage for AI based solutions, and this kind of sales effort is likely to be extremely expensive in its early phases.The company is actually making discernible progress in the other operating expense categories. Research and development was 31% of revenues last quarter compared to 36% of revenues the prior year. And, general and administrative costs were just below 10% of revenue compared to 12% the prior year. Overall, operating expense fell from 102% of revenues to 94% of revenues.The company is managing through the disruption of NAND supplies. Its GAAP gross margins were consistent year over year despite earlier fears that the cost of NAND would compress gross margins. The company basically is at its desired gross margin level, and there is no reason to believe that it will not be able to protect gross margins in future quarters, regardless of statements about longer-term gross margin goals.I imagine that the new CEO will work with this management to develop a strategy that might get Pure to profitability far faster than the current cadence might suggest, and indeed, it may be one reason for his entrance. Management has spoken about a long-term business model goal of 15-20% operating margins. That is a dog whose hunting qualities are suspect. As mentioned earlier, stock-based comp was 16% of revenues last quarter. The math of those two metrics is really not sustainable. The company is going to have to find a way of reducing the ratio dramatically of stock-based comp dramatically (LOL) or increasing its planned non-GAAP operating margin model. While Pure has a very bright future and will be growing share in a growing market, it is going to have to be able to generate real profits.Last quarter, Pure's CFFO was at break-even levels. This was a far better result than the prior year - but more than all of the improvement was a function of the increase in stock-based comp. The company, despite the NAND shortage, actually was able to reduce inventories which either suggests that its past purchases of NAND, which were significant in the prior quarter, have been adequate to support demand, or that the company sold down its finished goods inventory because of demand.The company continues to spend moderately on capex, although capex has declined significantly so far this year compared to the prior year. Management is forecasting that Pure will turn to sustained positive free cash flow going forward, presumably as GAAP expense ratios decline and revenues increase.During the course of the conference call, the CFO suggested that analysts use 237 million outstanding shares in preparing models and estimates. The actual share count this last quarter was 209 million. The difference relates to the increase in outstanding shares that will be calculated as the company becomes profitable. I think it is most useful to look at valuation using 237 million shares.Currently, at the closing price yesterday afternoon, Pure has a market capitalization of a bit less than $3.5 billion. It has a current cash balance of about $530 million, so its enterprise value is around $2.95 billion. Based on current estimates, the forward 12-month revenues for Pure are forecast to be about $1.2 billion, yielding an EV/S of less than 2.5X.Although the company has forecast that it will be generating some cash in the next six months and that it will reach non-GAAP profitability in the last quarter of the current fiscal year, the amounts in question are so small as not to be meaningful in constructing a valuation matrix. I think it will take another two years or so before there are meaningful earnings and cash flow to value.I am often asked questions about longer term forecasts for different companies about which I write. My guess is that a couple of years from now, this company will reach $1.9 billion in revenues, and at that point, it will probably have non-GAAP margins of around 10-13%. At the mid-point, that would create operating profit of about $220 million.At this point, the company obviously has never paid taxes, and it probably will have significant NOLs available to shield net income two years from now. Given the trend of outstanding shares, I think a reasonable guesstimate for fiscal 2020 EPS would be about $0.85-0.90/share. Whatever else is true, that kind of earnings and doubtless concomitant levels of cash flow would have a massive salutary impact on share valuations.I believe that the storage space is far more investable and has far better prospects than current valuations might indicate. Pure is a leader in what it does and is likely to remain a leader for the foreseeable future. The new CEO, at the least, seems likely to be pro-active in terms of expense management and the company's longer-term business model. Will he be pro-active in finding a transaction in which the company is consolidated? Will Cisco wind up buying Pure?I really have no way of assessing the probabilities of Pure being consolidated. It certainly is a possibility given the company's size, technology, and its valuation. And if it is consolidated, I am sure the premium would reflect the company's substantial growth opportunity.But I do not think that investors need bet on consolidation as the only fuel for share price appreciation. The opportunities the company has to continue hyper-growth and improve profitability in excess of the current published First Call consensus seem massive. I think there is plenty of positive alpha in the offing."

On the other hand, not understanding things sometimes precludes from great investment opportunities. This is why from time to time, it pays to get outside one's comfort zone and widen that circle of competence through hard work.Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) offers a new generation of quiet technical data storage solutions, which is probably the reason why it is not on the radar of most investors. What follows is a simple explanation of what Pure Storage does and why its stock currently is trading at a substantial discount to its true value.What Pure Storage does, in simple termsIn a nutshell, Pure Storage in on a mission to replace enterprise spinning-disk storage with all-flash storage. If you have already upgraded from a computer with a traditional spinning hard disk drive (HDD) to a computer with a solid state drive (NYSE:SSD), you have witnessed first-hand the increase in speed SSDs offer compared to HDDs. It also gives one a first idea what storage systems based on flash memory (the type of memory used in SSDs) can achieve opposed to traditional memory on an enterprise level. The advantages flash memory offers compared to spinning disks lead enterprises to want to replace their legacy data systems as soon as possible, but the problem is that flash memory is expensive. This is where Pure Storage comes into play: the company provides optimized software and hardware that make it possible to cram more data on flash memory so that the effective capacity of an all-flash-based storage is becoming eventually cheaper than storage space on a traditional disk.Pure Storage designs the storage systems using solid state memory from third parties such as Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) (OTCPK:SSNF), which are then assembled by partners such as Foxconn (OTC:FXCOF). The central part of Pure Storage's value lies in its software that allows using flash memory efficiently. In addition to providing a data platform that is much faster, Pure Storage has introduced software that makes maintaining and upgrading enterprise storage much easier with respect to the past so that large-scale upgrades (so-called forklifts) and disruptive migrations become unnecessary.Pure Storage offeringsThe company sells mainly three products:FlashArray, Source: Pure StorageFlashBlade, Source: Pure StorageFlashStack (mini), Source: Pure StorageAs mentioned before, the true value of Pure Storage's offerings lies in its software: Purity OE, the operating environment in which clients can install their operation system and applications upon, has been built from scratch to harness the full potential of all-flash hardware. As a result, the Purity OE is responsible for reducing the data in such a way that on average for 5GB of data only 1GB of flash memory is needed in most use-cases.Pure1 is the cloud-based software that allows management, monitoring, and support of the storage systems. Software and hardware offered by Pure Storage are based on the idea that storage should have the attributes of software as a service (SaaS), i.e. it should be scalable without interruptions and be updated continuously by the provider in such a way that it will never become obsolete. This is what the company's Evergreen Storage business model promises.The storage marketIt is widely known that the past years have seen the advent of the cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon AWS (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). This industry is still growing at rates beyond 40% year on year, largely at the expense of the enterprise storage market dominated by Dell/EMC (DVMT), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) who are experiencing stagnant or declining revenues.But this doesn't mean that storage has no future: in 2016, the market of enterprise storage systems generated roughly $35B in revenues. Only $4-5B, (roughly 50% more with respect to 2015) of the total market revenues were generated by flash-based systems. This leads to the conclusion that even though the storage market is experiencing currently no growth, the market for all-flash systems is growing fast and still has much potential. Within the AFA market, Pure Storage positioned itself third after EMC and NetApp in terms of revenues, according to IDC in Q1 2016.It would be interesting to directly compare Pure Storage's products to those offered by competitors, but that requires diving deep into technical aspects only to find that in many cases the performance of storage systems depend to some extent on the kind of applications they are used for. Nevertheless, a good first read in that direction is IDC s MarketScape or Bert Hochfield s articles.Competitive advantageBeyond strictly technical aspects, there are several points that put Pure Storage in a more favorable position with respect to competitors. First, with respect to the large incumbents, it doesn't depend on the revenues from legacy spinning disc systems. Second, the way it approaches support, management, and upgrades with its Evergreen business is revolutionary and save customers a lot of time and money. Third, its founders and management got the timing right. They focused on a general purpose all flash system and built it from scratch to harness the full potential of flash when no one else was doing it. This will protect the company from lower prices in the AFA space and supply shortages when it comes to flash memory.Finally, even though this claim is subjective, Pure Storage's CEO, Scott Dietzen, and the two founders John Colgrove and John Hayes, are probably the best people to run such a business. They have managed to build one of the most interesting firms to work for in the industry and obtained by far the highest net promoter score (a measure of client satisfaction) in their segment as a result of Pure's distinctive brand and culture. If everything goes well, Pure Storage will be producing $1B of revenues by the end of 2017, which no independent storage company has achieved since the rise of NetApp in 1992.From left to right: John Colgrove (founder and CTO), John Hayes (founder and advisor), and Scott Dietzen (NYSE:CEO). Source: Pure StorageFinancials and ValuationSince its IPO at the end of 2016, Pure Storage has increased its revenues from $440M in 2015 to $728M in 2016. During that same period, losses widened from $214M to more than $245M a quarter due to the expenses needed to fuel that growth. Since the general sale of FlashBlade started only two months ago, losses have reached an apex and are going to decline: for 2017, Scott Dietzen and his team aim at $1B in revenues. During that same time, on the other hand, the stock price went from around $18 to $10, which results in a market capitalization of roughly $2.2B.As of January 2017, the company had $546M of cash (including marketable securities), no debt and $507M of current assets on its balance sheet. Since the company incurred $116M in stock-based compensation and had $87M in deferred revenues, it used only $14M cash in operations (a fraction of recorded losses). Net of operations linked to marketable securities, $83.3M were used for investing activities. This means the company has plenty of room for future spending if it needs to.The mid to long-term goal of Pure Storage is to achieve operating margins of at least 15%, which seems to be perfectly doable given its current gross margin of 65% and everything we have discussed so far. As far as valuation regards, the exact numbers are always debatable, but even under conservative assumptions it is hard to object to the claim that the stock is undervalued: let's assume that yearly revenues reach $1B within foreseeable future and that the management reaches its 15% operating margin. This would lead to $150M in income from operations and roughly $97.5M in net income considering a tax rate of 35%, which is probably excessive. Shares outstanding are currently around 207M. This would lead to an EPS of $0.47 and a PE ratio of 21 at the current $10 share price-without even factoring in the growth potential.To assess the future growth, consider that sooner or later the vast majority of the $35B revenues generated by all storage sellers will come from AFAs. If Pure Storage was able to defend its 15% market share it currently has in the all-flash business, it would by then generate $5B in revenues. Based on the numbers used above, it would achieve $2.35 in EPS and a have a PE ratio of around 5 at current share price. Put in simple terms: buy Pure Storage at a fair price today and get its future growth potential for free.Reasons for low valuationPure Storage currently has short interest of above 20%. There are several short theses, but they don't seem to stand against scrutiny:Erratic behavior of the stock priceThe past month or so was interesting: traders sent the stock down by more than 10% percent after the earnings call at the beginning of March because Q1 guidance was ""disappointing"" while whole year guidance seemed ""aggressive"". A few days later, the stock gained more than 7% percent because Nimble Storage (NYSE:NMBL) (a vendor specialized mainly in hybrid systems for small and medium-sized enterprises before moving into all-flash) had been acquired by Hewlett Packard Enterprise for a 45% markup. As already mentioned, Pure Storage has no interest whatsoever in being a target. Most of the company's voting rights are bundled in the hands of its founders and directors, who go on repeating that they want to remain independent. The stock price started to slide once more when details of the Nimble deal emerged. Most recently it jumped again because analysts started appreciating the potential of FlashBlade.Personal views and conclusionMy personal view is that the erratic behavior of the stock price will go on for some time. But I also think that there are a series of positive catalysts at the horizon. For people unfamiliar with data science it seems to be difficult to believe that computing power and speed is still an issue in 2017, but when it comes to big data it certainly is. That is why I believe that there are a lot of companies out there that can't wait to get their hands on FlashBlade, which started selling only in January. Put in the words of IDC analyst Eric Burgener, FlashBlade ""... is the kind of technology an athletic-wear company needs to deliver product offers related to the star players in a soccer match that's still being played. It allows the manufacturer to analyze social media posts to determine whose shoes to promote"". In my limited view, FlashBlade has no real competition right now if you consider all aspects. Let's see how it does in the market.I also believe that the reaction to the last earnings call was overdone. It wouldn't surprise me if Pure Storage delivered a solid beat (as it has every time since its IPO) but I'm not sure whether this will impact the stock price positively in the short-term.Being a long-term investor, I would certainly welcome profitability, but with a balance sheet like Pure Storage I think in the next couple of years, growth and market share should be the primary focus.To conclude, I hope this article got some non-techs interested in Pure Storage. The company is quite undervalued despite strong potential. Unfortunately though, it happens to be in an overlooked market, and it will probably take some time until the negative perception of the storage industry changes. When it changes, however, better be prepared.Disclaimer: The article reflects my personal opinion and reality to the best of my knowledge, but I can't guarantee for content or outcomes.

Now NTAP has $5b in revenue and is profitable. Most new IPOs have either been gobbled up or are out of business. Check this out, it's a chart of Violin Memory (NYSE:VMEM). I'm sure EMC has post-it notes valued more than VMEM's market cap. Fusion-io was acquired by SanDisk and Nimble Storage's (NYSE:NMBL) shares are in single digits; its IPO price was $21.There are many people betting against Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG). The odds are against PSTG. The short interest is around 40% of float, which is very high.Why new entrants have struggledFusion-io couldn't crack $400 million in annual revenue and was serving a specific niche, specifically server-side flash. Fusion-io served a small TAM, had a small customer base, and was unable to differentiate itself.VMEM could not compete with other all-flash array vendors. EMC and NTAP have massive resources at their disposal, and their solutions are more mature.NMBL is at an interesting inflection point. It is now at $100m in revenue per quarter, but is showing worsening operating leverage. The pressure is on NMBL to become profitable.The storage market is in a lot of painTo begin, we'd like to be clear that storage may never grow again. The table below is sourced from IDC and illustrates the overall storage market decline of 3% in the third quarter of 2016 (YoY):There are many reasons for the decline in storage. The key reasons include:Will Pure Storage be the next victim of a competitive storage market?It now has been 24 years since the last independent profitable storage company was born, NTAP. The storage market is in decline, and the short interest on PSTG is at 40%. The odds are against PSTG. Even though the overall storage pie is over $40B, there isn't much room for new players. Many storage hopefuls will go out of business.To consider if PSTG will be successful, we need to spend more time on the competitive dynamics and less time on the financials. Reviewing financial models is just the start. For PSTG to become an independent and profitable company, it will need to crush the competition.This is how we believe things will play out:The storage market is too competitive to support new entrants unless they can truly disrupt the competition and industry. For the reasons explained above, we believe PSTG is doing just this and is hurting NMBL, EMC and NTAP. NMBL is growing, but is facing intense competition as described earlier and we don't believe it will become profitable and independent. NMBL will struggle.We believe PSTG is strengthening its competitive position and is consistently rolling out new products such as M10 and FlashBlade to provide a consistent increase in its TAM. This continuous strengthening of its competitive position and innovation gives PSTG a real chance to succeed. Success means independent and profitable.Financial model and fundamentalsThe below table looks at the financial model of NTAP, PSTG and NMBL. Interestingly, the market is extremely skeptical on the prospects of PSTG and NMBL, and price to revenue multiples are in line with NTAP. PSTG is growing the fastest and is starting to reduce its negative free cash flow margin and is trading at a modest premium to NTAP. NMBL is struggling to reign in losses.We expect PSTG to continue to grow and scale the business and become free cash flow positive at the end of calendar 2017. NMBL will continue to struggle and is unlikely to reach sufficient scale to become free cash flow positive.Key RisksThe three biggest risks to PSTG include:SummaryRecent storage IPOs have struggled and investors have had poor experiences and mixed results. The article explained why PSTG will continue to disrupt the storage market. Additional product launches will hurt NMBL, NTAP and EMC. The launch of the M10 and FlashBlade will increase the TAM, add competition for NMBL, and add additional use cases.Pure Storage's focus on the enterprise, partnership with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) through FlashStack, and entry into the scale out NAS market will allow PSTG to manage the key risks and succeed. We consider an investment in PSTG as higher risk as the company is not yet free cash flow positive. We recommend buying PSTG in two installments, half now at current levels, and half in 12 months once it becomes free cash flow positive."

        Very weak Q1 guidance due to an increase in new customers and more pronounced seasonality.
        Fiscal year 2018 guidance appears aggressive.
        Management's explanations on the call not overly convincing.
        Valuation looks cheap but risk profile has increased substantially.","Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) just reported its Q4/FY2017 results and largely continued its recent streak of modest beats on both the top and bottom line relative to analysts' expectations amidst record new customer additions.Moreover, the company provided initial FY2018 guidance very much in line with the street's current estimates and even projected sustained positive cash flows to be achieved in the second half of the fiscal year.Picture: Pure Storage ""FlashBlade"" Blade - Source: Company WebsiteBut it was, in fact, the company's strikingly weak Q1 guidance that caught my attention as management guided revenues 15% below the current consensus estimate of $204 mln and operating margin to a whopping negative 25%.On the call, management spent a lot of time explaining the reasons behind the poor Q1 guide and even more time to reassure analysts and investors about the company's ability to deliver the sizeable ramp up in revenues and earnings required in subsequent quarters to live up to full year guidance.Management specifically stated the following characteristics influencing the Q1 guide:Asked by analysts about their optimism to achieve the required, sizeable increase in growth rates beyond Q1, management pointed to the following:Frankly speaking, I was less than impressed with management's statements and, judging by the sheer number of questions centering around the full year guide on the call, analysts weren't entirely satisfied with the explanations provided to them, either.Moreover, the projected, substantial moderation of growth in the company's main FlashArray product line obviously raised some eyebrows among analysts as well as the fact, that competitors like DELL/EMC are already on the market with offerings similar to Pure Storage's new FlashBlade product.Accordingly, I see substantial risk for Pure Storage to miss its aggressive FY2018 targets by a wide margin with a good chance for the issue to become evident already in the company's Q1 report three months from now.That said, I still expect the financial community to give Pure Storage the benefit of the doubt for now, due to its mostly good execution history and an inexpensive valuation at just 1.5x projected FY2018 sales adjusted for the company's strong cash balance of almost $550 million.Personally, I am looking for analysts to largely affirm their views on the company tomorrow morning with my expectations for the stock to open only modestly in the red. In this case, I will be looking to establish a short position, as I could envision some of the company's larger, institutional holders to reassess their investment thesis in light of the increased risk for a substantial downward revision to revenues and earnings projections going forward.As a daytrader, I will most likely cover the position at session end at the latest point regardless of the outcome but might very well revisit the stock going into the company's Q1/FY2018 earnings release.Bottom line:Pure Storage's weak Q1 guidance substantially increases the risk for the company to fall well short of seemingly aggressive FY2018 targets. For now, I do expect analysts to largely give the company the benefit of the doubt but will nevertheless look to enter a daytrade on the short side tomorrow.Should the company indeed be forced to revise expectations going forward, the stock will easily crater to new, all-time lows.Given the heightened risk profile, I would advise investors to sell their shares despite the inexpensive valuation.I will revisit the stock on the short side going into the company's Q1/FY2018 earnings release."
4027847,98236,2016-12-02T12:30:49-05:00,"Pure Storage announced the results of its fiscal Q3 Wednesday afternoon.Results were a significant beat on both revenues and earnings.Expense management was a visible component of the beat.The company forecasted moderate but not hyper revenue seasonality in the coming quarter.The company is beginning its rollout of NVMe, a technology it believes will be as disruptive in the storage space as the introduction of flash.","Pure Storage - It's Valuation Shrinkage TimePure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) reported the results of its fiscal Q3 that ended 10/31/16. I guess I would describe the results and the guide as one of the unexciting beats. I was amused in reading one commentary this morning to find the author unhappy with results that diverged from his model by 80bps. While the language was temperate, the thoughts - quelle horreur. An 80-bps divergence from his forecast in non-GAAP product gross margins. Armageddon must soon be at hand.The beat was basically seen by investors and analysts as to be expected. The shares were down around 10% today although that was partially a reflection of a very visible drubbing taken by the entire tech group based on very little substantive news…other than that age-old culprit of sector rotation.Pure's beat was simply not large enough to satisfy investors. We have reached the stage where investors are worrying that beats might not be large enough going forward and are left handicapping the size of the expected over-attainment.I first wrote about PSTG two months ago, and said it was a buy then at about this price. The share price has decreased marginally. The tech valuations are also marginally lower but the outlook for Pure is better than it was two months ago. I still like Pure Storage shares and think that they will outperform the tech index. Tech is being sold heavily today and it is possible that we are in one of those market phases where tech has a difficult hill to climb. That is a different subject. If tech reprises what happened in its wreck earlier this year, so will the shares of this company. I think the shares are cheap, but not cheap enough in that kind of environment to protect them from material share price devaluation.I think that revenue growth will track higher than the current consensus and I think there is no potential price war on the horizon for the specific storage products that this company sells. The days of spinning disc are coming to an end, and this company remains a leader in the world of all-flash arrays (AFAs). There is a huge amount of potential operating leverage although the company is in the earliest days of making that happen. The cavils that I have seen regarding the shares, and there are more than a few, are of little importance when looked as part of valuation parameters.Just for the record, PSTG announced a 50% growth in revenues, a beat of about 3% compared to guidance - a bit more on a constant currency basis. Gross margins were up 380 bps year on year and were exactly in the middle of the guidance range. Operating margins, particularly non-GAAP operating margins, improved as well, although GAAP opex spending growth slowed significantly both year on year and sequentially. Non-GAAP financial performance showed even stronger performance helped by the rapid rise in share-based comp., which basically doubled in this last quarter year on year.The company is still a long way from cash flow break-even despite the high level of stock-based comp. The rapid growth in revenues is also driving rapid growth in receivables and deferred revenues, not really a major operational consideration, fell quite a bit year on year.Guidance was pretty much a non-event if you consider non-events to be consistent with 48% revenue growth. The mid-point of the non-GAAP margin guidance produces an EPS loss a bit less than the current consensus but there have been complaints that leverage needs to be greater. Fact is that with the upcoming quarter bracketing the end of both the calendar year and the fiscal year, I would be surprised to see sequential growth of 11-15%. While that is approximately consistent with the percentage growth of revenues between Q3 and Q4 fiscal 2016, I expect that Q4 seasonality will be stronger than forecast. But the question is, will it be enough? I imagine that if revenue beats, then so too will earnings. There is plenty of leverage at scale available.I initially wrote about Pure Storage on this site in an article of September 20th. The shares, in the wake of the share price movement this morning, are basically down a bit since that time. The software/tech index is also down a bit after today's drubbing. It has been a wasted few months in which to have been a Pure shareholder.The current consensus rating from First Call for Pure shares is a tepid 2.2, holding between buy and hold and the latest coverage initiations were at neutral. That being said, the consensus analyst price target is $16.50, 27% higher than current quotes.Price Wars and Storage - The two are not synonymous!Pure shares are not highly valued in terms of EV/S. And while it is not quite yet objectively provable, I think a business like this with a gross margin above 65% is going to be quite profitable when it reaches some kind of steady-state growth. I will discuss valuation a bit later in this article, best as can be done. At the moment, the company has a market capitalization of $2.38 billion. Its cash balance is a bit greater than $500 million and so it has an enterprise value of less than $1.9 billion. The current estimate for sales in the 2018 fiscal year is just a bit above $1 billion - thus the EV/S is less than 2X. I do not want to try to probe the psyche or the logic of the 10 analysts who rate this name a hold. They clearly have different and much higher bars than I do regarding evaluating stocks. Or as is really the case, they believe that the growth trajectory for Pure is far more fraught than I do or that the path to profitability is littered with boulders and hidden landmines.Basically, it all comes down to two things. Many analysts, looking at the results of the storage wars of the past few years, can bring themselves to believe that this is a different world with new players and new sets of key metrics. And other analysts can't believe that companies that sell products intended for corporate data centers can do so successfully in the context of the explosion of cloud computing. I suppose that is unfortunate - but when there are urban legends that animate share price discussion, it presents investors with opportunities that are normally not available. The fact that PTSG has a short interest of 16 million shares which is a substantial percentage of its current float is an indication of just how deep this misapprehension is in the minds of some investors/hedge funds. There are investors who often suggest that it is hard for them to go against a high short interest because the short interest ""must know something."" Sometimes it pays to go against that kind of thinking as the rewards can be far more significant than otherwise.I do not want to spend a substantial amount of space in this article in reprising the history of the enterprise storage space. I have been involved with it one way and another since 1969. It has always been competitive, prices always fall and price elasticity has always been enormous. As the saying goes, plus ca change, meme ca chose. Flash, which is the subject under discussion here, must become cheaper if it is going to entirely supplant spinning discs. And it is becoming cheaper. A few days ago, I got a post from a reader who is a storage engineer. The reader was writing about an article I had published regarding the transition of NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) from its near-death experience to a company now becoming based on selling AFAs. He commented that his company was introducing the next generation of solid state drives (SSDs), the core ingredient of AFAs that are very advanced and incredibly cheap. That is how the storage market works. The components decline in price, the storage vendors incorporate the technology in their designs and cut prices and demand booms.Oh, there is one difference here. Flash is competing against spinning discs. The cheaper flash becomes, the higher its market share will be and the faster it will obsolete spinning disc.I expect that Pure will continue to lower prices for the foreseeable future and I expect that Pure will both continue to gain market share and maintain relatively high product gross margins indefinitely. (Concerns about the current prices of NANDs are way overdone.) Those investors waiting for some collapse in product gross margins have not only missed the bus - they are in the wrong bus. I have identified one link that discusses the growth of AFAs in the overall storage space; there are many, many others that suggest the structure of the market and its growth.The AFA space is probably on track to see growth of 70%+ this year overall. Pure is in the third position in the market behind EMC/Dell including all of their different brands and NetApp whose market share has exploded thanks both to their own acquisition strategy and their focus on AFA.Of the companies in the space, Pure and Nimble (NYSE:NMBL) have significantly higher gross margins than do their competitors suggesting they have significantly lower costs. Would it make sense for EMC or NetApp to start a price war when they have substantially greater costs than either Pure or Nimble? To say that it would be unusual is an understatement. Does it make any more sense for either Pure or Nimble to start a price war? Not really when both companies are achieving spectacular growth in all-flash and would only be cutting their own revenues.Does Pure have a Secret Sauce and how does it keep the sauce secret?One of the issues constantly cited by both potential investors and commentators regarding the enterprise storage space is that the products are commodities. Storage is storage is storage, or so they believe. I think that to be a substantial misapprehension that has a patina of verisimilitude and the substance of a bowl of mush. These days there are about six credible vendors of AFAs. But they do not all sell the same things. Pure has prospered because of its very high Net Promoter Scores, second only to those of Nimble and within hailing distance of those Nimble has received. (Net Promoter Scores are a measure of user satisfaction and depict the percentage of users who are willing to recommend a particular product or service. Pure has a Net Promoter Score of 83.5 with 100 being the highest on a scale of +100 to -100.)Pure has a more reliable platform than much of its competition with six nines of availability. These days, the company is focusing its development on something called NVMe (Non-Volatile Memory) technology. I am not qualified to state as does Scotty Dietzen, the CEO of this company that ""NVMe offers the potential for a 100-fold increase in performance to processing many requests simultaneously (Parallel) rather than one at a time…We believe all-NVMe is going to prove (to be a) bigger disruptor than all-Flash."" Based on what I have read, this seems likely to be the case and its wide adoption by Pure will constitute a significant technology moat behind which it can grow and prosper…until some competitor is able to replicate the capability. NVMe is being used as part of the Pure offering currently but it has been a development focus for the last several years. At some point in the near future, NVMe will become a major factor in the Pure offering and it will become a major differentiator in terms of storage performance. Essentially, it is the difference between sequential and parallel read points. (I apologize if I have over-simplified the technology but so far as it goes, it is suffice to say that it will be a part of the secret sauce for Pure, and an important one at that, and one that should be appreciated by investors in terms of how they might value the shares of this company.) To what extent NVMe will be a differentiator and exactly how much of lead Pure has in the technology is not totally knowable at this point. I do think it is fair to say that it is something that has already helped the company win enterprise deployments and it is likely to become even more of a competitive factor the closer Pure gets to a major NVMe launch.Pure is also in the midst of launching FlashBlade, which is a product line for unstructured and Big Data. This has been an under-served market for years now since EMC absorbed and later eviscerated Isilon. (Isilon still exists in some truncated state for EMC/Dell but investments have not kept up with the pace of technology change in that market.)Again, many hedge funds and some individual investors continually expect to see revenue growth for this company revert to the mean, whatever the mean might actually be. But the storage market is not a commodity and all storage simply is not fungible. Again, I do not want to attempt to define the features of FlashBlade that facilitate the performance and capacity of the solution. Here is a link to Pure's marketing blog regarding FlashBlade. While it will not produce a great deal of revenue this year, it obviously has the potential of being a significant revenue generator in fiscal 2018 and beyond and is one of the factors that should allow this company to expand its market share within the flash storage market.What is the current competitive state of play in the storage market?I would never suggest that the storage market is not competitive. Pure doesn't go out and win deals as a sole source. One area that some believe to be an area of potential competition that has emerged recently is the offerings of hyper-converged products. These offerings appear to have befuddled investors and analysts and in particular, those offered by Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) are thought to be Pure's competitors. I have written favorably about Nutanix, but hyper-converged technology is better suited to remote and branch offices for its workloads and, at this point, does not often compete for workloads in primary data centers. Hyper-converged is very attractive because of the automation it offers in running data centers, and its decreased footprint, but at the moment, it is not intended to compete against AFA for most applications.When it comes to what I might call basic workloads, Pure has developed a form of storage efficiency in the flash world. This is akin to the advantage that NetApp used to enjoy when it was able to use storage efficiency to charge more per unit of storage but still was considered to be a lower cost competitor because it used less storage than competitors to provide the same throughput. Pure makes a similar claim and it would seem to bear out in the fact that gross margins for this company are significantly higher than those of the traditional competitors who now sell flash. Those competitors simply have to provide more capacity while matching the Pure price in order to sell.EMC remains and is likely to remain the principal storage competitor and it is also the largest vendor of flash. Anecdotally, there is still a fair amount of confusion and sales force dysfunction in the new enterprise - but over time, that is likely to fade. The CEO of Pure said that EMC offers nine different flavors of flash and while I imagine that it does not offer nine products to one customer at one time, the confusion of the non-integrated product line affords competitive opportunities for a company such as this.At the moment, Pure maintains that when deals get to the Proof of Concept phase, it has a two-thirds win rate and given its technology advantages, that is not terribly surprising. Pure has a meaningful partnership with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) which is a significant competitive differentiator and Cisco partners have begun to migrate from EMC/Dell to Pure. In order to develop offerings that include Cisco compute, Cisco networking and Pure Storage. I believe that over time, that will become a meaningful market share driver for Pure.I want to close this section by addressing what many investors think to be some kind of long-term disease that Pure has to deal with and of course, that is competition from the cloud. I want to constrain the length of this article, at least to some degree, but the fact is that to many users, cloud storage is cheaper than, far cheaper than any kind of on-premise storage. A few weeks ago, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) took an axe to its pricing, and in particular, to its storage pricing, which was cut by as much as 28% for one kind of storage in one region. (Amazon has a multiplicity of offerings such that it is not possible to talk about the overall impact of its pricing changes in the storage area. There are apps that have been developed to help AWS users understand their costs - and even with those apps it is hard to speak about any kind of knowable pricing for a typical workload).It is obvious that over the past several years, the emergence of the cloud has dramatically inhibited the usage of external storage and it is just recently that shipments of external storage have stopped falling in dollar terms. Many of those institutions and investors that have short positions in Pure shares believe that the phenomenon that happened in the past will happen again going forward and that Pure's growth will be inhibited materially by competition with steadily lower cost cloud storage alternatives.But things really do not stand still in technology. I have to once again talk about NVMe, something I am more than a bit loath to do. But the architecture of NVMe, which has thousands of parallel points of connection, is ideally suited to both Big Data/Analytics and unstructured data applications. By this point, I think, most investors recognize that the world of the next several years will be one of hybrid clouds and it is fair to say that the advent of NVMes will allow users to cheaply and efficiently develop applications in their own clouds that make use of this technology. At some point, I anticipate, those institutions with their major short interest in Pure will come to the realization that the technology is far more complex and nuanced than they have realized and will throw in the towel and allow valuations to rise to levels commensurate with the company's rocketing growth.Costs, Valuation and a restatement of the investment case for all who may have missed itI understand that in an attempt to be thorough I sometimes befuddle. I don't like to write about specific new technology trends and base an investment thesis on that - but the fact is that shareholders and those thinking of investing in this name are really buying into very specific technologies that are being brought to market by Pure's team. There is no hidden cash flow or margin generator here. If readers believe that the technologies, described as best my poor fingertips and keys are capable of doing, are for real, then the numbers will align and the investment will work. And the opposite is true. It is lots more than just flash. It is flash, it is unstructured data. It is storage efficiency and it is the advent and proliferation of NVMe. Is all of that worth an expectation of 30%+ growth for several years? I think it is.So, the question becomes one of profitability. I am not going to get involved in debating the course of NAND pricing, or what the ramp will be on FlashBlade gross margins. Over time, NANDs will get cheaper. Over time, volumes on FlashBlade will reach levels consistent with gross margins in the range of this company's model.Overall, GAAP operating expenses grew by 52% sequentially. Included in that amount was a one-time $30 million legal settlement. Absent the settlement, GAAP opex grew by 30% year on year, substantially below the 50% growth of revenues and demonstrating significant operating leverage. I am puzzled that such a level of expense discipline did not receive more and more favorable commentary. For nine months, and excluding the legal settlement, GAAP expenses grew by 46% while total revenues grew by 72%.Sequentially, revenues grew by 21% reflecting some of the seasonality of the end of the fiscal year of the Federal Government. Sequential operating expense was only up by 6%, again excluding the legal settlement. These are all GAAP expenses.During the course of the call, the company's CFO, Tim Riitters explained the seasonality of expenses. At this point, the company has diminished hiring although it will always have room to add engineering talent. Hiring will re-accelerate in Q1 and Q2 of the new fiscal year. But I think the takeaway here is that the path to profitability is very visible here. The company says it will reach sustained positive cash flow in the second half of next year; the results this quarter do show a company exercising a fair amount of expense discipline.One can tinker with numbers and models every which way. I think that based on the business case I have laid out, it is reasonable to believe that even with an external storage market basically not growing, flash will continue to grow rapidly for years to come and this company is likely to grow faster than the flash market as a whole.I also think that the company can readily achieve its margin goals over several years. It is entirely reasonable to put together a model that shows non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.25-2.50 in fiscal 2020 for this company and free cash flow should be roughly equal to non-GAAP earnings. What is the worth of $400-450 million in non-GAAP earnings/free cash flow in 2020, growing at perhaps 15%? Again, the answer depends on the discount rate that is used, but if the variables fall into place, then a reasonable valuation is several times the current enterprise value of $2 billion."
4002612,52852,2016-08-28T11:44:27-04:00,"PSTG reported a great Q2 print.Sell side analysts rejoiced, bears panicked.Stock rallies, investors realize how silly it was, Yellen done yellin', then stock sells off.","Something peculiar happened today in the equity market: Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) reported earnings on August 25th after the close; the stock traded up 14% at the open, but ended the day down 3.6%. Holy Totoro, what happened? Allow me to walk you through the events step by step, and conclude with my interpretation of what I think is the right way to trade PSTG going forward.On August 25th, promptly after the market's close, PSTG released Q2 earnings. The print looked good on the surface: EPS came in at ($0.16) vs. ($0.23) consensus, revenue came in at $163.2M vs. $155.2M consensus, and it guided Q3 revenue to $187-195M vs. $190.7M consensus.Going into some details in the print:At 5 PM EST, PSTG hosted its call. Some notable takeaways from the call include:Ecstatic, traders sent the stock up 14%.It is worth nothing that out of 25 analysts covering PSTG, 60% of them have a Buy rating vs. 40% with Hold ratings. In fact, PSTG has the highest Wall Street rating score out of all its storage peers. This is a remarkable disconnect with reality given PSTG is the most heavily shorted stock, with 51% of outstanding shares short vs. an average of 5% short for peers. PSTG is also the worst performing storage stock (excluding tiny VMEM) and tech stock in general, dramatically underperforming competitors like EMC (EMC), Nimble (NYSE:NMBL) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) YTD.With that as background, it should not be a surprise that soon after the earnings release, the Sell Side began pumping out mostly bullish reports, regardless of what Q2's results were really telling the market. Sell Side analysts also tend to be reactive rather than forward thinking - this is why they look at the after-market trading price and customize their reports to how investors (or robots) initially reacted to the stock.I will offer my view of what I think happened. Note that I am just one market participant and that I have not closely followed this stock until the mysterious move today, but given my background I think I am qualified to make an educated interpretation of the events.First, the print was great, and the guidance was roughly in-line. With 51% of its float short, there are more bears tuning into earnings than bulls - this is important to keep in mind.Let's walk through a likely scenario. The poor 25 year old analyst at XYZ hedge fund who recommended shorting the stock immediately begins to panic after seeing the report. He knows all-flash array is rapidly commoditizing and that the fate of storage equities tends to end badly - that is, unless the storage company gets acquired, but PSTG is too big and expensive to get acquired. So he tells his 55-year old boss, who doesn't know the difference between all-flash and fried chicken, to short the stock. The 25 year old's face turns white and sees that the stock is up 6% in the aftermarket, and immediately begs his boss to cover. This drives the stock up to +14%.Wall Street takes a look at the aftermarket trading and tailors their report to the reaction. At the end of their report they note a few negatives, including discounting, cost pushout, and weak gross margins both for the quarter and in the guidance.In the morning, panic covering ensues, which finally eases when people realize what a bad quarter it was, and then Janet Yellen's hawkish commentary emboldens bears and sellers. All of this culminated with the stock trading down nearly 4%.In case you missed exactly why the quarter was actually bad, I'll make it abundantly clear for you:So there you have it, now you know what happened with PSTG, at least from the perspective of one market participant. If my interpretation is correct, PSTG's trend will be biased to the downside."
3944956,24157,2016-03-01T13:26:09-05:00,"Pure Storage went public with no profits, dwindling cash and stiff competition.Not surprisingly, shares fell post IPO, but still remain significantly overvalued.We've seen numerous IPO companies crash in the recent past, and the data storage market is littered with landmines. PSTG could be the next to go off.","We focused on overvalued IPOs in 2015, including Square (NYSE:SQ) and Planet Fitness (NYSE:PLNT). This week's Danger Zone hones in on another IPO from 2015 that may have been one of the last to capitalize on the easy money in the market. Post IPO, we believe it won't take long for investors to realize this company is bleeding cash, has no profits, and faces stiff competition moving forward. This week's Danger Zone is Pure Storage, Inc. (NYSE:PSTG).Look Past Revenue, Search For ProfitsWhile many ""unicorns"" were debunked as myth in 2015, Pure Storage was able to avoid such scrutiny and went public on the strength of its revenue growth. Since 2013, the company has grown revenue by 436% compounded annually. It seems IPO investors chose to overlook the fact that profits have remained negative. Pure Storage's after-tax profit (NOPAT) has fallen from -$77 million in 2014 to -$179 million in 2015. Figure 1 shows the disconnect between revenue and profit:Figure 1: Pure Storage's Increasing LossesSources: New Constructs, LLC, and company filingsPure Storage has the same problem as many overvalued startups: unsustainably high expenses. From 2012 to 2014, cost of revenues, research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative costs have risen 324%, 174%, 277% and 301% compounded annually.Unfortunately, dumping further capital into the business has been a poor investment. Pure Storage's return on invested capital (ROIC) has declined from -42% in 2014 to -72% in 2015. Worst of all, Pure Storage needed to IPO to continue operating, as its free cash flow reached -$312 million (13% of market cap) in 2015.Non-GAAP Metrics Are Frightfully MisleadingWe've warned investors about the accounting practices of IPO companies as well as the over usage of non-GAAP earnings, and Pure Storage raises lots of non-GAAP red flags. The company uses numerous non-GAAP measures to paint its business in a more positive light, as can be seen below:Like most companies using non-GAAP, Pure Storage excludes all sorts of operating expenses from these metrics. For example: Stock-based compensation, assumed preferred stock conversion, and a one-time charge for an equity grant to the Pure Good Foundation. So how meaningful are these exclusions?Even after removing these large expenses, the company is unable to turn a ""profit,"" GAAP or non-GAAP.Competitive Market Diminishes Growth ProspectsPure Storage faces enormous competition in the data storage market. This market includes large storage vendors such as EMC (NYSE:EMC) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), large companies acquiring similar technology such as HP (NYSE:HPQ), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Dell and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY), and new startup companies offering next-generation storage solutions.A relative latecomer to this market, the company lacks not only the resources of the larger incumbents, but also lacks its profitability. See Figure 2.With so many offerings in the flash storage market, we think buyers will be very price sensitive, which makes Pure Storage's deep level of unprofitability (ROIC of -72%) a major competitive disadvantage. How can it compete on price when it is losing so much money?Figure 2: Pure Storage's Poor ProfitabilitySources: New Constructs, LLC, and company filingsBull Case Undermined By Competitor StrengthPure Storage's focus on all flash storage differs from competitors' offerings, which still use hard disk based and hybrid storage. The bull case surrounding the company implies that not only are hard-disk-based storage solutions going to be ditched for flash, but also that Pure Storage can take nearly all market share.While Pure Storage touts that the enterprise storage market is estimated to reach $27 billion by 2018, it fails to mention that in 2014, all flash arrays, which the company specializes in, only made up $667 million of this entire market. The small size of the market notwithstanding, EMC has a large lead over Pure Storage, which means it will be rather difficult for PSTG to take a majority share of that market.In mid-2015, Gartner estimated that EMC had a 34% share of the all flash array market, more than that of Pure Storage and IBM combined, which placed No. 2 and No. 3, respectively. EMC's success in this market, after acquiring XtremIO in 2012, further underscores its competitive strength. Moreover, because EMC operates other profitable business lines, it has more capital to invest in this market. It also has greater distribution as its reported cumulative sales passed $1 billion in less than two years, something Pure Storage has failed to achieve since launching flash array in 2012. With EMC's large existing customer base that can be upgraded to all flash arrays, PSTG faces an uphill battle in taking market share from EMC. Herein lies another big problem for the company. The current stock price implies that Pure Storage has not only won the battle, but also already conquered the storage market all together.Valuation Is Unrealistic With Or Without AcquisitionPure Storage went public at $17/share and has already fallen well below this price. Despite this price decline, shares are still significantly overvalued. Even if it achieves just 1% pre-tax margins (-103% in 2015), the company must still grow revenue by 50% compounded annually for the next 14 years to justify its current price. In this scenario, it would be generating $50.1 billion in revenue 14 years from now, which is slightly more than Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) 2015 revenue and only $4 billion less than Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) 2014 revenue.Even if we assume Pure Storage can achieve a 13% pre-tax margin (average of competition in Figure 2) and can grow revenues by 30% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is only worth $10/share today - a 28% downside.Could A Competitor Acquire Pure Storage?As can happen in growing technology markets, large firms often acquire new technology rather than building it. Could acquisition hopes be driving Pure Storage's expensive share price? Let's take a look at the stock through the lens of a potential acquirer.Scenario 1: NetApp acquires Pure Storage. NTAP has the highest profitability of its competition from Figure 2. Assuming upon acquisition Pure Storage immediately achieves NetApp's margins and ROIC, the company would still have to grow revenue by 40% compounded annually for the next decade to justify buying PSTG at its current price (~$14/share). In this scenario, the value of Pure Storage's business based on the value of the firm if it achieves NTAP's 7% NOPAT margin in year 1 of the acquisition is still below $0 due to the large value of preferred capital and outstanding employee stock options (more on this below).Hidden Liabilities Make Buyout Even More UnlikelyPure Storage has some hidden liabilities that make the company even more expensive than the standard accounting numbers suggest and pull its valuation below the current $14/share.Catalyst: Market Wakes Up To RealityHistory shows that startup storage firms have a checkered history in the data storage market.With negative profitability and strong competitors, we wouldn't be surprised to see PSTG's shares fall as soon as customer growth and revenues come in even slightly below expectations. With the quick success of EMC, this event could occur as soon as next quarter. However, much like the case of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), which trades solely on customer growth, if investors focus on a KPI unrelated to profits or the creation of shareholder value, it could take a few quarters before investors realize that Pure Storage's business is not sustainable in its current form.Executive Compensation Provides Little AccountabilityDue to Pure Storage's designation as an ""emerging growth company,"" it is not required to disclose the details regarding its executive compensation. As it stands, executives receive bonuses based upon ""company and individual goals."" Unfortunately, these goals are not outlined in Pure Storage's S-1. If we were to make a recommendation, PSTG would be wise to adopt a plan that awards executives based upon meeting a target ROIC since ROIC has been proven to be a driver of shareholder value creation.Impact Of Footnotes Adjustments And Forensic AccountingWe have made several adjustments to Pure Storage's S-1:Income Statement: We made $4 million adjustments with a net effect of removing $4 million (2% of revenue) in non-operating expenses. We removed $4 million in non-operating expenses and $0 in non-operating income.Balance Sheet: We made $105 million of balance sheet adjustments to calculate the invested capital with a net decrease of $39 million. The largest adjustment was the removal of $27 million related to operating leases. This adjustment represented 9% of reported net assets.Valuation: We made $758 million (31% of market cap) adjustments that all decrease shareholder value. There were no adjustments that increase shareholder value. The most notable adjustment to shareholder value was the removal of $544 million due to the preferred stock. This adjustment represents 22% of Pure Storage's market cap.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."
4007341,98236,2016-09-20T13:01:52-04:00,Pure Storage and Nimble Storage are essentially the last two independent players who compete in the high-growth flash storage market.Neither company has yet been profitable and neither has generated positive cash flow consistently.Flash is in the process of ending the days of the spinning disc and its market share gains are accelerating.Pure has had a consistent record of exceeding high-growth targets and is likely to continue to do so.Nimble is just now entering the market for all-flash arrays and restarting its growth engine. There are some green shoots to be seen.,"Anything you can do I can do better!Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) and Nimble Storage (NYSE:NMBL) are the current enfant terribles of the enterprise storage business. They were both formed about a decade ago to provide flash storage arrays in competition not just with each other but almost every storage vendor who has ever walked the earth. (At this point Nimble and Pure are really only competitors in that they both provide flash storage products. It appears that over time that they will become competitive but that is not quite the case these days. But many investors seem to consider them in the same context and so I think it makes sense to include them in the same article. And so while the article is a bit long, readers get to learn about two companies for the price of a single read.) The lead in is the title for a song in the Irving Berlin hit of 1946 called 'Annie Get Your Gun' which was one of the showstoppers of that very successful musical.When I originally composed this sentence, I wanted to say that flash is the hottest trend in storage since the last one. But that really isn't the case. I first got into the IT business working for IBM right after the dawn of spinning discs. Spinning discs are a mechanical product that has the limitations and constraints inherent in all mechanical products. Flash marks a transformation of the same magnitude that spinning disc represented when it replaced tape at the start of my business career. Spinning discs are on a course to sunset in the next few years and the market will be more transformed by that time than has been the case since NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) came into the market in the 1990's with network attached storage (NAS) but this is a far more basic transition than that ever proved to be.Nimble and Pure have some similarities and differences. I think as a company and as an investment, Pure is easier to understand. While high-growth companies can readily hit murderous speed bumps, at this point, I think the odds favor Pure's ultimate success. It has shown signs of a real path to profitability and its market share gains are stunning. It has made the leadership quadrant of all of the MQ surveys that get published and of equal significance it has achieved a remarkable score in terms of user satisfaction that was remarked on by IDC in its latest survey as being unprecedented. It would appear to have developed a positive culture with regard to customer engagement that is not seen on the part of most other industry vendors - NTAP had but later lost that distinction some years past.Nimble share valuation is significantly cheaper than Pure and there are many reasons for that. The company, at least thus far, has shown a less distinct path to profitability although there are signs of improvement in the last couple of quarters. It entered the market for what are called all-flash arrays (AFAs) just a few months ago and its growth trajectory is certainly less well-established than that of its larger rival. For some years, its focus was on a hybrid flash product which is probably on the road to obsolescence. It may have entered the lists for AFA just in time and its latest forecasts call for growth to re-accelerate.Going back many years, there has never been a low-risk way of investing in the enterprise storage space. At one point, at the dawn of the internet, EMC was one of the so-called four horsemen companies and was priced as though it would never face competition. After that myth got shattered, NTAP was the poster child in the storage space for a while and achieved rapid and profitable growth for many years with a valuation to match. Then there were the companies in the deduplication space and those that pioneered scale-out NAS architectures. As readers will see shortly, flash came along a few years ago and many of the original companies in the space flamed out and were acquired in deals that proved to be very disappointing.Personally, I think investing in companies with disruptive technologies tends to be a fraught experience at best. Many investors just don't like having to bet so much on the come. And the fact is that the legacy companies in this space have been around for many years and are many times the size either Nimble or Pure. And this transformation is not quite like the mass extinction event when the meteorite that did away with the dinosaurs 65 million years ago and made room for our species. These dinosaurs will most likely survive in some fashion; some of them may even thrive to one extent or the other.One of the issues in investing in companies that sell enterprise storage is that there is always an element of commoditization and always issues with regard to price competition. No one buys storage of any kind for any reason other than some kind of quantitative analysis regarding cost. Storage doesn't look pretty and you can't get a thrill watching it accelerate from 0-60mph.The trick in selling storage is to be able to provide users with an experience that can resolve some of the inevitable issues with regard to price competition. There is some evidence that Pure has pulled that off and will continue to do so. It is not an impossible feat; NetApp enjoyed a very long run, enjoying high-gross margins and premium pricing but management eventually forgot how it got to that point. I think that the shares of PSTG are reasonably valued with an EV/S of just greater than 2X. Further, as I discuss below the company has a realistic path to profitability and that the company has achieved a relatively strong degree of differentiation that is likely to persist into the future. Overall, while Nimble shares are cheaper, I am not nearly as certain as to its future. I think if investors are going to invest in companies selling disruptive technology they may as well take the plunge all the way and focus at least as much on growth as on current profitability. But the fact is that with Nimble, investors get less growth and still are investing in a loss-making business. It doesn't quite add up for me when comparing the investment to buying PSTG shares.Needless to say, at the moment, neither Pure nor Nimble are profitable and that is true even on a non-GAAP basis. They both lose lots of money and they have burned some amount of cash. Growth has slowed markedly for Nimble but seems to be making a modest comeback. Pure has forecast slowing percentage growth but that certainly hasn't happened the last two quarters and it may have under-forecasted user appetite for the flash transition.Nimble shares have performed worse than those of Pure. Since the company's IPO back at the end of 2013, it has lost 77% of its value. Since Pure went public about just less than a year ago, it has lost just 19% of its value and it has had a significant rally of 20% over the past three weeks. Nimble and Pure really do not quite compete with each other. Their products are aimed at different corners of the storage market and the companies are not seen as alternatives. But they both use what is called flash technology to build their storage arrays and they are two of the three survivors of the flash craze that remain as independent vendors. (The third, Violin Memory, (NYSE:VMEM) is really in extremis and will almost surely wound up getting liquidated for little or no value.There is often a certain cadence that often appears in the life of a tech IPO. It starts out with valuations that reflect what might best be called a scarcity value as they cannot be justified by any real metrics that investors typically use. They are just ""Too darn Hot"" a famous song by Cole Porter from the show Kiss me Kate, itself an adaptation from Taming of the Shrew by William Shakespeare. And then, most often, the shares seem to ""Doin' what comes naturally,"" the title of a song from the musical Annie Get your Gun by Irving Berlin & writer Dorothy Fields and go through some major valuation compression.The question is really what comes next. What is the logic between thumbs-up on PSTG and a neutral evaluation of NMBL? Can either or both of the companies find some realistic path to profitability in a very crowded market? Does either company have the potential to overcome the huge headwind that is the cloud that has made the enterprise storage business a graveyard for investor hopes?It will be these topics that I will try to explore in the foregoing article.By the Numbers - Some Compares and Contrasts!I suppose it would be nice for readers and it would certainly be nice for this writer if I could just gloss over this section. But I think undergirding any investment is a detailed quantitative analysis and here, in comparing two different companies, that comparison just simply has to be based on lots of numbers.Pure is quite a bit larger than Nimble with an enterprise value of about $2.1 billion compared to an enterprise value of $440 million for Nimble. Neither of the companies is in any danger of achieving profitable operations in the near future. They both happen to have fiscal quarter that end one month after calendar quarters. Pure has got a bit more than $570 million in cash and no debt. GAAP losses have shrunk significantly both year on year and sequentially. The company's cash burn has moderated substantially although it is still was above $10 million this past quarter, a step backward from the company's Q1 results. The company is forecasting consistent cash flow from operations in its next fiscal year and current trends suggest that the forecast is based on reasonable expectations.Stock-based comp at 16.6% of revenues last quarter is still rising substantially, up more than 100% year on year and 17% sequentially. The growth of deferred revenue has not been consistent in terms of its percentage but as the company gets larger, I would expect that most of its customers will choose an annual maintenance billing option that will make that metric more predictable and less random in terms of its pattern. There have been signs of leverage at scale, and those signs were significantly stronger last quarter than in the recent past. That said, however, management told investors on the last call that its results were assisted by unplanned inability to spend money - perhaps not such a terrible problem. Investors were cautioned to avoid thinking that profitability was just around the corner. I don't think that was a terribly alarming potential.Nimble's EV/S is down to just a bit more than 1X based on current-year estimates of 24 analysts. And its growth rate is down to less than 25% for the current year and 21% for next year. Pure's growth rate is estimated at 63% for this year although it was over 90% last quarter. I am not too sure how serious Pure's current year revenue estimate actually might be. Pure forecasts its revenue growth just once a year and that is what the consensus reflects. The fact is that both quarters so far this year have been significantly above the company's forecast without any adjustment in either guidance or estimates. The current quarter has an estimate that is supposedly tempered in terms of growth percentage because of a specific issue that drove results for the year-earlier Q3 significantly above plan.But so far this year, the company has achieved 92% growth and is forecasting growth to decelerate to 47% this quarter. Based on the recent track record, that seems to be more than a bit conservative. In any event, using the consensus estimate, Pure has an EV/S based on this year's estimated revenue of $717 million and an enterprise value just greater than $2 billion of 2.9X and an EV/S of 2.1X based on estimates for fiscal year 2018 that ends on 1/31/18. As will be explored below, there is massive investor skepticism that Pure can find its way to sustained profitability amidst the sand bars and shoals of the enterprise storage waters.Overall, Nimble's path to profitability appears more measured to this observer, and its growth rate, while starting to show favorable trends based on new product introductions, is far lower, and far more at risk than is the growth rate of Pure. The company's GAAP losses have shown some modest signs of decreasing in the years since the company has been public, and the trend continued last quarter at a slightly faster pace. Some of that is the result of favorable gross margin trends that have been brought about because of product mix. Some of the improvement relate to control of general and administrative spending. But the other components of operating expense such as research and development are taking a long time to control. On the call, the CEO Suresh Vasudevan and CFO Anup Singh did everything in their power to avoid answering specific questions in a quantitative fashion when it came to margins. It makes it harder than it should be to guess about how long it will take for the company to reach profitability.The company has $195 million in cash and no debt. That puts the company's enterprise value at just less than $435 million. With revenues estimated to be almost $400 million this year and $482 million next year the EV/S metrics are just a bit greater than and a bit less than 1X. Most analysts raised estimates in the wake of results for the quarter that ended on 7/31 but those kinds of valuations reflect more than a bit of skepticism regarding viability. They are also at levels that have to invite speculation about the company being a candidate for consolidation by either private equity or from one of the many strategic participants in the enterprise storage space. Trying to handicap the evolution of price wars on into the future is certainly a fraught exercise, and one made more difficult when considering that this company is likely to have lower product costs than its larger competitors as reflected by its gross margins that are 65% GAAP and 67% non-GAAP. Gross margins were essentially consistent in the past quarter and compared to 65.3% non-GAAP gross margins in the year-earlier period. It is relatively plain that this company, along with Pure, enjoys substantial cost advantages when compared to legacy vendors who have far lower gross margins probably reflecting both lower average selling prices per unit and higher manufacturing costs for their very old designs.The company's results have been hovering right around break-even in cash flow for several quarters. Last year, it generated cash; this year it has burned some. The amounts are not particularly material and for what it is worth, Q2 showed an improvement at the margin when compared to Q1.Have valuations for these once high-flyers just been doin' what comes naturally, i.e. compress or is there some substance to make them worthwhile as potential investments. It is relatively clear that the valuations have compressed by more than might be attributable to the normal course of hyper-valued IPOs. Concerns regarding competition and particularly price wars are rampant. I think those concerns are likely to prove overblown, particularly when the aggressors in the price war have inherently higher product costs than these two smaller competitors due to older, less efficient architecture. While the current lack of cash flow may preclude sale to some private equity bidders of either Nimble or Pure, there are many operating entities, including most of the large old-line server companies who might be able to reap lot of cost and some revenue synergies. That is probably most true for Nimble which is more of a specialist niche vendor than is the case for Pure and has a valuation that usually attracts bidders like crazy relative to many other valuations.The storage space and flash - a bit of backgroundThere have been many trends in the IT world that have come and gone through the years. One set of constant trends, however, has been the extremely rapid growth of storage demand in most user installations coupled with the extremely rapid degradation in price per unit. If there is nothing surer in life than death and taxes, there is nothing surer in an IT installation than the need for more storage capacity and the availability of more capacity at a lower price per unit. This article is not the place to discuss the growth in storage demand although I have to touch on issues with regard to price elasticity and the cloud at least on the periphery.For many decades, spinning discs have been the technology that has been used to provide storage to users. The leading vendor in the space has been EMC although lately statistics suggest that Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) has been giving it a run for its money. But with the consolidation between EMC and Dell now underway, it is certain that the new entity will be the king of the market share hill both now and for some time in the future. Rivals that are included by both Gartner and IDC in their evaluation of the enterprise flash market space include NetApp, IBM (NYSE:IBM) other than those mentioned above also include private vendor Kaminario. Over the years, several smaller vendors have been consolidated.At the turn of the decade, the industry was vastly disrupted by the emergence of what are known as solid-state drives (SSDs) or flash. (There are industry observers who want to confuse things by putting the two terms in different buckets but the best definition I have seen is that solid-state drives are simply a disk without moving parts while flash is the implementation that allows this to happen. I will use the two terms interchangeably in the balance of this article.)All of a sudden, there were legacy vendors who had led the market in providing spinning discs and a new wave of vendors who furnished the market with enterprise-grade flash. It has been an interesting evolution to watch. One of the leading storage vendors, NetApp, was almost wiped out when its management held out against providing users with all-flash storage arrays. EMC bought a tiny flash storage company called DSSD for $1 billion because it sat above EMC's XtremeIO flash offering on performance graphs for SSDs. 3Par, which HPE had acquired in the midst of failing financial performance by that vendor, turned out to have flash technology that has been able to support HPE's storage market share. Fusion-io, which had been the largest independent company selling flash memory was bought by SanDisk (SNDK) a couple of years ago in the midst of what appeared to be a financial flame-out. IBM entered the market in 2012 when it bought Texas Memory Systems. I expect that IBM would not be in the storage business at all were it not for the need to support its server offerings. That said, if it has to sell storage, it can certainly find better storage to sell than that which it currently offers.The enterprise storage space these days is a large market, but one that is no longer growing. According to IDC, in Q1, the market declined by 7% overall to a run rate of $33 billion. Pure, on its recent conference call said that its addressable market was $24 billion. Market shares have shown a significant reshuffle based on which vendor has a superior flash product line. At the moment, perhaps to the surprise of some, Hewlett Packard is now in 1st place having overtaken EMC. As mentioned earlier, the combination of Dell and EMC is likely to be in 1st place once the product lines are consolidated. This year, more than 50% of the enterprise storage market will be flash according to IDC.PSTG is taking share in the enterprise storage space at a huge rate. Other share gainers are HPE and Huawei. Nimble competes in a far more specialized space that is self-limited at this point but it too is taking share within its defined space, again in the context of a declining market.Simply put, while the demand for storage capacity continues to rise significantly, the cloud is having a major impact on the demand for overall enterprise storage. In addition, the capability for data reduction that is possible with flash is considerable. (For readers unfamiliar with the term as it is currently used by many analysts, data reduction is the transformation of numerical or alphanumeric digital information derived empirically into a corrected, ordered and simplified form. Data reduction includes both deduplication and compression and both are incorporated in the Pure offering to a degree beyond that offered by other, competitive vendors.)The data centers that users used to grow, almost as though they were marijuana plants, are becoming a relic of a bygone era and more and more storage is coming to reside in the cloud. In addressing the outlook for Nimble and Pure, the questions on which to comment relate to their market share gains and their sustainability and that in turn relates to their ability to deal with the cloud-both public and private.Can Pure survive the bloodbath that is emerging in the storage space?Most readers just want to know if PSTG is a good stock to buy and to hold and they do not want to worry about the technology. But this is one of those particular situations in which understanding the technology, at least superficially, is really necessary in order to try to answer the question. The simple answer to the question is that not all flash drives are created equal and that Pure has flash technology that affords users significant advantages in terms of functionality that are unavailable from legacy vendors at this point. That is no doubt a statement that would find controversy amongst analysts but I have to use the objective material that is at hand. Pure is rated first by Gartner and tied for first by IDC. And it has an unprecedented user satisfaction score as reported by IDC - one that is far beyond that of its competitors. Since I do not buy or use storage I have to rely on the resources of third-party consultants. There are obviously going to be other opinions on the subject of who is offering the best price/performance or the potential that Pure's position could get eroded in the future - but for now the surveys show what they show. It would be hard to imagine under the circumstances for Pure not to gain market share at a substantial rate.When flash appeared on the scene, it presented legacy vendors with some significant challenges. For those readers with a recollection of history, it was more or less the same thing as when Britain launched its first Dreadnought in 1906. The dreadnought class of battleship was the ultimate fighting platform of its age and would soon lead to a mutually destructive arms race between Britain and Germany that was part of the background as to the casualty of WWI. Everything that had come before in terms of warships was instantaneously obsolete. Today, of course, there are no more battleships although if a reader goes to the San Jacinto monument outside of Houston, which is a memorial to the fight of Texas to free itself from Mexico and the battle that was fought on the site, you can still see the vessel as it has been completely restored. Depending on how fast one wants to drive, it is around one hour from the Galleria (the large shopping center on the west side of Houston to the monument.After years of working to perfect disc arrays that were faster and could be better deduplicated and generated less heat and used less power and so forth, the storage world had been turned on its head. The companies that had been the leaders in the storage market for many years are now the ones trying to catch up. At the moment, and for at least some time into the future, the race is to the ""Pure.""Pure's design these days incorporates several major functional advantages. I do not propose to go through how Pure delivers what it does - and I doubt if I would do the technology justice but the company has allowed users to break the typical cycle in which storage has to be bought anew every 2-3 years as old arrays reach their capacity limits. What PSTG describes as its ""Evergreen"" program is quite dissimilar than the way users wind up buying flash from legacy vendors. There is another basic concept in the world of storage called data reduction. It is a way of minimizing the amount of data that users have to store. One reason that the growth in storage shipments has come to a halt is that as flash becomes predominate, users need less of it to get the same results. It isn't that the growth rate in required storage capacity is slowing but that the need for capacity is being obviated, to an extent, by technologies that compress and deduplicate so that users wind up getting the same amount of storage capacity even though they have less storage than they would have needed a few years ago. Depending on workloads, the PSTG data reduction is several times more efficient than the flash arrays that are sold by legacy vendors and there are fewer snap shots that need to be taken. While it doesn't always work out on a one-for-one basis, many use cases will require less actual Pure storage than is the case with legacy vendors. It is the same concept that NetApp used to sell when it pioneered storage efficiency many years ago.Price wars are not going to go on indefinitely in the storage business as their results wind up being too painful for most vendors to sustain. In order to take some pressure off of current reported results, vendors frequently will heavily discount maintenance, they will provide a couple of years of free maintenance and they will bundle their offerings in order to provide users with what is notionally the ""lowest"" price. Much can be written about all of the different tactics in today's storage price wars; at the end of the day, selling products below their cost no matter how artful are the concessions in terms of reducing the reported impact in the initial year just cannot be sustained. Recommending or not recommending a stock like Pure is a bet on just how long and with what degree of intensity ""excess"" price competition might last. Does Dell eventually decide that it needs to generate cash and reduce its debt mountain or does it continue to try to put genies back in proverbial bottles? I am guessing the former - but other readers may disagree and I can't say that Dell, in particular, won't continue on its current path.The issue of market share is one that comes up in investment discussions regarding PSTG as a major factor in the company's valuation. The company's latest quarter showed growth of 93% year on year and 16% sequentially. The company is forecasting $191 million of revenues for its current quarter, which would be growth of 46%. And the consensus for next year, based on the estimates of 24 analysts shows growth of 40% with revenues of just above $1 billion. There is probably some upside in those numbers as they are essentially consistent with the dollar growth in sales achieved this year. The company's FlashBlade release is likely to open up the very top of the market for the company and it should positively impact results in a visible way during the course of calendar year 2017.The key for this company is going to be gross margins and their trend. If my surmise about the future of the price war bears out, and competitors start to focus a bit more on profitability than on market share, the opportunities for this vendor are significantly under-appreciated and under-valued. GAAP gross margins increased by 670 bps year on year and GAAP product gross margins increased a comparable amount to 67.3%, which suggests that the major impact of price competition is being held at bay. On the other hand, gross margins were down sequentially by more than 100 bps, and product gross margins declined by more than 200 bps in the last quarter. Some observers were concerned that this regression represented a more malevolent impact of the impacts of the price wars in the storage space. It is the bet one makes in investing in Pure. I think the slight downtick the company has forecast for the current quarter that ends on 10/31 is a function of the introduction of the FlashBlade product and not an estimate on the level of price competition in the market. I do think that the heavy debt load that is carried by Dell/EMC and the inevitable costs of merging two large organizations, is going to put some pressure on that company to improve short-term profitability and cash generation and that is likely to lead to somewhat less aggressive activities in terms of excessive price competition.As mentioned earlier, there are some signs that the company is starting to achieve expense discipline at scale although the progress is likely too slow for some. The following changes are all expressed as percentages based on GAAP in order to look at the direction of actual expenses.Research and development spending rose by 9.5% sequentially and sales and marketing spending rose by 4.8% sequentially. General and administrative systems declined sequentially. Overall, operating expense rose by 5.6% sequentially while total revenues rose by 16.4%. On the other hand, stock-based compensation expense has more than doubled year on year and growth in that category is showing no sign of slowing down. The increase in stock-based comp has been the single primary factor in the improvement in cash flow from operations. The company has forecast that CFFO will turn positive in the coming fiscal year and the trend supports that forecast even if the growth in stock-based comp starts to moderate.A blog I recently read said that no company since NetApp has been successfully launched in the storage business and reached a billion dollars in revenue since 1992. Pure is forecast to reach that milestone next year. I think the odds favor that the forecast will happen and that it will continue to deliver consistent although not earth-shattering improvements in both CFFO and in non-GAAP earnings. It has become cheap enough for me to recommend purchase of the shares.A (slightly) deeper dive into NimbleI can't quite get myself to pull the trigger in terms of recommending Nimble shares. It is very cheap for a growth stock in terms of EV/S. It hasn't made money or generated cash or any of those things that would allow one to evaluate the shares on the basis of financials. I am going to discuss GAAP metrics as I usually do when looking at expenses. Gross margins, which is key for many people in looking at an emerging storage name, were 64.6% last quarter compared to 65.3% in the prior year. That is a decent performance given the introduction of the company's AFA product line. Product gross margins fell from 68.4% to 66.8% although the sequential trend showed an improvement of more than 100 bps in this most recent quarter. There were signs of expense control of some magnitude sequentially. Sales and marketing costs were flat sequentially although they were still up by 29% year on year. General and administrative costs were flat sequentially and were up just more than 10% year on year. Research and development costs continue to increase significantly and were up by almost 13% sequentially. At more than 30% of revenue, research and development expense ratios have to fall by more than 1,000 basis points before the company can see a clear path to profitability.The company's most recent quarter was a solid beat. Revenues showed a bit of re-acceleration as the company started to enjoy the effects of the introduction of its AFA products. The company guided revenues slightly above the prior consensus but not enough apparently given the trajectory of the share price.This company's raison d'etre is based on what it calls cache-accelerated sequential layout (CASL) which allowed the company to combine flash and hard drives to achieve optimal performance. Recently (the past prior quarter) the company released its all-flash product and that product was 17% product bookings growth compared to 9% in the prior quarter. The company's guidance anticipates the continuation of that trend and seems in line with overall market trends. Eventually the use of all-flash is going to have salutary impacts on gross margin. The company does not compete beyond the low-end of the storage market and its future success will be tied to developing and selling AFAs in the segment. The company did see an increase of 37% in bookings of deals from large enterprise customers and it saw an increase of 60% in bookings from deals greater than $250,000.I think that there will always be a specialized market for this company's technology. It is more efficient to use any kind of storage based on caching and a form of predictive analytics which is the secret sauce this company embodies in its products. And I doubt that many competitors are going to choose to try to match Nimble's special sauce because its market is specialized and the company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing its operating system and the caching formula. It is going to win when it competes in the right use cases where its formula is uniquely valuable.Like Pure, the company has a very high Net Promoter Score (that is the metric that the industry uses to measure satisfaction and the 85% grade is more than double what the other larger storage vendors typically achieve.) But this is more likely than not to remain a niche market. I think that the most likely prospect for Nimble is to get bought at some point along the way given its size and its valuation - but that is rank speculation on my part.The company has wavered between positive and negative cash flow. Stock-based comp is 25% of revenues, one of the higher ratios around. On the other hand, it has basically stopped growing and since the company has to slow its research and development hiring which generates most of the stock-based comp, the ratio should start to improve over the next few quarters.The company is forecasting a significant growth re-acceleration that would, were it to happen, take growth significantly higher than the numbers in the current consensus. Many of the factors that would lead to such a result are unknowable at this point. One might indeed hit a home run by betting that with Nimble's AFA now being extended to all segments of the market and with some decent indications regarding go-to-market strategy the stars are aligning. I just don't quite have the confidence in things working out that way as there has yet to be enough of an established revenue trend and the phrase about there being many a slip twixt cup and lip is quite operative.Nimble hitting a home run - that is certainly possible but I like the risk/rewards inherent in betting on Pure a bit better where I can see what has been happening. There is lots of execution risk in restarting a growth engine once it has been allowed to sputter and I simply don't think there is enough information available to say that Nimble's secret sauce is going to be sold in this company's bottles over the long haul. But the valuation and the technology are such that it is a very real and very live consolidation candidate."
3556906,94046,2015-10-07T13:20:26-04:00,"The tech sector needs a confidence boost, but those in the bear camp have been proved right so far.Stretched valuations and risk-off trades suggest it won't be a very nice ride for Pure Storage, although the business is truly attractive.Several metrics indicate that investors should look for value elsewhere and that other IPOs in the pipeline could be pulled.","The tech sector needed a confidence boost and the IPO of Pure Storage (NYSE: PSTG) was meant to be great news this week.Unfortunately, those in the bear camp were right, at least judging by its performance in early trade on its debut on Wednesday, when the shares fell below their IPO price, as of this writing.It's still early days to determine fair value, but here are a few things you ought to consider if you are invested or if you plan to invest in its shares.First WarningThe IPO was priced at a mid-point $17 a share after launching at an indicative price range of between $16 and $18, which implied proceeds of $425m. Its equity capital was valued at $3.14bn at IPO, or about 11 times its forward revenues of $275m at the end of 2015, according to my estimates.The size of the offering was not prohibitive, yet nine financial institutions underwrote it. That means on average a $47.5m ticket for each financial institution, excluding an over-allotment option of 3.5m class A stock.Moreover, Pure Storage sold a total of 25m class A shares, which represented only 13% of class A and class B total shares outstanding (185m), excluding the over-allotment option as well as other shares associated to equity incentive plans, some of which are issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $4.53 per share.Its debut has been even more disappointing because volatility, as gauged by the VIX Index, remains rather low at 19.A & B SharesWondering what the difference between A and B shares is?As the company says, ""the rights of the holders of class A and class B common stock are identical, except with respect to voting and conversion rights."" In fact, the holders of A stock are entitled to one vote per share, while the holders of B stock are entitled to ten votes per share.In short, Pure Storage got away with the float but had to offer a smaller amount of stock at IPO, quite simply because its owners knew that investors would have not welcomed a demanding valuation, but needed the money to run the business.Incidentally, news of the Pure Storage float comes only a day after Digicel (NYSE: DCEL) had to pull its IPO - the mobile phone service provider said that challenging market conditions may have prevented it from receiving a top valuation.At the end of July, Pure Storage had a net cash position of $128m (down from 192m on 31 January 2015): the group is burning less cash than in the past, at least according to its operating cash flow in 1h15, and is growing revenues, but based on those figures and excluding IPO proceeds, the company would have been safe for only about a year, according to my calculations.That's why it had to press ahead with its IPO, regarldess of the price.""We expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows from operations at least in the near future and may require additional capital resources to execute strategic initiatives to grow our business,"" it said in its filing. That's not unheard of in the tech world, really, but investors are nervous about macroeconomic indicators and weak fundamentals for companies that appear to be grossly overvalued at this critical economic juncture.Based on that, the current environment and a price to equity book value north of 5.5 times on an adjusted, pro-forma basis - well, considering all these elements, I'd be happy to give it a pass right now."
3978125,24157,2016-05-26T17:18:25-04:00,"PSTG has fallen as much as 18% post quarterly earnings release.Unfortunately, this quarterly release only continues the concerning trends we previously highlighted in February 2016.Even after this price decline, PSTG remains overvalued.","Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) ($12/share at time of writing) has fallen nearly 18% after announcing fiscal first quarter results that largely continue the concerning trends we pointed out when we placed PSTG in the Danger Zone in February 2016.Revenue Still Doesn't Result In ProfitsOnce again, Pure Storage reported robust year over year (YoY) revenue growth of 89%. Unfortunately, the company's costs followed suit. Research and development costs, sales and marketing costs, and general and administrative costs grew 66%, 71% and 69% YoY, respectively. In total, the company's operating loss grew from -$48 million in fiscal 1Q16 to -$64 million in fiscal 1Q17.Non-GAAP Remains MisleadingWe've previously warned investors about the accounting practices of IPO companies as well as the over use of non-GAAP earnings. In our original Danger Zone report, Pure Storage raised non-GAAP red flags due to its use of numerous non-GAAP measures that paint its business in a more positive light. The most recent quarterly release is no different.In fiscal 1Q17, Pure Storage reported a GAAP net loss of -$63 million but a non-GAAP net loss of only -$41 million. The discrepancy comes from Pure Storage's use of stock based compensation. $22 million (16% of revenue) in stock-based compensation expense was removed from GAAP net loss to calculate the non-GAAP net loss. Stock based compensation is a real cost of business and should be included when determining the profitability of a company.Class Action Lawsuits Consistent With Our FindingsOn May 26, 2016, one day after the quarterly release, Goldman Scarlato & Penny, P.C. announced an investigation on behalf of shareholders of Pure Storage Inc. This investigation concerns potential violations of federal securities law and focuses on whether misleading information about PSTG was provided to investors in connection with the company's October 2015 IPO. Additionally, Lundin Law PC announced an investigation of PSTG focusing on whether the company was experiencing pricing pressure from competitors or not. Both these lawsuits are consistent with our findings. Pure Storage has presented its business in a better light through the use of non-GAAP metrics, when in fact the economics of the business are in decline. At the same time, Pure Storage's low profitability, as noted in our original Danger Zone report, is a significant competitive disadvantage when it comes to pricing.Valuation Is Unrealistic Even After DeclineEven after the nearly 18% decline in PSTG, the stock is still overvalued. To justify the current price of ~$12/share, PSTG must immediately achieve 1% pre-tax margins (-44% in fiscal 2016) and grow revenue by 50% compounded annually for the next 11 years. In this scenario, Pure Storage would be generating over $38 billion in revenue 11 years from now, which is equal to Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) 2015 revenue.Even if we assume Pure Storage can achieve a 14% pre-tax margin (average of competition from original Danger Zone report) and can grow revenues by 18% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is only worth $11/share today - a 25% downside to the closing price on May 25, 2016.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."
3559946,25120,2015-10-09T12:55:33-04:00,"Pure Storage failed to produce opening day gains with its IPO.While the company is growing its business at an incredible pace, losses being reported by the flash memory player keep increasing.Big losses, stiff competition and high multiples make be very cautious about this business at this point in time.","Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) saw a very disappointing public offering despite the fact that it offers investors an opportunity to invest in a business which is reporting very strong topline sales growth.The rapid growth rates failed to attract interest from the wider investment community and myself. While the sales multiple at which Pure Storage is being valued is not excessive given the pace of growth, the trouble is that losses being reported by the firm are huge.Given the huge losses, intense competition and rapidly changing operating environment, I'm very cautious.Pure's BusinessPure Storage offers an ""evergreen storage"" business model which focuses on a reduction of complexity and costs of data storage. The company is a pure play on flash technology which is a rapidly growing segment compared to traditional technology which relies on spinning disks.The company launched ""FlashArray"" back in 2012, a scalable all-flash array hardware solution. This launch, combined with the ""Purity Operating Environment"" which is flash-optimizing software and ""Pure1"" being a cloud-based management system, has been the backbone of the rapid growth seen in recent years.Since 2012, Pure Storage has grown quickly to a customer base of 1,100. The rapid increase in the amount of data which needs to be handled, the need for quicker processing and technological advancements are crucial developments in the market for corporate data. With the solutions being provided by companies like Pure, companies process much more data in a quicker way and at lower costs.The OfferingPure Storage managed to sell 25 million shares in the offering at a price of $17 per share, thereby raising gross proceeds of $425 million. It must be stressed that all the shares were sold by the company, with no shares being offered by selling shareholders.The offering has been somewhat disappointing as shares were priced in the middle of the preliminary offering range of $16-$18 per share. After a disappointing trading session on the opening day, shares now trade around the $16 mark.Following the offering, Pure Storage has 185 million shares outstanding which now trade at around $16 per share. This values the storage player at nearly $3 billion.Incredible Growth, Both In Terms Of Revenues And LossesPure Storage has reported incredible growth in terms of sales. The company reported revenues of a little more than $6 million in 2013, as revenues increased by a factor of seven in the year which ended in January 2014. In the past year, Pure Storage has grown to a company with annual revenues of $175 million, an increase of four times compared to the year before.Momentum continues in terms of sales growth. Revenues came in at $159 million for the first six months of the year thereby already approaching the full-year sales being reported last year. More good news was seen in terms of gross margins. These margins came in at 59.2% of sales in the first six months of the year, a 370 basis point increase compared to the full-year numbers of last year.The trouble is that operating expenses remain very elevated and are actually causing substantial losses at the current time. Pure Storage posted an operating loss of $180.5 million over the past year, being equivalent to 103% of total revenues. That is correct, for every dollar in revenues being generated, the company spends two dollars. While these losses narrowed to 70% of sales in the first half of this year, actual losses in dollar terms remain very elevated.Recent trends have not been very encouraging either. While second quarter revenues approached the $85 million mark, operating losses totaled 75% of sales during that quarter. For your reference, operating losses came in at 65% of sales in the first quarter of this year.To deal with the large losses, Pure Storage needed to do this public offering as cash balances had fallen to $128 million at the end of the second quarter. After adding the $425 million in gross proceeds from the offering, the company will operate with a net cash position of roughly $500 million. With losses coming in at $112 million in the first half of the year, which included $20 million in stock-based compensation expenses, the company will gain a much better footing.That being said, if losses remain unchanged, Pure Storage will burn through its cash levels in the coming two or three years.Elevated RisksInvesting in IPOs is a risky business and this certainly applies to the Pure Storage case. The high valuation is just one of the many risks out there. For starters are the mounting losses being reported by the firm, rapid changes in the marketplace and a limited operating history.Besides these factors, Pure faces stiff competition from players like EMC (EMC), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Dell, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and IBM (IMB). All of these players are profitable and have access to much larger resources, allowing them to compete aggressively with the firm.For all of these reasons shares carry above average risks, certainly as losses are quite elevated. This makes that shares are quite risky and not well suited for a conservative portfolio.Final ThoughtsEven after a disappointing offering, shares of Pure Storage remain quite expensive in my eyes. At $16 per share an investor is paying $3 billion for a business which is posting annualized revenues of $340 million a year. After backing out the cash holdings, the valuation is $2.5 billion, or roughly 7-8 times annualized revenues.That said, losses continue to remain very elevated and will burn through cash balances within a 2-3 year time window. More concerning is the fact that losses continue to be very large in relation to the reported revenues as the break-even point is not in sight yet.While spectacular revenue growth is to be applauded, I'm hesitant to attach a decent revenue multiple to such growth if it only results in elevated losses.Struggling competitors like NetApp trade at just 1 times revenues if its revenue base is compared to the enterprise valuation. There is just one important distinction - NetApp is actually still solidly profitable at the current time. Hewlett-Packard, which is in the process of splitting the company, is valued at roughly $50 billion, or at 0.5 times sales. EMC trades at a 2 times revenue multiple although that valuation multiple is inflated by the fact that it holds a very large stake in VMWare (NYSE:VMW).The 7-8 times sales multiple for Pure Storage looks very high, given that the company is posting huge losses unlike most of its competitors. While quick growth being reported by the company contradicts no or declining sales at competitors, I see no screaming appeal for Pure Storage's shares in this environment.While continued growth will quickly reduce the forward sales multiples, as growth rates continue to exceed the 100% mark, losses are a large concern.For all of these reasons I'm not attracted to the shares at the current time. I will continue to follow the story with great interest as continued growth and narrowing losses might improve the investment case in the future."
4056868,98236,2017-03-21T14:16:03-04:00,"Pure reported the results of its fiscal year earlier this month.Operating results were ahead of expectations.The company's guidance, particularly for Q1, but perhaps for the year as a whole was quite disappointing to many investors.Some of the issue is one of enhanced seasonality. The other issue is simply the overall growth the company can deliver.I think concerns regarding guidance are a bit misplaced. I think the company has many opportunities to significantly better its current forecasts for both Q1 and for the year.","Is the Storage Space Investable?Since the advent of the cloud and its continued hyper-growth, it has proved to be difficult to invest in storage companies or even their adjuncts such as Commvault (NASDAQ:CVLT). Some of the companies within the space have been consolidated. Many other companies have been through a phase of implosion. Most lately, the overall decline in external storage revenues appears to have abated. And now, as in the recent past, the migration to flash storage has continued at an unprecedented pace.But valuations remain dramatically compressed, and most recently, Nimble Storage (NYSE:NMBL), a company whose growth rate has been 30%, was sold to HPE for less than 3X EV/S. The most prominent flash storage vendor these days is Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG). I first wrote about Pure back in September 2016. The shares have depreciated 25% since that time and 16% since my second outing on the name. The issue hasn't been operational performance. That has proven to be strong. Both of the earnings releases since my first article have been beats and raises. That is usually thought to be a recipe for share price appreciation, but these days, storage companies need something more to see share price appreciation. By now, Pure's EV/S ratio has dropped to 1.55X and its enterprise value is just greater than $1.5 billion. Anomalies such as these most often are followed by consolidation.At the start of this month, Pure released the results of its fiscal Q4 that ended 1/31/17. The company, having not had a great reception to beat and raise quarters, tried something different. It beat, but it noticeably cut expectations for fiscal Q1 (ends 4/30) and simply bracketed expectations for the current fiscal year in terms of its forecast for revenues and EPS. That has actually worked a bit better. The shares are only down 10% since the start of the month. One writer on this site has opined that the guidance appears aggressive/worrisome for the full year, rather than the current quarter. He also suggests that much of the questioning during the conference call reflected skepticism about the company's forecast and particularly as it applies to a new product called FlashBlade. There is no question that many analysts both focused on and expressed skepticism about the ramp for the new product.Is it reasonable to be a contrarian here if that is what it is to recommend Pure's shares? I am not sure if shareholders would necessarily have been happier with worse guidance. And I am not too concerned about the tone of analysts' questions. Analysts are going to be unhappy with guidance cuts even if they are for one quarter and even if they have more to do with seasonality than anything else.By tweaking guidance to the extent, it has for Q1 and by reducing the percentage growth rates it was willing to support, management has significantly de-risked investing in the shares. Far from guidance appearing aggressive, for the second half or for the full year, it appears to be ultra-conservative with far more potential for upside than downside. This is not a company with classical compressed valuation metrics. It doesn't earn money or generate cash. But for the leading independent company in what is, after all, still a high growth space, its EV/S at 1.55 is remarkable, remarkably low I think.As it is, opinions of analysts are more or less evenly divided between buy and hold, and no one thought the quarter that was announced was of significant enough performance to change their rating. So, it isn't quite being a contrarian to recommend this name as an investment. Can investors invest in Pure. I believe they can and should, and I find the concerns about the introduction of FlashBlade and its ability to bring in $80 + million of orders this current fiscal year to be much concern about very little.The question at the start of this section is relevant in that the predisposition of many observers in terms of investing in the storage space appears to be negative. There have been many years of disappointing operational performance on the part of many storage vendors. The largest of them is now private as part of Dell. The second largest, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) even after a terrific rally, is still trading for less than it did five years ago. The balance of the article presents the investment case for Pure at its current valuation and tries to look at moats, the kind of competitive barriers that a storage company can build and not the kind that are built surrounding castles.Some Lessons in Seasonality, Guidance and ProfitabilityOne of the principal reasons why Pure's shares are valued as they are has to do with the guide the company provided for its fiscal Q1. Simply put, guidance for a pronounced Q1 pull-back in revenues was seen as a significant concern and the company's forecast for a sharp rebound in Q2 and beyond was thought by some to be less than credible.Many observers find it surprising that IT vendors have significant quarterly sales perturbation based on seasonality. The most commonly observed seasonality in the IT world has to do with the spike in demand seen for companies that have significant sales to the Federal government. Federal procurement is marked by a profound budget flush that inevitably makes quarters that include September 30th particularly strong as government agencies and departments hasten to spend all allocated funds before the end of the fiscal year. Enterprises, while not as rigid, tend to flush their budgets at the end of their own fiscal year and that, more often than not, ends in December. Contra wise, the quarters after December and the quarters that span the summer months, particularly August, are known to be unusually slow, especially so for those companies with lots of exposure to European procurement patterns. There is nothing either mysterious or malignant regarding these trends. They almost inevitably are seen in the operations of all IT vendors that reach some scale, and it is not particularly concerning that they have made themselves seen in Pure's results.It is perhaps relevant in assessing guidance to take a look at the quarter Pure actually reported. Pure's quarter was certainly within the range of expected results. Revenues grew more than 50% year on year and almost 16% sequentially. Gross margins were consistent with past levels despite some component shortages and component pricing increases. The company showed a significant improvement in operating expense ratios both sequentially and year on year, both GAAP and non-GAAP.The company had an incentive program to focus its sales teams on new name accounts. The incentive worked - perhaps too well as there were 450 new logos closed during the quarter. Needless to say, these tended to be smaller enterprises than a more typical quarter has seen for Pure and that, in turn, has led to lower levels of potential ""expand"" business in the current quarter. It is nothing that is either unusual to see or particularly worrisome for a company like this still in its adolescence.The company provided guidance for the current quarter that was at significant variance with the prior First Call consensus. Revenue growth year on year is projected to contract to 27% and revenues are projected to decline 22% sequentially. The prior year, revenues declined by 7% sequentially and then rose by 16% the following quarter. All that says is that seasonality is not a novelty for this company, although the current projection may represent an extreme example.I am not sure that the chart that the company presented as part of its earnings release depicting its expectations for seasonality will prove to be quite correct, and I am not too sure how accurate the guide (22% decline in revenues from the sequential quarter) will prove to have been when the quarter closes. But there is nothing unusual in expecting this company to see a sequential decline in revenues in this current quarter followed by a significant sequential growth in fiscal Q2 at its scale.And given the anticipated seasonality, it is not terribly surprising to see operating margins deteriorate substantially in fiscal Q1 as well. Many IT vendors front-end load investments in sales and marketing and with sales projected to slip, and sales and marketing expenditures projected to rise, I think the results to be expected are or ought to be pretty obvious.Perhaps of equal interest, the company is forecasting gross margin stability. That is a bit surprising given the shortages and price jumps in terms of NAND and DRAM that other storage vendors are dealing with. Management talked about the fact that its products are between two and five times more efficient in terms of NAND usage due to a form of storage compression. The company also suggests that its software-based products have allowed it to mix different kind of flash as well as consumer-grade MLC. I have linked to an article that relates to how Pure uses this cheaper kind of flash without compromising reliability. I am not qualified to evaluate the arguments against this strategy. All I can say is that if the proof is in the eating, Pure has not been on any visible diet lately.Gross margin differences are very visible. Both HP (NYSE:HPE) and NetApp talked about supply constraints coupled with higher component costs in their forecasts. It is hard to gainsay the double-digit advantages in gross margins that this company both has achieved and continued to forecast. There is some myth that all storage is fungible. There is a myth that all-flash arrays, the kind of storage that this company sells, are fungible. Corn and wheat are fungible, more or less although there are obviously different types of those commodities.Storage is simply not fungible because of the significant software content that all arrays offer. I have heard the argument about commoditization since the days of NetApp's storage efficiency solutions. Back then it was ONTAP that allowed the company to achieve better product pricing than its much larger rival EMC. As is often said and is self-evidently true at this time in the flash storage market, the devil is in the details. A bit of study of how the storage industry has evolved will probably put paid to the idea that there is not significant product differentiation even within the context of all-flash arrays and that Pure has been able to leverage its technology successfully.Flash Blade - ""Lightning in a Bottle?""Lightning in a Bottle is said to be California's premier summer camp-out festival featuring music, art, yoga and education. It apparently includes sustainability, social cohesion, personal health and creative expression. A song has been named ""Lightning in a Bottle."" Given my musical tastes, I imagine I would find the festival and the song more than a bit painful and a bit of cacophony. But my taste in music is not universally admired either. The company's COO, Dave Hatfield, described Pure's FlashBlade product as the equivalent of lightning in a bottle, presumably with malice aforethought.Presumably for many of us who are not quite involved in the new age exemplified by the festival, the quote is supposed to mean that the product will be a very strong contributor to the company's revenue growth and will be a significant factor in establishing more rapid growth in the second half of the just started fiscal year.As mentioned earlier, I have written about this company in the past and have mentioned in those articles that FlashBlade would be a key to the ongoing growth of Pure. That remains the case. FlashBlade is designed for workloads that require very fast access to unstructured data and is used with FlashArray which is basically for primary data storage. The product was released earlier this year in general availability and a recent tweet talked about a FlashBlade system that replaced a 1,008 rack unit installation, filled with 13,000 disc drives that had come from NetApp. Obviously replacing 1,000 racks with a single unit is an impressive achievement.Needless to say, the FlashBlade installation that replaced the NetApp disc cost millions less and dramatically outperformed the existing disc array because flash is far faster and because the I/O load is automatically processed across all blades (parallel vs. serial if you like analogies).Mr. Hatfield said that the way the forecast for Pure has been constructed is that it takes between one and two FlashBlade systems per selling team for the current fiscal year to beat the company's internal plan. Overall, less than 10% of Pure's installed base needs to convert over to FlashBlade in order for the company to achieve its guidance. Summing up, Mr. Hatfield declared, ""We're super enthusiastic and very confident in the FlashBlade launch.""I am not really sure why it might have been that the negative writer on this site would have found that kind of assertion less than credible. Later on, during the course of the conference call, another questioner asked about the ability the company would have to sell $86 million of FlashBlade hardware this current year. Management again reaffirmed the forecast. At that point, one would either have to believe that management is somehow being economical with the truth or that it is completely unaware of the prospects for its own business. Given the record of this company since it has been public, it is simply hard for me to find any specific substantiation for such a serious allegation.The fact is that the products that FlashBlade competes against are really super-annulated, or as the product VP put, there has been a dearth of innovation in that specific market. EMC paid a lot of money to buy Isilon, but after the first few years of ownership, it has clearly under-invested in trying to improve the performance and functionality of what it had bought. NetApp has made some smaller acquisitions in the realm of unstructured data over the years. It has never been a major focus for the company and it really is not a major focus currently. It would not be surprising if Pure found it easy to both leverage its installed base and to take market share in selling FlashBlade, especially given the current state of sales execution plaguing Dell/EMC.I do not, to be sure, have some crystal ball of my own that tells me how successful FlashBlade is going to be. Sales execution is always important in product launches no matter what they are and who is expected to buy the products. It certainly helps that much of the expected success of this product is going to come from sales within the installed base. But selling $86 million of a hot new product within a total forecast of $800 million of hardware sales this current year just doesn't seem like a particular stretch. Best as I can determine, FlashBlade probably does have an edge in terms of its capabilities compared to competitive offerings - at least for the moment and that is about as good as anyone might expect in the storage hardware space.During the course of the call, management said that it needed to achieve 70% of its bookings from its installed base to reach the yearly revenue target. This is a quintessential land and expand company and hence 70% is really not some outlier in terms of prior performance. The CFO declared that the numbers for repeat customers ""are in the same zip code. Over time, we've seen that rate continue to climb up. Now that we've got the history (in front of us) and repeat business, we've got a lot of confidence and how those (numbers) are going to curve out over the course of the next year.""While clearly some of the analysts had a bit of trouble wrapping their minds around the forecast, for all of that, it hardly seems incredible or stretched. Management spoke about the statistical analysis it had done on its various customer and salesforce cohorts in putting together its forecast. A forecast by definition involves things that haven't yet happened. There will always be expectations which aren't achieved - or for that matter are over-achieved. There are many ways of putting together forecasts, but the statistical analysis used in the process by this company is certainly a reasonable technique and one that is really not producing outlier results, for the most part. I do think that the statistics that suggest the rather sharp Q1 seasonality may well prove to be challenged, but that is really a good thing.Competition, Evolution and Species Die-OffI am not going to try to answer all of the questions that arise regarding the future of Pure's market share. I do not have the resources of a market research organization, and the space required to try to be objective and thorough is far greater than is necessary to draw conclusions about Pure as an investment.One of the issues that some analysts have had with Pure is that to grow, it seems to need to gain share consistently in what has been a marketplace populated by giants. There is some validity to the terms in which the argument is framed. The AFA market is said to have a CAGR of just over 20% in the latest analysis put together by IDC. Pure is in fourth place with an 11.5% share compared to EMC/Dell with a share of 40%.One thing to note is that the legacy vendors these days are simply hoping to hang on and not grow a great deal. NetApp is hoping that the culmination of its re-imagination and product line rejuvenation is that it can grow mid-single digits. I doubt that EMC/Dell even has that level of aspirational goal.Data reduction continues to be a major factor in the Pure competitive story. Again, data reduction is all about software and architecture, and having a more modern architecture has allowed this company to exploit its software advantages to provide users with better performance regardless of the specific components it uses.The company has a significant partnership with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in terms of developing a converged product offering. Just how successful the offering which is called FlashStack has actually been is difficult to determine. But it has certainly helped Pure develop relationships with many Cisco resellers that historically worked with the other storage vendors. Going back some years, Cisco had alliances in its data center offerings with both EMC and NetApp. Over time, it seems likely that FlashStack offerings will supplant and replace the installed base that Cisco still has that use older technologies from its two former partners.There are a couple of other opportunities that are likely to be significant going forward in allowing Pure to continue to gain market share. One of these is a concept known as synchronous replication. It is a technique that storage vendors use to enhance the ability of their users to replicate data so that it can be safely copied and stored in disaster recovery architectures. Most very large users require that their storage partner have this capability. Pure has been shut out of the highest end of the market because it hasn't had this capability. The company is now in the process of preparing a roll-out of its version of the technology. It is a capability that is one of the factors that is perhaps amongst the reasons behind the significant sales ramp the company is forecasting beyond seasonality and FlashBlade.The final concept that should probably be noted is the migration to NVMe technology. I tried in a previous article that was at the limit of my understanding to talk about the transition/revolution to NVMe and the opportunities it presented for Pure. Pure maintains that its product evolution will be different than those of its competitors. It claims it will be a non-disruptive evergreen transition which is another part of the company's mantra. And it claims that it will introduce this technology in a way that leverages current software. Since none of this has happened yet, one has to take claims on faith or on a willing suspension of disbelief. But it does seem, at least possible, if not quite probable, that the advent of NVMe technology will allow Pure advantages that should enable the company to continue to grow its market share for some period of time to come.I think a more important competitive issue for this company remains how its solutions compare in terms of performance to workloads run on the public cloud. That is a horse that has been ridden near to death, and I doubt I will be able to shed any new light on the subject. The best guess of analysts is that regardless of the cloud alternative, the market for AFAs has a CAGR of above 20% for the next few years and that kind of opportunity provides plenty of runway for Pure.ValuationPure reported that it had 201 million shares outstanding at the end of its fiscal year. That represents an increase of 7.3% year on year. The company continues to use significant levels of stock-based comp, although the rate of increase has started to slow a bit. In the last quarter, stock-based comp represented 16% of revenues. As of last evening, the company had a share price of $10.38 and thus had a market capitalization of a bit less than $2.1 billion. The company had a cash balance of about $550 million, takings its enterprise value to $1.55 billion. The EV/S based on company guidance and the analyst consensus as derived from First Call is for sales this current year of $990 million. That results in an EV/S of just 1.55X. An unusual number for a growth company, to say the least.The company should reach non-GAAP profitability in the second half of the year, and it has made progress in some expense ratios, even on a GAAP basis. But no rational investor is going to be buying this name for earnings in the next couple of years.The company generated a modest amount of cash flow from operations in Q4, but it has not yet succeeded in generating CFFO for the full year. The decline in Q4 CFFO was a function of the slower growth in deferred revenues in the quarter. That in turn was a function of the company emphasizing new accounts/nameplates in the last quarter. These smaller businesses typically do not sign the kind of multi-year procurement agreements and services contracts that has in the past led to strong levels of deferred revenue increase. While management spoke to having sustained positive CFFO in the second half of the current fiscal year, it seems unlikely that the company will generate enough CFFO to do much more than pay for CapEx. It seems likely that the company will most likely produce a level of free cash in fiscal 2019 that would allow for a valuation using that metric.Pure is not yet a profitable company although it has a readily discernible path to profitability. I think at these levels, Pure's shares represent a significant value and one that can produce significant positive alpha for investors."
3540096,61281,2015-09-29T12:42:00-04:00,"Flash array storage company Pure Storage recently priced its IPO and set a date for its market debut.The company is well positioned to benefit from the transformation in the storage market.Market sentiment might impact IPO performance, but the company is a good long-term holding.","As equity markets slowed down worldwide in the last couple of months, the IPO market experienced very little activity in August and September with no significant tech IPO in that period. The Pure Storage (Pending:PSTG) IPO is about to break the trend and become the first significant tech IPO in a while.Pure Storage is a data storage company that offers a unique cost-saving solution that replaces traditional rack-based mechanical disk storage with flash-based storage. The flash-based storage provides better performance at a lower cost that utilizes all the advantages of flash over disk-based storage:Pure Storage has a unique SW/HW solution that claims to save $2.4M when transferring a 50TB disk-based storage system to flash array storage, assuming a 10% storage growth rate. The company's solution contains three components:Historically, the data center storage market has been based on disk storage, requiring frequent capex upgrades, maintenance, support and a large physical space to host the storage machines. With flash arrays, companies can transition to more efficient and cost-effective storage. The flash array market size is estimated to be between $1.5B and $2B, and the players in that market are the usual known storage titans: EMC (EMC), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Dell. However, one significant player in the flash array storage market is focused solely on excelling in that niche - Pure Storage.Due to the attractive cost efficiency associated with flash array storage, estimations assume that the market is expected to grow by 30 percent, according to the company's S-1. As shown in Chart 1 below, Pure Storage is the second largest player in the flash array market and the biggest pure-play flash array company that's well-positioned to monetize that increase.FINANCIALSPure Storage is a typical start-up with phenomenal, three-digit, top-line growth and an impressive gross margin, as shown in the chart below. However, the company's operating expenses are pressuring the company's bottom line into negative territory and, in order to keep up with competition, Pure Storage needs to maintain, as well as increase, its level of investment, so breaking even is not in sight.As shown in the chart above, Pure Storage continues its growth trend into fiscal year 2016. In the first half of the year, the company already generated revenues equivalent to 91 percent of annual revenues in 2015. If the company continues at that pace throughout the year, it can expect a year-over-year revenue increase of more than 80 percent.PRIVATE PLACEMENTPure Storage raised $530M in seven funding rounds between 2009 and 2014 - the latest round, series F, evaluated the company at $3B as shown in Chart 3 below. In round F, leading investment firms such as T. Rowe Price, Tiger Global Management and Greylock Partners, among others, purchased Pure Storage shares at $15.73 per share, which is 40 times what the series A investor, Sutter Hill Ventures, paid for its shares. That Series F share price reflected a P/S ratio of 13.4 for Pure storage based on TTM revenues of $223M, which is significantly higher than the ratios of EMC and NetApp and reflects the company's youth and expected growth.IPO PRICINGPure Storage is a $3B unicorn seeking to raise $425M from the public on top of the $530M the company has already raised in the private market. The company priced its 25M shares at $17, only slightly above the series F preferred share price of $15.73, which reflects a marginal increase in valuation from $3B in series F to $3.3B in IPO. As almost a year went by since the last funding round I can hardly believe the company will go public at this valuation and not at a much higher price.As there is a demand for such an exciting tech IPO with impressive potential growth and clear catalysts Pure Storage will probably go public in a higher price than $17 per share. However, the current market conditions could cool down the enthusiasm around the IPO and cap the maximum gain at a more modest level than a few months ago. The Pure Storage IPO price range reflects a P/S ratio of 11 to 12 based on $273M TTM revenues which are significantly lower than the competition.The way I see it Pure Storage can stretch its P/S ratio up to 20 as it's a promising startup with big losses and the market somewhere expects a high P/S ratio. Such a revenue multiple reflects a $5.5B valuation which is an 83% increase in valuation in the best case scenario. In the worst case scenario, market headwinds could pressure down Pure Storage's IPO price and the company will go public within the original price range that will present a very attractive entry point to monetize this prospect in the storage business.CONCLUSIONPure Storage will go public on October 7th, seeking to raise $425M with a midpoint share price of $17. The company is offering only flash-based solutions that maximize enterprise utilization of storage advantages over disk-based solutions to save costs.Pure Storage is currently the second-largest player in the flash array market and the biggest pure-play company in a market that is expected to grow by 30% CAGR in the next following years. So far, the company succeeded in monetizing its growth and increased revenues in tripledigit rates every year.In the best case scenario, Pure Storage could strengthen its P/S ratio at the IPO up to 20 (equivalent to $30/share). In the worst case scenario, the company will have an IPO at a P/S between 11 and 12 and will offer an attractive entry point for a long-term position in the storage market. I believe the P/S ratio will not fluctuate beyond the range of 11 and 20, and if it does, investors should avoid entering until prices stabilize. In revenue multiples above 20, there are other companies worth considering in my opinion."

The company's innovative technology replaces storage systems designed for mechanical disk with all-flash systems optimized end-to-end for solid-state memory. At the same time, its innovative business model replaces the traditional forklift upgrade cycle with an evergreen storage model of hardware and software upgrades and maintenance.PSTG's next-generation storage platform and business model are the result of its team's substantial experience in enterprise storage and web-scale infrastructure, as well as frustration with the industry's status quo.This deep industry understanding led to the development of PSTG's three-part integrated platform: the Purity Operating Environment, its flash-optimized software; FlashArray, its modular and scalable all-flash array hardware; and Pure1, its cloud-based management and support. PSTG's platform can deliver a 10X acceleration in business applications over legacy disk-based storage.It is also designed to be compatible with existing infrastructure, substantially more reliable, and power and space efficient.PSTG's business model builds on its technical innovations to reverse the traditional storage business model. Instead of moving data between old and new systems via forklift upgrades, PSTG keeps business data and applications in place and upgrade technology around it.PSTG's platform and business model are designed to add value to customers for a decade or more, reducing total cost of storage ownership while increasing loyalty. The company's innovations help rebalance the datacenter by closing the performance gap between legacy storage technology and servers and networks. But it is the simplicity of its platform and business model that is revolutionizing the enterprise storage experience.Together, PSTG's innovations have helped its customers realize the promise of the cloud model for IT and the benefits of Moore's Law. This has yielded industry-leading Net Promoter scores, based on the results of customer satisfaction surveys the company conducted.Intellectual propertyAs of July 31, 2015, PSTG had over 200 total issued patents and over 150 patent applications in the United States and foreign countries. The company's issued patents have expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2034.PSTG also license technology from third parties when it believes it will facilitate its product offerings or business. The company has adopted a policy under which it will not assert patents acquired to date from third parties offensively, other than as part of a counterclaim.CompetitionPSTG's main competitors fall into two categories:large storage system vendors such as EMC (EMC), Hitachi Data Systems and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) that offer a broad range of storage systems targeting various use cases and end markets; andlarge systems companies such as Dell, HP (NYSE:HPQ), Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) that have acquired or licensed specialist storage technology in recent years to complement their internally-developed storage offerings and have the technical and financial resources to bring competitive products to market.In addition, PSTG competes against smaller specialized storage companies, including next-generation vendors of hybrid storage as well as vendors of hyper-converged products, defined as server compute and storage combined within a single chassis.As the company's market grows, it will attract new startups, more highly specialized vendors as well as larger vendors that may continue to acquire or bundle their products more effectively.5% shareholders pre-IPODividendsNo dividends are planned.Use of proceedsPSTG expects to receive $395 million from its IPO and use it for the following:Primarily for general corporate purposes, including expansion of its product development and sales and marketing organizations.PSTG may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement its business, although it has no commitments or agreements to enter into any such acquisitions or investments at this time.Disclaimer: This PSTG IPO report is based on a reading and analysis of PSTG's S-1 filing, which can be found here, and a separate, independent analysis by IPOdesktop.com.

Since then, EMC's DSSD unit (reportedly acquired for ~$1B) has launched its first flash array (the D5), while providing impressive IOPS (throughput), memory bandwidth, latency, and storage density figures. EMC is aiming the D5 at demanding analytics, database, and data-processing workloads, while targeting mainstream enterprise workloads via XtremIO's arrays.Specs for EMC's D5 array. Source: EMC infographic.IBM (NYSE:IBM) is believed to be the market's second-biggest player in Q4, with sales for its FlashSystem AFA line rising 92% Y/Y to $189.1M. AFA growth didn't prevent IBM's total storage hardware revenue from dropping 11% Y/Y in Q4.Stifel notes Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG), which went public last October and solely targets the AFA market, has reported FQ4 (January quarter) revenue of $150.2M, up 128% Y/Y. That suggests Pure is the market's #3 player.Shortly after EMC (has filed multiple lawsuits against Pure) revealed the D5, Pure unveiled FlashBlade, a scale-out storage system declared to grow ""capacity, IO and metadata performance, bandwidth, and client connectivity linearly"" as more blades are added, while supporting up to 1.6 petabytes (that's 1,600 terabytes) of capacity and costing less than $1 per GB of usable storage. Pure has also attempted to enter the SMB flash array market by launching the FlashArray//m10 - the company promises enterprise-class 99.999% (five nines) reliability, low latency, and up to 100K IOPS - and unveiled the FlashStack Mini, a converged infrastructure offering that pairs the m10 with Cisco servers and networking gear and virtualization software from VMware or Microsoft.HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) takes fourth place with estimated Q4 sales of $138.1M (+165% Y/Y). Meg Whitman & Co. have long been quick to talk up the sales growth seen for flash arrays within HPE's 3PAR storage line. The company overhauled its mid-range 3PAR flash systems in mid-2015, and added a new low-cost model. A new high-end hybrid storage (mixed disk/flash) array was launched in March, with HPE trumpeting its ability to consolidate many types of workloads.Where others standNetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), which recently agreed to spend $870M to buy AFA vendor SolidFire, is estimated to have posted Q4 AFA sales of $89.2M via its EF Series and All Flash FAS arrays - up 224% Y/Y, but well below that of the market's top four players. NetApp says it plans to continue offering the EF Series and All Flash FAS after the SolidFire deal closes, with the three product lines respectively targeting high-performance, traditional enterprise, and next-gen infrastructure applications.Violin Memory (NYSE:VMEM), whose shares have plummeted into penny stock territory following multiple earnings disappointments, is estimated to have done Q4 AFA sales of just $10.9M. Back in December, Maxim Group argued Hitachi Data Systems (estimated Q4 AFA sales of just $600K) could act as a white knight for Violin. However, the company recently ended its strategic review.Also, on the outside looking in are Huawei (estimated Q4 AFA sales of $7.9M) and Fujitsu (negligible Q4 AFA sales). Various other firms (including, presumably, SolidFire) are collectively estimated to have produced $78.9M in AFA revenue.Some quick takeawaysGartner's numbers highlight the solid job EMC has done of addressing the threat posed to its traditional disk-based storage offerings by AFAs. Especially when one considers its DSSD unit is only now set to begin producing revenue. Dell, due to acquire EMC later this year and lacking a strong enterprise flash storage position, has to be pleased. And though their numbers aren't as impressive as EMC's, IBM and HPE have done respectable jobs of ramping AFA sales.Nonetheless, it's hard to ignore all three firms still saw negative total storage growth in Q4, with IBM down double-digits. To see positive growth long-term, the companies will have to not just continue winning over enterprises with their AFAs, but find ways to partner with cloud service providers who have been averse to buying from ""legacy"" IT giants, and who are accounting for more and of annual IT spend.The figures help explain why NetApp (#2 in the global external disk storage market, and #4 in the total disk market) is buying SolidFire: The company's relatively weak AFA position is one reason (though not the only one) its product revenue fell 19% Y/Y in the January quarter. As analysts have noted, juggling three different all-flash product lines could be a challenge.Meanwhile, Violin Memory's sales figures make it clear the company is now an also-ran in a market featuring several firms with much greater sales/R&D resources and scale. Assuming the company isn't sold, it will have to find ways to leverage its technology to create a differentiated niche.For Pure Storage, an upstart that has remained in the AFA market's big leagues to date, the numbers given for total market growth highlights its long-term opportunity. EMC has predicted all production app workloads will run on flash by 2020 - if that forecast largely holds up and Pure maintains its current AFA position, the company is bound to gain considerable share within the broader storage market over the next few years. In the meantime, the arrival of cheaper enterprise-class SSDs relying on 3D NAND flash could provide the AFA market with a fresh growth driver over the 12 months."

Mr. Hatfield holds a B.S. in Political Science from Santa Clara University.Potential Competition: EMC, Hitachi Data Systems, Dell, Hewlett-Packard and IBMPure Storage faces significant competition from two primary sources: large storage system vendors and large systems companies. These organizations include EMC (EMC), Hitachi Data Systems, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP), Dell (NYSE:DELL), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Lenovo, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Nutanix.Several smaller companies are currently focused on developing and launching flash storage, such as Kaminario and Tegile Systems.Financial Overview: Increasing Revenues, Decreasing ProfitsPure Storage provided the following figures from its financial documents for the six months ended July 31:As of July 31.2015:Conclusion: Consider Buying InOverall, we like PSTG as a nice break from the flood of healthcare offerings. 15 tech offerings YTD have brought an average first day return of 21.6%, which could bode well for an early trade.In its prospectus, PSTG notes the risks that its rapid growth may not be sustainable and that it expects to sacrifice near-term gains by investing heavily.That being said, we are already hearing that this deal is oversubscribed and could be priced at least at the high end of the proposed price range. An impressive underwriting team will likely see this IPO to success.We suggest obtaining at least a modest allocation."
3507016,23395,2015-09-13T04:30:50-04:00,,"In the race of the unicorns, Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) would have a shot at the Kentucky Derby.Pure Storage, which recently updated its financials ahead of a hotly anticipated IPO, has claimed to have the fastest growth in ""storage industry history"".To investigate this claim, we looked at other storage companies to have gone public since the dot-com bubble, as well as networking companies and other providers of software-based appliances to enterprises' data centers. For each company, we measured the number of years it took to reach $200 million in revenue as a benchmark for growth. Pure Storage already has over $200 million in trailing revenue and is on track to post revenue well above $300 million in 2015, its third full year of product shipments since launching in 2012. Only one company in our peer group, Riverbed (NASDAQ:RVBD), was also able to hit this milestone in three years, but its year-three revenue of $236 million is less impressive than Pure Storage's mark. All of the other companies we examined took longer to reach this threshold.Of course, this growth comes at a high cost. Pure Storage's GAAP losses were over $200 million in the last twelve months, and losses will likely remain high as it invests substantially in sales and marketing and R&D. While IPO investors have historically been willing to excuse heavy losses from very high-growth companies, they will need to be convinced that the company's investments are paying off and that it has a clear path to profitability.Of the companies below, FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) are both holdings in Renaissance Capital's IPO ETF. Pure Storage may be eligible for inclusion in the ETF after it goes public, depending on the company's market value.Source: Renaissance Capital. Some figures are estimated or approximated."

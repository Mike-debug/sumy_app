4268443,103480,2019-06-05T12:28:52-04:00,"Shares of Pivotal Software suffered their worst day in history after reporting Q1 results, dropping well over 40%.Though the company exceeded expectations on Q1 revenues and EPS, it also cut its full-year revenue outlook to 15-17% y/y growth.The majority of this guidance cut, however, is in services revenue - which carries a very low margin and is of lesser importance than subscription revenues.Pivotal Software cited a lengthening of deal cycles in a ""complex"" technology landscape as the major impetus of the revenue slowdown.","Immediately after its public offering and spinout from Dell, PaaS company Pivotal Software (PVTL) seemed like an incredibly promising stock. Pivotal's flagship Cloud Foundry offered developers a cloud-native platform on which to build their applications, and it claimed some of the world's largest blue chips like T-Mobile (TMUS) among its customers. Shares nearly doubled from their IPO price of $15 to an all-time high near $30.Now, however, Pivotal's story has somewhat soured. The company's ~50% y/y subscription growth rates from last year have dampened, and alongside Q1 earnings results, management has initiated a deep guidance cut for the rest of FY20. This sent shares reeling, with Pivotal's stock dropping more than 40% in its worst day yet:Data by YChartsMost stocks warrant a second look when they hit fresh 52-week lows, and Pivotal Software is no exception. In my view, investors now have a chance to snap up shares of Pivotal at a bargain-basement valuation. At the company's present market cap of $2.93 billion, and after netting out $854 million of cash on its balance sheet, Pivotal Software is trading at an enterprise value of $2.08 billion. It's true that Pivotal's guidance cut is disappointing. But even against this lowered view, Pivotal trades at an incredibly low valuation multiple of 2.73x EV/FY20 revenues:Figure 1. Pivotal guidance updateSource: Pivotal 1Q19 earnings releaseFor a company that's still growing subscription revenues in the ~40% range, while also improving its margin profile, this valuation multiple seems untenable. Pick up shares of Pivotal on the dip and wait on the rebound.There's no doubt that Pivotal's guidance cut was shocking. Here's where the key figures stand now, versus where they were at the end of Q4:Here's what CEO Robert Mee had to say on the Q1 earnings call on the revenue slowdown:Unfortunately, Pivotal's situation reminds investors too sharply of a similar situation at Cloudera (CLDR) last year, when the Hadoop company reported sales execution issues (specifically on renewal deals) and its stock got sliced in half, a loss from which Cloudera has not yet recovered.But here's why Pivotal is different: underlying subscription growth is still strong. You'll notice that of the ~$40 million cut to the full-year guidance outlook, Pivotal's subscription revenues only received $12 million of that cut on the bottom end and $9 million on the top end, worth 2-3 points of growth. The majority of the outlook cut came from the professional services business.Investors essentially shouldn't care how much revenue Pivotal brings in from professional services, as it's essentially a pass-through revenue stream with nearly zero incremental margin. Of course, every software company offers professional services and implementation offerings in order to onboard new customers and support existing ones, but these tertiary services are not drivers of cash flow.Here's a perfect illustration from Pivotal's Q1 results:Figure 2. Pivotal 1Q19 revenue trendsSource: Pivotal 1Q19 earnings releasePivotal's total revenues grew 19% y/y to $185.7 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $184.1 million (+18% y/y) but decelerating sharply from last quarter's 27% y/y growth rate. You'll notice, however, the underlying mix shift in revenues: while subscription revenues grew 43% y/y to $128.9 million, services revenues actually declined by -13% y/y to $56.9 million. The subscription revenue mix this quarter was 69%, eleven points better than 58% in 1Q19.This has tremendous gross margin implications. While Pivotal's subscription revenues carry a 93% GAAP gross margin, services revenues only contribute an 8% gross margin. So while Pivotal's revenues grew at 19% y/y, cost of revenues remained essentially flat. GAAP gross margins, meanwhile, zoomed up to 67.4%, up 550bps from 61.9% in the year-ago quarter. One of the major critiques against Pivotal post-IPO was the fact that it carried a gross margin deficit relative to other SaaS peers due to its high proportion of services revenues; now, both its Q1 results and guidance update point to a reduced subscription mix (implying higher future gross margins). In essence, Pivotal's bad news on guidance has a silver lining.Here's how CFO Cynthia Gaylor explained the drop in services revenues on the Q1 earnings call:The bottom line here: Pivotal's guidance cut is less about a slowdown in momentum of the overall business. Instead, it seems that Pivotal has shifted more of its hopes into its higher-margin renewal revenue streams. The company's net retention rate this quarter was a sky-high 143% (indicating huge upsets within the existing installed base), as customers increased the number of workloads running on the Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform. Yes, it's true that new customer installs are lagging (as evidenced by lower services and implementation revenues), but Pivotal's issues are not parallels of Cloudera, which specifically cited renewal problems.Of the huge guidance cut that Pivotal issued alongside Q1 earnings, only about a quarter was attributed to subscription revenues. The majority of the revenue elimination was on the professional services side, which is ""dead weight"" from a margin perspective and was the primary reason Pivotal's gross margins lagged behind other SaaS/PaaS peers.While Pivotal's hints at sales execution issues and deal cycle lengthening are certainly disappointing, we can still point to the fact that Pivotal's subscription revenue growth in Q1 is still north of 40%, and even after the FY20 guidance cut, subscription growth is still expected to be in the mid-30s. The ~40% drop in share prices is a massive overreaction, and patient investors have an opportunity to scoop up shares of a misunderstood stock at fresh 52-week lows."
4250971,21815,2019-03-26T04:44:34-04:00,"It's rare to see a fast-growing PaaS company, especially one that is a market leader selling at under 6x sales.The company is enjoying fast growth, expanding margins and it is on its way to becoming profitable.Its customers are happy and keep buying more, given a net dollar expansion rate of 149%.","We reported earlier about Pivotal (PVTL), the DevOpp platform company which we described in that earlier article. DevOpp platforms speed up development of apps and hence increase the productivity of developers, of which Pivotal is the pioneer and the market standard (based on the number of Fortune 100 clients).The company sold off on a tiny revenue miss in its Q4 2019 (its fiscal year ends at the end of January) and somewhat disappointing guidance but we think that the shares are fairly attractively valued and offer an opportunity here after a little selloff.Below you see how the company fared on some basic metrics:Data by YChartsNot untypical for a SaaS (or in this case, PaaS, platform as a service) company in the early innings of development, you see solid revenue growth but operational losses, especially on a GAAP basis.The advantage of such cloud platforms is that it is easier to update and add features, or even whole new products. The main products are:PFS will be available by the end of the year, PKS has already been introduced for almost a year and is experiencing solid growth. More than 100 customers are already on PKS which has a lower ASP which gives the company access to more and different type of customer, accelerating growth.According to management, PKS offers state of the art Kubernetes (Q4CC):This is of course what management argues, it certainly doesn't have the field all to itself (a competitor here is Red Hat (NYSE:RHT)), but it did develop PKS with the help of VMware (VMW) and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).The platforms are able to install security updates without downtime so users are no patch deficient, considerably enhancing security, which leads management to claim that its platforms are secure by default (Q4CC):The key growth metric is subscription growth, which was 55% (y/y) with the subscription customer base growing 18% in the quarter (adding 9 customers in the quarter, 58 during the year).Subscription revenue reached 66% of total revenue, up from 56% a year ago. The rest of the revenue is brought in by services, like Labs. Selling services is strategic as it helps land customers and helps them to set up and speeds usage up. Subsequent requests, expansions and services are often provided by partners.This points to another route of growth through an ecosystem of partners and here the company is widely serviced. In the first place one thinks of Dell (DELL) and VMware, with the former still having a majority stake in the company as it was spun out of VMware in 2013 (which was owned by EMS which bought the company in 2012 which Dell acquired). This is of considerable help, even with its newer products (Q4CC):From the Q4CC:And then of course another route to sell more is to increase sales to existing customers, which is what the company is doing very convincingly given the net dollar expansion rate of 149%.The market reacted badly to the Q4 figures (although that's probably more the result of guidance than the actual results) but the company is producing solid progress, especially in large accounts (Q4CC):Given the sky-high dollar net expansion rate, customers clearly like what the company offers and the market is still in the early innings, so we're not terribly worried here.From the Q4CC:The consensus Q1 revenue estimate was 190M so the Q1 guidance could be the reason the shares sold off.Data by YChartsThe chart above are GAAP figures. The company is of course basking in rising gross margins as subscriptions (93% gross margin) are growing way faster than services (which actually declined 3% for the quarter and have gross margins of 17%). With respect to operating margins (Q4CC):There is clear leverage (on a non-GAAP basis) on the basis of which management predicts Q1 fiscal 2021 break-even that is in four quarters.Data by YChartsCash flow is steadily increasing and there is little to worry about given the stash of cash ($702M at the end of Q4) that the company acquired with its IPO. Operational cash flow was even positive in Q4 ($8M) although seasonality might have something to do with that.Data by YChartsWhile the company isn't yet profitable, 7x sales TTM or not even 6x for this year's revenue are fairly modest multiples for a platform company like this and it's a lot cheaper than where it has been earlier in the year.Some sale pressure has no doubt come from the expiration of IPO lock-up shares and options. But still, we think this multiple has some room to expand, which is something we can't say for a host of other stocks we look at.These days we don't often come across a company that still seems pretty reasonably valued and even offers some room for multiple expansion, let alone one that operates in a fast-growing field and is considered the market leader.A 6x sales multiple seems to be a bit of a bargain considering the company's subscription revenue is still growing at 40-50%. The market is still fairly young and the company is well established with happy customers, given the net dollar retention rate of a whopping 149%.Gross margins are still expanding pretty significantly as high margin subscriptions grow much faster than services, and there is strong underlying operational leverage which will bring the company to profitability in the medium future (a year or so). What's not to like?"
4206224,103480,2018-09-14T06:17:16-04:00,"Pivotal Software's stock lost 20% after reporting disappointing Q2 results, despite beating Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom line.Revenue growth even accelerated two points from last quarter, and guidance also exceeded consensus expectations.Investors are getting jittery ahead of a mid-October lockup expiration, leaving shares vulnerable to a selloff as insiders are released to sell for the first time.With share of Pivotal up 54% over the past six months, selling shares now - while they sit at an ~8x forward revenue multiple - is tempting.","Last quarter it was up 20%, and this quarter, it's down 20%. Pivotal Software (PVTL), despite reporting strong Q2 results that featured both a modest revenue acceleration as well as respectable beats against Wall Street consensus estimates, tanked after earnings in the stock's worst one-day performance yet. Pivotal's post-earnings crash is a subtle reminder to growth investors that winners don't stay winners forever.I liked Pivotal earlier on in its IPO. The company distinguished itself by being a PaaS play - a rare niche in a market environment that has been deluged by front-end SaaS applications, with a noticeable gap in back-end infrastructure IPOs. I've always favored PaaS and IaaS technologies to be stronger investments - they are harder to rip out of an enterprise IT stack and generally face much less competition. Consider another recent IPO like Ceridian (CDAY), an HCM platform, and the mention of its name also calls to mind a dozen of its competitors, such as Workday (WDAY) or Oracle (ORCL) HCM Cloud. Though Pivotal has its fair share of competition, it has far fewer clones.To top it off, Pivotal was cheap immediately post-IPO, as it wasn't a strong performer right out of the gate. Back then, investors were worried about the relationship with Dell (DVMT), which spun out Pivotal from its portfolio in the IPO, but recently, Dell's own plans for an initial public offering have quelled the fears that it would try to pull the kind of reverse merger threat it posed to VMware (VMW).As a result of this, as well as strong results in Q1 (and arguably also in Q2, despite the market reaction), Pivotal has performed well post-IPO. Even after accounting for this quarter's drop, Pivotal at $23 is still up more than 50% from its IPO price of $15:PVTL data by YChartsBut this means it's also no longer cheap. At its current post-Q2 share price, Pivotal has a market cap of $5.92 billion; after netting out the company's $671.7 million of cash and zero debt (it's had a clean balance sheet since the IPO), the company has an enterprise value of $5.25 billion.Here's where the company's full-year guidance landed after this quarter's earnings. Note that the refreshed range of $647-653 million in revenues is a touch higher than Wall Street's consensus of $646.5 million:Figure 1. Pivotal Software FY19 guidanceSource: Pivotal investor relationsAgainst the $650 million midpoint of this updated revenue outlook, Pivotal Software is currently trading at a valuation of 8.1x EV/FY19 revenues. That's about one turn cheaper than where Pivotal traded at the end of last quarter (where shares jumped 20%), and as I noted then, it's cheaper than the bulk of high-growth SaaS companies, many of which are now traded at double-digit revenue multiples.But there's one upcoming catalyst that gives me pause: Pivotal Software's lockup expiration, which is set to occur on October 17 (as per NASDAQ). With shares up more than 50% since the IPO at $15, insiders may be tempted to let go of their holdings. The biggest shareholders are Silver Lake Partners and Dell - the former is likely to cash in on at least some gains; the latter is fairly unpredictable. Whether or not these holders end up selling, the fear of that outcome will likely drive tremendous selling pressure in October.I'm a fan of Pivotal Software's product and its growth story, but do believe that there will be a better opportunity to buy into the stock at a cheaper price in October, after the lockup pressure subsides. Stay on the sidelines until then.Here's a look at Pivotal's Q2 results:Figure 2. Pivotal Software 2Q19 resultsSource: Pivotal investor relationsRevenues grew 30% y/y to $164.4 million, actually accelerating by two points over last quarter's revenue growth rate of 28% y/y. Pivotal also exceeded Wall Street's revenue expectations of $158.2 million (+26% y/y) by a respectable four-point margin.Despite the beat, investors were looking for more. Last quarter, Pivotal had absolutely obliterated Wall Street's expectations - against expectations for 16% y/y growth, Pivotal delivered 12 points of upside at 28% y/y growth. Exiting the fourth quarter of FY18, Pivotal had generated sub-20% growth - so it's comforting that in this quarter, the company was able to exceed 30% growth. This gives me confidence in investing in Pivotal at a later date - just not right before the lockup expiration.What probably threw investors off this quarter, however, was a shortfall in billings. For subscription businesses, billings is actually the longer-term view on a company's growth pipeline. Pivotal's CFO danced around the subject by claiming the shortfall on deal timing:The miss, however, caused some Barclays to note that Pivotal ""will be in the penalty box with investors for the time being."" The CFO's outlook that Q3 would continue to be challenging on the billings front also doesn't help sentiment. As a result, it's possible that revenue growth may see a dip in the short term.On the bottom line front, however, Pivotal delivered some cheerier news. Gross margins hit 62.8% in the quarter on a GAAP basis, up sharply from 55.3% in the year-ago quarter. Pivotal attributed the growth to both a larger mix of subscription revenues (59% of revenues this quarter versus 51% in the year-ago quarter) as well as robust 93% subscription gross margins.Pivotal's margin in the low 60s is still below most software companies because it has always had a larger share of services revenues than most SaaS/PaaS companies due to its leaning on Pivotal Labs, which is essentially a consultative software development offering that helps clients to onboard onto the Pivotal Platform. However, with management's expectation that services revenues would ""grow in the mid-single digits"" alongside much faster subscription growth, its services revenue mix would decline over time and result in higher margins.Pivotal's operating losses also thinned down to -$35.4 million, representing an operating margin of -21.5%, 850bps better than -30.0% in the year-ago quarter, thanks largely to the gross margin gains. Pro forma EPS of -$0.06 also edged out over Wall Street's expectations of -$0.09.The bottom line on Pivotal Software: on the surface, the company produced good results, with accelerating revenue growth and a strong gross margin gain that led to an earnings beat. With the commentary on a billings slowdown, however, investors are right to fear that Pivotal's growth may slip again to the mid-teens in the back half of the year, which would be a return to its growth rates in the back half of FY18.Perhaps even more threatening than the billings miss is a lockup expiration coming next month that gives inside investors the ability to cash in on paper gains of more than 50%. I'd wait for the dust to settle here before diving in."

4231151,21815,2019-01-02T19:05:02-05:00,"The shares have declined pretty sharply after the last two quarterly figures, despite exceeding expectations in both.We think this is mostly driven by valuation concerns, although market circumstances and the end of a lock-up period also played a role.While still no real bargain, the shares are much cheaper now and would offer an opportunity under better market conditions.","Pivotal Software (PVTL) provides a cloud-native PaaS (Platform as a Service). Its-subscription based and high-growing Pivotal Cloud Foundry or PCF is an app development platform reducing the complexity of building, deploying, and operating modern applications.Pivotal Labs enables and assists its customers to accelerate their adoption of a modern software development process. The field is increasingly crowded, and the choices of means and instruments have proliferated, but this also offers Pivotal an opportunity (Q3CC):PCF is cloud agnostic, running apps on a variety of environments, including on premise, cloud, multi-cloud and hybrid environments, and this ability is a competitive differentiator.The company is still majority owned by Dell (NYSE:DELL) with its financial results consolidated into Dell's accounts, and Dell and VMware (NYSE:VMW) are still helping with sales and product development (see below).The market is certainly growing substantially as more and more companies embark on the digital transformation and move to the cloud, from the Q3 earnings deck:Management doesn't see the digitalization of business slowing down at all, so from this perspective, they still have a large runway.Q3 showed moderate revenue ($4M or almost 3%) and EPS ($0.03) beats (and a mild increase in outlook), but the shares couldn't escape the December market selloff. The shares got a substantial hit following disappointing Q2 results in September and have a long way to recover.While y/y growth figures, especially in subscriptions (53% increase in revenues, 17% increase in the number of customers) are still very impressive, the above figure shows that sequential growth has been slowing down considerably the last two quarters.As any cloud solution, there are Swiss army knife opportunities to add functions and features, improving the platform's value and stickiness and adding new revenue streams (""Land and Expand""). Pivotal is no exception, and its product suite is already large. Recent additions are:Land and Expand is certainly working:The 150% dollar-based net expansion rate must be a world record, although management expects it to come down gradually. This isn't brought about so much by their new products but by customers starting off small (a couple of hundred thousand dollar PCF deals) and then moving more workloads on PCF.This isn't a surprise because the company offers clients two broad categories of benefits:Management argues that the latter has reached an inflection point, so it's not a surprise they have this huge dollar retention rate as customers increasingly shift their legacy apps onto their platform, and it has scaled up its application transformation service to deal with the demand.Nevertheless, PKS and PFS are new and are likely to provide another impulse into expanding contracts with (for now, mostly existing) customers.The company traditionally offered professional services, and this is now a declining part of revenues. This transformation allows for gross margin expansion, but it keeps a cap on valuation as the service business is low margin, stagnant business commanding much lower multiples.One might wonder whether the company might not split the business, but these services are an integral part of its go-to-market strategy and offer customers support with its web-based subscription solutions. This becomes clear from the company's website:Services still constitute 40% of overall revenues and were actually growing in Q3 at 7% y/y to $67.4M, but with 27% gross margin, it isn't producing any profits (and that is likely to get worse in Q4, seasonally weak for services).Dell and VMware remain critical partners (and owners). For instance, the Pivotal Container Service PKS was developed with VMware (and in collaboration with Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) cloud), and its role seems about to expand (Q3CC):Having Dell (which also owns VMware) as a parent also greatly helps to land customers, complementing their direct sales force, although this channel is slowly becoming less important after the IPO.On the right of the slide, you see system integrators like Accenture (NYSE:ACN). These basically function in a similar manner as their own services (Q3CC):The company has a marketplace for third party solutions:The expansion of the ecosystem increases the value of the platform and its stickiness.From the earnings PR:For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, Pivotal currently expects:For the full fiscal year 2019, Pivotal currently expects:The Q4 guidance is slightly above consensus ($167.29M).While the company isn't operationally profitable, it does display a considerable degree of gross margin expansion (mostly due to mix, with much higher margin subscription revenues growing much faster) and operational leverage:PVTL Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe company is still losing cash, but after the IPO, it has plenty of cash to see this out to break-even:PVTL Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsStock-based compensation and dilution are rising a little fast, in our view.Competition comes from companies like Oracle (ORCL), IBM (IBM) and Red Hat (RHT) especially after the latter was acquired by IBM. It remains to be seen how that acquisition is affecting Pivotal, if at all.Since the company isn't profitable (not even on the operating level) nor cash flow positive, the only relevant multiple is EV/S:PVTL EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsAs the time frame since the IPO is very short, the valuation has simply varied with the stock price. On the one hand, one might conclude that multiples come down pretty rapidly after one disappointing quarter (in this case, Q2), but on the other hand, the bad last quarter of 2018 hasn't escaped the shares of Pivotal either, and there has been the expiration of the IPO lockup as well in October.However, given that most of the decline came in the immediate aftermath of the Q2 figures (despite beating consensus expectation), it's logical to argue this was the main catalyst for the stock price decline.We would also argue that the valuation got way ahead of itself before that, a sales multiple over 10 seems a little excessive when a big chunk of the company consists of low margin and near stagnant services.There is a lot to like in the shares:However, there are also some negatives:We think given the lumpiness of quarterly results, there is a good chance the downdraft from the second quarter has created at least something of a buying opportunity, market circumstances providing.But most of the decline we consider are corrections based on excessive valuation, and we would be surprised to see these kinds of valuations return anytime soon.Still, longer-term, there is quite a bit to like here, the platform is well received by customers, and the company keeps on adding functionality. Growing much faster than the services, the platform will become an ever larger part of the company and lead it to profitability."
4182453,104556,2018-06-18T21:36:52-04:00,"Pivotal has gone through many transitions as a business but it is still doing great.Even after the post-earnings run-up, the business is not extremely overvalued.Pivotal's financials and business model back up the premium valuation.","Pivotal (NYSE:PVTL) is still attractive, even after the post-earnings run-up. Go long this name as it is already a force to be reckoned with in the software world. Join us on a deep-dive into this name, including a long journey to the glory of today’s post-earnings pop.Six days ago marked a big moment in the business trajectory of Pivotal; its first earnings call as a public company. Pivotal came public on April 20th at $15 per share. But the story of Pivotal is a long and winding one.Robert Mee, current CEO, co-founded Pivotal Labs in 1989. Mee and his team popularized the software engineering method of Agile development, working in small teams and iterating versus the old waterfall method, focused on mitigating risk. For example, this method is so popular in the tech world that if you google the word, “agile” the first result will be in the software context rather than the lateral movement/agility meaning of the word.Mee’s baby was bought by EMC (EMC) in 2012 and combined with another EMC asset, VMware (NYSE:VMW), to create what we now know as Pivotal in 2013. But Dell acquired EMC before going private. Later, in 2015, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), GE (NYSE:GE), and Ford (NYSE:F) invested $1.7 billion cumulatively.All in all, there are a lot of hands in the cookie jar. DellEMC owns 62% of shares outstanding and VMware owns 21%. Combined, they control 98% of the voting power, though. So as an investor in this name, you have to go with the flow. But be assured that DellEMC wants Pivotal to succeed.Speculation that Pivotal was spun off by DellEMC to cover its debt has some truth. Pivotal’s IPO raised $555 million, not chump change, but I don’t believe DellEMC used it for the cash. Dell’s debt, after all, exceeds $50 billion since being taken private. The IPO proceeds can only cover 1% of that debt load. However, DellEMC knows just how valuable Pivotal is. I suspect it will hold the stock and sell on the way up as that will be much more profitable. So the interests are aligned for us as investors.On the last earnings call, Mr. Mee, explained what Pivotal does. I’ll include the paragraph here,In English please:Pivotal’s business consists of two things: selling subscriptions through the Pivotal Cloud Foundry and a consulting-esque services segment from Pivotal Labs. In essence, Pivotal’s goal is to help developers become more productive. That is the underlying goal of everything the company offers. The slogan is, “transforming how the world builds software.” But it is clear that Pivotal is intentional and focused on making developers more productive.In this video, the first speaker from Forrestor, a technology research firm similar to Gartner (NYSE:IT), cites a study of talking to software engineers. About 28% of them say they spend no more than 3 to 4 hours actually coding. Most of their time is spent on integrating their applications, making sure they are secure, provisioning servers, or just other mundane stuff coders need to deal with. Pivotal’s real mission is to make sure coders can do more of what they love, which is making great software.The company does this through its Cloud Foundry. I’ll let Mr. Mee explain what that is as well,In English please:Pivotal’s offerings allow faster, what I’ll call, code-to-run times. Essentially how fast can you build an application, modify it, and run it to make more sales, improve a customer’s experience, or anything that builds a business’s competitive advantage. It does this through its Application Service which enables developers to increase their velocity for application building. Pivotal has a lot of case studies on its website but for instance, Liberty Mutual, the insurance provider, went from releasing new code monthly to daily while reducing infrastructure costs by 60% and increasing velocity by a multiple of 4.Investor Presentation: PivotalPivotal also offers its Container service and microservices Marketplace. If you want to learn more about the ins and outs of the technology, watch this video with Onis Fakhouri, head of R&D (I love his presentations with all the clever use of emoji). To very briefly sum up the container and marketplace, essentially when developers work in Agile teams it is difficult to coordinate and make sure software works when it is combined. Containers and microservices help with this problem. Which, if it doesn’t sound like a big problem, be assured, it is.After all, this is the lifeblood of most organizations these days; developer productivity. Especially in the big organizations that Pivotal services.Pivotal only deals with big-time customers. The latest customer count is 339, up from 319 a quarter ago and 275 a year ago. And revenue was nearly $156 million in the latest quarter. If you annualize that number, the revenue per customer is nearly $2 million. So Pivotal doesn’t deal with many small-fries.Investor Presentation: PivotalAs stated, Pivotal started as Pivotal Labs. This piece of the business is still alive but it is shrinking. Pivotal Labs works with organizations which need help implementing PCF. It is naturally much lower margin than the subscriptions, so Pivotal has been making a hard push on the subscription side of the business. In the prospectus, the company’s subscriptions made up just 34% of sales in 2016 but in this past quarter, that number reached 58%.So some investors, when the company IPO’d, still viewed it as more of an IT consulting firm. But I think that perception has changed as investors have bid up this stock more than 25% after the last week's earnings. Revenue came in at 28% but more notably, subscription revenue rocketed to $90 million in the quarter, up 69%. And the expansion rate held at 156%. This means that customers, on average, are buying 56% more in dollar-volume than in the year prior. This shows the strength of Pivotal’s ability to upsell. This is the highest expansion rate I have seen around. Alteryx (NYSE:AYX) boasts the next-highest I can think of at 131%. However, Pivotal is selling to huge enterprises so this number might be a bit lumpy as the CFO noted on the call.Investor Presentation: PivotalBut Pivotal’s numbers mask the beauty of the subscription figures. Subscription gross margins ticked up to 92%, but the incremental cost to sell and market it didn’t grow by a whole lot. This is where the relationship with DellEMC and VMware pays off. These companies are huge in their own right and what does that mean? That’s right, a big sales force. These partners have accounted for 46%, 44%, and now 37% in the years 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. This means Pivotal doesn’t have to work as hard on the selling side but it is also good that the reliance is coming down because that limits negotiating power on the partner’s side.Below, I will provide a table filled with the numbers from Pivotal’s prospectus. This will give you a better idea of the income statement, unveiling the truth of the company’s financials.One of the most important things from this table is the S&M operating expense. You can see, in absolute dollars, it increased by $34 million from 2016 to 2018. In that same period, subscription revenue increased by $165 million. I don’t know of any other software company that can grow subscription revenue with that small of a change in sales and marketing. And that is one of Pivotal’s main advantages right now.Here are Pivotal’s numbers:You can also see that the losses are narrowing at a quickening pace. In the past quarter, the operating loss came all the way down to -13%. So everything is trending in the right direction. Services are now the minority of the business and the subscription piece is rolling on ahead.Investor Presentation: PivotalJust to put Pivotal’s numbers in perspective, I gathered up some financials from Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), which I wrote an article on not too long ago. As a percentage of sales, Okta has a higher proportion coming from subscriptions so I thought it would be an interesting comparison, especially since the valuations are pretty similar nowadays.Here are OKTA's numbers:You can see that Okta spent $54 million in S&M to gain $96 million in subscription revenue. So the incremental S&M to subscription revenue is 1.8 (96/54) for Okta compared to 4.9 (165/34) for Pivotal (these numbers can be found in the tables above). As you can see, Pivotal is bringing in subscription revenue much more inexpensively than Okta. Plus, Pivotal has higher subscription gross margins, subscription revenue is growing faster and it has narrower losses.Pivotal’s enterprise value as of writing this is about $6 billion ($6.7 billion market cap – $645 million in cash). Okta’s is around $5 billion. Before the 25% pop, Pivotal’s valuation looked very enticing. Now it is much more richly valued though still tolerable.On the earnings call, the CFO talked about the remaining performance obligations for subscriptions or RPO. Apparently, 50% of $800 million in contracts is due to be realized in the next 12 months. So there is a guaranteed backlog of $400 million in the next 12 months.At the midpoint of the 2019 guidance, the company estimates that it will have $382 million in subscriptions, which is 47% growth from last year. Unless the expansion rate dips severely, I think that is sandbagging. Plus, $300 million or so of that $400 million is guaranteed (3 quarters worth). So it doesn’t seem likely that Pivotal will botch an earnings call within the next year; but as noted, the expansion rate could be lumpy.If Pivotal ends up doing $400 million in subscription revenue, I doubt they will do less than $250 million in services revenue, so let’s call it $650 million in 2019 sales. Breaking it apart, if the services revenue warrants a 2x sales multiple, that will be worth $500 million. So that leaves us with $5.5 billion in enterprise value ($6 billion – $500 million of services value). Therefore that all is subscription value. So $5.5 billion/$400 million is nearly 14x sales. A high multiple but for one that is growing at nearly 70% with 92% gross margins, not ridiculous. Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS), popular cloud security platform, has similar numbers as its EV/Sales ratio is at an insane 26.That is all to say I don’t think Pivotal is too overvalued especially when you break everything down.On the prospectus, Pivotal mentions legacy providers like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as well as public cloud players like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). Plus, open source provider, Red Hat (NYSE:RHT). All of these companies vie for a piece of the enterprise cloud computing market. But Pivotal kind of plays in the middle of everything.After all, it is trying to improve developer productivity. Pivotal falls under the category of PaaS (platform-as-a-service). I know, there are too many -aaSs. It is a bit difficult to find apples-to-apples comparisons with Pivotal since most of the big players like Amazon offer PaaS-type products. The drawback with using AWS or something is the risk of the dreaded lock-in to one vendor, which has become a concern to enterprises going for a multi-cloud environment.After searching a while, there is OpenShift by Red Hat, Apprenda (a private company) and Heroku (by Docker, the private company which popularized the software container).Apprenda and Heroku are much smaller so I don’t think they can compete on the same enterprise level as Pivotal. OpenShift seems like a worthy competitor but Red Hat is also focused on a lot of other things than Pivotal’s Cloud Foundry bread and butter. All in all, I think there is enough market share to go around.I also will choose not to compare each facet of each company's product offerings as I don’t think that is necessarily helpful or material to the investment thesis. But here are some things that I think are…Pivotal doesn’t just check the financial and business model boxes. It also has some interesting aspects to its business and culture.Before getting into them, I also like that the two top execs own over $170 million in stock. Always good to see heavily invested leaders.The three core values of Pivotal are:They are simple but powerful. There are also many links online that give insights to the power of Pivotal in the software community. “Pivots,” employees are called, are not allowed to work past 6 pm. Most Silicon Valley companies deck its campus out with volleyball courts and nap-pods and anything else a Stanford CS graduate could want. But Pivotal sees things a little differently. Management wants to see its developers be productive and then go home and have a life outside of work.The perks of top Valley firms are awesome, no doubt, but they come with a price; grinding 80-100 work weeks. No wonder they try to make it so fun to work there.Every morning, Pivots come in at 9 and then at 9:06 I believe it is, they stand up and have a standing meeting to share what they worked on yesterday and what they will work on today. 9:06 because it is less likely that people will be late then. Programmers are also paired up to bounce ideas off of each other and mentor each other. This relationship between developers is a key to effective agile strategies, but it’s no wonder they are good at it, the CEO practically invented the concept!Even further, the company is on record to say that it explicitly hires for empathy. I love that. It shows that it cares about the well-being of its work culture and it clearly shows in the success of the business. People who felt cared for, work hard. It’s pretty simple.Selling to enterprises requires a big sales force. As noted, DellEMC and VMware have done a lot of the heavy lifting up until now but it will be interesting to see how Pivotal handles it in the future. Will it continue to leverage its partners or move more of the selling in-house?You can watch for how this develops in the S&M line of operating expenses. You can do the calculation I did with the incremental subscription revenue/incremental S&M expenses.Also, a key number to watch is the customer count. 339 is not very many when compared to a company like Okta that boasts over 4,000 clients. Granted, it is different, not everyone needs to build enterprise-grade applications. But if customer additions slow down dramatically, it might be a sign that sales execution is lacking.Moreover, sometimes organizations focus too much on the land rather than expand, leaving current customers feeling unattended to. This is what happened to Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) as it reported a huge slowdown in expansion rate, leaving the stock to plummet nearly 40% two earnings calls ago. So the combination of expansion rate and customer additions will be really important to look at.I don’t see the cloud becoming unimportant anytime soon, so I’m sure organizations will want to optimize their operations as much as possible. With these sort of companies, I rarely discuss TAMs in-depth just because it seems like there is enough to go around. But in the enterprise space, it can be good to go over more in-depth.Investor Presentation: PivotalAs you can see, the market is plenty big and growing quickly, especially the PaaS segment (platform-as-a-service), the market Pivotal falls under.As for any fast-growing company, there are always valuation concerns but we talked about that too much already.Pivotal has been in business for nearly 30 years and Robert Mee has been at the helm the whole time. It’s always reassuring, as an investor, to see a founder-led company, especially one that has navigated the ever-changing tech scene for almost three decades. Dare I say, the company has probably had to do a few pivots in its time (cringe-worthy I know).I do not purport to know that Pivotal is superior in all its technology offerings versus other competitors. All I try to do is balance what I can gather from the business model and customer feedback and the financials and valuation to make an investment choice. And after doing that, I still find Pivotal attractive.It does not have a lot of customers but those customers it does sell to seem to love the Cloud Foundry. Pivotal also does not have any client concentration risk that is typical of a company with a few hundred customers.The main thing to think about is the 156% expansion rate and 69% subscription revenue growth. Both clearly are evidence of demand of the product, so that is mainly why I don’t spend the time going over each little aspect of the technology against competitors. From the financials we can sense that demand is strong. Plus, everything else is trending in the right direction, this past quarter was even the first time the company broke free cash flow positive.It was a long time coming but congrats to the Pivotal team and Mr. Mee. Go ahead and bask in the glory of your 30 years of hard work. Please continue transforming how the world builds software."
4212464,98236,2018-10-18T12:51:39-04:00,"Pivotal shares have traded poorly since the company announced Q2 earnings.Now the shares are being further pressured by a new supply of shares coming from the expiration of the option lock-up.Despite these negative influences, Pivotal as a company is growing and it is finding success for its offerings amongst enterprise customers.Pivotal is a leader in the DevOps space, one of the fastest growing parts of the IT universe.It has a number of newer product initiatives and in particular, its entry into what is called Kubernetes is likely to further enhance growth.","Pivotal (PVTL) has only been a public company for about 6 months. In that time, the shares have doubled and have then lost about 40% of their value. They participated in the rally on Friday/Monday, but are under significant selling pressure this morning (the lock-up expiration is adding about 37 million shares to the float at this point.) Overall, the shares have underperformed since the last earnings report in the middle of last September). Like some kind of tidal wave, the valuation panic of the last several weeks in tech has laid bare some bargains that are not often seen in the high-growth IT space. In my opinion, Pivotal is a company with a strong competitive position that is not well understood. It is executing well if investors would concentrate on what well actually means for this company. And it has recently introduced a new set of solutions that certainly provide it with the tools to compete against it principle rival, Red Hat (RHT). I outlined some of my thoughts regarding the prospects for this company in May and I have linked to that article here.I had the opportunity to catch up for an in-depth interview with the company's Vice President of Investor Relations, Helen Corcos a very experienced IR professional who had a long career leading the IR effort at Symantec (SYMC) before coming to Pivotal. Should readers own Pivotal shares at this point? Obviously, the events of the past few weeks have suggested that IT shares do trade as part of a group and with relatively high levels of correlation. Pivotal is a high-growth company and it is not likely to ever wind-up in value territory. And its volatility speaks for itself. And it has a further complexity of being part of the Dell (DVMT) family, and in the short term, the shares will be under pressure from the expiration of the option lock-up.But looked at on its own, and at its current valuation, it represents one of the better deals in the enterprise software space in my opinion. Pivotal has been and clearly remains the gold standard in what is called DevOps or agile development and it will most surely benefit from the industry trend to move the development paradigm to one based on what is called Kubernetes. And the fact is, that in this world of rapidly changing requirements for digital transformation and for the application of AI to business processes, agile development is not something that can be avoided. The alternatives just don't bear thinking about.Why buy Pivotal shares? One reason to do so is the company's competitive position in a large and growing market. This is not the right venue to write in any detail about DevOps or ""agile development"" or ""rapid development."" And, in fact, I am hardly the most informed commentator on the subject. Many readers on SA are themselves developers and will, perhaps, have their own thoughts about DevOps and the role of Pivotal in pioneering the technology.DevOps is a large space in terms of revenues and as such trying to tightly define it can be an irksome undertaking. And because it is a bit hard to define, it is harder still to elaborate on the benefits it provides for users. But clearly, one of the major benefits users get from DevOps relates to far faster application development coupled with greater productivity for developers. I have linked here to one article that relates to an analysis as to just how much the DevOps paradigm speeds up the application development process. Whatever might be the right answer in terms of quantifying the improvements available from using a DevOps paradigm, so far as investors need to know, the answer is ""lots.""Pivotal and its CEO, Rob Mee, essentially pioneered this category some time ago. Without going through too much history, the company, after a number of corporate transformations, remains a leader in the space. Initially, Pivotal was called Pivotal Labs and derived its revenues from providing IT services and consultancy, and it still gets a significant revenue contribution from that component of its business. One aspect of Pivotal's valuation is that it has a legacy business that is profitable but not growing very fast, as it pivots to selling DevOps software.At this point, about 70% of Pivotal's equity is owned by Dell Technologies. I have no substantive reason to suspect that this ownership percentage might change. I imagine that there are some scenarios in which this ownership percentage becomes perceived as a negative, but I doubt that these kinds of speculations are grounded in anything substantive.To return to the DevOps paradigm, the technology is based on open source capabilities and this has proven to be popular with users. It is somewhat difficult to attempt to explain just why the technology has improved the productivity of developers to the extent it has. Suffice it to say, that the techniques of DevOps are becoming pervasive because the payback of its adoption is so substantial. Some people think that the adoption of DevOps can speed up the creation of applications by a factor or 3x-4x. In the company's most recent conference call presentation, the CEO spoke of using the company's Cloud Foundry to release new software over 60% faster, to enable customer developers to spend 35% more time writing code and to spend 90% less time provisioning new environments and patching operating systems. I actually think that these kinds of statistics make sense given other commentary seen from 3rd party sources.The latest statistics I have seen regarding the market size of the DevOps space suggest that the TAM will be $13 billion by 2025, based on a CAGR of 19%. Gartner has said that about half of all enterprises will be running what are called containers in their production environments. Containers are the most recent iteration of DevOps technology and have become exceptionally popular amongst developers. Again, it is not really necessary to understand too much about containers other than they are used to create applications based on individual modules, or how microservices are used as part of this process.What is necessary to understand is that the technology has allowed software developers to speed up the creation of new applications. It is all part of a revolutionary process that has enabled digital transformations and has also enabled the use of the huge quantities of data being driven from the Internet of Things and many other sources to be used to help organizations improve the accuracy of decisions.What is also a key consideration is that Pivotal has pioneered the category and despite some alternative offerings, it seems to have entrenched itself with the larger users and to become more or less a de facto standard in the space. There really doesn't seem to be any alternative within the DevOps space that offers a substantial advantage to Pivotal's set of tools on the horizon. And I would be surprised if the use of DevOps and its ancillary technologies didn't become more pervasive through the years.I am very often asked to comment about ""which company is better."" In this case, the alternative is Red Hat which has a large legacy business based on Linux. I am really not qualified to validate the commentary made by Pivotal's CEO in the last conference call that sets out a laundry list of claims for PKS compared to Red Hat's Kubernetes offering. But given the size of the opportunity, I am not sure that it is necessary for me to suggest that Pivotal Kubernetes is better than that of Red Hat. I imagine that both companies will continue to win major transactions and wind up dominating this very large space.Google basically was the pioneer in developing a commercially viable format in which users can access Kubernetes. Typically, users deploy Google's Kubernetes with Pivotal's PKS. It ought to be obvious that PKS is at least a strong horse in this race. Is it better than Red Hat? I am not altogether sure what better might be. Are the Pivotal Cloud Foundry and now the Pivotal Kubernetes solutions better than the equivalent offerings of Red Hat which include Open Shift, Open Stack and the Red Hat version of Kubernetes?In the interest of completeness, I have offered readers an article seen in InfoWorld from a couple of months ago. The article claims that only Red Hat and Google are playing in the Kubernetes arena. Of course, unsaid, is that Google is actually a partner of Pivotal and that the Google Kubernetes Engine is designed to work with PKS. It is worth noting that PKS was introduced about one year ago and it is just now in the process of showing the level of adoption to move the revenue meter for Pivotal. PKS 10, which is said to be the production version of the offering was released just last quarter.Actually, my conversations with the Pivotal IR Director suggest that Pivotal is having excellent success with its PKS offering. I wouldn't have expected her to say otherwise, but anecdotal checks really do suggest that one of the key parts of the Pivotal growth story is the rapid uptake of Kubernetes and that Pivotal has been a major beneficiary of that trend. In fact, PKS was co-developed with VMware (VMW) and Google as one of the key offerings of Pivotal and that is one of the reasons why I anticipate it will be able to maintain a high growth rate.Investing in tech is most often not so much about valuation but about investing in the right tech. These days one of the right tech spaces is that of application containers. The latest data is that the available market for application containers is supposed to reach $8.2 billion by 2025 with a CAGR of 32% through that period. Kubernetes is considered the leading technology in the space and presumably, its growth rate is likely to be higher still. There simply aren't many better markets in which to participate for an enterprise software vendor.Some private companies who exclusively offer some form of Kubernetes claim to be trebling their size every year. As they are private and it is hard to validate their specific financial claims, I haven't gone much further than noting their claims. But certainly, one reason to anticipate that Pivotal's growth rate is likely to remain at elevated levels relates to the rapid adoption of Kubernetes and the opportunities of PKS.Most recently, Pivotal was part of a group that launched something called Knative. This project, along with an internal Pivotal development project called Riff is the foundation of something now called Pivotal Functions Service. I really don't want to suggest that my understanding of Pivotal Functions Service is very complete. What I do believe, again based on commentary I have read, is that this paradigm will open up another growth area for the business which will focus on applications based on IoT data inputs.At the end of the day, at this point, investing in software vendors that offer DevOps capabilities seems a very reasonable strategy. In that overall space, Kubernetes seems to be the technology of choice, and it seems as though the PKS offering is getting lots of traction.Many readers are going to be aware that Pivotal shares, after enjoying a honeymoon with investors, are firmly in the doghouse in the wake of what was considered by many to be a disappointing quarter. The realities are far more complicated and nuanced. Pivotal didn't miss its quarter and its calculated bookings number is far less significant than some investors and commentators have thought. The company is doing quite well, actually, and given its competitive positioning, that ought to remain the case for the foreseeable future. It may be that not all investors were prepared for the level of either seasonality or lumpiness inherent in this company's bookings. And it may be, as well, that both the ""lumpiness"" and the size of bookings, on average were not really understood at the point before earnings. But again, this company is not losing market position and DevOps is not experiencing any growth slowdown.Specifically, last quarter, Pivotal reported revenue growth of 30% overall. Subscription revenues grew by 51% while services revenue grew 9% year over year. Sequential quarterly growth was 8% for subscription revenues and 2% for services revenue. Based on past quarterly numbers, the quarter most recently reported as well as the one to be reported in December, have typically shown some negative seasonality. The other two quarters typically show much higher growth percentages.I think that it is important to understand that Pivotal beat its subscription revenue forecast for the quarter handily. The company had forecast subscription revenues of $92-$93 million and it actually reported $97.5 million of subscription revenues. Overall, it raised its subscription revenue forecast and its total revenue forecast by about the amount it over-attained in fiscal Q2-that seems likely to be conservative, based on the body language I derived during the course of my interview with the IR Director. It reduced its loss forecast for the balance of the year far more substantially in relative terms than it raised its revenue forecast.One of the principal components of Pivotal's investment story remains its dollar-based net expansion rate. Last quarter the rate was 150% and that is down from 156% in the prior quarter. The IR Director stressed to me that management believes that the net expansion rate would gradually taper off over coming quarters, but would remain best of class.Again, part of the issue is that this company sells multi-million dollar sets of software tools to very large users. The process can be gradual or it can happen in one fell swoop. It is not particularly easy to forecast just when and how many existing customers are going to expand their deployments of Pivotal based applications. The net retention ratio will tend to fluctuate along with the level of deferred revenue increase. It is probably not a metric that can be used to forecast company performance on a quarter by quarter basis, even though it is a 4 quarter rolling average. Over time, as Pivotal rolls out additional products, and as the DevOps paradigm becomes more universal, it is certainly possible for the metric to rise on some kind of irregular basis.Recently, Pivotal has indicated that its Federal business may have reached a tipping point in which different agencies are moving deployments from a starter size to substantial installations. This may be something to be seen when the company reports its October ending quarter.The company's overall gross margins expanded very sharply, primarily because subscription gross margins are 93% and services gross margins are just 27% and the proportion of revenues coming from subscription revenues is rising sharply. Inevitably, the change in mix is going to drive company gross margins higher than the 66% GAAP reported last quarter.The company also saw a noticeable improvement in operating expense ratios, which declined by 600 basis points last quarter on a year over year basis. I am inclined to question if the cadence of expense ratio reduction can continue while the company is expanding both its product footprint and its sales capacity. The company's operating loss was 9% in this latest quarter 1500 basis points above the year-earlier level.The company is generating cash and it has a substantial cash balance. The company's free cash flow margin last quarter was 17%. This is the company's 2nd quarter of significant free cash flow. Much of the improvement was based on the increase in stock-based comp, but the company's receivables also showed a very positive trend.On the other hand, the quarterly increase in the deferred revenue balance was negative in the period, after two quarters of very rapid increase in that metric. The fact is that this company does business with far fewer customers than most companies of its size. As a result, it will have a very lumpy pattern of changes in deferred revenue. The last two quarters were far above trend and this past quarter was below trend. For many years, software analysts, and in that group, I will include myself, have been taught that bookings are the best metric to consider in evaluating just how well a company's selling motion is operating. After all, bookings do turn into revenues with some regularity. While Pivotal doesn't forecast bookings, analysts at most large brokerages choose to do so and do so consistent with their estimates of revenue growth. That has proven to be a very fraught undertaking that has led to inaccurate conclusions.One of the issues with bookings has to do with start dates and prepayments of individual contracts. Given that Pivotal has fewer contracts in a given quarter that generate revenue when compared to some other enterprise software vendors, these variables can have a materially impact on quarterly bookings metrics. In addition, this company charges its users based on workloads. Very often users deploy more workloads than their initial plans and in fact, that is one factor that will typically lead to revenue over-attainment. But the expansion of workload deployments does not necessarily lead to higher bookings, again a factor making bookings a less useful metric in considering the performance of Pivotal's sales engine.As mentioned, bookings growth in the prior two quarters, fueled by deferred revenue increases, was at unsustainable levels. In fact, the calculated bookings growth in Q1 was close to 80% and it would have been even higher in the prior quarter-but Pivotal was not public so not all the metrics necessary to calculate bookings are available. At the moment, there is but one company I know of with 80% growth in bookings and that is Elastic (ESTC). Elastic is no doubt a fantastic company-but one well recognized by investors and valued accordingly. According to the IR Director of Pivotal, one should not expect to see 80% growth in bookings on quarterly basis again. While she did not share expectations for the metric on an annual basis, I think overall Pivotal is growing in the 30% range. If that is a reasonable approximation of growth, it would be logically inconsistent to expect bookings growth to substantially exceed that growth range in any 12 month period.But the issue really is whether the shares are properly valued for what is a reasonable expectation of future growth. I simply believe that based on a careful inspection of the revenue and product components of this company, that its shares are undervalued.It is important for investors to note that this company, because of its legacy component of advanced services, will not report the kind of growth that is seen by other newly public IT vendors. At this point, Subscriptions represent 59% of total revenues. The company is forecasting subscription revenue growth of about 45% this year, decelerating to 39% in Q4. Total revenues are expected to grow by about 27%, with growth of 26% forecast in Q4.I imagine that the company expects to see a stronger trend in license revenue growth than it has forecast, with not all that much deceleration in growth below the levels forecast by the company for Q3 (around 48%). I think the EV/S calculation should probably be based on overall company growth rates at or slightly below the 30% range as compared to the 23% growth rate forecast by the First Call consensus. That yields a 12-month forward revenue forecast of about $755 million. Using 260 million average shares and a $19 share price yields a market capitalization of $4.8 billion and an enterprise value of $4.2 billion. That computes to an EV/S of about 5.5X.Is that valuation cheap enough for investors to enter this name? I think given the company competitive positioning in one of the fastest growing spaces within IT, it certainly is. In fact, the elements that have plagued the shares, including ""lumpy"" larger orders, a ""valuation panic"" and a lockup expiration, have provided investors with an entry point that is certainly attractive to me. The option expiration pressure, in the nature of things will abate, and over time investors will be better able to evaluate the progress of this company based on metrics that have less to do with bookings growth that no longer properly represents the company's actual level of sales attainment.As mentioned, the company has just completed 2 quarters of positive free cash flow. Given the constituents in free cash flow, I would be reluctant to use any free cash flow margin forecast at this point. It is not feasible to project contract start dates and prepayments which can have such a substantial influence on cash flow. Over time, I anticipate that this company will be able to deliver free cash flow margins at rates substantially above non-GAAP reported profits but I do not believe at this point that valuation can or will be based on free cash flow projections.Pivotal has another 8 weeks until it announces earnings for the current quarter, and it has a rather substantial option lock-up over-hang in terms of the 37 million shares now available for sale. That overhang is not going to be absorbed in a week and is likely to have a significant negative impact on share price performance in the next few weeks. For longer-term investors, this would seem to be an excellent price at which to enter the name. I realize that the impact of lock-up expiration can drive investors crazy-but it also provides an entry price that is particularly attractive. I would imagine that by the time of the next earnings release, the shares that need to be distributed to VC's and employees will have been distributed and this should allow valuations to respond rationally to the report of the company's operational performance."
4175271,98236,2018-05-17T19:38:40-04:00,"Pivotal became a public company about 4 weeks ago.The shares have been trading around 25% above their offer price.The company is the leading vendor of what are called 'cloud native tools"" to help users rapidly build applications that run in all the different flavors of the cloud.The company has a very large, essentially legacy services component, that has low margins and is shrinking.The combination of a hyper-growth subscription revenue segment and a declining services segment has made it difficult to value the shares.","April 20th is not, perhaps, the most auspicious day in human history being the birthday of one of the greater tyrants and mass murderers of the 20th century. But that was almost 130 years ago, and what is in a date anyway. Why focus on April 20th? It is the day on which Pivotal Software (PVTL) went public - and it had been one of the more eagerly awaited IPOs of this year.Pivotal has a somewhat unusual history that is perhaps worth recounting as it may figure in the share price valuation at some point. The company was formed in 2012 and was spun out of a venture that had been organized by EMC and VMware (NYSE:VMW). The company secured additional investors from GE Capital and Pivotal One. Finally, the company secured more financing from investors including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Ford (NYSE:F). Along the way, EMC acquired Greenplum, which became a division of Pivotal. Greenplum is known for its big data analytics offerings and is one of the leaders in the use of massively parallel processing techniques. Greenplum is apparently no longer a focus of Pivotal and gets no mention in the prospectus. That said, Greenplum is ""alive and kicking"" as the article linked here indicates and is occasionally still mentioned by Pivotal's CEO, Rob Mee. Greenplum apparently represents about 15-20% of Pivotal's revenue and appears to be profitable and rapidly growing at some point, it might turn into a sleeper asset.Pivotal will not report the results of its first quarter as a public quarter for another few weeks yet (it scheduled its 1st ever earnings release and conference call for June 12). But I have had several questions regarding its prospects, both from subscribers to my Ticker Target investment service and from other of my investment advisory clients. I prepared an initial recommendation for my subscribers but thought I would like to share some insights with a broader public on Seeking Alpha. For investors interested in such things, the prospectus, the source for much of the ""facts"" in this article, has some attractive graphs describing how Pivotal is transforming the way that applications are built. I have no intention of reprising that information as it is unlikely to help readers decide on investing in Pivotal shares.I have reviewed the numbers carefully - and investing in technology is still about numbers. Pivotal is an unusual software company in that until recently most of its revenues came from services. The company isn't profitable and doesn't generate cash so realistically, investors are stuck with EV/S comparisons. Many of the newest software vendors have very high EV/S ratios. While those ratios often scare some investors and commentators, they can be readily justified by a year or two of 40% or 50% growth. That is not going to happen here - not because the Agile development platform that Pivotal sells will not grow at 50% or more but because this company still has a legacy business that is in decline. So, positive though one might be in evaluating the outlook for Pivotal's Cloud Foundry and its Container Service and function service, it would be difficult, to rationally make the case that this company is going to enjoy the kind of EV/S ratios that can be commanded by other infrastructure vendors such as Atlassian (TEAM) or Twilio (TWLO). Typically, investors have not chosen to pay more than 2X-3X EV/S for services revenue - and that is for profitable services revenue which Pivotal doesn't have.Investing is typically a matter of choices, and for me at least, investing in Pivotal would restrict my ability to invest in another infrastructure name. Some readers may feel that is not an appropriate measure. Pivotal I think is the vendor of choice in AD for multi-cloud environments for larger enterprises and is almost certainly likely to remain so.Pivotal currently has an enterprise value of about $4.3 billion based on full-year average shares outstanding of 260 million. Its current 12-month forward EV/S ratio based on a revenue estimate of around $675 million is most likely around 6X-6.5X, and that seems to this writer to be only a bit under what a normalized EV/S ratio might be if derived from combining a high EV/S ratio for subscription revenues and a lower EV/S ratio for services revenues. Pivotal is likely to be a decent, but not spectacularly good investment, and I think there is more positive alpha available in other infrastructure software vendors, who haven't the boat anchor of services revenue with declining gross margins to deal with.As many readers of my articles probably realize, I am a growth junkie - or at least a growth enthusiast. And as a growth junkie, I have a certain level of sympathy in evaluating the shares of Pivotal. The company really has a commanding position in terms of its product capabilities that are used by its clients as part of a strategy of enabling the development of new applications. Pivotal is certainly one of the thought leaders in promoting the concepts of DevOps and Agile development which are becoming central tenets of the software application development paradigm.I think it is highly likely that over time, the company is going to produce headline hyper-growth. But it is important to note at the outset of this discussion, that at the moment and due to the impact of a transition that will be described in detail, the optics are simply less than optimal which is why most of the analysts from the underwriters have initiated on this name with either hold ratings or small upside target prices. Anyone buying Pivotal shares at this point has to understand that the company is simply not going to report the high growth percentages of other company's over at least the next couple of years, and while this is going on, the share price performance of this company may turn out to be muted. I don't currently have a position in the shares, and it is this conundrum that has been a deterrent for me.In some ways, many descriptions of Pivotal are a bit unsatisfying. Unless you're an IT professional, much of what customers do with Pivotal products seems a bit mystifying. The company's slogan is ""transforming how the world builds software"" and it does so through what it calls cloud-native solutions, in what is called the Pivotal Cloud Foundry. When I was young, foundries were places where metal was cast into tools. Then chips got made in foundries. Now there are cloud foundries - such is progress.I suppose to some extent, a Cloud Foundry can be thought of as the workshop of the second decade of the 21st century. Initially, Pivotal provided consulting services to its customers, but over the last several years, it has shifted its focus to providing tool which is offered via subscription. That said, the company continues to offer consulting services to clients through Pivotal Labs and that is part of its ""go-to-market"" strategy for PCF. It can hardly be a surprise to readers that all large enterprises have to adapt to the cloud. Many of them are doing so via buying packaged applications software, but true digital transformations, in which end-user customers can use the cloud to buy products and services, generally require that an enterprise has to build its own set of cloud-native applications. The terms that are used by many in the industry these days include DevOps and Agile, which are replacing the hoary model of waterfall software delivery.I have written in the past that part of the reason why IT software stocks have been so strong on a relative basis is that the solutions they sell are now producing a higher return on capital than in the recent past. There are some who might go so far as to suggest that software is driving the economy - although that is a discussion that I will certainly avoid in this article. What is certainly true, is that for most companies, being competitive in today's world require rapid development and deployment of software solutions that create business value. Creating business value means that software has to make it straightforward for an end user to buy from an enterprise, check the status of a delivery or a purchase, figure out their current financial status, or anything else that might lead to revenue and user satisfaction. Enterprises need to figure out what their competitors are doing in terms of creating business value, and then use rapid development tools to match offerings in a timely fashion.Most readers see the results of digital transformations in their daily lives in areas such as property and casualty insurance offerings, offerings of financial services vendors, car dealerships, and travel. Even an agency with the multiple operational problems of New York's MTA has undertaken to provide its customers with some, albeit limited, digital experiences. But the fact is that the transformations that are required are all-encompassing, and vendors (by that I mean the potential clients of Pivotal) that do not offer these kinds of choices are likely to lose market share.Pivotal's basic role in this transformation is to improve the productivity of software professionals. The company says that its largest customers, who use the most components of the offering have improved their productivity by 50% or more using the company's offering. I have no particular reason to doubt that claim; most development processes, particularly at large enterprises, have started to migrate to new application development models. Pivotal basically sells solutions that enable its customers to rapidly develop complex, digital transformation applications that can run in a multi-cloud environmentThe ugly is that Pivotal loses lots of money and doesn't know and will not be able to report the percentage growth of some other recent IPOs in the IT space. The basic reason for that is that Pivotal still gets 44% of its revenues from services, and its services revenue is not growing. The company is no longer structured to focus on sales of professional services, but the business is still significant to the reported numbers of the Pivotal. Further, while the company has already reached 90% gross margins on its subscription revenues, its margins on services revenues fell to just 15% in the quarter that ended last January. That, in turn, dragged down operating margins last quarter to a GAAP loss of 34%. Probably gross margins on services will not get worse than last quarter, and certainly, the percentage of revenues coming from highly margined subscription sales will grow, but this company has lots to overcome before it can report even non-GAAP profits.Pivotal reported revenues of $509 million in the fiscal year that ended in January. The issue is that this figure represented reported growth of just 22%. The company has been growing its ARR rapidly - it was up 58% in fiscal year 2018, but services revenue is either flat or declining. Profitability has been improving to a degree with the non-GAAP loss falling to 29% from 44% over the past year. The company did constrain the growth of operating expenses in the last year, and overall, operating expense grew by just 10% for the full year. That trend did not continue in the company's latest reported quarter, and opex grew by 10% sequentially, with the largest increases coming in sales and marketing and in general and administrative spending. Those results were based on seasonality - or at least it doesn't seem to be. In the year earlier quarter, the sequential growth in opex was 3% going from Q3 to Q4. Last quarter, opex was 97% of reported total revenues and that has to change dramatically before the company is able to report profits.The company bases its pricing on a usage model, and users are charged for their deployment of applications, containers, and other microservices. The company offers contracts that are typically of 1 year to 3 years of duration, and the company's backlog grew by 73% year on year to $820 million, about half of which is scheduled to be recognized in the coming year. That is a very impressive number and gives the business a fair level of visibility.The company has been enlarging its customer acquisition model, with revenues processed through Dell (DVMT) and VMWare falling from 46% of revenues in fiscal 2016 to 37% of revenues last year. It is important for Pivotal to develop its own in-house large deal capability as its sales strategies will not perfectly align with its parents on every occasion.This being 2018, needless to say, the company presented several very large TAM estimates in its prospectus. Overall, the company addresses the cloud infrastructure space or the PaaS market which is expected to grow from $16 billion to $29 billion according to Gartner, although at other points in the prospectus, the market opportunity is said to be over $50 billion. I almost invariably write about TAMs in presenting investment ideas, but I think the concept has been worked to death. I realize that I-Bankers feel constrained to ""prove"" that their latest IPO is worth the price, but setting up these straw men of incredible TAMs can be a bit tiresome. I think it is fair to say that the market for what Pivotal sells is large, and their opportunities are more than sufficient for the company to sustain hyper-growth selling AD tools for years to come. Trying to quantify the size of the opportunity is something I will leave to institutions who have compliance requirements in justifying their share acquisition strategies.One of Pivotal's core strategies is its dedication to hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments. One should remember that Pivotal's parents are Dell and VMW and that in turn means that the company's solutions have always been focused on enabling the hybrid cloud. Basically, building a solution with Pivotal tools will enable it to be deployed on private, public, and multi-cloud environments through a consistent interface. There are lots of advantages for the Pivotal offering in being agnostic and being able to offer developers the tools to allow their apps to run on a variety of public clouds, which helps their users avoid vendor lock-ins. It is this agnostic capability that is likely to be one of the principal differentiators offered by Pivotal, although most independent vendors of application creation technology are following a similar path. Still, it is unlikely that the stack vendors, who are significant Pivotal competitors, will ever choose to offer their customers the ability to run applications seamlessly on competing clouds.Now for the impressive. The most relevant way to look at Pivotal's operating performance is to consider the growth in ARR. The implied subscription annual contract value reached $940 million last quarter, up sharply in both the last 90 days and year over year. The company added $110 million of net new ARR in the last 12 months, which represents very strong percentage growth. Pivotal typically sells to larger users and has larger deals and not every quarter has strongly positive ARR - note that in the prior quarter, i.e. Q3, ARR growth was just 2.5% sequentially compared to more than 13% in this past quarter. The lumpiness of ARR growth is likely to lead to some volatility of the shares given how analysts are likely to value the business.Because of the relatively large size of this company's deals, the growth in ARR is going to be lumpy and that is going to be something for investors to appreciate. Not every quarter is going to see a high level of contract signings and strong ARR growth, and those quarters where growth is tepid may see analyst commentary regarding that metric. The company's dollar-based net expansion rate is a very impressive 158%, one of the highest such figures I have seen in the software space.Last year, the company acquired 44 new users compared to 95 in the prior year. The prospectus says that the company was focused on renewals and upsells last year, and indeed overall, the implied average annual contract value per subscriber grew by 36% suggesting that the value of the Pivotal solution is resonating strongly with its user base. That said, I might wish that the company had secured more than 5 new customer nameplates last quarter. I imagine that the company will set targets, at least in broad terms, regarding reasonable expectations for new customer acquisition when it holds its conference call. In the prospectus, the company said it will be returning to a focus on new customer acquisitions.Last quarter, the company reported subscription revenues of $75 million, up 56% from the prior year and up almost 14% from the prior quarter. While the quarterly growth metric has moved around quite a bit over the last year, the company's reported subscription revenue has been growing at well over 50% year on year, in every quarter this past year.So, what's the growth likely to be. There has been a flood of brokerage reports on Pivotal as its after-flotation quiet period has ended. The estimated growth rates the analysts are forecasting are about 24% this year and for 25% the following year, as subscription revenues become a higher component of the mix. Most analysts have the subscription growth rate declining; I suspect that this is just based on the typical growth rate compression forecast for all high-growth revenue sources and has nothing to do with anything specific to the outlook for Pivotal. The company is not expected to reach profitability through the end of next year, but it is projected to reach break-even cash flow from operations by the end of 2019.Presumably, these estimates are really the projections that the company has provided the analysts. There is no objective way at this point for anyone outside of Pivotal to arrive at estimates - there is simply no history of comparing forecasts to actual performance that can be considered. I imagine that the estimates given to the brokerages are those which are designed to be beaten; presumably, the company will try to build an expectation for beat and raise headline numbers. As mentioned, it is not feasible to remove the lumpiness from the growth in ARR, but it seems likely that this metric will be forecast and therefore, analyzed in detail.The IT space is full of alternatives with which to develop applications and that has been the case for many years. Pivotal has developed a very strong reputation as a development solution that provides users with the appropriate resources to rapidly develop the kinds of applications that businesses need to deploy these days. Of all of the company's listed in the prospectus as competitors, Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) would seem to be the company that most nearly mimics Pivotal's capabilities. On the other hand, this is not really an either/or situation for investors. In fact, the percentage growth rates of Red Hat's set of AD tools is roughly similar to the growth rate of Pivotal's subscription revenue-although, of course, Red Hat is profitable and Pivotal is not. For the record, Red Hat, with a growth rate of 20% or a little higher in terms of reported revenues, currently is valued at an EV/S of about 7.5X, although, as said, RHT is quite profitable and generates lots of cash.In terms of competitive focus, Pivotal does substantially better with the largest enterprises, while Red Hat has focused on developing lots of new name accounts. When it comes to technology, I think that most observers feel there is much similarity, although the companies are strong marketplace rivals. There is more than enough room in this market for at least two best of breed/agnostic competitors.The other major competitors are tools that are offered by both the stack vendors and the cloud services providers. There tends to be some level of competition in the market with shifting tactical alliances characterizing the largest procurements. I think that the odds are very favorable for this company finding space to operate alongside, rather than in competition with Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) and Microsoft - and that is a nice place to be.That is, after all, the purpose of these articles-invest recommendations. After 3000+ words, I still find myself conflicted. What Pivotal is selling today is strategic for its customers, and they will almost surely be buying more of it as time goes on. The 158% net dollar retention rate is not surprising and is one of the strongest arguments for owning these shares. But I remain perplexed as to how I can confidently recommend the shares with the services business boat anchor continuing to depress growth and even profitability measurements. In comparing these shares to those of competitor Red Hat, it is worth noting that Red Hat's legacy business, essentially enterprise Linux, has seen low to mid-teens growth and is very profitable. Personally, if looking to invest in the AD space to capture some of the growth potential of the rapid digital transformation being wrought by users, I would probably opt for a commitment in Red Hat, although its revenues in this space are quite a bit smaller than those of Pivotal.For readers with a long time perspective, these shares will have a certain level of appeal as the high growth component of the business is rapidly rising as a percentage of total revenues. In looking at fiscal 2020-which starts in just 8 months, the ratio of high growth revenues to the total is likely to reach 70%. But for me, at this time, I simply do not think the risk/rewards are high enough, or that the company ought to replace my other infrastructure software commitments in my portfolio. It is a close call, and while I do think the company shares can achieve some positive alpha, it isn't quite enough for me at this time."
4181362,103480,2018-06-13T12:11:22-04:00,"Pivotal Software had its first major breakout after posting Q1 earnings, rising more than 20% on the news.The company beat expectations on the top and bottom lines, with a strong acceleration on the top line to 28% y/y growth and upbeat guidance for the year.Pivotal's CEO also declared the company to be independent of Dell.At 9.1x forward revenues, Pivotal Software is fully valued and has little upside left.","When it went public in late April at just $15 per share, Pivotal Software (PVTL) never seemed like it could eventually become an investor favorite. Shares popped just 4% on the first day of trading, one of the weakest IPO performances of the year and certainly a disappointing performance for a PaaS company of its scale. Now, however, after Pivotal released its first-quarter earnings report (and the first earnings release since it went public), the company seems to have found its footing. As with most maiden earnings releases, Pivotal's release set a strong tone with Wall Street and provided an extremely upbeat view for FY18 that wasn't previously baked into Wall Street's models.As a result, shares are up more than 20%, capping off a strong recent trading pattern for Pivotal that has the shares up to nearly 2x its IPO price. Pivotal is now neck-and-neck with the other high-profile software companies that went public this year in terms of post-IPO performance:PVTL data by YChartsPerhaps even more importantly than the upbeat results and guidance - Pivotal's CEO, Rob Mee, declared on a pre-earnings phone interview the following: ""We are not at all dependent on the Dell Technologies portfolio,"" as reported by MarketWatch. Recall that prior to its IPO (and still today), Pivotal Software has a majority owner in Dell. Companies with an association to Dell have been in rocky waters this year, such as VMware (VMW). With Dell struggling to manage down its huge $50 billion debt load, the fate of its subsidiaries (reverse merger scares tanked VMware earlier in the year) has been left largely unknown. Though we still can't be sure of Dell's intentions, Mee's statement makes it easier for analysts to view Pivotal as a standalone company independent of its relationship to Dell.The question now for investors is: Does Pivotal Software have any upside left? When shares sputtered post-IPO, they were trading at just 6x forward revenues, and I believed Pivotal Software to be one of the recent software IPOs that hadn't yet appreciated to their full potential.Now, however, shares are looking quite richly valued. At its post-earnings share price of $26, Pivotal Software has raced ahead to a $6.53 billion market cap. After netting out the $645.5 million of cash on its balance sheet, Pivotal Software is left with an enterprise value of $5.88 billion.Along with its Q1 release, Pivotal Software also released FY19 guidance that took analysts by surprise. The company guided to $642-$649 million in revenues for the year, representing 27% y/y growth at the midpoint. Analysts were expecting only $622.0 million, or 22% y/y growth.Against the midpoint of Pivotal's upside guidance range, the company currently trades at 9.1x EV/FY19 revenues. While this isn't expensive relative to the other 2018 software IPO cohorts, especially against names like DocuSign (DOCU) that have rallied sharply, it's certainly an expensive multiple against the broader software sector, especially for sub par growth in the high 20s. Here's where other mid-cap software companies growing in the high 20s/low 30s are currently trading:BOX EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsIn my view, Pivotal Software has limited upside left after its robust post-earnings rally. Though the results were strong and the guidance for the year even better, the upside announced in Q1 has effectively already been priced into Pivotal's shares. The company already is trading three turns higher than in the early days of the IPO, and when the market turns south again, Pivotal is especially vulnerable given its recent rally. Recall also that the company's lockup expiration has not yet come due (it's slated for mid-October, according to Nasdaq), so there are definitely plenty of downside catalysts in the stock's near future. Now is a good time to lock in gains on Pivotal stock and sit on the sidelines until shares come back down to earth.Let's take a look at the company's Q1 results:Figure 1. Pivotal Software Q1 earningsSource: Pivotal Software investor relationsRevenues grew 28% y/y to $155.7 million, greatly eclipsing analyst expectations of $140.4 million (+16% y/y) by a staggering 12 points. Note, however, that in the first earnings quarter after going public, companies often show the largest gap to Wall Street's expectations because analysts' targets haven't yet been shaped by guidance or a reliable historical pattern. Going forward, the gap between expectations and results should dwindle.It's important to note as well that Pivotal's growth rates accelerated sharply from the 18% growth rate at which the company exited Q4. However, I have trouble believing that this growth rate will hold. Recall that Pivotal Software's growth pattern over the last year has been extremely erratic. In Q1 of last year, Pivotal Software also had its best growth rate (38% y/y), but in the second through fourth quarters, respectively, Pivotal grew at only 20%, 17%, and 18% y/y.Of course, last year's discrete quarterly growth rates are not a perfect way of extrapolating this year's results. But if Q1 continues to be Pivotal Software's best quarter as it was last year and the following quarters slip again below 20% growth, Pivotal may have trouble hitting the 27% y/y growth implied in its revenue guidance range for the year. It essentially needs to hold the 28% growth rate in the current quarter if it wants to hit that target. Unlike most software companies that guide conservatively for the year and allow themselves some room to decelerate in the back half of the year, Pivotal Software seems to have set an ambitious target which has some attainment risk.Of course, Pivotal management would tell you that they have an extremely clear view into near-term results. The company's CFO noted the following on the earnings call (emphasis mine):Still, however, I can't help but to think that there is some execution risk involved with setting a full-year growth target that's in line with this quarter's growth rate.On the earnings front, Pivotal Software showed similar strength. The company managed to reduce its operating loss margin on a GAAP basis to just -21.5% in the quarter, significantly improved from -39.9% in 1Q18. All of Pivotal Software's operating expense categories came down as a percentage of revenues, particularly sales and marketing, its largest opex line item. Note also that general and administrative spending actually fell 11% y/y, which is an encouraging sign of good spend discipline as companies typically show larger overhead spending post-IPO.As a result, Pivotal Software's pro forma EPS of -$0.10 in the quarter showed decent upside against analyst expectations of -$0.13 in the quarter. The company also managed to generate $4.5 million in operating cash flows, up from a loss of the same magnitude in the year-ago quarter.Despite the strong results in Q1, I believe Pivotal Software's shares to be fully valued with little room left for upside. The primary reasons are two-fold - first, at 9.1x forward revenues, the company already trades at a robust premium relative to other similarly-sized software companies in its growth category, and second, though Pivotal Software's guidance for the year contained plenty of upside to Wall Street's current models, there's definitely risk to hitting its target if there's any deceleration whatsoever in the year.Pivotal Software's shares are priced with no room for error, making the risk-reward profile look extremely unattractive. Stay on the sidelines for this name."
4228524,103480,2018-12-15T13:54:59-05:00,"Pivotal Software posted an excellent third-quarter earnings report that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines.The company also managed to accelerate subscription revenue growth by two points to 53% y/y.The company has also notched one of the highest dollar-based net retention rates in the software sector.At the same time, the company is gradually thinning out its losses and achieving stronger operating margins.With a much lower valuation after the autumn rout and the October lockup expiration out of the way, Pivotal has cleared all obstacles for a recovery in its share price.","Though the correction in the high-growth software sector has been a painful experience, it has created a lot of attractive buying opportunities in names that were previously expensive. Moving forward into 2019, investors should focus on stocks that check off the following requirements, as these stocks are best positioned for a rebound: high revenue growth (>30% y/y), reasonable losses and a path to improving margins, and a valuation that is well off peak.Pivotal Software (PVTL) is one such name. Last quarter, Pivotal was an extremely unattractive investment. Its share price had rocketed to the mid-$20s and was approaching a double-digit revenue multiple, while its revenue growth also saw a noticeable deceleration from the prior quarter. To top it all off, Pivotal was also facing a lockup expiration in October that put plenty of pressure on the shares.This quarter, however, its prospects have brightened dramatically. Subscription revenue growth has picked up again, profitability is strong (at least, it's not losing as much money) and the lockup expiration is in the rearview mirror. Pivotal's stock is also well off peak, with shares down more than 40% from peak values.PVTL data by YChartsIn my view, Pivotal has hit a bottom, and investors should position themselves for a rebound in this stock in mid-2019.The foremost bullish driver behind Pivotal is its now-cheap valuation, thanks to the beating it has received over the past several months. Let's take a deeper dive into where the company is currently trading.At Pivotal's present share price of ~$18, the company has a market cap of $4.68 billion. If we net out the $665 million of cash on its balance sheet, we arrive at an enterprise value of $4.02 billion.Figure 1. Pivotal guidanceSource: Pivotal earnings releaseFor the current year, Pivotal has guided to a midpoint of $658 million in revenues (we note also that its fourth-quarter guidance has upside of about ~$3 million, or 2 percentage points, versus Wall Street's expectations).Let's assume that Pivotal manages to grow revenues at 25% y/y next year, marking a five-point deceleration from this quarter's total revenue growth rate of 30% y/y. This gives us a revenue forecast of $822.5 million, indicating that Pivotal is trading at approximately 4.9x EV/FY19 expected revenues. For a company that is growing presently at ~30% y/y with >50% y/y growth in subscription revenues, I'd say that's a bargain. PaaS stocks like Pivotal have often traded at cheaper valuation multiples than peers, but in my view, Pivotal is worth at least 6x EV/FY19 revenues, implying a price target of $25 and 39% upside from current levels.Here's a look at Pivotal's full third-quarter results:Figure 2. Pivotal 3Q18 earnings resultsSource: Pivotal earnings releaseTotal revenues grew 30% y/y to $168.1 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $164.1 million (+27% y/y) by a respectable three-point margin. Subscription revenue growth, however, was even stronger, growing 53% y/y to $100.8 million. Note also that subscription revenue growth accelerated two points over last quarter's 51% y/y growth, which is a significant accomplishment for a company with Pivotal's fairly sizable run rate.Driving a large portion of the company's growth this quarter was upsells into the existing installed base. Pivotal reported a 150% dollar-based net retention rate this quarter, which is one of the highest in the SaaS sector. On the Q3 earnings call, CFO Cynthia Gaylor even cautioned investors that Pivotal's retention rate was so high that it may naturally decline over time:Moreover, the company's continued shift into subscription revenues has led to a significant lift in gross margins. Subscription revenues hit 60% of total revenues this quarter, up nine points relative to the prior-year quarter, producing a seven-point increase in gross margins to 67% as shown in the chart below:Figure 3. Pivotal gross margin trendsSource: Pivotal earnings deckAt the same time, Pivotal was also able to drive meaningful improvements in operating expenses as well. Sales and marketing expenses, R&D costs, and general and administrative spending each fell one point as a percentage of revenues relative to the year-ago quarter, as shown in the chart below:Figure 4. Pivotal operating margin trendsSource: Pivotal earnings deckAs a result, pro forma operating losses thinned down to -$14.8 million, much better than -$25.0 million in 3Q18, and operating margins ticked up to -9%, a ten-point improvement over -19% in the year-ago quarter.Pivotal's pro forma EPS of -$0.05 also beat Wall Street's expectations of -$0.08. In addition, the company's year-to-date cash flow losses have also pared down significantly:Figure 5. Pivotal OCFSource: Pivotal earnings releaseYear-to-date operating cash burn is down to just -$13.3 million, compared to a loss of more than -$100 million in the prior year. Recall also that Pivotal has a huge $665 million cash balance - at its current burn rate, Pivotal is far from running out of liquidity for several years. This is an example of a company that has a clear path to profitability, while also showing terrific growth in subscription revenues.Pivotal Software is exactly the type of high-quality, recurring-revenue software business that investors should latch onto in a market downturn. This isn't a ""growth-at-all-costs"" stock - alongside robust top-line growth, Pivotal Software is also making huge improvements to its unit economics while shrinking down its cash burn to virtually nothing.This is also a company that has plenty of greenfield sales opportunities - as in, many of Pivotal's prospective customers don't currently have a competing solution installed. The company estimates its 2021 TAM at $80 billion, indicating that it has only fractionally penetrated its addressable market:Figure 6. Pivotal TAMSource: Pivotal earnings releaseWith Pivotal's valuation now at under 5x forward revenues, which is significantly cheaper than in the past, being bullish on this stock is virtually a no-brainer.

4169078,104326,2018-05-03T09:18:35-04:00,"Pivotal’s IPO reaped in more than $550 million and earned it a valuation of nearly $4 billion.The company still fell short of high expectations, however, performing well but not making the huge splash many expected it to.The forthcoming surge in cloud computing all but ensures a healthy market for Pivotal to grow in.","Investors across the market had incredibly high expectations for Pivotal Software (PVTL:NYSE), a tech firm that many expected to generate one of the biggest market debuts this year. The recent hysteria and hubbub surrounding the so-called forthcoming pivot to the cloud doesn't appear to be enrapturing investors as many once hoped, however, as Pivotal Software’s relatively lukewarm debut fell far short of expectations.Despite the somewhat chilly reception of its IPO, however, Pivotal Software is only down, yet not out. The company’s shares were still trading up after its debut, which earned it a mammoth valuation, and Pivotal Software isn’t going anywhere soon. This means it could be a lucrative buy for investors who are willing to wait and play the long game. Here are the fundamentals that investors will be keeping their eyes on as they try to determine how the tech firm will fare in the immediate future.It should be of little surprise to investors interested in Pivotal Software that the company had incredibly high expectations surrounding its market debut, especially since it has some lofty ambitions of its own that it aims to bring to fruition over the coming years.The aspiring tech company specializes in cloud computing, and has been banking a great deal of its success on predictions that industries across the world would soon be making a huge pivot to the cloud. With mammoth tech companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) going crazy about the cloud, it’s not hard to see why such a pivot was predicted. Companies like Pivotal may have to wait just a bit more before they have their day in the sun, however. While investors are indeed interested in the cloud, their interest only goes so far as of yet.With an opening range of $15.11 to $16.80 during its IPO, it was expected that Pivotal would reap in a healthy sum of capital from its endeavor and that it did indeed. Pivotal’s IPO brought it in some $555 million, and earned the company an impressive market capitalization of roughly $3.9 billion. With such huge sums like that behind it, tech investors can rest reassured that Pivotal Software won’t be ditching the marketplace anytime soon, even in light of investors' relatively tepid interest in cloud computing at the moment.Those who are dismissing the cloud already are soon to be regretful, too. Pivotal Software’s long-term strategy of banking on the growth of cloud computing is still incredibly well-founded, given that the cloud computing market is projected to reach a mammoth $411 billion by 2020 alone. This should indicate to investors that there’s incredible potential for growth in Pivotal Software, but should also serve as a warning that the company’s industry will be incredibly packed with competition that it will need to overcome before attaining long-term success. These competitors include the high and mighty of software including: Microsoft, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).However, to its advantage, Pivotal has partnerships with all three of these companies, particularly with its popular Pivotal Cloud Foundary software. This gives it a unique insight into customer behavior, and an understanding of which cloud service they prefer and why. For example, Pivotal has one hundred joint engagements with Microsoft Azure cloud and so works with Microsoft's customers.One other distinct advantage it has over its competitors is that Pivotal allows businesses to work with apps in Java, the preferred language of many coders, meaning they don't have to relearn any skills to work with Google, Microsoft or Amazon, which gives customers the luxury of switching between these cloud providers with ease.The long-term fundamentals of the company’s finances may give some investors pause, too. Pivotal Software has incurred net losses every year since it was formed, after all, and investors will be looking for growing revenue figures to offset such losses if they’re to latch their horse to Pivotal’s wagon for the long haul in the market.Not all the news surrounding its net losses is bad, however. According to the prospectus, the company filed with the SEC, its net losses have been down in recent years, shrinking impressively from $232 million in 2017 to $163 million in fiscal 2018. If those losses keep shrinking, expect investors to jump aboard Pivotal’s ship with glee.Investors should also know Pivotal has some friends in high places. Dell (DVMT) has a massive economic interest in Pivotal Software’s success, after all, and could prove instrumental towards its future. Pivotal’s CEO has opened up about navigating the complex corporate politics that come with being a member of the Dell family, and it’s worth noting that, thus far, Pivotal’s team of executives seemed to have done a fairly good job of remaining an independent and effective member of a much bigger corporate family.Pivotal Software’s forging of lucrative relationships with such companies as Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Liberty Mutual should prove to investors the company has some serious potential. As long as the company’s net losses continue to shrink at such rates as they did from 2017 to 2018, investors aren’t likely to concern themselves too much with who owns Pivotal, outside of clamoring for more shares themselves.Don't let the lukewarm IPO dissuade you. For investors interested in long-term growth, Pivotal is definitely a worthwhile consideration. The growth of cloud computing seems ceaseless, and sooner rather than later the market is going to be banking big on companies like Pivotal Software."
4165162,23690,2018-04-24T11:01:31-04:00,Pivotal Software came public last week at $15 and traded quietly on their debut.Their very rapid growth in high-margin SaaS is being masked by their shift away from providing professional services.This provides a rare opportunity to buy one of the key names in enterprise cloud infrastructure at a good price.Our IV suggests the shares can reach $34 in the next year.,"Pivotal Software (NYSE:PVTL) went public on Friday at $15/share. The offering didn't get a resounding vote from the markets. Unlike other recent enterprise software deals, this one ended quietly at $15.75.We think PVTL is likely to do well at these levels. Partly because investors focused on ""slowing growth"" in revenues. That misses the most valuable aspect of the growth story - services revenues are actually declining YoY while software subscription revenue growth remains robust.The table below illustrates the underlying dynamics. Note not only the growth in SaaS revenue but also the overall increase in gross margin. With 90% margins on the SaaS business, this is the one we want to grow.Source: SEC filings and IPO CandyOur IV estimate (below) suggests the shares may see $34 in the next year.When we say ""big and ugly"" we mean that in a good way. Enterprise IT is a very complex beast. Enterprises have legacy applications, individual and global architectures, multiple databases and transactional systems and need a high level of security, monitoring, and compliance.Being productive in such an environment is an ever-present challenge. Over the years there have been waves of technology in this space. In the very early days, we had ""Computer-Aided Software Engineering"" or CASE which spawned an array of tools and techniques that saw some adoption.In the 1990's this shifted to ""model-based development"" led by companies like Rational Software, which ultimately was acquired by IBM (NYSE:IBM). During the same period, large companies started to shift away from mainframes thanks to distributed software infrastructure from companies like BEA Systems which was acquired by Oracle.For the past decade, most new trends in development have been toward lighter frameworks, speed and ""agile"" development methods. At the same time, the infrastructure has shifted yet again to the cloud led by providers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (AWS) and now Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (Azure).A whole crop of ""cool"" infrastructure technology providers have come public including Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), MuleSoft (NYSE:MULE), MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB), Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN), Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA), Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM), Coupa (NASDAQ:COUP), Tableau (NYSE:DATA), ZScaler (NASDAQ:ZS) and New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) to name a few! These stocks have mostly done VERY well.Today enterprises are looking for ways to exploit the advantages of these new development technologies to increase productivity and be able to leverage the cloud for their own business needs.At a very high-level PVTL provides 1) a development framework and approach, 2) a set of development tools and 3) a deployment platform that works on top of mainstream services like AWS and Azure.If you want a more complete ""feel"" for the PVTL platform you can learn more by just skimming the portal to the documentation: Pivotal DocsAs long as Pivotal continues to grow their subscription revenue the investment case is strong. It's recurring and much higher margin than the services business which is more appropriately performed by large partners like Anderson Consulting, PWC, or IBM.Source: SEC FilingsInvestors worry about what Dell may do with the rest of the shares they own. This ""overhang"" may be part of the reason for the lack of post-IPO performance. The Dell stake also might make it harder for a natural acquirer like IBM or Oracle to make a move on PVTL.At these levels, PVTL offers attractive risk/reward - especially versus some of the other infrastructure software names that have moved up sharply and trade much closer or even above our IV estimates.Source: SEC Filings and IPO Candy"
4164628,103480,2018-04-22T09:56:32-04:00,"Pivotal Software priced its IPO at $15, raising $555 million.Shares opened for trading at $16.75, but sold off during the day to give up nearly all of their gains. Shares closed up only 4% at $15.73 on Day 1.This is the first software IPO of the year not to see double-digit jumps from the IPO price.Pivotal trades at 5.8x forward revenues, one of the lowest valuation multiples for a recent tech IPO.","Pivotal Software (NYSE:PVTL) was supposed to be one of two subsidiary companies to go public during the week of April 16. The other, AT&T's (NYSE:T) Latin America unit Vrio (VRIO), withdrew its IPO at the last minute citing unstable market conditions. It seems Vrio may have been prescient with its decision, as Pivotal Software's IPO on April 20 was met with the most subdued response among tech IPOs this year thus far.Pivotal initially priced its IPO in a range of $14-16, ultimately pricing right in the middle at $15. Every tech IPO this year thus far - Zuora (NYSE:ZUO), Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), and Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) has been able to raise their range and price above it. And after getting off to a modestly decent start, opening for trading at $16.75 (a 12% pop), Pivotal's shares gradually skidded throughout the course of the day to give up essentially all of its gains:PVTL Price data by YChartsAll told, it ended the day at a 4% pop - if you could even call it that. In comparison, Zscaler popped 43% in its IPO, Dropbox 36%, and Zscaler 106%. Among these recently public cloud peers, it seems that Pivotal is getting the short end of the stick.The lack of enthusiasm for Pivotal doesn't seem to be a function of distaste for its business model. The Pivotal Cloud Foundry, a subscription-based cloud PaaS platform, has amassed a top-tier customer base and is essentially in a similar business as MuleSoft (NYSE:MULE), which recently got bought out by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) for a stunning ~16x forward revenue multiple ($6.5 billion).Rather, it seems that investors are skittish regarding the company's relationship with Dell. Though Pivotal's S-1 filing explicitly states that none of the IPO proceeds will be channeled to Dell (which has been trying to come up with ways to pay down its massive ~$50 billion-plus debt load), and Pivotal management has been interviewed as saying that the company runs independently of Dell, it is still far from being a standalone company.To drive the point home further - as per Pivotal's final prospectus, Dell still owns 70% of the company post-IPO and 96% of the voting power, through its supervoting Class B shares. Pivotal is essentially a wholly controlled subsidiary with a small slice of its shares trading in the open market. Dell itself is a core piece of its business, providing Pivotal with a large source of its revenues. Taken from the ""Risks"" section of Pivotal's prospectus:All told, with a modest valuation, Pivotal Software looks like it might have some investment potential. However, investors might want to wait until the dust clears, as the shares may see rocky trading in the first couple of weeks. The uncertainty of Dell's relationship with Pivotal will likely always cast a cloud over this stock. I believe 6x EV/FY18 revenues, or a price target of $16.50, represents a fair value for Pivotal in the medium term. There will likely be an opportunity to buy if shares continue to sink to the $14-15 range.The softness of Pivotal Software's IPO is, more likely than not, due to Pivotal-specific concerns, and not a softening of demand for cloud/technology IPOs as a whole. As we look ahead to DocuSign (DOCU) and Smartsheet (SMAR) next month, we're likely to see the steam pick back up.Here's how the chips fell in the Pivotal IPO:The selling shareholder by the way is the industrial conglomerate GE (NYSE:GE), whose new CEO John Flannery is in the process of divesting assets and raising cash. GE is only selling a portion of its shares, however, and is holding on to approximately four-fifths of its stake. Also interesting is the fact that Ford Motors (NYSE:F) has 17.5 million shares in the company (worth just shy of $300 million).DellEMC and Silver Lake Partners, however, will still control 96% of the company's votes through their supervoting Class B shares. Here's how the cap table looks post-IPO:Source: Pivotal Software finalized prospectusWith 250.3 million shares outstanding in the company post-IPO, and shares currently trading at $15.73, Pivotal has attained a market cap of $3.94 billion on its first day of trading. After netting out the company's $20 million of debt, $73 million of cash on the balance sheet, and $465.8 million in net proceeds Pivotal expects to raise from the IPO (a net cash position of $519 million), the company has an enterprise value of $3.42 billion.Assuming 15% revenue growth for the coming year, Pivotal currently trades at 5.84x EV/FY18 revenues:Source: Author-created chart; market cap taken as of close of trading on April 20; data from public filingsAt first glance, Pivotal's valuation looks rather cheap, especially when considering that fellow PaaS company MuleSoft just got bought out at ~16x forward revenues. Another PaaS comp, Twilio (NYSE:TWLO), currently trades at 7x forward revenues:TWLO EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsA couple notes on Pivotal's valuation, however. The first observation is that Pivotal's growth over the past year has been rather erratic, making it difficult to pinpoint a revenue estimate for the coming year. Here's a look at Pivotal's string of quarterly results:Source: Pivotal Software finalized prospectusYou'll notice that the company saw 18% growth in the most recent quarter (Q4, ending February 2), 17% growth in Q3, 20% growth in Q2, but 38% growth in Q1. Pivotal could see another growth spike this year, or it could continue its decelerating trend - until we get clearer guidance from the company, assuming that growth decelerates to ~15% is a good starting point.The second observation to note is that unlike most software companies, Pivotal has a heavy tilt toward services revenues - the low-margin consulting fees it earns from its Pivotal Labs division. The good thing is that Pivotal is gradually tilting more of its revenue mix into its high-margin subscription revenues (56% of revenues in Q4, the highest historical subscription mix), but the fact that services revenues are done essentially at cost makes them far less valuable than subscription revenues. Case in point: in Q4, Pivotal generated $58.3 million in services revenue, but those revenues cost $49.8 million to produce, or a gross margin of less than 15%.Thus, a lower revenue multiple for Pivotal Software makes sense versus other PaaS companies that have nearly all subscription revenues. As I previously said, 6x forward revenues ($16.50) is a good benchmark for the stock. As the company tilts more into subscription revenues (but decelerates its growth in doing so), it could curry a higher valuation from the market.Don't buy Pivotal Software just yet, as it seems the stock needs some time to consolidate and get over initial jitters before finding a support level (much like Stitch Fix (NASDAQ:SFIX) when it went public last fall). Pivotal Software will probably likely never trade at the sky-high valuation multiples of other software IPOs (Dropbox is at 9x forward revenues; Zscaler is at 16x forward revenues) due to its services-heavy revenue and uncertain Dell relationship. However, Pivotal does have a compelling business that should be bought if the stock does dip low."
4162002,103480,2018-04-10T04:41:00-04:00,"Pivotal Software has updated its S-1 filing to specify an IPO of 33.1 million shares at $14-$16.
        Based on the midpoint of this range, this implies a $497 million IPO.
        Pivotal's initial pricing range implies a market cap of between $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion.
        This would value Pivotal Software at between 5.1x to 5.9x forward revenues, a fairly standard revenue multiple for a software company with its growth profile.","Pivotal Software (PVTL), a PaaS company and a subsidiary of Dell Technologies (DVMT), has updated its S-1 filing with its latest pricing range and share offering. The company initially filed its IPO registration a few weeks back, a bit more stealthily than most software companies of its size - with the market zooming in closely on the IPOs of Dropbox (DBX) and Spotify (SPOT), there wasn't much room for anything else in the IPO headlines.Nevertheless, with Pivotal's ~$510 million in revenues in FY18 (the calendar year ending February 2018), Pivotal Software is one of the larger software companies to go public. A typical high-growth software startup is typically only touting between $150-$200 million in revenues prior to its public debut - the approximate hurdle at which bankers typically counsel companies to have crossed before making a public offering. With Pivotal Software offering 33.1 million shares at an initial pricing range of $14-$16, it's indicating an IPO of $497 million at the midpoint of that price - a fairly sizable deal. The issue with Pivotal Software isn't necessarily its valuation - which we'll cover in the next section, as an update to my original article covering Pivotal Software's business and growth trajectory. The initial IPO pricing actually sets a fair valuation for the company, one that opportunistic investors can still gain from. The issue is with Dell.As a reminder, Dell is doing everything it can to try to cull down its $50 billion debt load, which with the Trump tax bill's new limitation on interest deductibility to just 30% of EBITDA, is no longer optimal in its capital structure. The IPO of Pivotal Software was initially assumed to be a fundraising tactic for Dell's debt - though we note that a ~$500 million raise would barely scratch the surface of Dell's debt mountain.In Pivotal Software's S-1 filing, its ""use of proceeds"" section nullifies that hypothesis, saying that all proceeds raised will be used internally within Pivotal Software. That's a huge plus for those contemplating an investment in Pivotal. Yet even though Pivotal's assets aren't being gutted just yet, the association with Dell currently leaves a black mark across all its public subsidiaries. VMware (VMW) investors, in particular, are extremely flippant about Dell's proposed ""reverse merger"" that would absorb VMware and use its cash flows to pay down Dell's debt. Secureworks (SCWX), a cybersecurity company that's also majority Dell-owned, recently tanked due to a severe decline in gross margins and poor guidance. The poor performance of Dell subsidiaries in the public markets as of late - as well as the uncertainty that Dell could do something adverse in the future, as it's doing to VMware - is sure to cast a question mark over Pivotal's IPO. After Pivotal Software sells its 33.1 million Class A shares to the public, there will be 74.8 million total Class A shares and 175.5 million Class B shares in the share pool, according to Pivotal's refreshed S-1. This makes for total outstanding common stock of 250.3 million shares.Class A and Class B shares have equal economic weighting, but Class B shares (which will be 100% owned by Dell) are supervoting shares with 10 votes, whereas Class A shares will have one. This gives Dell ownership of 70% of the company, but 96% of the voting power. Pivotal will essentially be a publicly traded and wholly controlled subsidiary, with other investors just along for the ride.With 250.3 million common shares outstanding post-offering (the IPO is proposing to sell 13% of the stock into public float), Pivotal Software will have a launching market cap of between $3.5 to $4.0 billion, depending on where (and if) it prices within its given range of $14-$16.The midpoint of this range gives Pivotal a market cap of $3.76 billion, and is shown in the valuation table below:Source: author-created chart; data from public filingsNetting out Pivotal Software's $73.0 million of balance sheet cash and giving credit to the $465.8 million in net proceeds Pivotal expects to raise from the IPO (as stated in the S-1, and based on midpoint pricing of $15), and adding the company's $20 million of debt, Pivotal Software is proposing to go public at an enterprise value of $3.24 billion.If we assume Pivotal Software grows revenues by 15% in FY19 (last quarter revenues grew by 18% y/y, so this seems a reasonable deceleration. Note that total revenues are growing slower than Pivotal's subscription revenues, which grew 58% y/y last quarter and are increasingly becoming the focus of the business), we arrive at an estimated forward revenue of $585.9 million.This puts Pivotal Software at a 5.53x EV/FY19 revenue multiple, with low and high ends of the $14-$16 pricing range implying a valuation spectrum between 5.1x-5.9x forward revenues.This is a fair multiple for a software company with Pivotal's growth profile. Other PaaS companies like Twilio (TWLO) also trade at roughly 6x forward revenues, though Twilio has a much faster growth rate. For an IPO, however, Pivotal's initial pricing seems a bit aggressive and will probably produce less of a ""pop"" on the first day of trading than usual. Companies like Dropbox and Zscaler (ZS) were initially priced at lower than 5x revenues (though the initial range was ultimately extended, and the stocks have soared since). This further underlines the point that Pivotal strays from a traditional startup IPO, and Dell/Pivotal are trying to raise the maximum amount of capital possible.Though Pivotal Software has an attractive financial profile, its pricing range doesn't leave much of a margin of error for early investors. I predict that Pivotal Software's IPO - already priced so closely to a ""fair valuation"" - won't produce as big of a pop as other technology IPOs this year, especially with the cloud of Dell over Pivotal's shoulder.Of course, Pivotal's pricing range is still fluid - it could still lower or raise that range, or price outside of that range altogether. An IPO should be imminent within the next 2-3 weeks, so we'll know for sure shortly. But at the current moment, I don't think I'll be tripping over myself to buy a slice of Pivotal when the Dell-related unknowns are so overwhelming."
4163782,102994,2018-04-18T14:13:53-04:00,"Pivotal Software, largely owned and controlled by Dell, will begin trading on the NYSE April 20. It aims to raise around $500 million by selling 33.1 million shares at $14-$16.Money raised by Pivotal will stay with Pivotal. But the IPO provides a way for cash strapped Dell and investor Silver Lake Partners to monetize at a later date.Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners owns 24% of Dell and a substantial stake in Pivotal. Analysts say that Silver Lake is looking for better returns on its Dell-related investments.In February, Dell filed form 8-K with the SEC stating that it is exploring strategic alternatives to monetizing and optimizing its structure. The impact on Pivotal is unknowable.Pivotal's Cloud Foundry platform which helps enterprise software developers build products  that run on private and most major public clouds is gaining customers quickly and may be as important in the future as Oracle and IBM are today.","Pivotal Software (PVTL) is expected to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. When the startup was spun off from EMC in 2013, the New York Times called it a well-financed competitor to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services. It boasted $1 billion working capital on its balance sheet and 1600 employees on day one. The majority of its shares were owned by EMC, VMware (NYSE:VMW) and General Electric (NYSE:GE). Since then it has brought on Michael Dell, Dell Technologies (DVMT), private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, (instrumental in funding Dell’s acquisition of EMC,) Ford (NYSE:F), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as investors. As we approach the IPO, Pivotal's major shareholders are Michael Dell, Dell Technologies, Silver Lake Partners Investment Funds and EMC each with 351,028,548 beneficially owned shares according to the S-1 filing. Other significant shareholders (greater than 5%) include VMWare (VMW) (also controlled by Dell), ""An Affiliate of General Electric,"" and the Ford Motor Company which own 88,416,325 shares, 38,830,152 shares and 35,033,418 shares respectively. Of these, GE has said it would be selling part of its allotment in the IPO.It's worth noting that Pivotal has two classes of shares, Class A and Class B. Though they are valued the same from a financial perspective, Class B shares, which will be owned only by Dell, have 10 votes per share while Class A shares will have one vote per share.From the S-1:In other words, Pivotal will be a ""controlled company"" as defined by the corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange. That being said, Pivotal's S-1 states,This was likely stated to assuage would-be investors' fears of the opposite; however, Pivotal, and even Dell, have no control over what Silver Lake might do after the IPO if it wants to reduce its investment in Dell and the companies it controls.In January 2018, Bloomberg News reported that Silver Lake Partners may be seeking an exit from Dell. It goes to follow that if Silver Lake decided to sell a significant amount, or all, of its Pivotal shares, at once, the stock price would likely tumble.Dell went from being a $7 billion private tech company to one of that became markedly bigger when it acquired data center conglomerate EMC in 2015 for $67 billion. Needless to say, it did a good amount of borrowing. Dell seemed to be comfortable with making payments on its debt until recently. Things changed when the new tax law took effect earlier this year. Instead of being able to deduct actual interest expenses, it can now deduct interest expenses limited at 30 percent of its income. Moreover, according to Credit Insights, Dell has a new, unanticipated, additional tax bill (on cash and other assets held overseas) of around $480 million per year over the next 5 years, and as much as $6 billion over time.These new taxes affect Dell's financial agility. While it's reasonable to believe that Dell wouldn't want to take from, or negatively affect, its young offspring (Pivotal), even if things got tough, the mere possibility of that happening should spook investors. We have seen this happen when it comes to the relationship between Dell and VMWare over and over again.Were it not for the aforementioned, Pivotal's success in positioning itself as ""the platform on which modern enterprise software will be built"" is extremely attractive. The tools it offers on its open source based Cloud Foundry Platform-as-a-Service which enable developers to build applications that work across, and on, all major public clouds -- Amazon Web Services, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure -- and company-owned private clouds are almost unrivaled. They are used by six of the 10 largest automobile manufacturers, seven of the top 10 banks, and half of the 10 largest insurance companies. Pivotal, which was spun-off from EMC, in 2013 has grown quickly. Its revenues have grown from $280.9 million in FYE 2016, to 416.3 million in FYE 2017, to $509.4 million in FYE 2018.Its profits have grown impressively from $93.5 million in FYE 2016, to $181.9 in FYE 2017 to $281 million in FYE 2018. Its gross margins have grown from $33 million to $44 million to $55 million from 2016-2018.Here are the vitals: Source: Pivotal's S-1Though Pivotal is still losing money, it's to be expected of a 4 year old start-up. (There are articles indicating that Pivotal was founded much earlier, but they are confusing its origins from consulting company Pivotal Labs which EMC acquired in 2012.)Pivotal would be an easy buy on its opening day buy if the price was right ($14-$15) and the possibilities of Silver Lake Partners, and maybe even Dell, flooding the market with shares over the next year weren't so great. As it is, it's probably worth waiting for that to happen and buying the stock at that time at a bargain. Pivotal's Cloud Foundry has a solid chance of becoming the foundational platform on which modern applications are built and being based on open source software it presents an excellent alternative to anything AWS, Google Cloud Platform Microsoft and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) have to offer. Tempting as it is, I'd recommend staying on the sidelines for now."

Investors appear comfortable to attach a +6 times sales multiple for the company despite the still sizeable losses and rapidly slowing revenue growth, as the business operates in a very competitive field.The modest growth and losses make that I am not yet attracted to a perhaps reasonable 6 times sales, as Pivotal is operating in a very competitive environment, as is really visible in the declining revenue growth numbers. This makes Pivotal an easy avoid for me, given the dynamics of slowing growth, fierce competition, and still sizeable losses.Pivotal has developed an enterprise software platform, which is very much scalable in terms of applications and users. The company calls this platform the Pivotal Cloud Foundry, basically aimed at accelerating development through reducing complexity, costs and time, while the outcomes are easily scalable.The Palo Alto company was formed in 2012 and was controlled by EMC Corporation at the time. In 2013, even GE (NYSE:GE) took a 10% stake at a valuation of little over a billion dollar for the relatively small company at the time. After Dell (DVMT) acquired EMC in 2016, it became the majority owner of Pivotal. Following the IPO, Dell will continue to hold (through its subsidiary VMware) some 175.5 million shares in Pivotal, close to 70% of the outstanding stock.The rollout of the PCF at major customers has significant benefits for those customers, including massive gains in developer productivity, shorter release cycles, and improved security and reliability. Hence blue chip names like Boeing (NYSE:BA), Bosch, and T-Mobile US (NASDAQ:TMUS) use the services of the company, with many more customers across a wide spectrum of industries using the services as well.Pivotal priced the offering at $15 per share, right at the middle of the preliminary offering range. A total of 37 million shares were offered of which 33.1 million by the company itself, which is set to raise nearly $500 million as a result. With little over 250 million shares outstanding following the IPO, Pivotal is awarded a $3.75 billion valuation at the offer price. Trading at around $15.50 per share, that valuation has risen towards the $3.9 billion mark.So, what is the underlying business delivering upon to justify this valuation? Pivotal reported revenues of $280.9 million in 2015 (actually the book year ended in February of 2016) on which it lost $273 million on an operating basis. About a third of sales were generated from subscription revenues, a bit more sticky and predictable than the recorded service revenues.The company saw decent growth in 2016 as total revenues rose by 48% to $416.3 million, while operating losses fell to $227 million. The actual dollar amount reduction in losses was comfortable as operating leverage was even more impressive on a relative basis, after the company lost a dollar for every dollar in sales in 2015. The past year showed a continuation of favourable trends, although revenue growth slowed down a bit.Total revenues rose by ""just"" 22% in 2017 as service revenues were actually down, which makes that subscription revenues now surpass service revenues. The company reduced operating losses further to $168 million, equivalent to a third of the reported revenues of $509 million. Note that total deferred revenue balances grew by $75 million as subscription-based revenue models understate the reported growth in the near term, with sales only being recognised over the lifetime of the contract, instead of upfront.That means that the $3.90 billion valuation, which includes a net cash position of $538 million, really works out to a $3.36 billion valuation of the operating assets, still equivalent to little over 6.5 times sales. With the company still bleeding quite a bit of money and revenue growth having slowed down quite a bit last year, I cannot automatically say that I am very attracted to this valuation.Looking a little further into the growth trends in 2017, I am not automatically getting more comfortable with the investment thesis. First quarter sales were up 37% as growth slowed down to 20% in Q2. Growth dipped at 17% in Q3 before stabilising at 18% in the final quarter of the year. The slowing growth trend and fact that operating losses mostly came down in the first half of the year are not very comfortable signs. Given the extent of the losses, I find it hard to award a >6 times sales multiple on a loss-making software business whose sales growth has surely slowed down quite a bit to levels in the higher teens.Pivotal operates and competes in a crowded market with competition coming from many angels. Traditional software names like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) can be counted as competition. Competition furthermore comes from open-cloud names like Red Hat (NYSE:RHT), as well as cloud solutions provided by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others.While the valuation is a key risk factor, there are many other risks including losses, a dual class voting structure, fierce competition, slower growth, and reliance on key sales partners DellEMC and VMware (NYSE:VMW) (which still own a majority stake in the business). Other risks include that of motivated sellers, notably Dell and GE, which now have an opportunity to exit (part of) their investment."
4162050,104326,2018-04-10T08:36:57-04:00,"The tech world is engulfed in fury surrounding data privacy, but Pivotal Software is nonetheless charging forward with an IPO worth some $100 million.The company has posted net losses every year, but its losses have been shrinking while revenue streams soar.Much of the profits from its IPO could go towards Dell, Pivotal’s parent company, which is also the majority-shareholder.","Pivotal Software (PVTL:NASDAQ), a business software development firm, has filed to go public in a move that could generate up to $100 million for the company. Here are the specifics behind Pivotal Software’s recent filing for an IPO, and how it might play out as the tech sector bounces back from a relatively quiet 2017.Up until recently, 2018 has been quite the year for tech companies; firms like Dropbox (DBX:NASDAQ) have enjoyed massive amounts of attention surrounding their market debuts, meaning it stands to reason that Pivotal Software can enjoy a glut of media coverage before it goes public, too.Investors will likely be concerned with Pivotal's market fundamentals, like how well it’s been expanding its operations in recent years, and for good reasons; market fundamentals remain vastly more important in the long-term when measuring a company’s worth. So, how does Pivotal Software hold up to financial scrutiny?According to filings made with the SEC for its IPO, Pivotal Software is doing relatively well; the company continues to post net losses, but those losses have seriously narrowed in recent years and its revenue stream has been consistently growing like a beard oil company for some time. For instance, Pivotal Software saw revenue figures leap from a relatively meager $280 million in fiscal year 2016 to a more sizable $509 million through February of 2018, meaning the company is clearly having some success when it comes to scooping up more paying customers.If Pivotal Software can keep those revenue figures soaring, it will be on the right track for success, but it needs to continue to cut down its losses, too. After all, the company posted some $164 million in net losses for the latest fiscal year, a sizable sum, though significantly down from the nearly $233 million in losses it had posted in the year before. If investors are looking for a tech company to throw their financial weight behind, but are refusing to be sold until they see meaningful financial results, they may be lured in by Pivotal Software’s evidently staunch aim to get out of the red and start turning a profit.Despite the fact that its IPO could bring in some $100 million, Pivotal Software hasn’t wanted for funding in the past. The company has privately garnered more than $1.7 billion in the past, meaning it will likely have the resources it needs to keep expanding in the immediate future. Its IPO could provide it with some additional capital, too, though a large portion of its proceeds are likely to go to Dell, Pivotal’s parent company that’s currently shackled by debt.With Dell being the parent company of Pivotal, tech investors can likely rest assured that it is in relatively experienced hands, meaning they don’t have to fear about reckless executives igniting PR fiascos that cause stock figures to dip. Furthermore, the company has been forging some seriously lucrative contracts for itself, and will likely continue to expand its footprint in the business sector after its IPO.For instance, Pivotal’s CEO has talked up the company’s impressive partnerships with some Fortune 500 companies; Pivotal’s services are relied upon by 6 of the biggest auto manufacturers in the US, and the company retains the business of half of the 10 largest insurance companies in the country. With friends like that, Pivotal Software has serious room to gain street cred among other behemoth companies in need of a cloud service platform, and could make serious inroads in the future that help it start churning out profits.Investors looking for a tech stock to back will want to keep a close eye on Pivotal Software; while the tech world is currently being engulfed in a media-furor surrounding data privacy, companies like Pivotal are showing that their market debuts are still impressive gambits worthy of attention, and the company is rapidly heading towards profitable waters. As long as Pivotal Software successfully cuts down on its existing losses, expect the company to make a big splash during its IPO."

4158851,103480,2018-03-26T09:23:28-04:00,"Pivotal Software, an enterprise PaaS platform, filed for an IPO in late March.Its original filing has a $100 million deal as a placeholder, but with the company's $509.4 million of revenues (at a 22% growth rate), it will likely be much higher.Half of Pivotal's revenues are derived from subscriptions, which are highly prized on Wall Street. Subscription revenues grew a stunning 73% y/y in FY17.The company is essentially owned entirely by Dell.Pivotal's IPO was originally seen as a means to pay down Dell's ~$50 billion of debt, though its filing claims that IPO proceeds will not be transferred to Dell.","On the very same day that Dropbox (DBX) went public in its flashy $756 million IPO - one of the most heavily-anticipated deals since the launch of Snap (SNAP) in March 2017 - Pivotal Software, an enterprise infrastructure play that is mostly owned by Dell-EMC, quietly filed for its own public offering.Perhaps one of the most surprising elements of the Pivotal filing was its following claim in the ""Use of Proceeds"" section of its original S-1 filing:Dell (DVMT) has been sagging under the weight of ~$50 billion in debt, borne of its $67 billion mega-merger with EMC in 2016. With the new Trump tax bill limiting interest deductibility to just 30% of EBITDA, observers have noted that Dell is under high pressure to begin culling down its debt load as it is no longer the tax-optimal capital structure. Selling Pivotal's stock to the market via an IPO was speculated as one of the strategies Dell was considering to pay down debt, as was an IPO of Dell itself.The quasi-separation of Pivotal as a standalone company (though it will still be majority-owned and controlled by Dell after the IPO) is probably a good thing for the company. Pivotal's subscription business, Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) is rapidly growing, with 73% y/y growth in FY17 to a staggering >$500 million in revenues. Very few software companies ever reach that scale, and fewer still are still growing at nearly 2x when they reach that size - perhaps that's the benefit of having the considerable resources of Dell-EMC funding the operation. Software companies' growth, after all, is more limited by the capacity of its direct sales force than anything else, and Dell-EMC has a literal army of salespeople.Though many of the details surrounding the Pivotal IPO are still unknown, this article will cover the key topics and nuggets gleaned from the company's S-1 filing so that investors can be prepared with information ahead of the offering, which is expected some time in April.Pivotal's space, PaaS (platform-as-a-service), is a hot one to be in right now. This is true from both a technical and financial standpoint. From the technical side, as more and more SaaS companies plow the markets and saturate every single application field imaginable, more attention has been turned to the platform services that power these applications. PaaS offerings tend to be more unique than SaaS, and has the added benefit of having a reputation for being a sticky subscription business. Once installed, it's difficult to uproot the platform that underlies all the applications you use to run your business.That's not to say that Pivotal isn't up against any meaningful competition. Its list of blue-chip competitors is endless, from IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) (which Pivotal dismisses as ""legacy"" technology providers) to more cloud-friendly rivals like Red Hat (RHT) as well as public cloud providers like Amazon AWS (AMZN) and Google Cloud Platform. Each of these vendors puts a different spin on platform capabilities and application services. Pivotal, however, has the unique advantage of being a high-growth company housed within a much larger entity (Dell-EMC) with large resources. It packs the punch and innovation of a startup, with the checkbook of a blue chip.From a financial standpoint, PaaS as a space has also been heating up since Salesforce's (CRM) recent $6.5 billion acquisition of MuleSoft (MULE). With that deal valued at 15.8x MuleSoft's estimated forward-twelve months' revenues, it marks one of the most expensive acquisitions in the software space and a 36% premium to MuleSoft's trading price prior to the announcement.Salesforce's bid for MuleSoft is a huge acknowledgement of the criticality of solid PaaS services. The enterprise platform that a corporation uses is the beating heart of its technology infrastructure, the underlying skeleton on which all of its applications are powered and developed. Owning this platform - which Salesforce sought to do in its purchase of MuleSoft, which connects different applications together via APIs - gets you to the center of a customer's cloud presence, and once there, it's difficult to uproot.Assuming a 20% growth rate on Pivotal's $509 million of revenues, if Pivotal were acquired for the same enterprise value multiple as MuleSoft, it would be worth a massive $9.6 billion - and while it's unlikely to touch that valuation (unlike MuleSoft, only half of Pivotal's revenue base is subscription), it's useful to keep that value in mind. PaaS is valuable.Pivotal's core business likes in two primary services: its subscription-based Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) platform, for which customers pay a recurring fee to use; and Pivotal Labs, a consultative service in which Pivotal personnel ""co-develops"" IT infrastructures with clients. Pivotal, in its S-1 filing, believes the two services to be highly complementary (the availability and quality of support from a service like Pivotal Labs often helps drive the purchase decision for a product like Pivotal Cloud Foundry). The company does, however, place its emphasis on its higher-margin subscription business.The primary benefit of the Pivotal solution is a ""cloud-native"" platform. According to Pivotal, most software developers are so weighed down by inefficient legacy infrastructure and technologies that they spend only 30% of their working time writing good code (a big red flag in Silicon Valley, where high-quality engineers can command one-percenter salaries). A good platform base, in theory, not only improves the end product but also improves the efficiency of a company's investment in its engineering personnel.The following diagram illustrates the basic differences between Pivotal's solution and legacy infrastructures that aren't built for the cloud:Figure 1. Pivotal Cloud Foundry architectureSource: Pivotal Software S-1 filingInstead of having applications designed in silos with separate legacy infrastructures servicing them each alone, PCF allows customers to apply its infrastructure across an array of app development environments. According to the company's S-1, PCF "" integrates an expansive set of critical, modern software technologies delivered continuously to provide a turnkey cloud-native platform.""Also, being designed with the cloud in mind - which means customers are going to want services to be available and connectable across an array of outside providers (the opposite of legacy Oracle's approach, which tries to lock customers inside its own ecosystem; though with Oracle's migration to the cloud, this is changing), Pivotal is inter-operable with popular software development tools within AWS, Google Cloud, OpenStack (an open-source IaaS platform), Azure, and other services. Pivotal's software is itself based on open source codes layered with proprietary software.Pivotal - the product of a collaboration between EMC and VMware, which are now both owned by Dell - has grown substantially from nothing in the four years it's been around. (Though again, this is not to Pivotal's own credit - it's not quite correct to classify Pivotal as a four-year-old startup when it's funded by Dell). The following timeline from Pivotal's S-1 showcases its growth to 319 subscription customers in the four short years of its existence:Source: Pivotal Software S-1 filingWith spending on PaaS services expected to grow at a 22% CAGR from $16 billion in 2018 to $29 billion by 2021 (according to Gartner research cited in Pivotal's filings), the company still has plenty of market opportunity left to penetrate.Here's a closer look at Pivotal Software's financials:Figure 2. Pivotal Software FY18 resultsSource: Pivotal Software S-1 filingPivotal has sustained incredible revenue growth in the past few years despite its scale, as is evident from the financials above. In FY18, Pivotal grew revenues 22% y/y to $509.4 million, that alone making it one of the largest enterprise software companies in the market.From these financials, it's also clear why subscription revenues are Pivotal's primary focus - and why Wall Street prizes them much higher than other revenue streams. Pivotal's subscription revenues grew 73% y/y to $259.0 million (its subscription revenue stream alone makes it larger than most SaaS companies, and its 73% growth rate at that scale is also astounding), while its consulting services revenues from Pivotal Labs actually saw a slight decline to $250.4 million.From a margin perspective, however, this is a benefit. Subscription revenues carry a massive 88% gross margin, while services revenues are essentially performed at near-cost, providing only 21% gross margins. This margin gap illustrates why subscription revenues are more valuable, and why companies like Pivotal will offer consulting services basically at cost in order to win more profitable subscription business. Not only that, subscription revenues are recurring revenue streams - and with hard-to-replace PaaS services, these customers can be gold mines for years and years. Even small deployments can, over time, lead to million-dollar revenue streams (Pivotal's 319 customers contributing to a $509 million revenue base implies that its average annual revenue per subscription customer is nearly $2 million, a hugely profitable situation to be in). Its net expansion rate over the past twelve months, a measure of how a customer has expanded spend on the platform since deployment, was a cool 158%.As a result of the mix shift into subscription revenues and away from lower-margin services revenues, Pivotal's gross margin expanded to 55% in FY18, a huge leap from just 44% in FY17. As the mix continues to tilt in favor of subscription, Pivotal's gross margin will see further improvement, though the rate of this shift will have a natural slowdown as subscriptions begin to overtake the majority of Pivotal's revenues.Large sales and marketing costs, a salient feature of just about any enterprise software company, are also prominent in Pivotal, consuming 43% of its revenues (just because Pivotal has access to Dell-EMC's sales force and its ISVs doesn't rescue it from seeing those expenses hit its income statement). Largely as a result of prioritizing growth over profits, Pivotal is still showing a GAAP net loss of -$163.5 million, or a -32% net margin. All told, however, this isn't too dire of a loss relative to other high-growth software companies.The success of Zscaler's (NASDAQ:ZS) IPO (+106% on opening day) as well as Dropbox's IPO (+36%) have opened the door for more software companies to test the IPO waters in 2018, despite rocky trading in both February and March. With such a robust financial profile and a strong PaaS-based subscription business, Pivotal Software presents a compelling new opportunity for the markets.With valuation as yet unknown, it's too early to render a positive or negative opinion on the stock, but having all the information handy prior to the IPO is the best way to be prepared in making a rational decision. More to come as more of the offering details become known."

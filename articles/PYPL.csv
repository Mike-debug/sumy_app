In the present overvalued stock market, this leaves PayPal's stock cheaply valued, and worthwhile considering.Source: author's calculations; **mid-point company guidancePayPal reported strong results and raised guidance on its EPS guidance. For 2020, PayPal's EPS guidance is now pointing towards a growth rate of 27%–28% versus approximately 25% growth it was previously guiding for at the end of Q3 2019.The graphic above largely speaks for itself: not only is PayPal still growing strongly but it's actually picking up top-line momentum in 2020. Yet the stock still sold off after hours.Every financial outlet wishes to report its own rationale for why stocks are reporting strong results and guidance and yet the stocks are selling off. And every investor wants a clear and concise (preferably snappy), reason for a cause and effect during these earnings reports.Typically, I do offer my own cause and effect, as in many cases it's quite obvious. However, in PayPal's case, I can't find any tangible blemishes with this report that would make me concerned.What I would say, is that tech stocks have carried the bull market of 2020, and that many stocks have been priced in on the expectation that they are immune to the underlying economy. Thus, investors have been willing to bid up these assets, even as the detachment between Wall Street and Main Street continues to widen.Venmo is PayPal's digital wallet. Venmo is showing no signs of slowing down, as its Total Payment Volume was up 61%. What's more, looking out to 2021, its revenues are forecast to reach $900 million.Furthermore, in 2021, Venmo will start to be accretive to PayPal's consolidated bottom line.Even if we extrapolate Venmo's growth rate, PayPal is unlikely to segment out its Venmo operations for some time, most likely until Venmo makes up 10% of its consolidated revenues.Nonetheless, this is a very strong opportunity for PayPal, and one that investors are not affording enough consideration to.Does the market view PayPal as a growth opportunity or as a mature fintech company?This may sound like semantics, but it has wider implications on how the market would be willing to price PayPal.Given that PayPal has never been a fast revenue growth company in the past, I would be willing to conjecture that taken together with its guidance, not only is PayPal still a growth company, but its growth rates are actually picking up momentum.On the other hand, if PayPal is viewed by investors as a mature company, then, given that in Q3 2019 PayPal's free cash flow reached $923 million, whereas this quarter its free cash flow was $479 million -- a 48% reduction y/y -- this is quite a meaningful reduction.Source: Q3 2020 Investor PresentationIndeed, not only is this a meaningful reduction but I would posit that this level of free cash flow reduction is made worse based on the fact that during the past 4 consecutive quarters, its free cash flow has been rapidly increasing.Looking ahead towards full-year 2020, PayPal is still expecting its free cash flow to be more than $5 billion. This brings me to discuss its valuation.On the surface, the market is slightly shaky right now, in a sell-first ask-questions-later approach. However, as we look out to 2021, PayPal is expected to be slowing down from its top performance in 2020, down to approximately 20% run-rates over the next six months.Source: SA Premium ToolsThis appears to me to be at odds with PayPal's own expectations made during the earnings call:Consequently, I suspect that PayPal will be able to plow ahead in 2021, growing at slightly faster rates than the market is presently pricing in. Consider this, as we look out to 2021, PayPal is being priced at less than 9x its 2021 revenues.This single digit 2021 sales multiple appears to me to be quite low, for a company that is likely to continue growing its top-line in the ballpark of 22%-24%.This sales multiple is meaningfully lower than Square's, as that company's adjusted growth rate is close to 20x its 2021 revenues.PayPal continues to tick along, with strong top-line growth. Towards the bottom line, PayPal expects its free cash flow to be more than $5 billion, putting the stock trading for just 41x this year's free cash flow.Even though the stock sold off after hours, this was largely a spotless quarter, backed by strong guidance for the quarter ahead."
4384469,105096,2020-11-03T10:45:12-05:00,"PayPal shares fell 5.7% in after-market trading last night, after releasing Q3 results that represented one of its best quarters - a Buy opportunity.
        PayPal gained 15.2m new accounts during Q3, its second best quarter (after Q2 2020); Total Payment Volume was up 38% year-on-year.
        Revenue grew 25% year-on-year and EBIT grew 45%, despite short-term headwinds from COVID disruption in Travel & Events and from eBay.
        Management now expects to see a 27-28% EPS growth in 2020 and to raise mid-term EPS CAGR to above the previous 20% figure.
        With shares at $177.00, our Base Case forecasts a total return of 72% (18.8% annualised) in just over 3 years. Upside Case is even better.","We review PayPal’s (PYPL) Q3 2020 results released after markets closed yesterday; shares fell 5.7% to $177 in post-market trading, despite the results representing one of its best quarters - we believe this is a Buy opportunity for investors.Since we upgraded our rating on PayPal to Buy in May, shares have gained 27.1%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 as well as other payment players including Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and American Express (AXP): Our May upgrade was based on our view that PayPal's business has been permanently accelerated by COVID-19, and we believed that:We re-iterated our Buy rating in August, after Q2 results showed a record quarter and management began to hint at revising PayPal's medium-term EPS CAGR outlook above the previous 20% figure. We set out two scenarios in our return forecasts, building on PayPal's 2020 EPS outlook:Q3 2020 results were in line with our long-term investment case, though short-term headwinds in Q4 and 2021 may have triggered the sell-off.Q3 was the second best quarter in PayPal's history in accounts acquisition (behind Q2 2020), with 15.2m Net New Actives (""NNAs""), taking total active accounts to 361m, up 22% year-on-year: Encouragingly, management stated that NNA figures were “very consistent” across Q3, continuing at the same pace at approx. 5m each month, ""no fall off, no pull forward"", which suggests its momentum is continuing.Total Payment Volume (""TPV"") rose 36% year-on-year (excluding currency, otherwise 38%) in Q3 to $247bn, accelerating from Q1 and Q2, and much faster-growing than in 2016-19; 2020 TPV growth is now expected to be 30%:Within TPV, Peer-to-Peer volume rose 47% to $74bn, including Venmo volume rising 61% to $44bn. Cross-Border Trade volume rose 27% to $40bn. Travel & Events volume was down 40%, as the recovery seen in Travel in June and July was not sustained (Travel & Events was more than 10% of TPV in 2019).eBay (EBAY) volume rose 15%, but was only 7% of total TPV in Q3 (down from 9% in Q2). Its operational agreement with PayPal came to an end in July, and its planned transition away has happened faster than expected. Revenue grew 25% in Q3 2020, much higher than the historic 2016-19 range but the same as Q2; full-year revenue growth is now expected to be 21-22%:Total revenues grew less than volume due to a number of headwinds, included the faster-than-expected loss of high-margin eBay volumes and weaker value-add services. Honey contributed 1.5 ppt to revenue growth, but other value-add services have been weaker. Transaction revenues grew 29% year-on-year in Q3 (excluding currency), and 31% excluding eBay, which was approx. 4 ppt higher than Q2. Transaction revenue grew less than TPV due to a lower take rate, from both a mix shift and a reduction in currency hedge revenues. PayPal's take rate has been falling due to a mix shift to peer-to-peer and billpay, which carry lower rates, but they also have lower expense rates; PayPal's loss rate has also been improving thanks to better technology and management. PayPal’s overall transaction take rate after expenses and losses has been falling, but only slowly - it was 1.25% in Q3 2020, vs. 1.34% in Q2 and 1.31% in Q3 2019:PayPal's Q3 2020 non-GAAP EBIT was up 45% year-on-year (excluding currency); including currency, it rose from $1.03bn to $1.49bn, with EBIT margin expanding 377 bps to 27.2%:EBIT has benefited from strong revenue growth and operational leverage, even as non-transaction expenses grew 22% year-on-year due to investments. Management stated that the margin on incremental revenues in Q3 was 48% excluding acquisitions.Q3 2020 Non-GAAP EBIT margin was higher year-on-year, but would be lower than Q2 excluding credit reserve builds, as PayPal started adding some of the $300m of incremental investments announced at Q2 results onto the P&L:During Q3 results, PayPal discussed a number of new products and services which will help drive revenue growth in 2021 and beyond.The Venmo credit card was launched in October and will be fully rolled out in Q1 2021. Including this, Venmo i expected to ""approach” $900m of revenues in 2021, and to reach profitability in 2022.“Buy Now Pay Later” has been launched in France “several months ago” and just launched in the U.S. and the U.K., and PayPal has “just rolled that out to the vast majority of our consumer base”.The QR code roll-out has continued, as PayPal moves into physical retail. So far it has signed 10 retailers (including CVS (CVS) and Nike (NKE)), and 20 channel partners and point of sale providers (including VeriFone). The signed deals would enable PayPal's capabilities at “millions” of locations, and the company expects to have 500k small and micro merchants with QR capabilities by the end of 2020.In cryptocurrencies, as previously announced, PayPal will allow holders to buy, sell and hold them, first in the U.S. and then in international markets on the Venmo app in H1 2021. It will “rapidly move” at the start of 2021 and allow consumers to use crypto to shop across all 28m PayPal merchants.As a result of the above and other new offerings, both the Venmo and PayPal apps will undergo a “fundamental transformation” to increase their functionality and integrate. This will start in 2021 and be mostly complete by end of the year.2020 guidance was amended slightly, with ex-currency revenue growth now 21-22% (was 22%); non-GAAP EPS growth is now 27-28% (was 25%); FCF (management definition) is still expected to be more than $5bn:However, standalone Q4 2020 guidance has a wide range (compared to single points before) and implies a slowdown from Q3. Management described this as “prudent”, and also attributed some headwinds to a faster-than-expected eBay transition and macroeconomic challenges:For 2021, the eBay transition is expected to bring “more pronounced” headwinds in revenue growth and transaction margin, but ""largely contained to that period"" and will result in faster revenue growth thereafter.This implied uncertainty around Q4 2020 and 2021 is likely the key reason behind the adverse share price reaction after the results.For the medium term, the outlook is much more positive. The CFO explicitly stated that PayPal will be raising its medium-term outlook from pre-COVID levels at the investor day in February:The previous outlook was for a 20% EPS CAGR, but digital payments have clearly accelerated under COVID-19, and PayPal is confident of sustaining the now higher level of growth. Including its 2020 outlook, PayPal has now delivered 4 consecutive years of non-GAAP EPS growth of at least 25%.At $177.00 in post-market trading, on 2019 financials, PayPal shares are trading at a 57.2x P/E (on non-GAAP EPS); the FCF Yield is 1.1%. Due to the size of its growth and operational leverage, on 2020 guidance, the valuation drops to a 44.8x P/E and a 1.7% FCF Yield:With its large, long-term volume growth run-way and operational leverage, PayPal continues to deserves a P/E multiple of at least 45x in our view.For our illustrative return forecasts, we increase our 2020 EPS slightly, in line with the new outlook, but leave other assumptions unchanged.Our Base Case illustrative calculations assume the following:At $177.00, the exit price of $304.90 implies a total return of 72% (18.8% annualised) in just over 3 years in the Base Case:Our Upside Case assumes EPS growth still decelerates, but remains above 20%, and an exit P/E of 55x. This gives an exit price of $401.46, implying a total return of 126% (29.6% annualised) in just over 3 years:PayPal shares fell 5.7% in after-market trading last night, after releasing Q3 results that represented one of its best quarters - a Buy opportunity. PayPal gained 15.2m new accounts during Q3, its second best quarter (after Q2 2020); Total Payment Volume was up 38% year-on-year.Revenue grew 25% year-on-year and EBIT grew 45%, despite short-term headwinds from COVID disruption in Travel & Events and from eBay.Management now expects to see a 27-28% EPS growth in 2020 and to raise mid-term EPS CAGR to above the previous 20% figure.With shares at $177.00, our Base Case forecasts a total return of 72% (18.8% annualised) in just over 3 years. Upside Case is even better.We reiterate our Buy rating on PayPal. Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here."
4378275,105815,2020-10-08T22:51:55-04:00,"Pandemic accelerates the secular growth of digital payments with latest Visa's Card-Not-Present volumes data confirming ongoing growth in Q3.PayPal has pivoted well to become a platform company, boasting a portfolio of high-quality digital assets.Monetisation of digital wallets will be a key driver of medium to long-term growth.Already impressive guidance gets an upgrade, as our financial model projects revenue CAGR of 20% and EPS CAGR of 24% over the next five years.We initiate coverage on PayPal with a Buy recommendation recognising current price as expensive but believe that shares offer decent upside for the long term investor.","We see PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) as the best-in-class digital payments company, well positioned to benefit from the move to e-commerce during the pandemic and beyond. We see the recent growth in e-commerce sales as sustainable driven by the stickier new customer cohort of older aged customers, coined by management as “Silver Tech” and merchant’s launching not only new use cases for online businesses but also adopting a digital-first strategy.We are most excited about the potential for mobile payments in the US. We see PayPal as best positioned to capture the biggest market share in the form-factor pivot of payments to mobile given its scale both on the side of consumers (150 to 175m US consumers) and merchants unlike any other player in the payments space.Tech savvy CEO Daniel Shulman took the helm in July 2015 and has been instrumental in transforming the business from a product (PayPal Checkout) company to complete digital platform company, boasting of some of the leading fintech products in the industry such as Venmo, Xoom, iZettle and Honey among others.We initiate coverage on PayPal with a Buy recommendation and price target of $229, imputing a 20% upside to its current share price. Post the pandemic, PayPal's short to medium-term growth trajectory has been upgraded, warranting a higher PE multiple of 47x which we explain more in our valuation section below.The spread of the pandemic has accelerated the penetration of e-commerce in Q2 alone by three to five years. The penetration or the diffusion rate of e-commerce in Q2 2020 increased to 16% from 12% in Q1 2020, a 400bps change vs 20 to 50bps historical change per quarter. (Figure below).E-commerce penetration accelerated by almost two to three years in a single quarter driven by Stay at Home measuresSource: US Census Bureau and AlphaTech EquitiesEncouragingly, management recently reported that it saw digital payment volumes remain at elevated levels vs pre pandemic in areas where STH measures were relaxed, and people were going out to eat at restaurants and shop at brick and mortar businesses.We believe there are several factors that are driving confidence in the sustainability of e-commerce penetration including…1. Visa Card-Not-Present volume shows elevated levels of growth in Q3 despite reopening of economyOur view on the sustainability of e-commerce is driven by evidence in that ""Card-Not-Present"" volumes (which stands for payments made online, phone, recurring payments and invoices) reported by Visa increased by 30% excl. travel throughout July and August. It is important to note that these are levels which are much higher than the volumes seen in April which should provide significant upside for PayPal‘s Q3 payment volumes.CNP volumes rebounded strongly in Q2 and continues to remain at elevated levels in Q3Source: Visa 8-K2. “Silver-Tech” cohort continues to expand userbaseIn the Q1 earnings call, management reported that older cohorts which it termed “Silver Tech” had for the first time started to use e-commerce. This remains the fastest growing cohort of net new actives for PayPal in H1 2020. This elderly aged cohort, seemingly assisted by their children or family members, explaining them on how to use PayPal’s products has been an important win for PayPal given that they are the most financially well-off segment of the society. To gauge the stickiness of customer relationship of new cohorts, PayPal estimates that customers that complete three or more transactions in the first 10 days of using PayPal, typically turn out to be life-long customers. PayPal explained that from preliminary evidence, a good majority of the Silver Tech cohort should be life-long customers. At the end of Q2, management estimated that these new cohorts could end up accounting for 6% of its total customer base.3. Further penetration driven from new e-commerce use cases In addition to the ""Silver Tech"" cohort, PayPal sees new use cases as one of the most important drivers in the sustainability of e-commerce growth. Management reported new industries beginning to launch digital products given that was the only form of business available for many areas in the US during STH orders. Verticals including Education, Healthcare, Fitness, Restaurants and Entertainment all significantly pivoted to the online business model and adopting a digital-first strategy. Brands in these industries are for the first time selling to consumers directly online. Industries like Groceries and Home & Garden have experimented with online sales previously but given the move to online are seeing close to triple digit growth in online sales.PayPal’s checkout product still core to its digital platform, sits extremely well with merchants selling online. When a PayPal option is added at checkout, online sales on average typically increase 50% for merchants, given how much more seamless the payments process is for consumers.Furthermore, JP Morgan also estimated the recent jump in e-commerce sales as “sustainable”, consequentially increasing its long-term US E-commerce penetration rate to 35% to 40% from 30% previously (Figure below).JP Morgan expects long-term penetration of e-commerce to increase to 35-40% up from 30% previously Source: JP Morgan EstimatesWe have been very impressed by CEO Daniel Shulman who has been instrumental in transforming the fintech from a product (PayPal Checkout) company to a complete digital platform company, boasting of some of the leading fintech products in the industry such as Venmo, iZettle, Xoom, iZettle and Honey among others. PayPal currently has some 80 software releases a day versus eight software releases a year when Daniel took charge in 2015, highlighting the steep technology curve PayPal has climbed in his time there.Figure: PayPal has transformed itself from a product to a digital platform company Source: PayPal 2018 Investor Day PresentationThe company has a balanced approach in adding digital products to its platform architecture using bolt on acquisitions and organic product launches. PayPal has acquired several digital fintechs (figure below) to expand its product offerings, some of which we highlight below.Figure: M&A has been a key driver of product expansion Source: AlphaTech Equities and PayPal press releasesPreviously known as PayPal Express Checkout, PayPal Checkout is a module that simplifies a buyer’s secure checkout experience by presenting them with the most relevant payment types to make online purchases.When a customer clicks on the PayPal Checkout button, a transaction is set up via PayPal’s Orders API, allowing users to log in and pay via their PayPal account. Upon approval of payment, PayPal automatically fills out the user’s details before returning the user to the WHMCS shopping cart to complete the checkout process. To implement the checkout button however, a merchant’s e-commerce website must contain an HTTPS secured connection to create a link between WHMCS and PayPal.Figure: PayPal Checkout process.Source: developer.paypal.comMerchants incur a fee when a transaction is conducted via PayPal Checkout. For sales within the US, merchants incur a 2.9% fee in addition to a $0.30 fee per transaction. International sales incur a higher transaction fee at 4.4% with an additional fixed fee based on the receiving currency.PayPal reported a 40% YoY growth in PayPal Checkout volumes in Q2 2020, highlighting the upside from the incremental move to e-commerce it benefited from during STH orders.PayPal acquired Honey Science Corp in 2020 for $4bn. Honey operates as a browser extension that aggregates and automatically applies online coupons to e-commerce websites. The extension is available on all Chromium-based browsers in addition to Safari, Firefox, and Opera. Prior to being acquired by PayPal, the extension boasted a strong 17 million monthly active users and 30,000 partnered online retailers, generating more than $1 billion in consumer savings during 2019 alone.Honey takes advantage of large sets of data and hyper-personalisation to tailor unique deals for each of its individual customers. It operates a massive database, cataloguing the price of every item on retail websites and notifying users when there is a price drop on an item listed in their drop-list. If a user makes a purchase from a select number of partner merchants, Honey receives a commission, which it then distributes a portion to its users via its cashback program. Honey's Net New Active Accounts (NNAs) were 3x the level in Q2 2020 versus that of Q1, highlighting how the fintech benefited during the STH period.Figure: Screenshot showing how Honey compares prices on AmazonSource: joinhoney.comXoom - International funds transferPayPal acquired Xoom in 2015 for $890m. Xoom facilitates electronic fund transfers to over 158 countries worldwide via its website and mobile application. In a select few countries, customers may also pay their bills and reload their mobile credit via Xoom. The company was acquired by PayPal in 2015 to solidify PayPal’s position in the cross-border transaction industry.Xoom primarily generates revenue via a servicing fee and the difference in foreign exchange rates. The service fee varies depending on the customer’s country, the recipient’s country, source of funds, payout currency, and overall transfer amount. Transferring from a US bank account incurs the least fees but requires a maximum of four business days for Xoom to receive funds. Customers paying via a credit or debit card would incur higher fees, but the transaction will be processed significantly faster. Xoom charges some of the lowest fees in the market. International money transfer from the US to popular countries such a Mexico or the Philippines costs only $4.99, irrespective of the transaction amount. Xoom NNAs were up over 600% in Q2 versus Q1 2020.Figure: Xoom fees calculatorSource: Xoom’s websiteiZettle - Card terminals for merchantsPayPal acquired Swedish POS manufacturer, iZettle for $2.2bn in 2018. As the first company to develop a solution to mobile commerce, iZettle commands huge popularity within the industry. Its latest card terminal, which was launched in 2016, has replaced all its previous card readers in Europe, and it was the first mobile payments company to accept contactless payment within the UK. iZettle is a major competitor to Square and was acquired by PayPal to expand its in-store presence with SMEs and significantly grow its presence within Europe.iZettle provides payment and point-of-sale solutions, offering two distinct products: iZettle Go and iZettle Food & Drink. The iZettle Go application is free to download, it turns any smartphone or table into a point-of-sale system, facilitating cash, card, and invoice payments. Card payments through the app incurs a fixed transaction fee of 1.75%, regardless of the card processed by the iZettle reader. Payment links, invoices, and transactions made via e-commerce websites incurs a fixed 2.5% per transaction made through the iZettle system. At the price of £29 per month per device, iZettle Food & Drinks allows users to track sales, staff, and waste, print orders, and split bills in addition to all the features included in iZettle Go.Figure: Image displaying the full range iZettle store kitSource: shop.izettle.comPayPal acquired Venmo as part of its $800m Braintree acquisition in 2013. Venmo is a peer-to-peer (P2P) payment application available on both the iOS and Android operating systems. The app facilitates payments by acting as a third party and is extremely popular in the US with the phrase “to Venmo” becoming synonymous with making P2P payments.While PayPal's digital wallet has many of its features, Venmo is an entirely different product proposition as it is unique to both users and merchants. Unlike other payment applications, Venmo is a payments platform build around its social capabilities. The platform encourages users to share their experiences after each transaction, facilitating conversation around their purchases. This high level of engagement acts as free advertisement for merchants.At the end of 2019, PayPal reported a revenue run rate of $450m for Venmo on a 52m user base. Since then Venmo has seen the number of users increase to 60m by the end of H1 2020. Both PayPal and Venmo together have c. 150 to 175m users in the US alone. The revenue per user run-rate of $9 in Q4 2019 for Venmo is much lower than that of rival Square at $30 in Q4 2019 and $45 at the end of H1 2020. This underscores the potential of growth for Venmo going forward, especially if, much like Square, PayPal can offer trading of crypto assets on its digital wallets. PayPal already monetises Venmo by allowing its users to pay at merchant locations, use its debit card or making instant P2P transfers. With the aim to increase monetisation for Venmo, PayPal has announced plans to issue credit cards at the back end of 2020 for user in partnership with Visa.Square has increased its rev per use by 3x in the last three years primarily on the back of adding new revenue generating productsSource: Square Unit Economics March 2020 and Q2 earnings transcriptsInvesting in QR code payment opportunity is vital for PayPal, given that it allows to broaden its payments offerings to offline brick and mortar businesses which constitutes >80% of all retail sales. Given the increased free cash windfall from the pandemic, management announced an additional $300m of investment in H2 2020, majority of which will be dedicated to building its QR-code payments network in the US.In terms of PayPal’s QR-code unit economics, sighting the pandemic, PayPal is not charging merchant for any payments until the end of 2020. However, beginning 2021, merchants will pay 1.5% of transaction value + €0.10 per transaction in the UK.PayPal sees itself benefiting from a ""HALO"" effect as consumers using it online also more likely to use it for offline purchases given the positive brand identity it enjoys. We see PayPal’s QR code offering as a significant driver of growth in the medium to long term given…1. PayPal is best positioned off all payment companies to drive QR-code based payments in the USUnlike any other payment company, PayPal’s is the best positioned to drive QR-code based payments given that its scale. Venmo and PayPal combined have between 150 to 175m users in the US at the end of H1 2020, an extremely attractive proposition for merchants of any size. Versus competitors, Square comes closest with a digital wallet which had 45m users at the end of H1 2020. Visa and Mastercard do not have a digital wallet serving customer directly. Zelle, another P2P payments platform back by banks and credit unions in the US is another big player in the digital wallets space which had forecasted to overtake the number of Venmo users (40m in 2018 versus 60m in Q2 2020) back in 2018.Figure: US mobile payments penetration is significantly lower than China2. The onset of the pandemic is driving merchants to demand touchless payment solutionsFurthermore, with the onset of pandemic, users are more likely to use touchless payments such as QR-codes, driving merchants to reach out to PayPal and ask for touchless payment solutions. Currently, PayPal is working with more than 100 large retailers across US and Europe including the likes of pharmacy giant CVS to provide QR-code based payments.3. Strong value proposition for using digital wallets will fuel user adoptionThe ability to add reward points for customers every time they pull out a PayPal or a Venmo digital wallet will be a key driver of adoption. Acquisition of Honey will provide further impetus for users to use the Venmo and PayPal apps to make offline purchases as it allows merchants to integrate some of Honey’s discount offerings. Merchants could also use proximity messaging feature to provide customers with offers to increase sales.After posting stellar Q2 results, PayPal has upgraded its full year 2020 revenue guidance to 22% from 17-20% it set out earlier this year. Additionally, management also upgraded its full year EPS growth guidance by 9% to 25%. Given the CNP volumes of 30%, Visa reported for July and Aug, we see PayPal’s Q3 results beating its full year guidance comfortably. On a three to five-year basis, we see PayPal’s revenue increase by ~20% and EPS to increase by c. 18-24% driven primarily by operating leverage despite taking into picture PayPal's incremental investments to roll out its QR-code infrastructure across the US.Our financial model estimates 24% EPS growth over the period 2019-2024ESource: AlphaTech EquitiesFigure: We estimate a 20% revenue growth and 23% EBIT growth over the next five yearsSource: AlphaTech EquitiesPayPal’s 12-month forward PE ratio has increased from an average of 35x in the two years prior to the pandemic to an average of 47x post the pandemic (See figure below). We believe the current multiple range of 43x to 51x as the new normal unless the growth story breaks for any of the risks mentioned above.Forward PE ratios are now trading at all time high range given higher growth prospectsSource: KoyfinWe see PayPal as one of the few companies that will see long-term sustainable benefits of the incremental move to e-commerce during the pandemic. Additionally, we draw increased confidence from Square’s monetisation of its Cash App and see PayPal doing the same with its digital wallets which boasts almost 4x the user base of Cash App. We see PayPal outperforming its medium to long-term guidance of revenue growth from 17-18% CAGR (vs our forecast of 20%) and EPS from ~20% (vs our forecast of 23%).We initiate coverage on PayPal with a Buy recommendation and a price target of $229, imputing an upside of 20%.Figure: We use forward PE to get a 20% upside on current share priceSource: AlphaTech EquitiesWe see PayPal as the best-in-class digital payments company, well positioned to benefit from the move to e-commerce during the pandemic.

We see PayPal as best positioned to capture the biggest market share in the form factor pivot of payments to mobile payments given its scale both on the side of consumers (150 to 175m US consumers) and merchants.Tech savvy CEO, Daniel Shulman took the helm in July 2015 and has been instrumental in transforming the business from a product (PayPal Checkout) company to complete digital platform company, boasting of some of the leading fintech products in the industry such as Venmo, Xoom and Honey among others.We initiate coverage on PayPal with a Buy recommendation and price target of $229, imputing a 20% upside (12 months target price) to its 1%current share price. Post the pandemic, PayPal's short to medium-term growth trajectory has received a boost which warrants it a higher PE multiple of 47x."
4385158,21485,2020-11-05T07:30:00-05:00,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. is doing very well and is showing how a top-notch technology firm can take advantage of a disrupted economy suffering from a major pandemic.Furthermore, PayPal is showing how it is developing a technology platform and network consistent with scalable ""new"" Modern Corporations to be competitive in the future.In one way or another, PayPal is going to play a role in the future payments system and, along with Ant Group and JPMorgan Chase & Co. will set standards.","PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a leading example of what is happening in the economy as the economy goes through the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and the related economic recession.PayPal’s year-over-year total payment volume rose by 36 percent on a currency-neutral basis. This exceeded its second-quarter performance when total payment volume only increased by 30 percent.This, to me, represents the future, a future that has been accelerated into the present by the disruptions the economy is now going through.The near-term future will not be so “expansive” since the past two quarters especially benefitted from the unusual circumstances of the time.But just because the performance may drop back from the current numbers, this doesn’t mean that investors should be concerned about the future.The management of PayPal has prepared for the future and seems to be perfectly capable of meeting its competition. Investors should be very interested in this company.Year-over-year, profits more than doubled.PayPal processed $247 billion in payments in the third quarter. It grew in volume as other competitors, like credit card companies, actually faced a decline in transactions. Actually, the amount of credit card debt fell by $51 billion during the second quarter from a year earlier. The drop in the second quarter of $76 billion was the largest ever.PayPal also added net new accounts of 15.2 million in the last quarter, as the movement from cash and checks to electronic payments picked up.The company now has a wallet and peer-to-peer payments app, Venmo, and the value of transactions associated with it rose by 61 percent to $44 billion in the quarter.One of the things that PayPal has been criticized for in the past has been the fact that management has just focused on the company’s fundamental payments system. It wanted to make sure that it worked and was all it was meant to be. Management was interested in the quality of the product.The criticism arose because PayPal’s competitors expanded their product lines and this threatened the hold of PayPal on the market. And, then with movements from such organizations like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) and the Chinese threat, Alipay coming from Alibaba Group Holdings (NYSE: BABA) now associated with Ant Group, analysts expressed concern over whether or not PayPal could keep up with future competition.It seems that PayPal is keeping up and bringing its concern about excellence along with it.As Telis Demos writes in the Wall Street Journal, PayPal’s growthPayPal has been investing a lot of money in Venmo and will be pushing it very hard going forward. The company expects it to begin making a positive contribution to its performance in 2021.In other words, the company is really building an information platform and network based upon intellectual capital that is consistent with the nature of the “new” Modern Corporation, which I have been writing a lot about.The hypergrowth may be coming to an end, but the company appears to be in a very strong position, ready to take on the competition it is bound to face in the future.And, overall, the stock market seems to appreciate this fact.Shares of PayPal have more than doubled in price from their March lows and are now trading near record highs. The stock now trades on 40 times forward earnings. Competitors Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V), the two biggest payment processors in the United States, trade on 35 and 27 times earnings. Investors seem to appreciate PayPal’s possibilities.I mentioned Ant Group earlier and its connection with the world’s largest payments system, Alipay. Recently, I have written several articles on this company and the role the Chinese payments system might play in world banking and financial circles. The most direct article can be found here.The Ant Group is planning to move out into the world and had planned to raise $34 billion to support this growth. For now, it looks as if this effort will be put on hold. Jack Ma, co-founder and former chief executive of Alibaba, appears to have offended Chinese officials and, for the time being, the new offering has been pulled from the market.This situation, I believe, will be resolved very quickly and Mr. Ma will “step into line” with whatever the Chinese authorities want. And, Ant will be back on the move to share its products with the world.In my estimation, PayPal will play a very important role in the future of payments systems and in the future of the banking system. The company is a well-run company, the technology is first class, and it will be an alternative to Alipay and other systems. My guess is that it will not play this role independently, but will become a part of some larger organization, one that can help it scale up. But payment systems are the future of banking and finance."
4382151,105812,2020-10-28T14:05:57-04:00,"PayPal's platform enables merchants to accept digital payments both in stores and online.PayPal continues to innovate around digital payments, with the recent addition of QR Code payments and the Venmo credit card.PayPal's platform targets a $110 trillion addressable market.Based on my DCF analysis, PayPal is ~6% overvalued at current prices. But given PayPal's strong competitive position and substantial market opportunity, the stock is a buy for long-term investors.","The world is undergoing a shift towards digital solutions, and digital payments are an undeniable part of that transition. PayPal (PYPL), as an enabler of digital payments, is well-positioned to capture value in the coming years.My investment thesis is summarized in the following points:1. PayPal's management has stated that their total addressable market is $110 trillion. And this number is expanding each year, as digital payments become more prevalent both in stores and online.2. PayPal benefits from a strong network effect, which effectively engages users on both sides of the transaction. As evidence of this, active accounts have grown at 16% per year, but total payment volume has grown faster (26% per year) since 2015.3. PayPal's financial performance in recent years has been exceptional. Since 2015, revenue has grown at 18% per year, earnings have grown at 19% per year, and free cash flow has grown at 28% per year.PayPal's ecosystem of consumer-facing and merchant-facing products enable digital payments both online and in stores.For merchants, PayPal functions as a payment processor, allowing them to accept in-store payments made with cards or digital wallets, like the PayPal app, or even Apple (AAPL) Pay and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) Pay. PayPal also functions as a payment gateway, which allows merchants to securely accept online payments. Merchants can choose between Payflow Link, a free gateway hosted by PayPal, or for $35 per month, merchants can use Payflow Pro, which provides a more customizable checkout experience.For consumers, PayPal and Venmo function as digital wallets, enabling P2P transfers and (more recently) in store payments.In July 2020, PayPal announced a partnership with payment processor InComm. This partnership enables InComm to distribute PayPal QR Codes to retailers across the country through cloud-based software updates. CVS has already agreed to implement this technology across 8,200 locations in the United States. But InComm connects with 10 of the top 20 retailers, and processes tens of millions of transactions each day, meaning this partnership has the potential to be much larger.In October 2020, PayPal launched the Venmo credit card, a Visa-branded card that offers consumers another way to make in-store purchases with Venmo. While this probably won't have a dramatic impact on PayPal's bottom line, it does further enhance PayPal's strong network effect by allowing users to engage with the platform in yet another way.For all of the services I've just discussed, PayPal takes a percentage of the total payment volume. This is how PayPal monetizes its platform. The percentages vary depending on the situation, but the most common scenarios are shown in the chart below.Source: PayPal Fees.In addition to the fees indicated above, which include a 1.5% cross-border fee, PayPal may also charge a currency conversion fee of 3%. So, for an online transaction funded by a PayPal account outside the United States and settled in $USD, PayPal may take as much as 7.4% of the total payment volume.In 2018, PayPal's management highlighted the company's enormous market opportunity during an Investor Day presentation. This is shown in the graphic below:Source: PayPal Investor Day Presentation 2018.As indicated above, PayPal targets a total addressable market (TAM) of $110 trillion. Note that this refers to payment volume, not potential revenue. PayPal would take a percentage of the above figure. Even so, the market opportunity is enormous.But PayPal's market opportunity is also expanding quickly. According to a report by Research & Markets, the global digital payments market is expected to grow at ~24% per year through 2025, to reach $12.4 trillion.As a result of this expansive TAM, the digital payments space is highly competitive. Outside of China, where WeChat Pay and AliPay are utterly dominant, PayPal faces significant competition from Apple Pay and Square (SQ).Square's Cash App is much smaller in terms of monthly active users, which were reported to be 30 million in Q2'20. In comparison, PayPal reported 364 million in the most recent quarter. However, Apple Pay's active users were estimated at 441 million in September 2019, well ahead of PayPal's 295 million users at the time.Additionally, in Apple's Q1'20 earnings call, Tim Cook stated that Apple Pay transactions were on pace to exceed 15 billion per year. By comparison, as of Q2'20, PayPal has processed 13.6 billion transactions over the past twelve months.So why is Apple leading?First, Apple's iPhone is a significant advantage. Hundreds of millions of people already have iPhones, and enabling Apple Pay is simple. Beyond that, Apple Pay is commonly accepted at in-store POS terminals. These factors have likely contributed heavily to Apple's lead. But if PayPal can meaningful enter the in-store portion of the digital payments market, using solutions like QR Code payments, the Venmo credit card, or even their own NFC-enabled application, this could drive significant future growth. Investors should pay attention to PayPal's efforts around QR Code payments especially, as this is the same strategy employed by WeChat Pay and AliPay in China.Even if Apple remains ahead of PayPal, the digital payments market is enormous and expanding. This is not a winner-take-all situation. There is plenty of room for all three of these companies to benefit from the digitization of payments.PayPal primarily generates revenue by taking a portion of the total payment volume processed through its platform. And total payment volume is a function of (1) the number of active accounts and (2) the number of processed transactions. Investors should pay close attention to all of these metrics.Since 2015, PayPal has grown active accounts by 16% per year. This is shown in the chart below:Source: Created by the author using data from PayPal Investor Relations.As indicated above, growth in active accounts has been impressive. Even more impressive, active accounts growth has accelerated each quarter in 2020. In Q1 and Q2, active accounts grew by 17% and 21%, respectively.But it gets better. Since 2015, the number of processed transactions has grown by 25%, to reach 13.6 billion in the last twelve months. And PayPal's total payment volume has grown at 26% annually. This is shown in the chart below:Source: Created by the author using data from PayPal Investor Relations.These figures indicate that total payment volume growth has outpaced growth in active accounts over the last 4.5 years. This is indicative of increasing user engagement. In other words, each PayPal user is using PayPal more frequently. They are engaging in more transactions. They are spending more money. And that is a very bullish signal for the business.Likewise, as you might expect, strong growth in these key metrics has translated into strong sales and earnings growth. Since 2015, PayPal has grown revenue at 18% per year. This is shown in the chart below:Source: Created by the author using data from PayPal Investor Relations.In the most recent quarter, despite the pandemic, revenue growth accelerated to 22% YoY.Over the same time period, earnings have grown even faster, at 19% annually. This is shown in the chart below:Source: Created by the author using data from PayPal Investor Relations.Additionally, PayPal's balance sheet is very strong, with over $16 billion in cash and liquid investments compared to $8.9 billion in long-term debt.In my discounted cash flow valuation model, I have used the following variables:My rationale is as follows: In the 4.5 years between Q4'15 and Q2'20, PayPal's FCF per share has grown from $1.48 to $4.64, representing 28.9% annualized growth. Conservatively, I have chosen to assume a growth rate of 20% over the next 5 years. I have also chosen 2.9% for my terminal growth rate, as this figure corresponds to the average annualized global GDP growth since 2000. And the discount rate is set at 8%, as this is roughly the average annual return of the S&P 500 since 1957 (i.e. the year it was expanded to include 500 stocks).Using these inputs, I estimate PayPal's fair value at $190 today. This is shown in the charts below:Source: Created by the author.At the time this article was written, a fair value of $190 implies that PayPal is overvalued by roughly 6%. However, given PayPal's strong business and expansive market opportunity, I think the stock is still a buy here. Also, my DCF model may be conservative for two reasons: (1) PayPal has grown FCF per share at 28.9% per year over the last 4.5 years, but I have estimated 20% over the next 5 years; given the expanding market opportunity, PayPal may grow FCF per share more quickly than I've estimated. (2) I've modeled a 5-year growth phase, then a perpetual terminal phase where growth drops to 2.9%; but it is unlikely that PayPal's FCF per share growth will drop to 2.9% in 5 years.Now, let's look at another FCF-based valuation.Again assuming 20% annualized growth, PayPal's FCF per share will grow from $4.68 to $11.55 by Q2'2025. PayPal currently trades at 43x FCF, but I've used three more conservative scenarios to estimate potential returns: 40x, 30x, and 20x. This is shown in the charts below:Source: Created by the author.As indicated above, in my most bullish scenario, PayPal returns 18% per year, reaching a share price of $461 in 2025. And in my most bearish scenario, PayPal returns 3% per year, with a share price of $231 in 2025. While 3% won't beat the market, 11% and 18% almost certainly will. And while 11% per year may not sound incredible, the result at the end of 5 years would be a 69% gain - not bad.And once again, I believe this model errors on the side of being conservative, as I've estimated that FCF per share will grow at 20% annually over the next 5 years, despite the fact that it has grown quite a bit faster than that in the previous 4.5 years. Additionally, since going public, PayPal's Price to FCF ratio has typically been well above 20x. This is shown in the chart below.Data by YChartsPayPal's platform engages users on both sides of the transaction, creating a strong network effect. And while the digital payments space is highly competitive, PayPal is a market leader alongside Apple Pay and Square. And provided PayPal continues to innovate and expand the functionality of its platform, as they have with QR Code payments and the Venmo credit card, I believe they will maintain their strong competitive position.Additionally, PayPal recently announced that it would start allowing users to buy, sell, and hold cryptocurrency. This service will be expanded to include Venmo in the first half of 2021. PayPal also plans to allow consumers to use cryptocurrency to fund purchases at any of its 26 million merchants.This decision allows PayPal to match a feature already provided by Square, demonstrating yet again their ability to innovate around digital payments. And with an estimated market opportunity of over $12 trillion by 2025, PayPal's innovative culture leaves them well-positioned to capture value.Finally, based on the valuation models discussed in this article, I believe PayPal can significantly outperform the market over the next 5 years, despite being slightly overvalued at present.For all of these reasons, I believe PayPal is a solid long-term investment idea."
4377198,105447,2020-10-01T12:35:54-04:00,"This week's Alpha Trader podcast features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher talking markets with Bob Iaccino, who is making a return appearance to the show.September wasn't the best month for stocks, and last week was a volatile one, but Iaccino notes the market as having shaken off a lot of the negativity by last Friday. It might mean equities aren't yet ready to take another leg down.Iaccino has been, and continues to be a bull on the dollar, having taken note of a curious shrinking in the Fed balance sheet for several weeks during the summer.Among Iacinno's stock picks are those names that might not be too affected by the election or the virus. Cheesecake Factory, Dollar General, and PayPal fit the bill.","Editors' note: This is a transcript version of the episode of Alpha Trader that we published earlier this week. We hope you enjoy.Aaron Task: Welcome to Alpha Trader. Our guest today is Bob Iaccino. He is Co-Founder of the PureXposure Growth Series. It's on YouTube. You can find it there. And he's co-Portfolio Manager at The Stock Think Tank. Bob. Welcome back to Alpha Trader.Bob Iaccino: Thanks for having me again, guys.AT: Welcome, Bob. Thanks for being back. We're coming -- we're talking to you Friday, early afternoon at the end of, I will -- it’s fair to say, volatile week, a lot of intraday volatility. S&P rallying, as we're talking now, but still on track for its fourth straight weekly decline, down about 2% for the week, with a couple hours left here in trading on Friday. So let's talk technicals first, because it seemed like the 100 day moving average, which is right around 3,200 was the level from which the S&P bounced a couple times this week. Was that, do you think the driving factor in terms of the turnaround? We've seen both intraday a couple times, and then, here again on Friday?BI: Yeah, it's interesting looking at the week, guys, because the week is -- it's definitely going to end up a down week. As you mentioned, we haven't quite closed yet on Friday, as we're speaking to each other now. But it -- at least the way it looks right now, it looks like we're going to have a positive close versus the weeks open. So what I mean by that is that, we opened up, we gapped lower on the open on Monday, we're going to close above that gap lower. It's not going to close above the prior Friday's close.So it's going to be a down week. But it's going to be an up-week from the Monday open to the Friday close, at least where we sit now. So when you talk about the 100-day moving average, it's the one of the three populars, which would call the 50 to 100 or the 200, that I don't pay that much attention to. And the reason is based on our research, it's the weakest of those three. I certainly think it bears noting though, as you did that, that's where we held up because self-fulfilling prophecies are good pieces of technical news. They're good [technical difficulty]. If they're going to fulfill themselves, you should probably pay attention.The 100-day moving average, in my experience, and I'm in my third decade of this, I think this is my 27th year now, is the one that people use as a bit of a crutch. When you go back and back test it, it definitely holds up. But it breaks down more often than the 200 does. And it provides fewer reliable signals than the 50 does.AT: Interesting. So the fact that we're above the open on Monday, tells you what about sort of the next 3% to 5% move for the S&P 500 from here.BI: Well, one of the fun things about technical analysis, which is just a big word way of saying price action, right, is that they mean very obvious things. When you study price action, you come to find out that it's almost the obvious. What that means to me is that we're -- the market feels a little bit better than it did on Monday. And that's a pretty obvious thing to say, when you say that it looks like, at least that we do close above that. And it's a little bit of strength that people can draw from. It's not a lot. It could be the start of the close of the gap, from that gap lower from last Friday's close. It could be the start of that.But all it means that we didn't accelerate lower. So during the week, at some point, there was some little pieces of good news. It could be Jerome Powell, or the three days in a row where he said we're doing everything we can, a little bit of good news that we got from Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary, Mnuchin saying that they're ready to negotiate on fiscal, there's some little bit of news within the market that said, okay, we're low but we don't need to go any lower yet. I suspect that we're likely to see lower over the next couple of weeks, but it just may not be triggered today.AT: Got it. And that expectation that we might be lower next week, there's so many -- you just mentioned a couple, and the fiscal stimulus package being looking like it's dead in the water now. We're going to have hearings and probably a fight over a new Supreme Court justice and of course the election is looming right in the horizon and futures volatility is up in anticipation of that. The VIX is down 1% today but it's still the higher end of the range it's been in, or -- and of course COVID cases are still are starting to creep up, certainly in Western Europe and they’ve never really gone down here in the States. It's never any one thing but what are you looking at to determine, whether you're in more of a risk on or risk off type mode.BI: Well, this is one of those times where I'm much happier to be a strategist than say, an economist or an analyst, because all my job really is, is to try and figure out what's going to happen and not necessarily make sense of why it's going to happen. If I take that off -- that hat off for a second, it's embarrassing, how messed up the political situation is, and how much it can affect the markets. I mean, just the back and forth, if you didn't think that politicians were two-faced before, you do now. And that's either party either side, I don't care.AT: Right. Yeah, the idea that both parties are going to say, hey, we're okay with more people being laid off ahead of election is insane, politically, just from a pure political point of view, right? Again this [ph] fabulous package to help you, right.BI: Right, just the fact that they can't come together and say, okay, let's get small businesses and individuals off the mat, and then go from there. The fact that the two parties can't come together and say that, because they're so worried about one party claiming victory over the other, if that were to happen, is it's really -- I mean, it's really gross, I can't think of a better word than that.AT: That's a good word, that is a good word for it now.BI: It's just gross. I mean, people are really struggling out there. And that's just hard to take. But again, being a strategist my only job is to react to what you just said, which is it's likely dead in the water. So when you take a look at what the market, let's say what the market needs to go higher, let's just use that as the baseline case, the market needs more money going into things that it probably shouldn't. In other words, fiscal stimulus is not a good thing, if you're looking at economics, right? It's just not a good thing. It's the government spending money, they don't really have.But interest rates are low. So if we're going to borrow more to spend that money, I guess it's a good time to do a bad thing. And people need it. So if you were to want the market to go higher, I'm referencing the equity markets in general, you would want more dollars out there. And that takes us to the Dollar Index. The dollar index is looking strong. I’m actually long the Dollar Index as SPG now. We've been long the Dollar Index for about a week and a half now. And I don't want it to make money. For in my heart, I don't want it to make money. Of course, I want it to make money. We put the position on. But we have a target of 96.5 on that thing. And we're only at 94.67. And anyone who follows the Dollar Index knows that's still a pretty size.AT: It's a big move. Yeah, that's a big one.BI: And that's our target to exit the long positions, about 96.5. So I don't like that this position is working, because what's happened since the pandemic took hold, is that when the dollar is weak, everything else works. And I’m referencing long positions. And the dollar has been not great now. It's certainly not reversing the entire move down. At least we don't think so, the entire move down that started say March 19 or so. But it certainly looks like it might go up to its 200 day average. And we'll already be out by then, because its 200 is somewhere around 97 or so. But it could certainly challenge that. And that would be bad for most of the other asset classes.Stephen Alpher: Speaking of the dollar, it's incredible how markets make opinions for months while the dollar was headed down for the past few months, on this show and everywhere, even Ray Dalio, a lot of musing about the dollar losing its reserve currency status. And all it took was the slightest downdraft in the market, the slightest bit of fear in equity markets, and what do you know, everybody's buying dollars again, the tweet of the day, Aaron we've had on this podcast, I won't be able to pronounce his name, Sri Thiruvadanthai.BI: Yeah, got you.SA: A five word tweet with an emoji, dollar regaining reserve currency status, with a bunch of rolling on the floor laughing emojis after it. So I'm interested to hear you’re bullish on the dollar. Is it just because of your short term bearishness on the stock market, or does it go beyond that?BI: No, honestly, it's two things. Number one, so just a quick background, the way we do things in the Stock Think Tank, as well as one of my other companies, Path Trading Partners, is I put forth a fundamental opinion on something. And then our technical team either vetoes it or endorses it. And if the technical team vetoes it, we just don't do it. And that consists of Mike Arnold and his team. He actually put forth the technical opinion on the dollar. And I tried to back it up with my fundamental thesis and they seemed to match up. And that's why we put on the long.When I looked at St. Louis Fed, their Fred website, which I'm very fond of, and I looked at the Fed's balance sheet, it was shrinking. It wasn't expanding. Now it did have a huge jump from some $4 trillion to over $7 trillion during the height of the fall of the equity markets with the pandemic effect. But then it started shrinking. It went down below $7 trillion, and that comes from assets rolling off in it and their duration ending and then expiring, so to speak, and then not replacing it at the same rate that the things were rolled, that the assets were rolling off. And I thought, well, that certainly isn't a bunch of dollars in play.If the extra $600 a week in the unemployment, the excess unemployment or extra unemployment comes off, and that's not replaced, where are these extra dollars coming from? In other words from its current baseline level. So again, I don't think the dollar is going back to where it was pre the $7 trillion fed balance sheet. But it certainly needs to go up. If the fed doesn't start growing that balance sheet again -- for the record over the last three weeks or so they have, but certainly not at the clip that the market wants. The dollar reserve currency status, reserve currency status has one major requirement. And that's a stable government.Now we can laugh right now about it, because it certainly doesn't feel like we have a stable government through Congress all the way to the Supreme Court at this point. But it's still the most stable, which is another embarrassment. So when you look at it, at the end of the day, when people are fearful for the return of capital, they still want it in dollars. And I agree with that tweet, except maybe the shock and awe of the rolling on the floor emojis, because where are you going to go? You can go to Bitcoin yet. I mean, I kind of do. I'm an accumulator of Bitcoin at this stage. But reserve currency, like where do you have to have a currency that works to buy everything, still has to be the US dollar.AT: Right. And just to be clear, the tweet that Steven and Bob are referring to, by Sri Thiruvadanthai, who's Director of Research at the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center, and I apologize if I mispronounced his name, he's at T as in the drink S-R-I, and many guests here before. So yes, absolutely. I think that's what's happening to the dollar there. It is still the ultimate. It's a reserve currency, and it's the ultimate flight to safety. So COVID cases are coming up, election uncertainty in the U.S. is rising, but people still believe in the dollar. So not surprisingly, given what the dollar has done last couple weeks, gold is down. It's down about 5% this week. Do you have a position on gold, positive or negative? Are you giving your long dollar, are you shorted or out of it right now.BI: We're out of gold right now. We spent quite a bit of time long gold. We got long gold on June 1. And we actually -- I could call it up. But I feel like it was two or three weeks ago that we got out of the gold position. It was prior to this recent fall. And that again, is not a not a compliment. We didn't predict the fall. We actually thought maybe we'd gotten out too soon. And it's still -- it's now slightly below where we got out if I remember correctly. Again, I could call it up if I -- if we wanted to. But from the perspective of gold right now, we're completely out of it. And I don't actually like that. It's another thing where I'd like to be long gold. But our technical team again says that it's not really in a pattern where there's going to be follow through to the upside.Now in the past the inverse relationship, the historical inverse relationship of the dollar and gold has been what you swung to all, else equal, right? And I'd say that it's not all else equal right now, but it's just -- I find it very strange that if equities are selling off, gold isn't going higher and treasuries are not going lower in yield. None of that's happening right now. But the last time we saw something like this back in, let's say February, where yields were going lower, commodities were rallying -- meaning gold and silver, but the stock market was rallying at the same time. And the two against one narrative ended up working, whether you blame the pandemic or not it's obviously the pandemic that caused it.But I remember saying that the stock market either has to go down or gold has to go down and yields have to rise and the stock market end up going down. Right now with yields stagnant, and gold falling, it tells me that the stock market's likely to rally back.AT: Our guest is Bob Iaccino.

We'll be right back with more Alpha Trader.Take a deep dive into futures to arm yourself with knowledge to expand your strategy with confidence, see what adding futures can do for you at cmegroup.com/alpha.SA: Welcome back to Alpha Trader with Bob Iaccino. Bob, I wanted to go back to something you said a few minutes ago. One of the reasons you became bullish on the dollar was you looked at the St. Louis Fed -- Fred data and saw that the fed's balance sheet was actually shrinking for a good period of time, which is super interesting considering everybody says the fed is pumping like crazy. And normally the fed would need to continue to greatly expand its balance sheet just to keep the fed funds rate at zero. The fact that they could -- the balance sheet could shrink and the Fed Funds rate did not go shooting higher tells me we're still kind of in a massive, a sizable deflationary environment. Does that make sense?BI: Yeah, I would agree with that. I think it -- from that perspective, people forget that Jerome Paul used to actually be involved in the markets, right? He spent a lot of time in private equity. And I think he has a different aspect than an academic would, or just a pure economist. And what I mean by that is, there were times in the 90s, I remember where the Bank of Japan was actively trying to prop up the yen. And they would buy trillions and trillions and trillions of yen, only to have it fall in their face after they were done buying. And they were fighting a trend.And I think -- and again, I don't want to put it on, as if Jerome Powell is the one that they call like -- he's the don of the Fed or something. But it -- I think that this particular fed knows that if the trend is going their way, just kind of hold off, just kind of save those bullets. And if the trends going against you, maybe wait until the heat of the trend dies down a little bit. So again if you're looking at the balance sheet, the balance sheet reached its peak at about June 10. It was about $7.1 trillion, I don't remember $7.16 trillion, somewhere in there. And then by early July, it had fallen below $7 trillion going to about $6.9 trillion. And right now we're back above $7 trillion as of September 23. I'm actually looking at that data right now.And I think it might have a lot to do with why yields have been so stable. Fed has sort of a skewed yield curve control as a strategy. But they may actually be doing it behind the scenes by just balancing when they're going to buy assets. So right now you could call it a stable balance sheet, as opposed to shrinking. But given what's going on, we're officially in a recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, who's the people who say when we're in recessions or not.I hate when things lose their definition of recessions, when things have lost its definition at some point. I don't know why. But anyway, we're officially in a recession. We have an economy and workforce that needs stimulus. And we're not getting it. And it seems to me that the Fed thinks, okay, this is not the right time, since yields aren't really moving, and things aren't really in freefall. We can kind of hold off and keep our powder dry, until we absolutely need to do it, or until things are going our way, when we can really push it. That's just my theory on it.AT: Those are things that suggest, and I think Steve was hinting at this that the stock market can do well, even if the Fed's balance sheet is flat or coming down a little bit as it had since its peak earlier this summer, to your point because they had a great August.BI: Yeah, I really think we've proven it. I mean if you look at the Fed's balance sheet, basically shrinking through June and July, and then you just pull up an S&P chart, look at what happened from June to July. I mean, basically at a 7%, 8%, 9% rally from that spot. So I think we've seen it very, very short term. So I'm certainly curve fitting, but you know, we've seen it/AT: Right. And obviously, the caveat being it's a lot higher than it was at the beginning of the year, for sure. But I could I could spin this into a very bullish point of view that the stock market has shown, it can go up if the Fed's balance sheet is flat, let's say. And if it goes down, we know the Fed stands ready to do more, which should buoy equity prices. And the meme that's going around, Fred fed Ted bread, seems to be the driving force for a lot of traders right now. Do you share that mindset that, the feds at our back, they've got us? So you're going to buy dips, basically, and keep writing this thing?BI: Yes. And I also think that when you look at, for example, the volatility curve, I'm sure you guys have spoken about the volatility curve being strong and even higher out toward October, November, December, with some of the issues that we're likely to see with the election. I think past that point, you're going to get fiscal stimulus, regardless of who is in the White House, regardless of who has the Senate, regardless of who has the House. There's no political scenario, and again, I'm not a political strategist, but there's no political scenario that I can see, where there's no fiscal stimulus going forward, period, unless there is an absolute available and 100% safe and 100% effective vaccine by then, which I don't see that happening either.So the next step is we get through the election, and there's some form of stimulus after it. Once we're -- once all the smoke has cleared, and then a vaccine sometime in 2021.SA: I found it interesting that you are -- I’m happy that you brought volatility. We spoke with Jon Najarian last week, and he said he had a bit of a contrarian take and that he's looking forward to selling volatility before.BI: Spoken like an options guy.SA: A lot of people are -- I mean there's a lot of crazy talk going on about transfer of power and or it could be weeks before the Presidential election is settled. And he's not buying any of it. He said that, yes, there might be some house races that are going to be up in the air for many weeks. But come Monday or Wednesday morning, after the election, we're going to know who our next President is going to be. And he's going to be so involved at that point.BI: Yeah, Jon, Jon's a friend and Jon's job -- his entire, very successful career has been built on unusual activity. And I think that's exactly what he's calling this. And it's exactly what it is. I mean, just by the pure definition of unusual activity. I look at it, more like it's not a time to buy options, than it's a time to sell options. That's something that Jon is good at. That's not something that we would be doing. But it is something that we would notice. Because again, when you look at, if every stock is going to act like Tesla, it's a little worrisome. And there's an implication of implied volatility being higher that every stocks can act that way. And it's not the case. The volatility being hard just tells you that the prices can expand very quickly. If you run a strategy, like we do in the Stock Think Tank where you have -- where risk is your first, second and third consideration, it's not that important. It's likely to mean that our position sizes will be smaller headed into the election than they would normally be.AT: So can you talk a little bit more about how you’re positioned at Stock Think Tank right now, either in securities, or do you only trade futures and ETFs?BI: No, no, we trade everything in terms of like our actions, our public portfolio, but the portfolio that our clients see is all stocks. But we as individuals trade quite a bit of futures. We trade a lot of oil, for example. But we're basically -- I don't want to say we're not in anything you've heard of. Everything that we're in, we're not in Facebook, we're not in Netflix, we're not in Google, we're not in Apple. We're in things like cheesecake factory, for example, Dollar General, we have. We have Intel, where I told you we're long the dollar, we're long that through an ETF and I'm also short Euro futures personally.So in the Stock Think Tank, we're long dollar ETF, which is the UUP. We're in Activision, for example. Those are the kinds of things that -- they're companies that are not likely to be affected by who's President and how bad it's doing. Cheesecake Factory is a good example. When you look at Cheesecake Factory’s business, and you say, okay, they're an anchor restaurant in a lot of malls, right. Well, some negative right? Well, maybe not. They have pricing power in terms of rent reduction. They also have huge, huge spaces, which means they can they can socially distance when necessary. And they also already had a very large takeout business.So they're kind of in a position of strength for a recovery. And they're in a position of sustainability for an explosion of cases. So that's part of the sort of fundamental view behind that. So very, very big name, very big chain. Dollar General, for example, well, Dollar General is a recession play. I mean, they've always done well, in general, and they do well during recessions. So that's sort of a recession play, which we're in a recession. The dollar we already talked about. We're in PayPal, that might be the nature…AT: That's your hot stock.BI: Yeah, that's our momentum play, right? Yeah. Well, all kidding aside, it's somewhat of a value portfolio with a little bit of risk put in in things like PayPal and Activision and the dollar, simply because PayPal, I think, is the bridge to the future of finance. It's -- to me, it's sort of the anti-XLF stock to a certain degree, because PayPal is a very trusted name in a space that people need to transition over to in the near future. So that's part of what I like about PayPal. So that's sort of what we…AT: And Dan Schulman has proven to be a really shrewd operator and a really smart guy.BI: Absolutely. They got into Bitcoin early. And again -- I'm not pushing Bitcoin on this, nor to anyone. I never really talk much about it. But they're very progressive in what they do in terms of going into technologies. And are also very, very trusted. There were several academic studies done that said that people are much more likely to spend online if PayPal’s involved, right, which shows you the trust factor in the company. I think that's…AT: And I think there's a lot of I'll age myself, the kids out there, who use Venmo don't even realize that PayPal owns it.BI: Exactly, exactly. I mean, that's one of the things that Dan does really well is getting into things to try and get people comfortable with electronic payments. And Venmo is one of those companies where it became a verb. I like companies that become verbs.AT: Yeah.BI: you Google something or Uber there or, I can Venmo you this. When a company comes becomes a verb, it's going to be the first thing that the kids today teach the older people. You teach me how to Venmo, or you teach me how to Uber. Becoming a verb I think is a massive thing.AT: So you said you don't like to talk about Bitcoin but I am going to ask you something. You said you’re long Bitcoin. It peaked mid-August about 12,300. It's now trading a little over 10,000? Are you long it as a hedge against the dollar, which you're also long right now, because you think it's the future of finance, or crypto or the Blockchain, excuse me itself is going to really fundamentally revolutionize everything, what is your big picture view on Bitcoin?BI: I think at least in the short term, Bitcoin is the winner of a space that's not going away. And that's really the whole thesis. And I don't want to overplay it, not one of these people, that's I've converted 30% of my cash into bitcoin. It's not like that. It's a few hundred dollars here and there, a few thousand dollars here and there. When it dives, which it does often as matter of fact, you know, the price that I buy it at, continues to climb. I like that.There was a time where I did an interview with TD Ameritrade where I told them, if it gets down to 3,000, I'll buy some more. And right around March, middle of March or so, during the height of the sell-off, it got down there, not quite to 3,000, but 3,800, I think. And I did buy some more there. And then I said, well, okay, now buy some of it gets down to about 6,000. And it did that. So I bought a little bit more there, and then at 8,000. And now it's about 8,000 or so at 500. But if it gets down there, I'll buy a little bit more. And it's not it's no great shakes.I promise you it's not like a huge pile of Bitcoin in the floor of my closet. It's not like that. Just something that I don't want to miss out on technologies. I'm from the trading floor, originally, the Chicago pits, I left there very early. And it wasn't because I'm smart. It was just because I didn't want to rely on technology, meaning the pits the yelling and screaming, that I knew was going to go away at some point. So I wanted to reinvent myself before I had to reinvent myself. I feel the same way about cryptocurrencies. And it's also the reason that I own PayPal is because I want to make sure that I'm involved in things in a small way that force me to study them and see if they're going to be right or not. And that's kind of what the thesis for me for Bitcoin is, it's the winner of a space, I don't believe it's going away.Can that change? Sure. And if it changes, I assure you that everything I have in Bitcoin is going to go to zero very quickly. Because these things are moving at a pace that my generation can't even recognize. But that's why I keep it small. It’s just something I want to be involved.SA: Now we've talked about the future a bit with PayPal, and Bitcoin. I want to go a little old school on -- as an old CME tech guy, there's perhaps been no bigger winner during the recovery from the pandemic lows than those who were long lumber futures, and it kind of coincided with a massive rise in homebuilding. We just -- I think new home starts just printed over a million for August.BI: That's great.SA: First time since 2006,BI: 1.01 I think it was.SA: We know in 2006 was like. But lumber prices have, I don't know if crashed, crashed is probably the wrong word, let's say they've tumbled quite a bit in the past few weeks. They've gone from over close to 900 to 600 or so. Is that telling us something? Or is that just volatility in a super pumped up market?BI: So two things on that, nothing will make a stock or a commodity or a future fall quicker than long liquidation. People selling out longs that either have made a profit or look like they're going to lose some of the profit, most active investors and traders and there's a decent amount of them in things like lumber, money left on the table bothers them more than losses. So when you see something rise as quickly as lumber did, and then it starts to fall, it's almost like panic profit taking. And I think that's part of what happened in lumber.But I do believe that the shift to work from home is very real. I am now 100% from home and pre-pandemic I wasn't. I did about 30%, 40% of my work still at the exchange, and some of that was having meetings. Some of that was doing TV spots, whether it be Bloomberg or CNN or CNBC or whatever were all still done at the exchange. As far as I know, all of that's gone for good.So I'm one of the people that's leaving the big city. Myself and my wife are leaving October 9 to go somewhere quiet or where we can be in a larger place. I live about six minute bike ride from the Chicago Board of Trade right now. I won't in a month. So I think that lumber futures are going to base at a much higher level. And home builders are going to be strong for quite some time once that initial blast is gone. And then as the economy gets stronger, if work from home stays with a stronger economy, then there'll be a spike again.SA: Wow. And I just have to say I was at Home Depot the other day, I think a two by four was like $6.50 or something.BI: Wow.SA: Inflation is somewhereSA: Yeah, I'm looking at it. I'm looking at a chart. So lumber, let's call it was it $500. And then it went over $900. And now it's back to five and change. So it's almost on a round trip in that big spike, but you're thinking, maybe this is the -- I won’t call it a floor, but where it can base from? So thinly traded market, I'm assumingBI: I appreciate you’re not trying to pin me down. But I do think it's pretty much the floor. I'm not telling anyone to buy it. I don't own it. I don't trade lumber futures much. As a matter of fact, I can't tell you the last time I did. But it's because of that low liquidity. So it's not the most active market in terms of volume. But yeah, I do think that. And again, the reason for me is people, other than if kids could get back to school, work from home will become very popular, it's already popular of course. But I don't have kids, and I really like it.But I hear from my friends and my family who do have kids that their kids are driving them crazy. But there's no doubt about it, that companies are going to reduce their real estate portfolios. The amount of office space they need to lease is going to shrink dramatically. I did see -- his name escapes me now but one of the C suite people at BlackRock said that he can't figure out how to get culture right, company culture in a work from home environment.So I could see things like retreats, or even two days in the office three days out with a rotating staff. But I dare say this isn't going to be the last pandemic. Maybe the next one's 100 years from now, I don't know. But I don't think this is going to be the last one. And I think a lot of people can -- whether they be concerned for their health, or they just don't want to take a shower anymore. I don't care what it is, are getting comfortable. And companies are finding that the productivity can actually be very high. I think it's a permanent switch.AT: I think -- I don't know about the showering part. But I think people will be thrilled not to have to commute, as I've done for years living in North Jersey, like the commute added at least three hours a day to my day, and that was a good commute. So and I think then, to your point I think a lot of people are thinking I don't need to be this close to a major urban center. If you have kids, it is very hard having them home and working from home if they're doing school from home.BI: Well simply no gain for me because I mentioned that I was a six minute bike ride. I actually rode my bike. Right now I'm not riding my bike and pack it on the weight. But otherwise…AT: Yes, the pandemic carbs -- pandemic is getting noticed that way.BI: Like COVID-19 pounds.AT: Yes, before we move on, and we appreciate your time here today. You mentioned the home builder. Do you -- are you long any home builders right now?BI: No, no, I'm not. It's not an area I understand, to be honest. Seems to be just people are buying homes, the home builders go up. But there's intricacies in certain stocks that I don't really understand. And that's it. I just kind of stay away from those now, if we if our technical team saw a price pattern that they liked that, that would work. But the seasonalities, and which home builder builds better homes and the styling aspects of it is just not something I understand.AT: So Bob, before we wrap and I don't know if you if you still trade energy futures anymore, but unlike lumber, oil has been -- WTI at least has been noticeably flat after Of course crashing below zero but then it rallied back to around the $40 level, a pretty straight shot and it's been hovering around that level for several months now. And I don't recall who was one of our recent guests said if you just get some positive news in the economy, you could see a big jump in oil. The fact that it's holding up here is a bullish sign. Do you have any position in oil and or any thoughts on the next move for crude from here?BI: So we got a long oil, September 8. Not at the lows, we actually got long while it was falling. And we're back to positive in that position now. And I would agree with that other guests, when you look at crude oil, specifically the -- here's the fun thing about crude oil. When you ask if I still trade energy, we still trade quite a bit of it. It's one of my favorite things to trade. And I like things. I like simple supply and demand markets. Those are my favorite to look at. Because then all you have to do is make a conclusion as to whether you think there's going to be some exogenous shock, you can see. There's always the risk of an exogenous shock. You can't see, like a virus, but you just say, okay, is there going to be supply or demand shock in the near future, is going to be a hurricane? Is there going to be war in the Middle East?Otherwise, is the supply demand balanced or not? And currently, the crude oil supply and demand is pretty balanced. And which is why I agree with whichever guests you have that said that, because the faster route is a change in supply. But that's generally telegraphed. And the surprise would be an increase in demand. But I don't think it's going to be much of an increase in demand. And I say that based on some of the things we talked about earlier, the lack of people going back to work, for example. There's going to be a percentage of the population that's afraid of this virus for years to come, and may not want to get on an aeroplane, may not want to take a drive, may not want to drive to work, may not want to carpool at all.So I don't really understand how big of a spike in demand that can be. Having said that, I think we're going to see a move back up to $44, $45, probably before this -- this podcast has gotten stale. I don't think we'll see $70 oil again. I don't. Let me make that $80, just so I can give myself a little bit of room, yeah,We're going to run low on U.S. supply. But I think demand destruction is very real from people wanting to kind of stay cooped up, after this, six or seven months of being cooped up, they've gotten used to it, to destruction of vacations, to electric cars. We've got Volvo who is going to go all electric, Volkswagens going to go all electric, the success that Tesla has had at least from PR perspective. I think demand destruction is very, very real. And over time, that's going to erode the value of crude oil in the general market. And then when you combine that with the idea that OPEC is going to have quite a bit of control, over price as the U.S. continues to decline in production.I mean in July, U.S. was still the largest producer. So but that supply of U.S. crude oil is going to fall off a cliff because of the nature of shale drilling, where most of the oil comes out in the very beginning. And rig counts are down about 73% in the U.S. now. So the U.S. supply is going to fall off a cliff. You combine that with a little bit of a boost in demand. And I think your other guest is going to be right. And that's why we're long it. But we're not going to hold it very long. We're not going to hold it much past $48 to $52. I think that's going to be sort of the trigger point for it to settle in again. It will go sideways for long stretches of time. And then it goes into a protracted trend that usually lasts about three to six months. I'm waiting to see that next trend. And I think it's probably up.SA: I'm looking at a story on our site this morning, BP tumbled to 25 year low.BI: I mean, even British Petroleum said recently that they think peak demand is here for crude oil, and I find that a little bit fatalistic. But I think it's probably pretty close. It's not a matter -- I mean, if once we learn that we're not going to run out of oil, this is not a climate mandate, or any, this is just people are switching over. I mean, there's climate change activists, there's climate change deniers, and then there's most of the rest of us where we believe it's happening. And we're not really sure what the cause of it is. But cleaner air is better, right? I mean, just in general, cleaner air is better. So who argues with that?SA: Yeah, and the BP management is interesting is as they manage an oil company, but don't appear to be particularly interested in producing oil anymore.BI: Like what 500 mile batteries is the sort of the Holy Grail, and autonomous driving is the Holy Grail. And you put those two things together. Anyone that's working on autonomous driving is also working on doing that driving with electric cars. So there's going to be a point in the future where you don't need to own a car, anywhere. That's long ways down the road. But companies like Uber, if they can get to autonomous driving, and then they have an electric vehicle fleet, I mean, who needs oil?AT: Yeah. Right. And so last question, I promise, I would think that there's an opportunity here for some energy stocks, which have been real dogs, which maybe is even I guess, it's an insult to dogs. I love dogs. So what you know, BP it's got a 12% dividend yield. I mean, do you have any positions in energy stocks and or do you think there's an opportunity there or are you just happy to trade the futures?BI: So two things? No, we don't have any energy stocks, although we have in the past. The Stock Think Tank portfolio is more medium term. So we do take in some dividends here and there but they're not really figured into our thesis of why we own something but for people who want to own something that's likely to be stable. My favorite of those is Valero. Honestly, I think Valero is the most solid company to own. And in terms of the energy companies and their performance, Valero -- VLO, the ticker for anyone who doesn't know, Valero is the one that mimics crude oil, the closest of the larger energy names.Having said that, I've seen periods of time where crude oil was up 70% and Valero was up 40$ and Chevron was up 30% and Exxon was down 9%. So if you have a thesis on crude oil, I'll give you something that's 100% correlated to crude oil, crude oil. So if you have if you have a thesis on crude oil, and you want to take advantage of it in the best place, you want to be in the Crude Oil Futures. Even USO is only about 49% crude oil contracts. And it's a mix of other things and doesn't really mimic crude oil as closely as you would like. Even the ETFs don't really work.So if your thesis is on the energy companies, that's fine. There's nothing wrong with that, there's nothing wrong with getting that dividend and hoping that the stock recovers or predicting that stock’s going to recover, I shouldn't say hope but from a perspective of you have opinion on crude oil, and you want to express that opinion in the market, you need to be in crude oil.AT: All right, well, Bob, I really appreciate your time today. We covered a lot of ground and it's been great having you on today.BI: Well, I appreciate it now. In the words of Captain America I can do this all day so don't worry about it.SA: Thanks Bob.

4377055,105864,2020-09-30T15:15:32-04:00,"PayPal has performed exceptionally well during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 2020 Q2 having record financial success.PayPal's primary exposure to the e-commerce market rather than in-person gives it a better outlook compared to peers.PayPal's valuation is fairly high but if it can sustainably continue to grow, in the digital payments age, it will be a great investment.","In my article about the ETFMG Prime Mobile Payments ETF (IPAY), I discussed some of the top holdings, including PayPal (PYPL), Square (SQ), Visa (V), and Mastercard (MA). Out of the four, I believe PayPal has the best outlook moving forward, though the others are primed for the digital payments industry growth as well. All of PayPal's financial figures that I cite in this article are from its 2020 Q2 Investor Updates and Results filings.PayPal primarily makes money from transaction fees from its merchant sellers. They set up online payment systems with PayPal and PayPal takes a cut of every transaction. This setup means consumers must also have a PayPal account, which also means every transaction requires at least two active PayPal accounts. This two-sided network is a competitive advantage for PayPal, as noted by CEO Dan Schulman.PayPal also makes money in its Peer-to-Peer (P2P) segment with users sending each other payments via PayPal or Venmo. There are over 40 million Venmo users in the U.S., which is about 20% of the over 18 U.S. population. PayPal can receive transaction fees for faster transfers to bank accounts. It also receives interest on money left in accounts. This can quickly add up as U.S. consumers on average leave $485 in their PayPal accounts vs. just $196 in their wallets.Source: PayPal 2020 Q2 Investor UpdatePayPal has experienced record growth as a result of the pandemic. Merchants who were unable to continue in-person sales moved online. This lead to 21.3 million total new accounts with 1.7 million new merchant accounts added in 2020 Q2.Source: PayPal 2020 Q2 Investor UpdateTotal Payment Volume (TPV) grew 30% despite a ~60% drop in verticals most affected by the pandemic. This shows that while PayPal is hurt in some sectors by the pandemic, it was able to more than recover the losses from the massive increases in e-commerce transactions, in general.Most importantly, PayPal was confident enough in the performance of the most recent quarter and future trends to raise guidance for Q3 and also the fiscal year. For fiscal year 2020, PayPal now expects to see a 22% YoY growth in revenue and 25% growth YoY in EPS.Since PayPal concentrates most of its business to online merchants and digital P2P payments, it was less affected than some of its peers. Square saw a 17% decline in revenues in its seller ecosystem business which primarily targets in-person sales at small businesses which is a segment most affected by the pandemic. However, in contrast, its CashApp business, a competitor to PayPal's P2P services, saw massive growth similar to PayPal. Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) also faced headwinds as much of their business is also via in-person transactions (card present). Visa reported a 50% decline in April and 20% decline in May YoY in in-person transaction volumes.PayPal was founded as a digital payment company, initially as part of the eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) platform but later spun off to accomplish even greater reach. In my article on IPAY, I argue that the digital payments industry will be significantly accelerated by the pandemic. PayPal is still one of the leaders of this industry and committed to staying there. CEO Dan Schulman affirms this, saying:Data by YChartsPayPal has had a significant run-up since the pandemic began, both in price and P/E ratio. The current P/E ratio is about 88x which is relatively high compared to the current S&P 500 ratio of 28x. Visa and Mastercard are hovering around 40-45x. Square's ratio has skyrocketed recently and sits above 200x. PayPal's valuation certainly is not cheap, but similar to Square, it is priced for growth. The question is, can it achieve the expected growth?Data by YChartsSince 2016, PayPal has consistently grown EPS, doubling EPS from about $1 to $2.07 in 4 years. This is about a 20% CAGR. PayPal raised guidance for fiscal year 2020 to 25% EPS growth and I believe the future for digital payments is solid. Let's assume PayPal can continue to grow EPS at 20% annually on average for 5 years. This means in 2025 PayPal will have an annual EPS of $5.15. The current price as of the publication of this article is $192.80. Let's go through a few P/E ratio possibilities in 5 years and what the expected annualized ROI would be.The expected annual ROI is only significant in the ""Maintain Current P/E"" scenario with 19% annual ROI. It's questionable that PayPal can maintain this level of P/E ratio in 5 years as companies typically mature over time and no longer grow as much as they used to.Taking a more conservative approach is to look at PayPal's historical average, which is 55. This would lead to an 8% annual ROI, which is roughly the market average return. I see this as the worst-case estimate for PayPal.I do not think that PayPal will be priced with similar P/E ratios as Visa, Mastercard, or the S&P 500, which would result in very low or negative ROI. PayPal is a leader in the industry and less exposed to the current macroeconomic risks compared to Visa and Mastercard. Additionally, even in 5 years, I expect it to have higher growth prospects than the average company in the S&P 500 given its technological focus.PayPal is a strong player in the digital payments industry and the pandemic will only accelerate its growth. Its current valuation, however, is at near record high levels. If you believe PayPal can continue to maintain its current P/E ratio and growth rates, it's certainly a great buy.I plan on continuing to invest in PayPal via the diversified digital payments ETF, IPAY, as it is one of the top holdings. At PayPal's current valuation, I am not comfortable holding it as an individual stock in my portfolio which would overweight it."

Initially providing payment gateway services on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), it has expanded into a complete payment platform through acquisitions over the years. It now offers digital wallet and peer-to-peer (P2P) payment solutions, cross-border funds transfer, and credit lending. Its user base has been steadily growing. With a complete portfolio of payment solutions, it has witnessed strong growth of its user base with a market reach of over 200 countries. As the secular trends towards a global cashless society continues, digital transaction volumes will exhibit robust growth which benefits PayPal.The company is taking advantage of this by expanding its footprint across e-commerce and in-store point-of-sale (POS) both regionally and in emerging markets. Its partnerships with e-commerce giants and retailers enable users to pay seamlessly with its platform. At the same time, however, the company faces the threat of new entrants from BigTech and rival Fintech companies. Nevertheless, the company offers a competitive edge as a secure end-to-end payment facilitator which is the most trusted platform by customers. As it continues to integrate its platform services to create more value, it is likely to continue adding users and increasing engagement and payment volume growth.Source: S&P GlobalPayPal has one of the most unique business models within the payment industry. It has established a complete payment ecosystem through e-commerce expansion of its PayPal Checkout and acquisitions of third-party payment solution providers. This strategy has provided PayPal the ability to integrate many services around its gateway to increase its user base. Its most notable acquisition is Venmo, a leader in P2P payments among millennial users, allowing the company to expand into the mobile market. Besides Venmo, the company's other acquisitions include Braintree, Xoom, iZettle, Hyperwallet, Simility, GoPay and Honey.Source: PayPalBy acquiring companies across the payments value chain as seen in the diagram above, PayPal establishes its position as an end-to-end facilitator of digital payments. For example, as other businesses suffered due to COVID-19, PayPal on the other hand has witnessed a sharp rise in active users to almost 350 mln as consumers opt for contactless payment options.Source: PayPal, Khaveen InvestmentsThe integration of PayPal's services around its platform across the payments stack is its main competitive edge. It creates value to keep users engaged. Apart from retaining users, it also aligns with its strategy to continuously grow its user base. Though user growth is expected to moderate as things start to return to normal, yet with increasing integration of services, we are confident that the company will continue to see robust user growth into the future of above 15% annually as it targets 1 bln users globally. This would lead to higher user engagement and total payments volumes (TPV), contributing positively to PayPal's transactional revenue stream as it charges a processing fee from TPV.With a complete payments platform, PayPal stands to reap the benefits over the expanding digital payments market as the world moves towards a cashless economy. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, cash still represents a popular payment method accounting for over a quarter of all transactions. We expect its share to continue declining as digital payments gain popularity.Source: Federal Reserve Bank of San FranciscoThe long-term shift towards digital payments is attributable to several factors, which are:As retailers have been shutting down, e-commerce growth has accelerated, which in turn has benefited digital payment companies. Despite expecting some normalization as economies open up and restrictions start to ease, it remains a key catalyst for digital payment volumes as consumers prefer the convenience of buying online and have little choice than to use digital payment methods. PayPal is looking to benefit by integrating its platform into e-commerce by partnering with Shopify (SHOP), Etsy (ETSY) and Facebook (FB) for Instagram Checkout, allowing customers and small businesses to pay and receive payments using its checkout platform. PayPal's top 20 marketplaces recorded 40% growth in volume which approached $90 billion last year.In addition to e-commerce, there are huge opportunities that would arise from a PayPal and Venmo integration with for in-store point of sale contactless payments. The platform has recently introduced QR functionality as another touch-free form of payment. With Venmo's rapidly growing user base and shifting preference away from cash for in-store payments, PayPal is creating an omnichannel solution for merchants to accept cashless payments. It has started implementing QR payment for CVS customers in 8,200 stores throughout the US. We see PayPal expanding QR payments across its merchant base in the US, which contactless payments continue gaining popularity. The US has lagged emerging countries especially China in terms of adoption of QR. Super-apps AliPay and WeChat Pay already dominate the half a trillion Chinese digital payments market with over a billion users each, becoming indispensable for the average user to transact for anything.Besides the US, the shift towards digital payments is also seen in emerging markets, as improving internet connectivity and higher smartphone ownership rates reduce adoption barriers. According to a Visa (V) report, more than two bln people and 200 mln small businesses lack access to financial services, most located in emerging economies. This presents PayPal with tremendous opportunities to tap these markets. In South America, PayPal is partnering with MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) to incorporate its platform on its e-commerce site. Mercado is touted the Amazon (AMZN) of the fast growing LATAM e-commerce market with nearly 20% of share or $14 bln in gross merchant value. This would deepen PayPal's reach in the region where 70% of the population in unbanked. Additionally, it has also partnered with mobile commerce leader Gojek in South East Asia to incorporate its payment platform. Point is PayPal is connecting leading marketplaces and payment networks globally.The global payments industry is highly competitive with rapid changes from innovative solutions. Not only does PayPal face competition from digital payments companies, but it is also faced with new threats from the entrance of BigTech such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). These companies are leveraging their strong user bases to capture some of the growth opportunities of digital payments by introducing their own digital wallets.Source: PayPal, Square, Forbes, QZ, MerchantSavvyApple is proving a strong competitor to PayPal. Launched in 2014, Apple Pay's user base has grown rapidly. Nearly half of all iPhone users are using Apple Pay, higher than PayPal with 100 mln more users. While Apple currently has a higher user base, the major downside is that it is only compatible within the iOS sphere. This means that only Apple product users are able to use Apple Pay. On the other hand, PayPal is an agnostic service and has no such limitation as it can be installed on any phone.PayPal has managed to secure a strategic partnership with Google. At first, users could add PayPal on Google Pay to pay for services such as Gmail, YouTube, Google Play and Google Store purchases. It has further integrated with Google Pay to enable contactless NFC payments between customers and merchants. This benefits PayPal as it can be saved on Google's hundreds of mlns of user accounts.Apart from BigTech, PayPal has to contend with rival Fintech competitors, the largest being Square (SQ). The company is similar to PayPal as its services encompass mobile P2P, digital wallets and retail PoS hardware. Offering a slightly more competitive fee than PayPal, Square has managed to penetrate this highly competitive market targeting smaller merchants. Yet, PayPal offers a superior level of integration as a specialized e-commerce payments provider for online merchants with physical footprints.In P2P, Square's Cash App is growing rapidly with above 60% user growth year on year, outpacing that of Venmo's growth at 50%. Its strategy targeting specific consumer networks with partnerships with popular brands such as TikTok allowed it to gain popularity among Millennials and Gen Z consumers. While Square was able to scale both processing and P2P payments successfully, Venmo can also capitalize on PayPal's integration to offer additional services. Additionally, PayPal is still the larger platform with a larger reach of more than 200 countries while Square's international operations is still limited.Overall, despite the entry of new market participants, we remain confident in PayPal's prospects as it has a complete payment platform with extensive market reach after many years of experience in this field.As PayPal's revenue is mainly derived from processing payment transactions, we forecast its revenue growth based on total digital payments volume growth. Due to factors of rising e-commerce adoption, contactless payments at the PoS and internet connectivity and smartphone ownership, our expectations of transaction volume growth of 23% is in line with industry average. Assuming PayPal maintains its share over total transaction volumes, as an integral platform globally, we see its payment volume reaching $2,662 bln in 2025.Source: PayPal, Research and Markets and StatistaDespite the strong growth in the company's payment volumes, it has trouble converting that volume into revenue. As seen below, PayPal's take rate on transactions, which is total revenue divided by total payment volume has been declining since 2012. The reason is because of PayPal's P2P volume growth, which has a lower transaction revenue than its traditional processing fee of 2.9%. In 2019, Venmo had revenues of $450 mln from $102 bln in transaction volumes, representing a take rate of just 0.44%.Source: PayPalHowever, PayPal plans to monetize P2P volumes by launching QR payments and partnering with Synchrony Financial (SYF) to launch Venmo credit cards, this could see an increase in PayPal's take rate. Nevertheless, we believe it will take time to fully monetize its P2P volumes as its competitors might take advantage. We forecast a moderate decline in take rate to project PayPal's revenues.Source: PayPal, Khaveen InvestmentsOverall, we see PayPal's revenue growing at an average rate of 16.72% from 2021. Now that we have obtained the revenue growth, we apply a DCF analysis to calculate its intrinsic value.Source: Khaveen InvestmentsBased on a DCF analysis, with an EV/EBITDA multiple of 41.43x (digital payments industry average) and a discount rate of 11.7%, our model shows an upside of 10.97% from current market value based on an estimated average revenue growth of 16.72% (before tapering out in 2027).PayPal is an experienced player in digital payments, and the company has made the right moves in expanding its services to support its core value proposition by acquiring emerging payment startups. Its vast ecosystem now encompasses the payments stack with digital wallets, P2P, lending and many more. This represents its strategy to achieve robust user growth which in turn leads to higher user engagement and transaction volume.As it continues to solidify its position with partnerships across online and in-store commerce, both regionally and in emerging markets, the company is poised to benefit from the growing global digital transaction volumes despite growing competition. While its take rate has been declining, revenues are still expected to grow at an average of 16.72%, not to mention monetization efforts of its fast-growing P2P segment. Overall, we rate PayPal as a Buy with a target price of $217.51.Note: For more research and analysis of high-quality companies within the global fintech industry, please click the ""Follow"" icon at the top of this page."

Currently, the service is offered to U.S. account holders only via the PayPal platform, with expansion into international markets and its Venmo subsidiary slated for early 2021. Whilst we are excited about the prospect of PayPal's opportunity to generate additional trading revenues, we are most excited about enabling its digital wallet users to spend the cryptocurrencies at merchant locations. In the near future, PayPal intends on enabling its users to pay with cryptocurrencies by converting the selected cryptocurrency into the merchant's national currency, ensuring that merchants are always paid on time without being exposed to the constant fluctuations in value of cryptocurrencies.At the announcement, Dan Schulman, president and CEO of PayPal, said: ""The shift to digital forms of currencies is inevitable, bringing with it clear advantages in terms of financial inclusion and access; efficiency, speed and resilience of the payments system; and the ability for governments to disburse funds to citizens quickly. Our global reach, digital payments expertise, two-sided network, and rigorous security and compliance controls provide us with the opportunity, and the responsibility, to help facilitate the understanding, redemption and interoperability of these new instruments of exchange.""In-app UI of PayPal's cryptocurrency serviceSource: PayPal NewsroomNewer Merchants are more likely to adopt bitcoin paymentsAn early 2020 survey by HSB revealed that about 36% of American SMEs accept bitcoin, with 59% of those companies purchasing the currency for their own usage. 21% of bitcoin-accepting companies have been in business for more than 20 years, while 47% have been in business for less than five years. A clear trend is emerging in that newer companies are more willing to adopt cryptocurrencies in their daily transactions.Several blue-chip companies have attempted to adopt the usage of bitcoin within their ecosystem. However, adoption has not been consistent within the companies as the usage of bitcoin tends to be limited to a certain segment of their ecosystem and processed by third-party cryptocurrency wallet providers.One of the early notable merchants to first adopt cryptocurrency was Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment since late 2014. Xbox users can add up to $1,000 in credit to their account in a single day, with a $5,000 credit lifetime limit per account. Despite the enthusiasm and interest in bitcoin of Microsoft founder Bill Gates its adoption has not been consistent on the platform. Microsoft halted the acceptance of bitcoin for a brief period between 2017 and 2018, impinged by high transaction fees and volatile prices.BitPay is the most prominent bitcoin processor for payments.BitPay, launched in 2011, is the most prominent third-party transaction processor for bitcoin, partnering with a range of well-known companies from Amazon's video live streaming service, Twitch, to cosmetics retailer, Lush. BitPay partners can accept bitcoins via their website, e-mail, or in person using a mobile POS device, incurring a 1% transaction fee and receive payments in most of the world's major currencies.Investing in bitcoin and QR code payment opportunity is vital for PayPal, given that it allows to broaden its payments offerings to offline brick-and-mortar businesses which currently constitute ~80% of all retail sales. Given the increased free cash flow windfall from the move to digital payments during the pandemic, management announced an additional $300m of investment in H2 2020.PayPal sees itself benefiting from a ""HALO"" effect as consumers using it online are also more likely to use it for offline purchases given the positive brand identity it enjoys. We see PayPal's QR code and Bitcoin payment offering as a significant driver of growth in the medium to long term, given…1. PayPal is best-positioned in the payments sector to drive QR code and Bitcoin-based payments in the USUnlike any other payment company, PayPal is best-positioned to drive QR code and bitcoin-based payments given its scale of 150-175m US users. The scale makes it impossible for merchants of any size to ignore PayPal enabled mobile payments. Versus competitors, Square (NYSE:SQ) comes closest with a digital wallet which had 30m users at the end of H1 2020. Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) do not have digital wallets serving customers directly. Zelle, another P2P payments platform backed by banks and credit unions in the US, is another big player in the digital wallets space which had forecasted to overtake the number of Venmo users (40m in 2018 versus 60m in Q2 2020) back in 2018.2. The onset of the pandemic is driving merchants to demand touchless payment solutionsFurthermore, with the onset of the pandemic, users are more likely to use touchless payments such as QR codes and bitcoin, driving merchants to reach out to PayPal and demand touchless payment solutions. Currently, PayPal is working with more than 100 large retailers across the US and Europe, including the likes of pharmacy giant CVS (NYSE:CVS) to provide QR code-based payments. We don't see any reason why PayPal cannot also provide bitcoin payment solutions along with its QR-code based payment solutions to the same merchants.3. Strong value proposition for using digital wallets will fuel user adoptionThe ability to add reward points for customers every time they pull out a PayPal or a Venmo digital wallet will be a key driver of adoption. Acquisition of Honey will provide further impetus for users to use the Venmo and PayPal apps to make offline purchases as it allows merchants to integrate some of Honey's discount offerings. Merchants could also use proximity messaging features to provide customers with offers to increase sales.In early 2018, Square allowed almost all its cash app users to buy and sell bitcoins. The business now accounts for 2.6% of overall net revenues, up from only 0.4% in Q2 2019 as ""Stay at Home"" measures saw Cash App users increasingly engage in trading Bitcoins.Adj. Bitcoin Rev growth accounted for 2.6% of Square's Q2 adj RevSource: Square's quarterly reports and AlphaTech EquitiesWith the aim of monetising its digital wallets, Square has been adding multiple revenue engines to its Cash App over the years with bitcoin becoming an important avenue of growth during the pandemic.Monetisation of Square's Cash AppSource: Square's Unit Economics presentation March 2020However, there are significant differences between Square and PayPal regarding the Bitcoin opportunity, includingThe power of scale: Square's Cash App has 30m versus PayPal and Venmo combined 150-175m users in the US. The scale difference is a key differentiator for PayPal as it allows the company more power to build out a nationwide merchant acceptance network to enable bitcoins and QR code payments.Q2 2020 # of users in million: PayPal has 5x the users vs. SquareSource: PayPal and Square Q2 2020 transcriptsSpending with bitcoin: Square's Cash App only allows users to buy and sell bitcoins versus PayPal, which in addition to allowing its users to trade bitcoins will also enable them to spend cryptocurrencies at merchant locations.Multiple currencies: Unlike Square which only allows trading of bitcoin, PayPal will allow users to deal in multiple digital currencies, including Ethereum and Litecoin. According to coinmarketcap.com, the current global cryptocurrency market capitalisation is at $393bn, with bitcoin accounting for 60.8%, Ethereum 11.9%, bitcoin cash at 1.28% and Litecoin a 0.92% of the total market share.Online presence: Given PayPal's flagship product of online wallets, it makes it much easier for the company to enable customers to spend bitcoin via digital channels versus Square which operates mostly as a tech-enabled acquirer for SMBs.We see management increasing its execution pace on monetising its digital wallets with the launch of bitcoin services. PayPal's rev per user at c. $9 is significantly lower than that of rival Square at $45 per user. Whilst bitcoin trading should give a significant monetisation boost in the short to medium term, we are particularly excited about PayPal enabling payments at retailers via bitcoins in the US.Rev per user for Cash App is significantly higher than PayPal's VenmoSource: Square and PayPal's Q2 earnings transcriptsSince we published our initiation coverage report on PayPal earlier this month (link here), shares have outperformed the broader S&P 500 index by c.5%.

We upgrade our price target to $239 and are now ""Very Bullish"" on the stock.PayPal's valuations are rich but for a good reasonOur short-term financials remain unchanged for the time being but we will monitor the bitcoin trading launch closely to see how it impacts monetisation of its digital wallets for 2021 and beyond.Source: AlphaTech EquitiesWe see PayPal as the best-in-class digital payments company, well-positioned to benefit from the move to e-commerce during the pandemic.

Merchants launching not only new use cases for online businesses but also adopting a digital-first strategy.We are most excited about the potential for mobile payments in the US. We see PayPal as best-positioned to capture the biggest market share in the form factor pivot of payments to mobile payments, given its scale both on the side of consumers (150 to 175m US consumers) and merchants. We are most excited about its recent announcement to launch its QR code and bitcoin payments network.Tech savvy CEO Daniel Schulman took the helm in July 2015 and has been instrumental in transforming the business from a product (PayPal Checkout) company to a complete digital platform company, boasting of some of the leading fintech products in the industry such as Venmo, Xoom and Honey, among others. First out of the blocks on the launch of bitcoin and QR code payments, he has proved to be a visionary once again.We upgrade the stock to ""Very Bullish"" with a price target of $239, imputing an upside of 18%."
4374903,69905,2020-09-17T11:17:37-04:00,"Paypal is pointing towards solid growth rates ahead, with 20% plus revenues expected.Guiding for $5 billion plus of free cash flow in 2020.Despite its solid growth potential and strong free cash flow generation, this stock still trades for less 40x free cash flow.","PayPal (PYPL) is growing at a very strong pace and guides towards 20% plus revenue growth rates. Given its strong positive operating leverage, the more its top-line expands the stronger its free cash flow potential.The stock trades for less than 40x free cash flow, which is cheaply valued in the present market. This stock is worth considering.PayPal is a renowned digital payment solution. It operates on a global scale connecting consumers and merchants.PayPal is showing no signs of slowing down. Indeed, as of Q2 2020, its active accounts were up 21% y/y, with more than 26 million active merchant accounts. Arguably, the best indicator that PayPal continues to plow ahead is its growth in total payments volume. Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationThis strong and stable increase in payment volume is being reflected in PayPal's high revenue growth rates.Source: author's calculations; **company guidance, using GAAP guidancePayPal's guidance guides investors that despite its size, it's showing no sign of slowing down. On the contrary, compared with 2019, PayPal's revenue growth rates are pointed towards being faster in 2020 than they were in 2019.As investors, we have become accustomed to having to choose between either solid cash flows or growing top lines.In the case of PayPal, as highlighted above, its growth rates are highly enticing, while at the same time its cash flows are incredibly alluring. Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationAs you can see above, PayPal's free cash flow more than doubled from Q2 2019 to $2.2 billion in Q2 2020.Even if this pace of growth is not sustainable, investors can are still able to see that as PayPal continues to grow at scale that its cash flows are now starting to percolate in -- and doing so at a very rapid clip.In fact, part of the allure of PayPal is its high operating leverage. This means that the more its top line grows, given that its costs are not fully variable and are somewhat fixed, there's potential for free cash flow as a percentage of revenue to increase dramatically (as seen above).As a sanity check, you can see this trend being echoed in PayPal's income statement:Source: Q2 2020 Investor PresentationHence, altogether this bodes well for the company as it continues to plow ahead, and the more it grows on the top line, there's a disproportional and positive effect on the bottom line.Having said that, as I noted earlier, this high level of operating leverage expansion is not likely to be sustainable, and despite already generating approximately $3.5 billion of free cash flow in H1 2020, PayPal's guidance for FY 2020 only puts its free cash flow at above $5 billion. In other words, investors should not expect to see a similar amount of free cash flow being generated in H2 2020 as PayPal made in H1 2020. A more realistic estimate could be for PayPal's H2 2020 free cash flow to reach around $2 billion.Before addressing its valuation, I'll touch on PayPal's rapidly growing opportunity, Venmo.Venmo facilitates person-to-person transactions. Venmo collects revenues when customers make transfers of funds to their bank accounts. However, the fees from Venmo are lower than the fees from PayPal's platform. (Source)Venmo is the number 2 finance app in the Apple (AAPL) store. The number being Venmo's competitor Cash App (SQ).Both apps are digital wallets and have substantial overlap. While Venmo is more of a pure-play and simpler digital wallet than Cash App, while Cash App has more features such as well as the ability to buy bitcoin or fractional shares of stocks.During Q2 2020, Venmo's total payment volume was up 52% y/y. PayPal doesn't report Venmo's revenues separately, making comparisons in revenue growth rates with Square's Cash App largely meaningless.Having said that, during PayPal's Q2 2020 earnings call, PayPal noted that Venmo's revenue growth rates were higher than 60% y/y.Hence, enough detail can be discerned to see that Venmo's volumes and revenues are growing faster than PayPal's total platform volumes and revenues which were up 30% and 25%, respectively.Indeed, PayPal's 10-Q, states that transaction revenues grew more slowly than volume in part because of Venmo's rapid growth was stronger than PayPal's platform and that Venmo's transaction fees are lower than PayPal's. PayPal trades for less than 40x its 2020 free cash flow, assuming roughly $5.5 billion of free cash flow in 2020.In the present market, we are seeing a very large discrepancy between investors' clamor for high growth stocks which are unprofitable and companies which generate very strong profits and cash flow not being particularly highly valued and fashionable.Having said that, as long as PayPal is able to continue ticking along at and growing its top line at 20%, as it currently expects to, there's no fundamental reason for Paypal not to expect a small amount of multiple expansion, particularly if its growth rates and cash flow generation remains as strong as its pointing towards for 2020.Consider this, as I looking elsewhere there are not many companies in the past COVID environment expected to grow at their revenues at approximately plus 20%, which are still being priced at just less than 40x free cash flow.PayPal may be entering a more mature part of its business cycle, but it doesn't appear to be showing any signs of slowing down.In fact, quite the opposite, as its guidance points towards PayPal accelerating its revenues. This stock is worthwhile considering as part of a well-diversified portfolio."
4372953,105617,2020-09-08T05:00:00-04:00,PYPL already has seen strong growth in TPV and active accounts and expects both to grow substantially in 2H.E-commerce is expected to reach up to 30% of total retail sales for the holiday season and PayPal will be a large beneficiary.Revenues for Q4 could reach as high as $7b and EPS for the fiscal year could jump above $4 due to strong e-commerce holiday tailwinds.,"PayPal's (PYPL) growth has been unchecked since March, with shares rising over 130% on e-commerce and contactless payment tailwinds. PayPal has been a solid beneficiary of the shift to e-commerce shopping and should continue to do so as the holiday season nears. Given that we still have not yet gotten significantly closer to a vaccine, and that major stores are closing doors temporarily for BFCM shopping, e-commerce is expected to surge, and with that, PayPal could find more significant tailwinds and growth.PayPal already generates a significant share of digital payments and is continually growing its reach as well, reflected by its highest TPV yet during the previous quarter. TPV grew 29% to $222 billion, with merchant services (top marketplaces/platforms) delivering 92% growth ahead of eBay's (EBAY) 34%, aided by a recovery in cross border trade TPV.As Q3 is winding down to its final weeks, the next focus comes down to the heavy-hitting holiday season, not just for traditional retailers, but for e-commerce names too. For 2019, e-commerce holiday sales were $137.6 billion, representing ~14% of total retail sales; however, it is estimated that up to 30% of holiday sales in 2020 could be driven by e-commerce, leaving significant room for PayPal to benefit. KBW has already named PayPal as the best idea for 2H due to these e-commerce tailwinds for the holidays.Prior shifts to e-commerce boosted PayPal's active users as well as payment volumes for 1H. PayPal saw active accounts grow from 305 million in Q4 19 to 346 million by the end of Q2 20, with both Q1 and Q2 adding 20.2 million and 21.3 million. For comparison, PayPal only added 9 million accounts in Q2 2019, so 2020 saw Q2's active accounts double, helped by the recent acquisition of Honey.As PayPal is growing active accounts at a faster clip now than during the previous year, payment transactions in a seasonally higher holiday Q4 should benefit tremendously.Source: Investor PresentationWhile Q1 showed weak payment transactions due to extremely hard hit travel and event-related transactions, Q2 reflected a strong rise by YoY and QoQ. But there was still ""~47% fewer travel and event transactions"" for Q2 20 compared to Q2 19. So while travel and events still have yet to recover, PayPal already has shown recovery in payment transactions.Carrying this over to the holiday season shows a substantial area of growth. PayPal is already expecting significant growth to remain for 2H - 70 million more accounts expected to be added, TPV growth of 30%, and revenue guidance at 25%. Q2 saw nearly a quarter of a million new accounts added daily, and 37% growth in DAU - this is basically ""‘Cyber 5’-like usage for an entire quarter."" Q3 and Q4 are expected to see up to 300,000 or more new accounts added daily and similar growth in DAU from holiday shopping tailwinds. Cyber-5 like usage for Q2 will be trounced by the actual Cyber-5 usage, as dozens of stores are already planning to be closed for Thanksgiving sales.Converting the expected growth to payment transactions and TPV points to historically large quarters ahead for PayPal. Active accounts could hit 425 million by year-end, and PayPal is likely to retain a good proportion of new adds due to high average payment volume per user (39.2 transactions) as well as loyalty benefits, cash-back and rewards, and a new interest-free installment payment option.PayPal's installments will be available for purchases ranging from $30 to $600, and will last a six-week period. It's seeking to ""help merchants drive conversion, revenue and customer loyalty without taking on additional risk or paying any additional fees"" and while that does up the credit risk a bit, it's likely to see far more usage in holiday sales on potentially squeezed disposable incomes for many.With active accounts expected to soar past 400 million, payment transaction volume should reach 4.5 billion by Q4, for a YoY growth of 29%. TPV should float up to ~$260 billion by Q4 based on user growth and expected TPV growth rates. Given that, PayPal is expecting to see quarterly revenue at or near $6.2 billion by Q4.But the tailwinds from e-commerce shopping are likely to be significant, and potentially larger than PayPal is expecting - logistics operators like FedEx (NYSE:FDX), UPS and the USPS have already increased surcharges for higher volumes. More products are expected to be shipped, aligning with the estimated surge in e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales.E-commerce could generate up to $300 billion in total sales this holiday season - that leaves incredible room for PayPal to benefit, as card-not-present transactions have already seen positive growth since May, which is a solid indicator for e-commerce growth.Should e-commerce find that sort of surge, PayPal's expected TPV near $260 billion could actually rise to $280 billion, and payment volume could push 5 billion - active accounts might float up to 430 million or 440 million, but that might be a stretch. Revenues could reach almost $7 billion for Q4 in a best-case scenario. With these potentially substantial drivers associated with e-commerce holiday sales, PayPal could find EPS in the $4.05-4.15 range for the fiscal year.PayPal has a top-of-the-line system in place that will allow it to capture significant traffic from holiday sales. Aside from powering check-outs on a majority of sites, PayPal offers purchase protection for buyers and sellers and the new installment purchasing plan. This will help facilitate online transactions and ensure that both merchants and customers are satisfied.However, as we are seeing currently, tech is falling quite rapidly with the NASDAQ down 1,200 in two days by early Friday trading - PayPal won't be immune to further sell-offs in tech, which could be a larger risk to take. Also, credit card companies like Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and American Express (AXP), to name some, will also generate a fair share of payments during the holiday season, and could pressure PayPal to a degree.Overall, PayPal should emerge as a key player this holiday season as the retail dynamic looks to be shifting rapidly towards e-commerce for the Cyber-5 shopping weekend. PayPal already witnessed Cyber-5 like usage for Q2 and forecast a strong 2H; however, the ever-increasing shift to online retail sales might surpass PayPal's strong estimates, and see the company generating record quarterly revenues near $7 billion (as active accounts pass 420 million). PayPal's offerings of installments, buyer and seller protection, loyalty rewards and cash-back help keep customer engagement rising, fueling higher average transactions per account, and a higher overall payment volume will speak numbers for PayPal's TPV growth. A strong 2H and holiday season will give PayPal a huge catalyst going into 2021."

It can be considered one of the few companies (i.e., Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), etc.) that offers both solid fundamentals and strong future growth. Analyzing the business’ status quo and its projection into the foreseeable future, I don’t see PayPal underperforming the market. If you are long equities, you should be long PayPal.SourcePayPal has a very healthy balance sheet. Over the past 5 years, PayPal has been able to consistently hold significant levels of cash, $16 billion at the end of Q2. PayPal has recently issued long-term debt of $9 billion, including the $3 billion from the revolving credit facility in March. The first repayment of the long-term debt would be a $1 billion payment in September 2022.Source: PayPal Financials, AuthorHowever, considering free cash flow and cash levels, this debt is very manageable. This becomes evident when we observe the net operating cash flows of the company. PayPal managed to grow its annual net operating cash flows more than 100% year over year, from $1.2 billion in Q2 2019 to $2.4 billion in Q2 2020. The last report in Q2 2020 shows a significant acceleration in this trend also on a quarter-over-quarter basis, with cash from operation increasing almost 60% from Q1. Net operating cash flow for the first two quarters of 2019 is only $2.2 billion. Compared to the $3.9 billion for the same period in 2020, the current CF level has significantly improved. All these factors seem to allude that PayPal has shifted to a higher gear. Now speeding towards the end of the year, where revenues tend to spike up due to holiday season, I wouldn’t be surprised to see another earnings beat in Q3 and Q4.Source: PayPal Financials, AuthorThe operating margin had taken a dip last quarter due to deteriorating economic outlook forcing the company to increase its credit losses reserves. The unemployment rate is a strong variable in this calculation, and with a stable decrease in the unemployment rate, we should see a consequent decrease in credit loss reserves and operating margin. In Q2, operating margin for the quarter was 28.2%, improving more than 0.5% year over year. This result constitutes the highest level of improvement in a quarter since the company spun off from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), contributing to forming a rosy picture for PayPal’s future.PayPal may be a healthy company with a solid balance sheet and strong cash flow, but that is not all to the story. Future digital payments growth is also what makes this company so well-positioned in the current fast-changing business environment.In June, PayPal achieved the highest growth rate as an independent company, processing $222 billion in Payment Volume in Q2. An element that kept me sceptical after Q1 was the increased proportional reliability on eBay. In Q2, other marketplaces significantly outpaced eBay’s volumes. CEO Dan Schulman confirmed that eBay will remain “a very important customer over the foreseeable future,” helping to pause concerns on this issue. E-commerce adoption has indeed functioned as an exceptional catalyst to PayPal’s revenue growth. The change in consumer behaviour that occurred in the last 3 to 6 months shifted the adoption curve forward 3 to 5 years. With customers forming new habits, and companies pushing for digital sales strategies, chances are that this trend is going to last for a long time.Not only volumes, number of customers posted sustained growth as well. The 140% growth in Q2 YoY in added accounts includes almost 2 million accounts from Honey, but the adjusted net account growth (excluding Honey) rate remains very high at 115% YoY.PayPal reported 60 million customers in Venmo, its digital wallet and mobile payments provider. In my previous article, I highlighted how Square’s (SQ) Cash App presented challenging competition due to faster adoption rates. That is likely still the case, but I believe there is space for more than one player in this market, and the two platforms can coexist as well as Alibaba's (BABA) Alipay and Tencent’s (OTCPK:TCEHY) (OTCPK:TCTZF) WeChat coexist in China. With Venmo counting double the number of Cash App accounts, management has all the tools to maintain its leadership position in this fast-growing business segment.Another catalyst for PayPal is the expanded international reach. Recent agreements with Gojek (170 million users) and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) (for cross-border transactions) are likely to contribute to international growth and revenue diversification.I have talked about the growth numbers, but not all segments are thriving in this challenging business environment. PayPal experienced a 60% decline in travel and event volumes, which represented about 10% of TPV last year. That is a significant chunk of volume and quite a bad signal for short-term business, as restriction and stay-at-home orders do not seem to be going away anytime soon. However, looking at it on a long-term time horizon, PayPal achieved a record quarter despite these challenges. Eventually, travel and events business segments will pick up again, potentially reigniting PayPal’s growth in the medium to long term.Source: Visa (V)PayPal is betting heavily on QR codes as a method of payment, and the company is expected to allocate an aggressive marketing budget to promote the QR code payments feature. Targeting big merchants is a smart move by PayPal to drive daily use. However, contactless card payments have been picking up sharply in the past few months, and PayPal QR code functionality will probably struggle to achieve the same rate of success in the short term. Payments through QR is a new experience for most customers, and certainly requires higher technical expertise for older customers than a tap-and-go feature. That being said, the QR payment feature will be integrated into PayPal Mobile and Venmo, whose customer base is on the younger side of the average population demographics. Like all new technologies, this relatively new payment option could take longer than expected to achieve the desired ROI from management.In this unprecedented time of digital transformation, any forward-looking investor is searching for growth. More conservative investors, wary of the market all-time highs, are searching for healthy balance sheets and strong cash flows. On one side, high-growth companies have great long-term potential in this historical time, but often sacrifice any real income generation to grow bigger and faster. On the other side, traditional value, money-printing stocks are lagging in market performance, as investors recognize the potential value-traps placed by accelerating innovation across numerous industries. PayPal offers the best combination of both worlds. Digital payments is growing fast as an industry, and it’s hard to see a trend reversal in the current environment. PayPal also maintains a healthy, improving balance sheet, and cash flows that should satisfy investors hungry for real meat, not just smoke. I don’t think PayPal is immune to market corrections, but I’m confident that this powerful combination will lead to market-beating returns over the long term.Author's Note: If you found this article of value and want to receive updates on this research, just click the ""follow"" button near the title.

4362158,102764,2020-07-30T05:13:13-04:00,"A high bar is hard to beat, but PayPal has just crushed very demanding earnings expectations.
        Rapid revenue growth in combination with expanding margins are driving powerful increases in earnings.
        The company is capitalizing on major tailwinds for further growth.
        Accelerating demand during the pandemic has cemented PayPal's leadership position in the industry.
        Valuation looks quite reasonable based on recent cash flow generation.","A high bar is hard to beat, and PayPal (PYPL) was facing remarkably high expectations leading to its earnings report on July 29. Fortunately for investors, PayPal outperformed those demanding expectations and the stock was rising by 4% after the report. Even a mediocre company can do better than expected when expectations are low, but it takes a top quality business to consistently beat aggressive expectations.The fundamental picture in PayPal looks stronger than ever. With the stock trading at all-time highs, it makes sense to be patient when building a position in PayPal at current prices. However, valuation is not unreasonable at all based on cash flow generation. Besides, winners tend to keep on winning over time, and PayPal is performing like a winner.PayPal is crushing the market this year, the fintech leader has gained almost 60% while the S&P 500 is up by roughly 6.4% in the past twelve months. It is always difficult to assess how the market will react to earnings, and especially more in these kinds of situations. PayPal stock has been trading higher in anticipation of strong financial performance from the business, and this puts investors in an uncomfortable position.Source: Seeking AlphaWith the stock trading at all-time highs and outperforming the market by a huge margin, there is no room for error in the earnings report. The company needs to beat expectations, preferably by a wide margin, in order to justify recent gains and to continue doing well going forward. This is not happening to PayPal alone, many companies in sectors such as e-commerce, fintech, and cloud computing are currently in a similar spot. The digital transformation trend has accelerated demand for many of these industries, and the market is clearly reflecting this in stock prices.The earnings numbers for the second quarter will be crucial in terms of assessing id prices have gone too far or if, on the contrary, there is still more room for upside left in many of these high growth leaders.Investors with a long term horizon may well decide to tolerate the short term volatility and take a step back from all the noise surrounding stocks during earnings season. As long as the fundamentals remain healthy, one cent in earnings below or above expectations is really no reason to change your investment thesis for a company.But data from earnings cannot be disregarded, and the long term is a series of short terms. Especially during challenging times, we can learn a lot about a company, its fundamentals strengths, and the quality of its management team by assessing performance in times of crisis and uncertainty.The recent numbers from PayPal were exceptional across the board. Transactions grew by 26% to 3.7 billion, and transactions on PayPal Checkout experiences grew by almost 40%. TPV grew at 30% on an FX-neutral basis, with a record of $222 billion. Management said that there was an acceleration in TPV growth during the quarter, and June was the highest growth rate in TPV since PayPal was separated from eBay.Source: PayPalThe company added a record 21.3 million new customers in the quarter, increasing nearly 140% year-over-year. As a reference, new actives during the quarter were bigger than all of the new actives in the full year 2016. Nearly 1.7 million merchants signed up for PayPal during the quarter, and net actives for Honey were nearly triple the levels form the first quarter.Source: PayPalSolid operational performance was reflected on both the top and the bottom lines in the income statement. Revenue grew by 25% on an FX-neutral basis to $5.26 billion, accelerating after our strong 20% revenue growth in April.Non-GAAP operating margin increased by a record 500 basis points to 28% of revenue. Solid revenue growth in combination with expanding profit margins allowed PayPal to deliver a 49% increase in non-GAAP EPS during the quarter, reaching $1.07 per share and outperforming expectations by $0.2 per share. Operating cash flow grew 103% and free cash flow grew 112% year over year.Source: PayPalThe pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation revolution across the board, and PayPal is both a major driver and a leading beneficiary from this trend. The company is focused on several major drivers to capitalize on its growth opportunities going forward.Source: McKinseyPayPal is accelerating its in-store contactless payments as both consumers and merchants are rapidly moving towards digital payments across their online and offline experiences. The company is expanding its presence in all forms of omnichannel commerce, from point-of-sale in-store to buy online and pick up in-store, order ahead, pay at the table, and home delivery.Digital wallets are another key growth engine. Venmo grew its TPV by 52% to almost $37 billion, and it reported revenue growth rates above 60% during the first 3 weeks of July. PayPal is planning to expand the range of services provided inside its wallets by rolling out additional services such as bill pay, subscriptions and rewards management, shopping tools from Honey, and new forms of credit and budgeting tools.When analyzing the impact of the pandemic on the company's value, we need to consider not only the financial implications but also, and more importantly, the strategic ones. Accelerating demand not only has obvious financial benefits for PayPal in the short term, but it also drives a substantial increase in value for shareholders when considering the strategic impact of this trend.Size and presence are crucial sources of competitive strength in the industry. Merchants need to accept the payment methods that bring them customers, and customers want a payment method that is accepted everywhere. Users on both sides of the transaction attract each other to a leading payments platform such as PayPal. The same dynamic is at play in digital wallets, the more users and functionalities it has, the more valuable the service it provides.PayPal is consolidating its position as a leading industry player at times when industry demand is being pulled forward, which is creating a lot of value for shareholders. It is not just about accelerating revenue growth, but rather about consolidating the company's leadership position in a spectacularly attractive market.The company produced $2.4 billion in operating cash flow last quarter, if we analyze those cash flows, we get a price to operating cash flow ratio of 21.5 at current price levels. This is hardly excessive for a company that has just announced that it has doubled its cash flow year over year.In terms of price action, PayPal stock is in a well-defined uptrend, and a sustained breakout above $185 could open the doors to further gains in the near term."
4367225,104442,2020-08-10T15:54:33-04:00,"With its focus on e-commerce, online consumption and mobile payments, PayPal is one of the leading payment providers of the 21st century.The global pandemic has exceeded e-commerce growth forecasts by 3-5 years, which also triggered a growth boost for PayPal, according to management.PayPal has numerous growth factors which, together with a diversification and scaling of the business model, should ensure continued growth in the coming years.While the company has a substantially lower valuation than its peers, my DCF calculation indicates an upside potential of around 75%, which corresponds to a per share price of around $350.","PayPal (PYPL) is benefiting from at least three secular trends: a) increased adoption of e-commerce, b) globally growing online consumption and c) the increasing use of digital, cashless & mobile payment solutions.With its clear focus on the online business and mobile payments, PayPal is one of the payment services providers of the 21st century and is seen as one of the standard payment solutions in the internet.At least that is the opinion of the stock market, because since the separation of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), the stock has delivered a gain of 440%, outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 by far (see following chart).(PayPal's performance since July 2014 vs. major indices. Source: YCharts).With a performance of over 80%, the share is also a clear outperformer year-to-date, driven primarily by increased e-commerce adoption and online consumption due to the coronavirus pandemic (see following chart).(PayPal's year-to-date performance vs. major indices. Source: YCharts).Consequently, in this article, I would like to discuss if it is still reasonable to invest in PayPal after its steep rise and evaluate how much further potential the shares could have.(PayPal logo. Source: Pixabay)In the following, I have listed five key reasons which, from a fundamental perspective, favor a continued robust and promising future for the company.First, the area of payment services - alongside cloud computing, e-commerce and tele health - is one of the most promising growth sectors, with annual double-digit growth rates. The companies are usually profitable and/or have increasing, positive free cash flows.With regard to PayPal in particular, growth has even accelerated as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, so that the company has raised its guidance for FY 2020.As the following figure illustrates, total payment volume grew by 30% in the last quarter, while cushioning a decline of around 60% in volumes from travel and event sectors.(TPV processed by PayPal in Q2 2020. Source: PayPal)With regard to revenues, the company registered its highest revenue growth since the separation from eBay with a growth rate of 25% year over year (see following figure).(PayPal's revenue growth in Q2 2020. Source: PayPal)Additionally, the following figure illustrates the double-digit growth in earnings per share (non-GAAP). As shown in the figure, earnings per share (EPS) grew by 49% in Q2 2020, despite including credit loss reserves, which reduced EPS by $0.07. EPS grew by 26% year-to-date. Excluding the year-to-date impact of macroeconomic factors, EPS grew by 44%.(PayPal's non-Gaap EPS growth over time. Source: PayPal)Second, although PayPal is mainly known as an online and e-commerce payment system, the company generates more revenue than Mastercard (MA).In terms of quarterly revenues in Q2, the company has now even overtaken Visa (V). If, for example, the travel industry does not recover quickly from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, it can be assumed that PayPal will soon leave Visa and Mastercard behind in terms of annual revenues as well (see following figure).(PayPal's revenue compared to Visa and Mastercard. Source: YCharts)While payment providers such as Visa, Mastercard and also Square (SQ) (if one excludes Square's revenues generated with Bitcoin, which in my opinion is questionable reported) suffer a decline in revenues, PayPal even got an additional growth boost despite or due to the pandemic.In this context it is noteworthy that Mastercard, together with Visa, are the two largest credit card providers (apart from the Chinese Union Pay; see following figure).Global market share of credit cards providers as of 2017; Quelle: Payments Cards & MobileThird, while the online and e-commerce sector is showing accelerating growth, Paypal is entering into strategic partnerships to further expand its presence in the mobile payment sector.In this context, the partnership with Instagram Checkout, which was concluded in 2019, can be mentioned on the one hand. Peggy Alford, Senior VP Core Markets of PayPal, even got a seat on the Facebook board.Instagram Checkout allows users to make purchases of the desired product within the app. Previously, users were redirected to external websites of merchants. According to company statements, approximately 130 million monthly active users (MAUs) click on product offers within the Instagram app. Analysts estimate the sales potential of Instagram Checkout at more than $10 billion by mid 2021.Additionally, based on the management's statements during the earnings call, PayPal closed commercial partnerships with Gojek, MercadoPago as well as MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), all of which are among the leading merchants in their home markets. Moreover, the company intends to expand its capabilities in China by partnering with China's UnionPay and other leading Chinese player for this purpose.On the other hand, PayPal continues to show very rapid growth in terms of new accounts and P2P across its platforms PayPal, Venmo, Honey and Xoom. The number of active accounts in the quarter increased by 21% or 21.3 million year over year. This represents the strongest quarterly growth in the company's history (see following figure).(PayPal's active and net new accounts in Q2 2020. Source: PayPal)With further regard to mobile payments, PayPal is aiming at an increasing monetization of its mobile wallet and P2P payment platform ""Venmo"", which is currently a U.S.-only service. According to the company, the transaction volume by Venmo increased by 52% to $37 billion in the last quarter.Additionally, management plans to further diversify and expand the business. The management mentioned during the earnings call for the last quarter, among other things, the introduction of new omni channel check-out options in both PayPal and Venmo, new bill pay, subscriptions and rewards management solutions as well as new types of credit and budgeting tools (see figure below).(PayPal's In-Person Payments Strategy. Source: PayPal).Fourth, the recent acquisitions of Hyperwallet (international platform for payments across different countries and currencies) and iZettle (provider of POS terminals in the retail sector) express PayPal's ambitions in the payment sector and should gradually translate into growth. There is even speculation that PayPal intends to build up its own card network, similar to Visa and Mastercard.Fifth, PayPal has a solid balance sheet. Therefore, PayPal could make further acquisitions if necessary, buy back own shares or even pay a dividend in the future, which could further boost the stock price. PayPal's cash, cash equivalents and investments amounted to $16.2 billion, while the debt amounted to $9 billion as of June 2020.Going forward, the company expects revenue growth of around 25%, non-GAAP EPS growth of around 25% and GAAP EPS growth of around 45% in Q3 2020. Additionally, the company expects to generate approximately $5 billion in free cash flow in FY 2020, a $1 billion increase over the previous forecast.Although PayPal generates more revenue than Mastercard and is on the brink of surpassing Visa, as already mentioned in the section above, its market capitalization is still substantially below that of Visa and Mastercard, despite a rise of 80% for the year.As you can see in the chart below, PayPal's market cap is 40% below that of Mastercard and 80% below that of Visa. Based on PayPal's closing price of $199 on August 7, 2020, a parity with Mastercard would mean a price of $279 per share and with Visa a price of $358 per share.(PayPal's market cap in peer group comparison. Source: YCharts)With regard to the P/S ratio, it can be said that PayPal's P/S ratio is also substantially lower compared to the peer group, despite a currently much higher growth rate.While PayPal has a P/S ratio of around 12, its peers Mastercard and Visa have a P/S ratio of around 20. Consequently, the stock could have an upside potential of at least 66% based on a P/S ratio approach to catch up with the peer group in terms of valuation (see figure below).(PayPal's P/S ratio in peer group comparison. Source: YCharts)Two most likely reasons for this valuation disparity are probably the operating income and the operating cash flow, which for PayPal is still below its peers. A further explanation could be that the market underestimates PayPal's potential and thus prices in a higher risk discount (see figure below).(PayPal's OCF and operating income compared to peers. Source: YCharts)In this context, a margin expansion of PayPal can be expected in the future. This assumption is related to the diversification and scaling of the business model as well as the results of the previous quarters, which confirm these assumptions.According to the management's statements during the earnings call, operating margin for the previous quarter came to 28.2%, improving over 500 basis points year-over-year. At the same time, this represented the highest level of operating margin improvement the company reported in its history, which is attributable to the operational strength across all areas of the business, CFO John Rainey told analysts.Nevertheless, I prepared a calculation of PayPal's fair value based on a DCF model in order to make a more accurate assessment of the valuation.In order to choose a conservative approach, I have chosen a growth rate of 20% and a growth decline rate of 10% per year in terms of the free cash flow, which is largely in line with analysts' estimates for the next few years provided by MarketScreener.Furthermore, I have chosen a multiple of 30 for the last FCF, which is below the average Price/Cash Flow multiple for the last five years of PayPal (33.55), Visa (30.80) and Mastercard (33.13), according to Morningstar.Based on my valuation method, the fair value is $346,30, which corresponds to an undervaluation of the stock of 74% (see calculation below).(Fair value calculation. Source: Author's calculation)The calculation does not include the impact of the potential and ongoing buyback programs. Share buyback programs are very likely to provide a further boost to the share price.With its online and mobile focus as well as its dominant role as an internet payment provider, PayPal seems to be one of the best long-term investments to participate in the digital and cashless payment trend.The global pandemic has exceeded e-commerce growth forecasts by several years, which also triggered a growth boost for PayPal.PayPal has numerous growth factors which, together with a diversification and scaling of the business model as well as monetization of its several platforms and digital wallets, should ensure continued double-digit growth in the coming years.Additionally, the company closed several strategic partnerships such as Instagram Checkout, MercadoLibre and MercadoPago, which should further propel its growth and role in the digital payment world.Interestingly, the company still has a substantially lower valuation than its peers, despite generating more revenues than Mastercard and being on the brink of surpassing Visa in terms of revenues. This valuation disparity could offer a chance for potential investors.Based on my fair value calculation, the stock has an upside potential of around 75% and could be worth around $350 per share.Nevertheless, even if the shares appear fundamentally undervalued, unexpected events are always to be expected on the stock market and there is no guarantee of rising share prices. Investors should always bear in mind that stock prices are volatile and should not be influenced by price movements alone, but rather should pay attention to the underlying fundamentals. In this respect, investors should always pay attention to their individual risk tolerance.PS: If you liked my article and you want me to write more articles of this kind in the future, then like, comment and share this article.

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.We review our Buy case on PayPal (PYPL) after its share price rose above $200 to a new record high, following Q2 2020 results last week. Since we upgraded our rating on PayPal to Buy in May, shares have gained 46.6%: Our May upgrade was based on PayPal's business having been significantly accelerated by COVID-19 and having a sustainable high-teens EPS growth, with the following key assumptions:Relative to PayPal's $139.24 share price at the time, we believed shares would deliver a high-teens annualised return.PayPal's Q2 2020 results released last week support our assumptions and, even with the now higher share price, we believe the shares could still deliver a low-teens annualised return over the next few years.In line with our investment case, Q2 2020 showed the continuation of strong growth in PayPal's user base, volume and revenues from the April level. PayPal finished Q2 with 21.3m Net New Accounts (from 7.4m in April), pushing total Active Accounts up 21% year-on-year to 346 million:Total Payment Volume (""TPV"") grew 30% (excluding currency) year-on-year in Q2 2020 to $222bn, a clear acceleration from Q1 (when it grew 19%), and also faster than the growth shown during 2016-19: Within TPV, Cross-Border Trade grew 24% to $37bn, Peer-to-Peer (""P2P"") grew 38% to $64bn (including Venmo growing 52% to $37bn) (growth rates exclude currency). eBay volume grew 32% to reach 9% of total TPV in Q2, but PayPal's next top 15 marketplaces grew at close to 100% year-on-year, 3 times larger than eBay's growth.These strong growth rates more than offset the 60% volume decline in the “travel and events” vertical, which was more than 10% of TPV in Q2 2019. The number of payment transactions grew correspondingly, up 26% year-on-year in Q2 2020, compared to 15% in Q1 2020 and 21% in Q4 2019.Revenue growth accelerated with TPV, to 25% year-on-year in Q2 (compared to 15% guided in May), and is also higher than the range in 2016-19: PayPal's Transaction Take Rate was 2.23% in Q2, compared to 2.21% in Q1 2020 and 2.25% in Q2 2019; it would have been higher year-on-year excluding the dilution by lower-rate P2P volumes. The newly-acquired Honey contributed 140 bps to revenue growth, having grew its Net New Accounts 3 times and doubled its revenue year-on-year.We believe PayPal could continue to grow its revenues at least at high teens, due to size of its global potential market.PayPal's total TPV of $791bn in the last 12 months still represents a tiny percentage of global payment volume, estimated at $235tn (of which Personal Consumer Expenditures are $50tn). Even in PayPal's core North American market, there was $16tn of cash and check payments in 2018, including 30% of Personal Consumer Expenditures: PayPal also has large untapped geographies. As of 2019, it generated approx. 65% of its revenues in the U.S. and the U.K., which means plenty of growth if it could replicate its success in these two countries elsewhere.PayPal's volume remains a fraction of those for payment networks like Visa (V) ($11.6tn in FY19) and Mastercard (MA) ($6.5tn in 2019).PayPal is actively pursuing growth initiatives, for example in in-store. It is investing to expand its point-of-sale (""POS"") in-store capabilities, including with QR codes, which is now available in 28 countries; PayPal is also working with 100+ large merchants across the U.S. and Europe to “aggressively roll-out” an integrated POS solution that includes QR codes. Last week it announced a deal with CVS Pharmacy (CVS) to enable PayPal and Venmo QR code payments at their 8,200 stores by year-end.Internationally,PayPal is also expanding its list of partners and deepening each relationship, including Gojek (in Southeast Asia), MercardoLibre (MELI) (Mercado Pago in Brazil and Mexico, cross-border trade in LATAM). In China, PayPal completed the acquisition of a 70% stake in GoPay in December, and is working to integrate its platform and to partner with local players such as China UnionPay. On the Q2 2020 call, management talked of having “explosive growth” in Mexico, Japan, Brazil and ""across Western Europe"".Another key development in Q2 2020 is the size of operational leverage shown in PayPal's P&L, which gives us confidence that EPS could grow far faster than revenues at some point in the future.For Q2, excluding one-off credit reserve builds ($237m in Q1 and $117m in Q2), both GAAP and non-GAAP EBIT margins were higher year-on-year: Even including the reserve build, non-GAAP EBIT margin expanded 130 bps year-on-year in H1, though GAAP EBIT margin was down 80 bps, mostly due to stock-based compensation cost margin expanding 160 bps: Operational leverage is also visible in how non-GAAP EBIT grew 48.8% year-on-year in Q2 to $1.49bn, as expenses grew slower than revenues. Revenues grew 22.2%, but transaction expenses grew only 13.3% and non-transaction expenses grew only 9.6% (or 3% excluding acquisitions): Transaction and loan losses were up 38.4% year-on-year including $100m from the one-off reserve build, otherwise non-GAAP EBIT would be up 58.8%. Management stated that the margin on incremental revenues in Q2 was as high as 50%, or 70% excluding reserve build & acquisitions.Margin expansion is limited by how PayPal continues to be in investment mode, for example announcing $300m of new investment for H2 during Q2 results, in additional capabilities in in-store, QR, tap-to-pay cards and rewards, on the Honey integration, and on international markets. The opportunity for far more significant margin expansion lies at some point in the future.The Q2 2020 P&L shows the benefit of the growth acceleration and operational leverage described above, with non-GAAP EPS growing 49% year-on-year and 61% quarter-on-quarter: PayPal also reinstated a full-year 2020 outlook, including a 22% ex-currency revenue growth, a 25% EPS growth and more than $5bn in Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") (compared to $3.86bn in 2019):The new outlook represents a clear acceleration from the pre-COVID-19 outlook of 17-18% ex-currency revenue growth, 9-16% EPS growth, and ""more than $4.0bn"" FCF. The FY20 outlook also includes 70m in Net New Accounts, compared to 41.5m gained in H1, which implies more than 14m per quarter in Q3 and Q4, compared to less than 9m per quarter in 2019. While PayPal has not reinstated a medium-term outlook (the pre-COVID one included a 20% ex-currency EPS CAGR), management hinted at an acceleration there as well:PayPal continued to expect the impact of the end of their exclusive agreement with eBay, which ended in July, to be manageable. (eBay volume was 9% of total TPV in Q2, and likely represented a mid-teens percentage of revenues.) The FY20 outlook above has incorporated this impact and other marketplaces that had moved to intermediated payments historically had left PayPal with 50-75% of the original volumes.At $204.09, on 2019 financials, PayPal shares are trading at a 65.6x P/E (on non-GAAP EPS, 98.3x on GAAP EPS); the FCF Yield is 1.0%. Because of its expected strong growth, relative to 2020 expected financials, the multiples drop to a 52.5x P/E and an 1.4% FCF Yield:Our Base Case illustrative returns calculations assume the following:Relative to the current share price of $204.09, the exit price of $301.29 implies a 12.0% annualised return and a 48% total return over 3.5 years: In our Upside Case, we assume EPS growth to remain above 20% and P/E to contract by a smaller amount to 55x. This gives a 21.3% annualised return: PayPal's Q2 results last week showed a continuation of the strong growth in its user base, volume and revenues seen in April.Its P&L also showed strong operational leverage, with the margin on incremental revenues at as high as 70%.EPS growth year-on-year was 49% in Q2, guided to 25% for the full year, and management hinted at a medium-term CAGR of more than 20%.Our Base Case is for EPS growth to remain at least at high teens in the next few years, and for the P/E to fall back to 45x.At $204.09, shares will still give a 12.0% annualised return over the next 3.5 years in this Base Case; an Upside Case gives 21.3%.We reiterate our Buy rating on PayPal.We continue to have Buy ratings on Mastercard and Visa. We are Neutral on American Express (AXP).Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here."
4369989,105812,2020-08-20T14:37:10-04:00,"Digital payments are expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, driven by increases in e-commerce and digital/mobile wallet payments.PayPal offers variety of products and services that enable merchants to accept credit/debit card and digital/mobile wallet payments both in stores and online.PayPal is continuously strengthening its payments ecosystem through new product innovations, acquisitions, and partnerships.PayPal's impressive financial results in Q2'2020 are evidence of its growing importance in the payments market.","As the world moves away from cash (and plastic cards), towards e-commerce and digital payments, few companies are as well positioned to create shareholder wealth as PayPal (PYPL). PayPal is creating an ecosystem that facilitates digital payments online, in stores, and between users, while actively engaging merchants and consumers.My investment thesis can be broken into three parts:According to Grand View Research, the digital payments market is expected to reach $132.5 billion by 2025, growing at 17.6% per year. And the payment gateway market is expected to reach $94 billion by 2025, growing at 13% per year. These trends will be driven by greater adoption of e-commerce and increasing use of digital/mobile wallet payments, both in store and online.The chart below compares global payment methods in 2019 to forecasted methods in 2023. Percentages are based on total spend.Source: WorldPay Global Payments Report 2020By 2023, digital/mobile wallet payments are expected to account for the majority of global consumer spend in both e-commerce and POS (brick-and-mortar) transactions. While this data is heavily weighted by the Asia/Pacific region, where digital wallet payments already lead the pack, all other regions discussed in the report (North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa) are trending the same direction.And this trend makes sense. Digital wallets offer more security and certain conveniences that cash and plastic cards do not. For instance, if you lost your purse or wallet, it wouldn't be hard for someone to start charging your credit card. And it would be even easier for them to spend any cash you had. But if you lost your smartphone, they probably wouldn't even be able to unlock the device. At least not before you cancelled your service.More to the point, we use our phones for everything - to send messages, to stream media, to browse the internet. Why aren't more of us using them to make payments too?PayPal is creating a payments ecosystem. They offer a variety of products and services that not only benefit users, but engage merchants and consumers. More importantly, PayPal is continuously strengthening this ecosystem through new innovations, acquisitions, and partnerships.For MerchantsBrick-and-Mortar Solutions: PayPal provides POS hardware, basic software, and payment processing services that allow merchants to accept credit/debit card and digital wallet payments in stores.PayPal's POS software, PayPal Here, provides basic functionality. But for merchants who require more, PayPal partners with other providers of POS software solutions, such as Vend for retail and Lavu for restaurants.In 2018, PayPal acquired Swedish fintech company iZettle, which has been called the 'Square (SQ) of Europe'. This acquisition not only gave PayPal a better foothold in certain European and Latin American markets, but expanded its product offering to include iZettle's advanced POS software for bars, cafés, and restaurants (iZettle Pro).In 2019, PayPal took a 70% stake in GoPay, making PayPal the first foreign payments platform to enter the market in China. This move gives PayPal an extraordinary opportunity in coming years. Home to over 710 million online shoppers, China is not only the world's largest e-commerce market, but one of the fastest growing as well.In May 2020, PayPal announced QR code payment functionality in 28 markets around the globe, meaning merchants can display a QR code and consumers can use their PayPal or Venmo app to scan this code and make a payment. CVS has already announced plans to adopt this checkout technology in 8,200 stores later this year. But CVS is likely just the first of many. And PayPal will undoubtedly benefit by being more involved in the checkout process at brick-and-mortar locations. If this trend gains traction in the US, like it has in other parts of the world, PayPal could be more common than credit cards a decade from now.E-commerce Solutions: PayPal provides payment gateway services, which are necessary for online and mobile transactions. A payment gateways securely connects a website to the payment processor, allowing merchants to safely accept credit and debit card payments online.PayPal functionality can be added to virtually any website, but PayPal has also partnered with various providers of e-commerce solutions, including Etsy and Shopify. These partners allow merchants to create online storefronts with built-in PayPal functionality, thereby driving growth in PayPal's merchant user base. Additionally, PayPal's acquisition of iZettle further expanded its e-commerce ecosystem; iZettle E-Commerce allows merchants to not only create an online storefront, but to manage in store and online sales and inventory from one place.In the circumstances described above, PayPal generates revenue by charging merchants a fee based on the total payment volume (TPV) and the number of transactions they process. These fees are summarized below.Source: Created by the author using information from PayPalFor ConsumersPayPal engages consumers primarily through its digital/mobile wallets, the PayPal app and Venmo. These allow users to (1) send and receive money and (2) make in store purchases, but more functionality may be in the pipeline.These digital wallets are so prolific that Venmo has become a verb. In the most recent quarter, Venmo processed over $37 billion (50% YoY growth) and ended the quarter with over 60 million users.For its part, the PayPal app can be linked to Google Pay and Samsung Pay, which allows users to make in store purchases using their PayPal account at NFC-enabled POS terminals. Also, as discussed earlier, PayPal has recently announced QR code payments, which will allow PayPal and Venmo users to make in store payments by scanning a QR code.PayPal further strengthened its ecosystem and ability to engage consumers with the acquisition of Honey, an online shopping and rewards platform. But many investors are so hung up on the price tag that they've missed the forest for the trees. Yes, at $4 billion, this was very expensive. But Honey's platform allows PayPal to insert itself further upstream than ever before in the consumer's decision making process. PayPal can now help consumers find products, not just pay for them. And that could be an enormous growth driver, as it has the potential to engage consumers (and merchants) on a whole new level. For instance, merchants wishing to monetize PayPal's enormous user base might offer deals through Honey, which in turn should drive user growth as consumers seek discounts, which should entice even more merchants to offer deals...and so on. PayPal may also leverage this platform to reward consumer loyalty, much the same way credit cards offer cash back and other rewards. Or PayPal could leverage the consumer data to make personalized recommendations through Venmo. The bottom line is that this acquisition could be beneficial in a number of ways, and PayPal has made some good capital allocation decisions in the past (I.e. Venmo).PayPal has created a global network of merchants and consumers, operating in over 200 countries and supporting over 30 currencies. As of Q2'2020, PayPal had over 346 million active accounts, including over 26 million merchant accounts. And each new consumer adds value for every merchant, just as each new merchants adds value for every consumer. Not only that, but PayPal has spent years building a well known and trusted brand name in the payments market. It would be difficult for new entrants to overcome these obstacles and take market share.PayPal's competitive advantages are borne out in their financials. Over the last five years, PayPal has grown revenue 123%, or roughly 17% per year. Earnings have grown even faster at 20% per year, and FCF has grown 26% per year. During this time operating margins have remained relatively constant around 15%. While it would be nice to see margin expansion, this is a heavily competitive space, and maintaining margins is still impressive.Data by YChartsAs mentioned earlier, PayPal's revenue is heavily related to total payment volume (TPV) and transaction volume. The charts below show these figures over the last few years.Source: created by the author using data from PayPal Investor Relations.PayPal's TPV has grown at 26% annually since 2015. But in Q2'2020, TPV growth accelerated to 29% YoY. Incredible growth during a recession, especially when compared to other big names in the payment market; Square, Mastercard (MA), and Visa (V) all reported double digit drops in gross payment volume in the most recent quarter.As I mentioned earlier, PayPal will benefit from the shift towards e-commerce and digital/mobile wallet payments. And that's exactly what happened in the fallout from COVID-19. The pandemic caused an acceleration in these trends, and PayPal executed perfectly. PayPal called Q2'2020 the strongest quarter in the company's history:ValuationPayPal is richly valued, currently trading near an all time high PS ratio (12x) and an all time high PE ratio (90x) - much higher than the 2.4x sales and 29x earnings of the S&P 500. But over the last five years, PayPal has grown sales 17% and earnings at 20% annually. Sales growth has also accelerated in each of the last four quarters. So, while these ratios are certainly high, they may not be that crazy for a company posting such strong growth figures.Data by YChartsCompetitionPayPal faces competition from tech giants who offer competing products, like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. Of the three, Apple Pay is probably the biggest threat, as it had over 440 million estimated users in September 2019. However, one notable limitation of Apple Pay is that it is device dependent. Only Apple product users can use Apple Pay - this severely limits the addressable market. PayPal, however, benefits from being an agnostic payments platform, meaning the total addressable market is much larger. But make no mistake, Apple is a formidable threat with a large user base and mountains of cash.PayPal also faces competition from Square. And while Square has a more robust offering of niche specific POS software (Square for Restaurants and Square for Retail), Square also has two notable limitations: (1) merchants using Square POS hardware cannot accept payments outside of the country in which the account was created and (2) the Square app is only available in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and Japan. So PayPal is an obvious choice for merchants looking to operate with a physical presence in several countries. Likewise, larger merchants that do not have a need for Square's accessories may still choose to offer PayPal as an online checkout option.Finally, PayPal faces competition from AliPay and WeChat Pay in China. Although they have not meaningfully penetrated many of the markets in which PayPal operates, they do command an astonishing 93% of the mobile payment market in China. If they are able to expand beyond their current markets, it could be problematic for PayPal. However, competition goes both ways, and PayPal recently acquired a 70% stake in GoPay, allowing them to meaningfully enter the Chinese payments market.Even with all the competition, this is not a market that will be dominated by one business. There will be several winners, and I believe PayPal will be one of them.PayPal is a well known, trusted, and innovative company that has created a strong global network of buyers and sellers. And as digital payments become more prevalent - driven by increases in e-commerce and digital/mobile wallet payments - PayPal is well positioned to capture value.For patient investors willing to take a long-term view, PayPal is a buy even at today's pricey valuation."
4361361,103480,2020-07-28T12:22:55-04:00,"Shares of PayPal have retreated slightly from their recent rally alongside most other large-cap tech stocks.
        PayPal has been one of the most consistent gainers among large-cap tech. Shares are up ~50% year-to-date, beating flat S&P 500 performance.
        All signs are pointing to strength in Q2 and the rest of the fiscal year, driven by a pickup in online commerce activity.
        Despite a premium valuation, PayPal's combination of growth plus margin expansion secures a continued rally in the stock.","PayPal (PYPL), the leader in online payments in the U.S., has long been one of the safest large-cap tech stocks to bet on. I don't typically favor richly valued momentum stocks, but PayPal's combination of continued growth despite its gargantuan scale plus substantial earnings expansion gives me confidence in PayPal's ability to sustain and grow its premium valuation multiple. The company is set to report earnings on July 29, and all signs point to strength - not just in Q2, but for the remainder of the fiscal year.The bullish thesis for PayPal, in my view, rests one one major key point: online payments penetration in the U.S. is actually fairly low. We still use cash and plastic for virtually all of our transactions - compare that the China, where paying through mobile apps like Alipay has become the norm. The coronavirus, in my view, has the potential to accelerate that trend toward online payments in the U.S. Most of all, the share of e-commerce as a percentage of total retail spend has soared since the pandemic began - so naturally, PayPal will see a lift as a payments processor for many online merchants. Many people who may have only resorted to e-commerce for occasional purchases have now turned to the internet for all of their needs - giving PayPal a proportional opportunity to grow. We can already see the impacts of this trend in PayPal's April results, the only month out of Q2 that PayPal has pre-reported some key metrics.Then, we note as well that as of the end of 2019, PayPal has acquired a 70% stake in a Chinese e-payments company called GoPay, making it one of the first U.S. payments companies to be authorized to do business in China. As I wrote in a prior article, this gives PayPal a foot in the door in the largest consumer market in the world, and one that is also furthest along in accepting e-payments as mainstream.The bottom line on PayPal: buy this stock on any dips and continue riding the momentum upward. While PayPal's 43x forward P/E ratio, based on Wall Street's consensus EPS target of $4.17 for FY21 (per Yahoo Finance), looks rich - when we consider the fact that PayPal is organically adding ~10 million net new accounts every quarter plus generating 60% y/y cash flow growth, we understand why this is a stock to bank on for the long term. Initially, the coronavirus was bad news for PayPal. Along with the rest of the market, shares fell ~30% peak-to-trough in March as investors feared that a global recession would hit PayPal's e-commerce volumes.This did in fact come true in March. The chart below bridges between where PayPal had guided to for Q1 revenue growth (17-18% y/y, in-line with Q4 revenue growth rates). Figure 1. PayPal Q1 revenue bridgeSource: PayPal shareholder letter As we can see above, three things hit PayPal in Q1: cross-border e-commerce weakness, sector-specific weakness for travel and events, and lower interest rates affecting interest income. In my view, however, only the third factor - lower rates, and arguably the smallest impact - will be sustained into the rest of FY20, while the giant leap in e-commerce activity since the coronavirus began makes up for the rest.We can read-through from other companies' results to see that e-commerce has been on an explosive growth trajectory of late. Companies like Wayfair (W) and Etsy (ETSY) are having some of their best years yet, reflecting strength in e-commerce across a wide variety of verticals that can more than make up for lower travel bookings on sites like Expedia. Gaming companies, like Activision Blizzard (ATVI), have seen a large boost in in-game bookings after stay-at-home orders boosted in-home entertainment engagement. Even eBay (which actually stopped using PayPal as a payments processor starting this year) started to see its long-stagnant GMV volumes lift. Regardless of whether these companies use PayPal or not, however, the stark uplift in e-commerce activity and the associated boost in digital payments is a huge tailwind in PayPal's favor.That now brings us to where PayPal landed in April. After seeing its business decay in March, PayPal reported that it came roaring back in April. Look at the chart below:Figure 2. PayPal April trendsSource: PayPal shareholder letter PayPal added 7.4 million net-new accounts in April: up 135% y/y, and roughly the amount that PayPal typically adds in a whole quarter. Among other things, this is a strong indicator that many people are turning to PayPal (and digital payments) for the first time ever - and this dramatic increase in PayPal's user base is a huge revenue tailwind for the future. Consistent with the read-through that we've seen from other companies' earnings results PayPal called out retail and gaming companies as big drivers for the net-new adds.PayPal's TPV also saw a huge boost in April. Total payments volume is arguably the most important metric for PayPal, as it represents the total value of money flowing through PayPal's platform. After decelerating sharply in March due to the factors previously discussed, PayPal's TPV bounced rapidly back to 22% y/y growth in April, the same TPV growth growth as 22% y/y in the pre-coronavirus fourth quarter. Note as well that pre-March, PayPal's TPV had actually accelerated to as high as 28% y/y, despite the fact that PayPal's year-ago acquisitions of iZettle and Hyperwallet are now fully baked in. The key message here: the coronavirus was a temporary hit for PayPal, but the company recovered extremely quickly back to 22% y/y TPV growth and 20% y/y revenue growth in April. Considering that Wall Street consensus for Q2 revenue growth is only 16% y/y (after 20% y/y growth in April) and 14% y/y for the full year, I'd say PayPal has a low bar to cross to impress investors and Wall Street.Another point that's important to make is that PayPal's premium P/E sits in the context of its extraordinary profit growth. Despite the revenue weakness that kicked in during March of Q1, PayPal still delivered impressive operating leverage in Q1. Figure 3. PayPal Q1 margin trendsSource: PayPal shareholder letter After excluding the impacts of credit losses and credit reserves in Q1 (the same as every banking company), PayPal noted that its pro forma operating margin grew 210bps in Q1 to 24.7%. Likewise, PayPal's free cash flow also soared 60% y/y in the quarter to $1.30 billion, while FCF margins also expanded eight points as a percentage of revenue. These are best-in-class margins that help to justify PayPal's premium multiple - unlike other massive year-to-date gainers like Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA) that still have very little to show in terms of profitability. Figure 4. PayPal FCFSource: PayPal shareholder letterThere's a lot to like about PayPal heading into its second-quarter earnings release, especially the fact that its ~20% y/y growth trends in April are already ahead of Wall Street's ~16% y/y growth expectations. And with PayPal's huge net new account additions and the trend of converting the masses toward accepting e-payments into the mainstream, PayPal still has a long runway ahead of it."
4351377,103327,2020-06-01T16:00:40-04:00,"PayPal has built its strength in four ways for it to be a buy.PayPal has grown into a market leader, vital for the payment industry.PayPal doesn't let itself stagnate, making multiple acquisitions yearly to continue swallowing the payments industry.PayPal is an especially strong ESG company, which will be vital in coming years as more emphasis is placed on ESG.It has strong financials, and is ultimately undervalued for its growth.","PayPal (PYPL) is a technology platform & digital payments company offering consumers P2P payment solutions through PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and iZettle products. My thesis is that PayPal is a buy because of 4 main factors.1) It's the market leader in the payments industry, and in the mobile payment industry, trust is everything.2) It constantly makes strategic acquisitions and partnerships to overtake competitors.3) It's an ESG leader with a unique culture and initiatives for a big tech company, outperforming its peers.4) It's undervalued for its growth.As a quick overview, its two main sources of revenue stem from transaction revenue (70% of revenue stream), which includes charges of transfer, withdrawal, international transaction, and currency exchange rate, and value added revenue (30% of revenue stream): subscription fees, gateway fees, gain on sale etc. It exists in over 200 markets and over 100 currencies, having a market share of 59.68%, which is #1 in industry.Its value prop to merchants that use it is its convenience through its setup and APIs, low-cost, and security. Similarity, its value prop to consumers is that it's widely accepted, allows for flexibility of payment, and is secure.PayPal is particularly well positioned because of industry trends. Some factors driving it include a large increase in consumer demand through: compatibility with smartphones and banks' payment, increased security and ease of use; product/ technological changes: demise of cards, rise of wearables and biometric data, blockchain; and market trends: growth is faster in emerging than in developed markets (large unbanked populations, widespread smartphones penetration, migrant workers). In the future, mobile payments are estimated to become a key source of revenue. In fact, statistics cite that the global mobile payment CAGR is estimated to be 34% from 2017 to 2023, 45% of millennials prefer mobile payments in 2020, and mobile payments in physical stores will increase 39.2% in 2020. The Asian Market in particular is set to grow with China estimated to soon account for 50% of world's digital payments and PayPal's revenue surged 1200% YoY in India.As described before, PayPal is a market leader in the financial payments industry. This is especially important in the online payment industry, because there's a barrier to entry for competitors, given the high entrance cost, high technology, strict regulations, and need for trust. To maintain this lead, it is making strategic partnerships with competitors such as Chase, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Visa (NYSE:V), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), and BofA (NYSE:BAC). It integrates its mobile wallet into Google Pay, Samsung Pay and Facebook Messenger. Furthermore, to address some of the industry trends that were mentioned above, it has acquired companies such as iZettle, Honey, and Venmo.Acquiring iZettle has allowed it to provide financial & other services as payments, point-of-sale, accounting software and loans to small businesses. Honey allows PayPal to be not merely a means of payment, but partake in finding deals. Venmo has helped PayPal have a 87% mobile conversion rate compared to industry standard 45%, and P2P volume grew by 41% to $42 billion, propelled by Venmo. Each of these acquisitions targets different markets, such as B2B, B2C, C2C, allowing PayPal to penetrate all segments of the industry.In terms of its financials, we can describe it as a company with a high valuation, but an equally high ROE to justify its valuation. In particular, as we can see in the table below, its high P/E and EV/EBITDA coupled with higher than expected earnings, show that it has potential for high returns. The ROE coupled with no dividend indicates its ability for growth. And its low EV/Revenue offsets the ability that it is overvalued. These statements are backed by other statistics, such as its PEG, as shown in table 2.Table 1: Statistics Against CompetitorsTable 2: Statistics Against IndustryConsidering some other yearly metrics, its revenue grew by 12%, compared to industry average of 3%, its Debt/equity = 0.13, its Quick Ratio = 1.18, Earnings improved by 33%, net income growth beat both S&P and IT Services, coming in at 30.5%, and most notably, net operating cash flow grew by 394.26%. All this shows that although it may have a high P/E, for its growth, it is both undervalued and sustainable.A fact that is often overlooked is a company's ESG standpoint. This is particularly important given how much people value ESG, not only morally, but also because strong ESG companies tend to perform better, as they are able to avoid fines for not following regulations or avoid lawsuits for not treating their employees or customers well.If we look at PayPal's SASB score compared to 101 peer companies, we see that it outperforms on the environmental and social factors. Figure 1: PayPal's SASB scoreExamining some of these factors in more detail,EnvironmentalPayPal has focused on its energy and water impact. It adopts clean energy technology in the workplace (free cooling, sensor activated HVAC). On-site solar power produces nearly 10 percent of electricity used on campuses.

The stock is another one of these stay-at-home plays that seem to get a lot of attention despite analysts cutting estimates for the company. The rapidly rising stock and declining earnings and revenue forecasts have sent its valuation soaring to record-high levels, making shares grossly overvalued.The technical chart shows just how overextended the shares have gotten, and it likely means it doesn't end well. If you'd like, you can track all of my free SA articles on this Google Spreadsheet I created.PayPal's one-year forward PE ratio has spiked to around 41.5, which is the highest earnings multiple since becoming a public company, for the second time, in 2015. Over that time, the stock has averaged a one-year forward PE ratio of just 27.6. In more recent years, that ratio has peaked around 35, and it makes the current valuation for the stock stretched.(Refinitiv)Since the beginning of the year, analysts have slashed their earnings estimates for the company for this year, 2021, and 2022, with estimates dropping by 2-4% per year for the next three years. Those lowered results haven't stopped the stock from rising by over 50% in 2020.(Source: Refinitiv)Currently, estimates are for earnings to rise by 8% in 2020 to $3.35, followed by growth of 23.5% and 22.3% in 2021 and 2022. It gives the stock a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 17.7%, which is very healthy. But when considering the stocks, PE ratio, and then adjusting that ratio for that CAGR, the stock has a PEG ratio of about 2.3, which is well above a fairly valued stock range of 1 to 1.5.Should PayPal return to the upper end of its historical PE range around 35, the stock could be worth just $144. That is about 15.7% less than the stock's current price of roughly $170.75 on July 14.Payment volumes for the business are expected to grow at a healthy clip of 19.9% by analysts to about $853 billion during 2020. Analysts had been forecasting payment volumes to be around $890 billion before the start of the pandemic. Meanwhile, payment volume estimates for next year have fallen too, to $1.04 trillion from roughly $1.075 trillion.(Refinitiv)So, while by most accounts, some of the critical measures of PayPal's ability to generate profits have fallen, the stock has soared, in what appears to have just become an overcrowded momentum trade.The stock gapped higher on May 7, following its latest quarterly results, and trade higher in a very well-defined trading channel. However, on July 14, the stock fell below the lower bound of that trading channel for the first time since early May.The breaking of this uptrend seems significant because it could suggest the recent run higher in PayPal is ending and that would indicate the stock could drop quite a bit.The first significant level of support would come around $158, followed by $151, and the potential for a technical gap-fill down around $130.The relative strength index is pointing to a change in trend. The RSI had been moving sideways despite the stock continually rising from May through the start of July. This type of action is known as a bearish divergence.Additionally, we can see that volume levels had been gradually tapering off in recent weeks as the stock was rising, a sign of waning buyers. However, notice how the volume began to rise as the stock started to sell-off, a symbol of sellers entering the stock.There are many risks, first off, being bearish in this market on any stock has proven problematic. Momentum over a short period of time can be far more potent than fundamentals. It means at this point, the market seems to care very little about how expensive a stock may be. Additionally, should the stock return to the technical trading channel, it could rise sharply, all the way up to around $190.Still, with the recent rise of volatility in the equity markets in 2020, investors should, at the very least, be aware of the potential risks and the more critically the potential downside."
4350839,105308,2020-05-29T11:37:42-04:00,PayPal has undergone an explosive rally in its share price.Future expectations are set too high. The current valuation does not justify the company's future potential earnings.PayPal remains a great company. I will stay away at this point and hope to buy on a potential pullback opportunity.,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares are currently trading near all-time highs after an enormous rally over the past few months. Since its low point in March at around $82/share, PayPal has gained a little over 70%, currently changing hands at $141/share. The stock had already starting rebounding away from the S&P 500 in hope for an increased online transaction volume through Covid-19. Gains really took off, however, with the release of the company's earnings report. In my view, the recent rally is unjustified. The current valuation amid PayPal's multiple expansion is not supported by the future expected growth, leaving no additional upside for the present stockholders.In this article, I will:Image by raphaelsilvaPayPal's recovery had already started well before the company reported earnings. In fact, shares were near all-time highs the day before the report. After the earnings release, shares took off to new highs, as CEO Dan Schulman characterized April as the company's strongest month ever. That is in terms of new active users and engagement.The total payment volume for the quarter was up a solid 19% YoY.Source: Investor presentationThe exciting part, however, is in regards to April. The company revealed that its daily transaction volume grew by 25% within the month. Not YoY, but rather from the beginning of the month to the end of it. At the same time frame, the company added 7.4 million net new active users. This is almost more than double the additions it would normally achieve in previous, regular months.Source: Investor presentationThe cherry on top was the CEO's statement on the earnings call. Mr. Schulman unveiled that on May 1st, the company had its biggest, highest single-day transaction volume ever. That applied to Venmo as well. Therefore, it was made clear that April's remarkable numbers were not the peak, and that growth is indeed rapidly continuing towards May as well.A few days later, PayPal also started an offering of $4B of senior notes. Impressively, the company was able to issue 2050 notes at 3.25% or as little as 1.35% for its 2023 notes. With such low rates and the company's historical ability to achieve high ROI on its capital, the market has continued to push the stock higher over the past few days.While these numbers are impressive and point towards a bright future for the company, I believe that shares have hit the ceiling and offer minimum upside going forward.PayPal's valuation has massively deviated from its historical P/E ratios amid higher analyst expectations. With a surge in new active users, analysts estimate a new higher EPS of $3.60 for the next 12 months. Still, even if PayPal delivers on these expectations, the stock is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of ~41, as the graph below illustrates.The forward P/E of ~41 is the highest PayPal has ever seen. It implies that the current outlook in terms of PayPal's earnings growth is the most optimistic it has been since its IPO. The closest this figure has been to today was around 40 in early 2018. Over the next three quarters throughout 2018, PayPal grew its EPS 34.2%, 35.4%, and 35.2%, respectively. Therefore, it only makes sense that now the market expects an equally impressive, if not higher, EPS growth to justify this multiple again.  In my view, there is not a case to justify these expectations. Suppose that PayPal actually meets the analyst expectations of EPS of $3.60 next year. Over the past 12 months, PayPal's EPS amounts to $1.60. Being generous, I will assume PayPal's 2019 EPS of $2.09 to exclude its previous less profitable quarter. Even from that figure, an EPS growth to $3.60 implies growth of ~72%. Again I have not included PayPal's recent less profitable quarter, as well. I can't see such EPS growth materializing. Even considering April's impressive transaction volume and net user additions, these expectations are just unreasonable.An EPS CAGR of 30%-40% could be supported one way or the other. TPV for Q1 was $191B. Assume that March's TPV was a little over 1/3 of that at $65B. The company said that within April, daily transactions rose by 25%. Therefore April's TPV should be around $81.5B. This amount multiplied by three months comes out to $243B. However, let's assume some in-between growth as well, reaching $250B. That implies a 45% growth from Q2 of 2019. In any scenario, I can't see how an expected EPS growth of 72% could materialize.To confirm my concerns, I performed a discounted cash flow valuation model. In terms of the company's free-cash-flow growth, I assume an initial 25%, which gradually declines over time. I believe that this is prudent and that the 25% initial growth reflects the company's optimistic statements. Intrinsic value per share comes out $135, implying that PayPal is overvalued by around 4.4%.Source: AuthorEven if I were to use more optimistic estimates, however, the intrinsic value would not come out far from PayPal's current price. Therefore I don't see significant, if any, upside for investors to buy at ~$141/share.PayPal is an amazing company, no doubt about it. It offers a resilient family of products that has definitely seen significant growth amid the ""stay-at-home"" economy. Until recently, the company offered investors attractive returns even though it was historically trading at a slight premium. However, the recently increased expectations have raised the bar way too high. Even if PayPal delivers, its share price is hard to justify. At best, PayPal has no further upside at this point.I will stay away at this valuation and hope to add if a better opportunity presents itself, after a possible pullback.If you liked this article, please consider following me here on Seeking Alpha.

Sometimes this outweighs all fundamental factors.The current economic crisis, like all others, creates and destroys nothing. But it accelerates the trends that were before.","Let's start with a quantitative analysis and then move on to a qualitative one.Almost since the IPO, PayPal's (PYPL) stock price has been following its long-term exponential trend, which is pretty typical of a growth company:Now the company's stock price dynamics is almost perfectly synchronized with its trend. In general, this is a sign of ""healthy"" dynamics.At the same time, the rolling monthly total price return is too high. This is a short-term negative factor:After the last quarterly report, the average expectations of analysts regarding the growth of PYPL's revenue and EPS in the current and next fiscal year have not changed:A fundamental indicator of PayPal's growth is the dynamics of active customer accounts. And here we should admit that it has been growing with acceleration over the last four years:Moreover. Now we can even consider the relationship between the company's capitalization and the number of active customer accounts. By the way, this relationship identifies the current price of the company as almost balanced:Going further, over the last five years, PayPal's capitalization has been in a qualitative linear relationship with its absolute revenue TTM:As you can see, this relationship identifies PayPal's current capitalization as overvalued. Moreover, according to analysts' average expectations, in Q4 2020, PayPal's revenue TTM will be around $20 billion, and in my model, this means that the company's rational stock price will come close to $145, which is not much more than the current level.The long-term relationship between PayPal's absolute EBITDA TTM and capitalization also indicates an overvalued state of the company:It's interesting to note that PYPL demonstrates a strong direct relationship between return on invested capital and the EV/IC multiple. In this case, all other things being equal, PayPal's stock price should drop by 120% so that the balanced state can be achieved:Within the bounds of the described relationships, one can't say that PayPal is undervalued now.PayPal is in an active phase of quantitative growth and does not pay dividends. In my opinion, such companies should be evaluated through multiples based on revenue parameters.The comparable valuation based on the Forward P/S (next FY) has shown that PayPal is balanced with the market:The same is true for the Forward P/S (current FY) multiple:And for the simple P/S multiple:Even such a specific multiple as EV/IC tells the same thing: PayPal is balanced now.Now, PayPal's Bearish Beta (a measure of how a stock price tends to drop when the market is only down) is much smaller than the Bullish Beta (a measure of how a stock price tends to rise when the market is only on the rise):It means that PayPal stock is more responsive to the overall growth of the stock market than to its decline. Sometimes this outweighs all fundamental factors...The current economic crisis, like all others, creates and destroys nothing. But it accelerates the trends that were before.According to a study by DIGITAL PAYMENTS 2020 conducted jointly by Google and The Boston Consulting Group, five years ago, the cash and non-cash payments were accountable for 78% and 22% of payments respectively:Then it was predicted that these shares will be equal only by 2023. I do not have fresh numbers, but I am sure the COVID-19 pandemic will significantly accelerate this trend. This will strengthen the tailwind for PayPal. Therefore, I have no concerns about the long-term future of the company.I find the current price of PayPal generally justified. But, at least until the next quarter, I think the potential has been exhausted."
4348624,104621,2020-05-19T04:31:27-04:00,"PayPal is a winner in the new economy as transaction volume soars.The stock has had strong momentum since reporting earnings. Historically, stocks that rise after earnings tend to drift higher due to an anomaly known as PEAD.PayPal just sold 30-year bonds for 3.25 percent. This gives the company optionality with its balance sheet to make strategic investments.","PayPal (PYPL) stock is on a roll, rising from under $90 in the depths of the coronavirus crisis to nearly $150 per share this week. There is real substance to the rise. May 1st was the biggest day in the company's history for transaction volume, for both PayPal and Venmo. In this article, I'm going to explain why PayPal has risen so much and why the stock has the potential to rise even more.Cash has its place in society and is most popular among the working class (who often work for tips) and the upper class (business owners), but is less commonly used by those in the middle class. As such, the cash in circulation in the US (and outside the US) continues to rise. Checks, however, have no place in the 21st-century economy. We may view the coronavirus crisis as the nail in the coffin of the old system of businesses and consumers using paper checks. Hence, there were a record number of transactions for PayPal earlier this month. PayPal stock has been rapidly rising since the paradigm shift became clear in the company's last earnings call.Said Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal, during the May 7th conference call:These numbers are hard to ignore for a company the size of PayPal. PayPal is a global business, and recent catalysts have created societal changes on a global scale that are favorable to its business. PayPal similarly was able to raise money at rock-bottom rates, which it can use to buy back stock, expand the business, or both. Notably, the company was able to sell bonds with a 30-year term for 3.25 percent. With growth at 20 percent and borrowing cost at a 2-3 percent weighted average, the world is on PayPal's side. What's common in these types of scenarios is for investors to initially underreact to changing circumstances.Academic research has long held that stocks that report positive earnings and revenue surprises tend to continue rising in the weeks and months following the announcement. The basic thesis is that Wall Street analysts and investors are slow to react to changing fundamentals, causing stocks to underreact on average after earnings announcements, both to positive and negative surprises. Here's a graph, for those so inclined. The top line on the chart is companies that outperform on earnings, revenue, and other financial metrics like margins, while the bottom line is those that do worse.Source: QuantpediaThis effect is related to several related price anomalies, such as time-series momentum, relative momentum, and the disposition effect. PayPal is currently displaying all of these momentum indicators at once. The stock has time-series momentum because it's up big since the bottom in March. The stock has relative momentum because it's up more than the market - and the Nasdaq for the year. PEAD I already explained, and the disposition effect is connected to momentum (see here for the most-owned stocks on Robinhood). While PayPal isn't guaranteed to rise, it's a pretty good bet. As such, I'm making PayPal my top stock pick for 2020. Micron (MU) was last year's pick, although I made it much earlier in the year.PayPal has several well-known asset pricing anomalies in its favor at the moment. I see asymmetric upside for the stock in the new economy. The Robinhood crowd will pile into airlines and cruise stocks, and I'll put my money into companies that are making money, growing revenues, and in a strong financial position that's getting even better. I'm long PayPal, and you should consider it too.Did you enjoy this article? Follow me for future research updates!"

While the rebound is partly justified from the digitalization process brought about from stay-at-home orders, the stock faces challenges that could slow down the upside at these levels.SourceAfter a slowdown in March, growth rates have experienced a rapid acceleration in April and May. Figure 1 – Source: PayPal financialsThe pandemic helped to boost active accounts numbers, now up 140% from February levels. On the recent post-earnings conference call, CEO Daniel Schulman recently reported that PayPal had its historical largest single day of transactions on May 1st. Similar trends were experienced by other e-commerce companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of course, but also Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), with the latter recently lifting its Q2 guidance.  Figure 2 – Source: PayPal financialsEngagement levels are also up 30%, showing that the stay-at-home orders are still actively influencing consumers mindset and spending behaviour. PayPal’s growth was majorly driven by its digital wallet app Venmo and by the closure of Honey acquisition. Regarding Honey, PayPal CEO Daniel Schulman recently disclosed an impressive 180% increase in net new accounts.Short-term trends are therefore pointing upwards for PayPal’s business, with the stock reacting accordingly and now $160 a share. However, PayPal is not playing alone in the e-commerce space. In the digital wallet segment, Square’s (NYSE:SQ) Cash App is growing faster than Venmo, and the recent eBay growth could translate into a bigger piece taken out of PayPal’s revenue when the partnership ends this July.The digital wallets market is getting bigger, with research pointing at a $7.5 trillion market by 2024. There is definitely room for several players to grow at this stage, but in the long term, the circle could get smaller and smaller. Hints can be taken from China, where mobile payments account for 68% of total payments (vs. 15% in the US) and the market is majorly controlled by only two big players, WeChat and AliPay (NYSE:BABA). PayPal is building a strong ecosystem aiming at connecting digital wallets with physical stores, with online stores and now even with discount finder Honey, creating an omnichannel experience currently unique in the United States. However, the consumer side of the channel is getting outperformed by Square’s cash app. Money transfers between peers work best when the users are all sharing the same platform, and for this reason consolidation in the market should be expected (and already happened in more matured markets such as China). Cash App is growing at a faster rate (Figure 3), shown by the significantly higher download rates and the number 1 position in the financial applications category for both Android and IOS. Figure 3: Cash App (left) Vs. PayPal Mobile (right) - Source: App Annie IntelligenceMany of you are probably aware that eBay is soon switching payment processor from PayPal to Adyen (OTCPK:ADYEY), with the deal with PayPal ending this July. During the Q4 earnings call, CEO Dan Schulman anticipated that eBay would be approximately 6% of total TPV. It seems like a small number, but eBay at the time constituted a significant 14% of revenue (although in decline from the 26% share of 2015). Due to eBay’s recent growth, the revenue share coming from eBay is probably not going to decline as expected. The agreement with eBay is coming to an end soon, but PayPal will still be selectable as a payment option on the eBay marketplace until 2023. Should users continue to opt for PayPal as a payment method, the revenue share coming from eBay will not be significantly affected in the short term. However, in the long term, eBay will achieve completed independence from PayPal. At that point, a ~14% revenue cut for PayPal could be very significant.The recent run-up in PayPal’s stock price may be partly justified by a faster shift to digital payments and changes in consumers behaviour. However, a growing segment like digital wallets faces competition challenges, and the revenue diversification away from eBay should experience a slowdown. I remain bullish in the long term due to the potential growth in the digital market, but at this price, I rate PayPal a HOLD.If you found this article of value, please follow (near the title) and/or press ""Like this article"" just below."

PayPal's 1Q20 results were hurt by a soft month of March, but the company seems to have returned to ""business as usual"" in April.I think that PayPal is on the right side of growth trends in payment processing, and recent developments only help to support my bullishness.I believe PYPL's price and earnings multiple are high for a very good reason.","May 7 was yet another day to remember that the COVID-19 crisis will leave the US economy deeply scarred. Unemployment claims for the most recent week exceeded expectations, and filings now add up to well over 30 million since mid-March. Corporate America has been feeling the pinch, with earnings currently forecasted to drop by a ten-year record of 20% in 2020, if not more.But look at PayPal's (PYPL) numbers over the past few months, and the crisis will have seemed like a bump in the road. The company's 1Q20 performance, disclosed after-hours on May 6, was certainly impacted by the closure of a large part of the global economy in March. But business has returned to something very close to normal in April, suggesting that PayPal may suffer much less than its peers through the novel coronavirus setback.Credit: Corporate Office HeadquartersThe first quarter headline numbers were not necessarily pretty. Both revenues and earnings lagged consensus expectations, a one-two punch that PayPal had not suffered in the previous 20 quarters at least. Top-line growth of less than 12% was also a record-low for the company, while adjusted EPS of $0.66 that was flat YOY took a hit from a $237 million provision for credit losses.But any drag to operational and financial results seems to have been caused by a very weak month of March. The headwinds appear to have subsided, as the charts below suggest. In April, net new adds skyrocketed, likely the result of the economy shifting to e-commerce and PayPal naturally benefiting from it.Payment volumes bounced straight back to 20%-plus levels, and the management team has disclosed May 1st having been the ""largest single day of transactions ever, larger than last year's transactions on Black Friday or Cyber Monday"". The impressive numbers of the past several weeks happened in spite of some cross border weakness, FX pressures and a sharp drop in travel and entertainment-related business.Source: earnings slideLooking forward, the YOY increase in second quarter revenue has been guided to reach mid-teen levels on an FX-neutral basis, and the same should happen with non-GAAP EPS growth (pending potential adjustments to credit provisions). I believe there is quite a bit of conservatism baked into these projections, considering (1) how strong April's key operating metrics have been and (2) the unpredictable nature of this ""new economy"".I will be honest: I did not expect to see PayPal perform as well as it has so quickly after the start of the COVID-19 crisis. Intuitively, it makes sense that a heavy shift from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce and from contact to contactless transactions would have been a positive for the San Jose-based tech company. Still, I may have underestimated the appeal of PayPal's payment platform, and my expectations have been pleasantly exceeded.I remain a PYPL bull, and short-term developments only help to support my long-term view on the company and stock. About a year ago, I added this name to my All-Equities SRG portfolio, and explained in more detail why I did so. Today, I continue to think that PayPal is on the right side of growth trends in payment processing. Green field opportunities in less developed markets, the ramp up and monetization efforts in Venmo and the recent acquisition of Honey further beef up the growth potential.Data by YChartsCertainly, PYPL is not a stock for bargain hunters, as the chart above illustrates. Shares have pushed well past mid-February highs and now trade at a trailing P/E of 70x that is more than double Visa's (V) 33x. I won't even argue that a correction in the near term is off the table, considering the stock has nearly doubled in value in only about six weeks. But I believe PYPL's price and earnings multiple are high for a very good reason.Due to volatility concerns and my preference for risk-balancing a diversified portfolio, I prefer not to over-allocate to this stock. At the same time, I would not dare sell a winner amid a period of economic softness, even following the impressive spike in share price."
4346841,25047,2020-05-12T18:39:50-04:00,"Consumer-oriented fintechs present a new challenge to PayPal.I show that many of these new players present a superior product versus PayPal.Thus, as they grow, they will inevitably impact PayPal.","The proposition from fintech innovations is often to make things simpler, faster and cheaper for consumers. PayPal (PYPL) was a leader in the fintech world, bringing digital payments to the masses just as online ecommerce expanded powerfully. PayPal has been riding that same trend for a long time.Recently, though, many other fintech companies have started to gain significant traction by serving the consumer. What many of these fintech companies have in common is that they leverage the usage of physical and virtual debit/credit cards to instantly be usable anywhere in the world, be it physical or digital.This leveraging runs both ways:Of course, just offering the same advantages of having a debit/credit card would not be very attractive for consumers who already hold a debit/credit card. This meant further ""nearly costless"" (for the fintech) features needed to be added, such as:All of these extras make the new fintech's usage extremely attractive for consumers, while at the same time producing zero overhead or cost for accepting merchants (since they already accept the payments transparently because of accepting debit/credit cards).So here's the problem for PayPal: given the above, and with mostly only a single exception, PayPal is an extremely worse product for most consumers. Hence my thesis that the growth of these fintechs will at some point cut into PayPal's growth, or maybe even make PayPal regress.Why is PayPal worse?It's worse because not only is PayPal accepted less widely than debit/credit cards, but PayPal has also fallen prey to extreme greed.This extreme greed isn't entirely visible to US consumers, because they tend to transact using a single currency, the dollar. However, international consumers are often exposed to many different currencies (it's also not a surprise that some of these products were first targeted at travelers). Thus, such consumers are quickly exposed to PayPal's absurd foreign currency rates and fees, for instance amounting to 500 bps on the common EUR/USD pair.Not only is that extremely uncompetitive with emerging fintech companies (which can be as low as ""free""), but it lags even old-school banks (and credit cards...) by a massive differential (these will typically charge around 100-250 bps).PayPal doesn't just stop at being egregiously uncompetitive - which would already drive many consumers towards better, friendlier, fintechs. PayPal also rubs in the salt. Many consumers will notice that PayPal actively takes steps to make sure it charges the consumer the fat foreign exchange fees even if entirely unwarranted or unnecessary. For instance, if the consumer has a USD account in Europe and could thus transfer its PayPal USD balance towards that account with no conversion taking place, PayPal will force a conversion to EUR! This repeats on several other scenarios, where PayPal actively tries to force the imposition, a totally unnecessary conversion.All in all, between using PayPal and using one of the newer fintechs (especially those emerging in Europe, like Revolut or N26), it rapidly becomes evident that the newer fintechs are more practical and much cheaper to use. I've seen this myself as I was always a large PayPal user, and now overwhelmingly my previous PayPal usage has migrated to Revolut. From a consumer standpoint, only PayPal's extreme protection of online sales seems superior versus what one gets from the ability to chargeback a conventional credit/debit card. That, of course, already requires a bad online seller, the likes of which are now rarer.Finally, the emergence of Apple Pay and Google Pay integrates well with PayPal but also with its fintech competitors (though debit/credit card integration). This removes PayPal's checkout advantage (it being slightly more convenient when you are required to enter a card number).In my view, at the very least this competition (outside the U.S. market, but also potentially inside it) will restrain PayPal's growth and ultimately also impact its margins. PayPal as currently exists is simply an inferior product, though with lots of momentum behind it.I don't think the market is fully appreciating the emergence of this threat. For instance, N26 is now past 5 million users and Revolut is past 8 million users. The effect from these and other fintechs isn't very evident yet because they're still relatively small in the context of a growing fintech market, however as they gain scale the impact will inevitably happen."

        During April, PayPal gained 7.4m new accounts and grew payment volume 22%, while Visa and Mastercard saw 20%+ declines.
        Contactless retail, social distancing and government stimulus payments during COVID-19 are all generating new users and usage for PayPal.
        At $139.24, the shares are on a 1.4% Free Cash Flow Yield, but this is likely acceptable given PayPal's unique growth in a low-growth world.
        We believe the share price will likely grow at high-teens, in line with EPS; even a dramatic de-rating will give no worse than a flat share price. Buy.","PayPal (PYPL) delivered an astonishing set of 20Q1 results on Wednesday, with revenue growth accelerating to 20% year-on-year in April, despite the COVID-19 lockdown. Shares rose 8.5% to $139.24 in after-market trading. We were wrong with our Neutral rating, last updated in mid-March just before the COVID-19 lockdown. Our main mistake was in failing to anticipate how PayPal would actually benefit from COVID-19 immediately - at the time of our previous article, shares had lost 17.0% of their value since our May 2019 initiation, but after the lockdown in late March shares gained nearly 40%:However, we believe the latest results more than justify even the now-higher share price, and upgrade our rating to Buy.PayPal management witnessed a “very noticeable shift in our results toward the end of March and throughout April”, making April “perhaps our strongest month since our IPO”. Total Payment Volume (""TPV"") growth (excluding currency) decelerated to 7% year-on-year in March, but then rebounded sharply to 22% in April: The rebound in TPV was “driven primarily by PayPal and Venmo checkout experiences”, and was fairly broad-based across a number of verticals, including Fashion, Home & Garden, Electronics, Gaming/Video and Food/Drink. Overall growth was strong despite an over-80% decline in the Travel and Events verticals, which were a high-single-digit percent of volumes.Driven by the trends in TPV, PayPal's revenue growth similarly first decelerated to 5% year-on-year (excluding currency) in March, and then re-accelerated to 20% in April; management is now guiding for a 15% growth in 20Q2: The acceleration in growth was helped by a major increase in Net New Accounts (""NNAs""), which reached 7.4m in April (compared to 9.3m for the entire 19Q4), taking PayPal's total active accounts to 332m: PayPal's 22% year-on-year volume growth in April stood in sharp contrast to Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), which saw volume declines of 20% or more: PayPal is almost perfectly suited to the COVID-19 world. Having historically focused on underserved SMEs and consumers who were not using traditional electronic payments (like Visa and Mastercard), it was well-placed to help them with the contactless retail, social distancing and government stimulus payments that came after the outbreak. As PayPal's CEO explained: This expansion in PayPal's user base is likely to be mostly permanent, and the increased usage is likely to be mostly habit-forming, adding a lasting benefit to its long-term growth. The early signs are encouraging:PayPal's 20Q1 P&L does not capture its acceleration in April, and was also negatively impacted by higher credit loss reserves. However, it does provide increasing visibility of operational leverage, which helps to address our previous concerns about margin pressures.For 20Q1, while Net Revenues grew 11.9% year-on-year, Other Operating Expenses was flat organically and grew 9.9% as a result of acquisitions. Nonetheless, excluding higher credit reserves and prior-year investment gains, PayPal's non-GAAP EPS grew 66.8% year-on-year: Other Value-Add Services revenues grew 1.5%, with lower interest income due to PayPal giving interest and fee relief to some customers, but offset by the addition of revenues from Honey. (The acquisition of Honey was completed in early January and revenues had grew 40% from January/February levels by April; revenues were reported to be around $200m in 2019.)Interestingly, Transaction Expense grew 21.2%, slightly slower than TPV, with the Transaction Expense Margin actually improving by 5 bps (to 91 bps) due to the mix shift under COVID-19, departing from the historic down trend.PayPal withdrew its full-year 2020 guidance because of COVID-19, but its 20Q2 guidance points to an 15% ex-currency revenue growth and a 15-20% non-GAAP EPS growth:While this is slightly lower than the previous medium-term outlook of an (ex-currency) 20% EPS CAGR, it is far better than most companies today, many of which are seeing earnings shrink in 2020; it is also better than what Visa and Mastercard are likely to achieve this year.We now believe PayPal will be able to deliver a high-teens EPS CAGR in the medium term, close to its previous 20% medium-term target, even with a prolonged recession as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.While a recession will likely increase PayPal's credit losses, these are unlikely to be material to its earnings and balance sheet.Loans and interest receivables were at $3.7bn at 20Q1, with each 1% increase in the reserve coverage ratio estimated by management as implying an extra $45m in transaction and credit losses. However, PayPal already has reserves at 17% of loans and interest receivables after the 20Q1 reserve build (it was 11% at 19Q4), so potential losses are largely reserved for. In any case, any additional losses will likely not be material due the size of PayPal's earnings, with its non-GAAP EBIT at $4.13bn in 2019At $139.24 (as of aftermarket trading on 07-May), on 2019 financials, PayPal shares are on a 44.8x P/E (on non-GAAP EPS, on GAAP EPS P/E is 67.1x); the “real” Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") Yield, after subtracting the cost of stock-based compensation, is 1.4%:Our new base case is that PayPal's valuation rating would remain stable, because its double-digit growth during COVID-19 makes it uniquely attractive. This means its high-teens EPS CAGR would also lead to the share price growing at high-teens, lead to a high-teens annualised return for investors.Should PayPal de-rate to an approx. 3% FCF Yield over the next 3 years, the impact would be about 50% in total and high-teens per year, which would be largely offset by the high-teens EPS CAGR, giving a flat share price.Our previous concerns on PayPal included large non-GAAP expenses, valuation, poor capital allocation and the pending loss of the eBay (EBAY) business in July. However, with COVID-19 and PayPal's latest results, we believe these are now far less relevant for valuation.Non-GAAP expenses, primarily non-cash share-based compensation, continue to be substantial, and we believe non-GAAP earnings to paint an over-stated picture of company earnings. However, we have side-stepped this by using FCF Yield as our valuation metric.PayPal's valuation has changed in relative terms given its continuing strong growth while most other companies are seeing their earnings shrink. The FCF Yield of 1.4% is less than ideal, but not uncommon among large Tech companies. In a world of “lower for longer” interest rates, investors seem to accept high valuations provided there is high growth, which PayPal has. With the increasing visibility of operational leverage, there is the potential for PayPal earnings growth to accelerate further ahead of Visa and Mastercard.Capital allocation continues to be poor in our view, with too much spent on acquiring companies with little revenues, but we believe investors are willing to overlook this aspect of PayPal's business model.The eBay business is likely to still be worth the same 10% of revenues we estimated before. (Management had guided to eBay being at 6% of TPV at mid-2020, and we estimate this volume to have a 4% take-rate.) eBay's volumes were flat ex. currency in 20Q1 but accelerated to growing at 20%+ in April. However, we are encouraged by PayPal's faster growth, and its higher margins seen in 20Q1, which will help offset this loss. A ""flight to quality"" among consumers to brand-name payment platforms, as PayPal claimed to have observed during the lockdown, also makes it more likely that PayPal will meet its expectation of retaining enough eBay business for this to be only a 1% headwind to revenue growth in 2020. We were wrong about PayPal, specifically wrong in not anticipating its unique ability to benefit from COVID-19 since late March.PayPal's ability to continue growing its revenues (and at double-digits) during the COVID-19 lockdown makes it uniquely attractive. We now believe PayPal will grow its EPS at a high-teens CAGR sustainably and maintain its current valuation multiples. This means its share price will also grow in line at high-teens, giving a high-teens annualised return.If we are wrong about valuation, and PayPal shares were to de-rate to a 3% FCF Yield over the next 3 years, its high-teens EPS CAGR would largely offset this and give a flat share price, limiting investor downside.This is an attractive risk/reward, and we upgrade PayPal to BuyNote: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here."

(NASDAQ: PYPL). The stock represents good value with an estimated upside of 37.66%, trading at an EBITDA multiple of 16.00x. The upside potential is driven by the following:The company boasts a strong international presence with 100 million non-US users in more than countries and is expected to experience a revenue growth of 17% to 19% from 2020 to 2022. Downside risks are highly competitive industry, global and regional economic conditions that may affect operations and performance, and volume –based expense model that may pressure margins.Although it is too early to size its impact on the company’s performance, according to JP Morgan and other networks, it should be manageable.Source: Image created by author with data from FactSetThe outlook for the sub-industry of data processing and outsourced services is neutral; however, the overall industry posted healthy revenue growth in 2016 (13%), 2017 (10%) and 2018 (8.8%). Payment-led companies benefited from secular trends, as the shift from cash to digital payments (Source: CFRA). In addition, world-wide non-cash payment volumes (debt, credit, ACH and check) was $522bn in 2017 and is expected to rise to a $1tn value by 2022 with a CAGR of 14% (Source: Capgemini). This trend will fuel payment volumes and economics through digital payment with consumers (cards not present payments or CNP) and merchants (integrated point-of-sale). Lastly, the ability to establish deep customer relationships helps provide predictable revenue and free cash flow profiles, through recurring contracts.PayPal Holdings, Inc. will benefit from the shift in the payments landscape with the decline cash and rise of e-commerce. As of May 2018, the firm had an addressable market of more than 3.6 billion internet users. As of December 2019, PayPal had 305 million active accounts and expects to add 35 million additional active accounts in 2020 (Source: Deutsche Bank). The company saw a rise in 0.7% in revenue exposure from 16.0% to 16.7% in emerging markets and will further expand its financial services for ‘underserved’ populations including ‘un-banked’ Americans. Despite the engagement growth of about 10%, revenue growth slowed to 15% in 2019 (from 28% in 2018). We see the growth to pick up back to 16-18%. The growth will be driven by the expansion outside the US as Total Volume Payment (TPV) and Number of Payment Transactions continue to grow at over 20% per year and the Number of Active Accounts at 15% per year. Additionally, the partnership with UnionPay will allow PayPal to further penetrate and expand in China (further information below) as well as becoming the first company outside of China to be granted license to provide digital payment services in China through GoPay.Paymentus, Pay with Venmo, UberPaymentus, Pay with Venmo, Uber, and new partnerships are expected to accelerate TPV growth by ~300-400 bps in 2020 and ~500-700bps in 2021 (Source: Deutsche Bank). Paymentus is expected to be the largest contributor with about $35 to $55bn in 2021. Pay with Venmo is expected to be the next largest contributor with about $17 to $20 in 2021. Lastly, its partnership with Uber will be expanding in Europe, Brazil, India and Middle East, which will contribute about $13 to $16bn in volume in 2021. Revenue growth for 2020 to 2022 is expected to increase back up to 17%-19%, from a slight decrease in 2019 (2018: 18% vs 2019: 15%).Recent Acquisition: HoneyPayPal acquired Honey Science Corp for $4bn in cash. Honey was founded in 2012, which provides an online shopping tool that provides customers with discounts and reward programs. Honey is off to a strong start with about 100,000 downloads so far and is expected to contribute about 1.9ppts to revenue growth in 2020, which is an upside of about $330mm (Source: JP Morgan). With Honey’s 17 million monthly active users and partnership with about 30,000 online retailers, PayPal will experience an improvement in spending volume due to additional customer engagement.Partnerships: FIS Global, UnionPayPayPal recently signed an extended deal with Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (FIS) Global to increase the scale for Pay with Rewards (describe) across thousands of FIS that represents more than 7,000 card loyalty programs in the US. In the beginning of Q3 2020, FIS Premium Payback network will enable millions of cardholders of FIS to use their reward points to pay for purchases at PayPal merchants internationally and will serve customers in more than 50 markets around the world.PayPal Holdings, Inc recently signed a deal with UnionPay, the world’s largest card company by payment volume. More than $7 billion UnionPay cards will be added to PayPal accounts and customers will be able to use them outside of China including Australia, the Phillipines, Singapore, South Korea and Thailand. PayPal will be adding the option for more than 30 other markets in 2020.Source: Image created by author with data from FactSetAlthough PayPal’s debt levels are satisfactory, the company’s debt to equity ratio has increased from 13.2% to 29.3% over the past 5 years. The was a result of PayPal entering the public debt market for the first time, raising $5 billion. The company plans to use $2.5bn to repay a term loan and the remaining $2.5bn for additional acquisitions. Acquisitions play a major role in PayPal’s growth strategy, as the company has invested or fully purchased companies since the beginning of 2017.Source: Image created by author with data from FactSetAlong with our target price of $148.16, we believe PYPL’s P/E of about 40, which is above ADS, WU and MDP, is due to stronger growth prospects. Additionally, although comps were based off FactSet, PayPal’s direct competitors that provide an alternative tend to be smaller, less diverse service platforms such as Payoneer, Inc (focuses on online shopping) and Stripe (focuses on online business).High Competition in Multi-Trillion Dollar Global Payments IndustryThe global payments industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing and highly innovative. PayPal competes against businesses that have a much larger brand recognition, longer operating histories, or a dominant position, as well as smaller businesses that are more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes. PayPal competes primarily on the basis of the ability to attract, retain and engage both merchants and consumers on their Payments Platform, brand recognition and preference, and the ability to develop products and services across multiple commerce channels (ie. Ecommerce, mobile, payments at the point-of-sale). However, through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, we think that PayPal can capture growth (ie. China) in the exploding market.Global and Regional Economic ConditionsThe company’s operations and performance may be affected due the uncertainty in global and regional economic events and conditions that may result in consumers and businesses postponing or lowering spending due to tighter credit, higher unemployment, financial market volatility, consumer debt levels or reduced consumer confidence. However, during downturns, PayPal Credit will be a competitive advantage, as the company is willing to provide consumers with financing options through every economic cycle. According to the company’s data, over $20 billion in loans and over 250 million transactions have been offered through PayPal Credit. Additionally, the firm’s significant cash on hand will be a safety net to execute operations and acquire less prepared competitors.Two-Sided Network ModelPayPal’s Two-Sided Network Model brings value to both customers and merchants as an ‘agnostic’ network in customers being able to fund their accounts. However, PayPal inconsequently acts as the ‘middleman’ that heavily relies on other parties such traditional card networks and banks. Charged fees have been increasing as a percentage of expenses, which may threaten scalability and margins of the business. It is crucial that PayPal expands margins to contain the volume-based expenses. However, this risk may be offset by the annual EBITDA margins expanding 18% - 26% (CFRA research: 26% -28%) from 2020 to 2022, driven by increased payment growth.Source: Company DataIn conclusion, I recommend a buy for PayPal Holdings. The price target of $148.16 is driven through the shift from cash to non-cash payments which will rise to a $1tn value by 2022 with a CAGR of 14%. Paymentus, Pay with Venmo, Uber and additional partnerships are expected to accelerate the Transaction Payment Volume (TPV) growth by ~300-400bps in 2020 and ~500-700bps in 2021. International expansion is expected with UnionPay and GoPay as the only Non-Chinese company to penetrate the Chinese digital payment market. PayPal's strong balance sheet of negative net debt provides optionality in buying out start-ups or smaller companies struggling with cash during economic downturns."
4336257,105617,2020-04-06T14:16:07-04:00,PayPal is one of a few companies to reiterate previous guidance and not predict large declines in revenues.Strong growth in accounts and transactions per user has continually driven business higher.Growth in revenues and income (EPS) are expected to continue at current rates.,"Online payment processor PayPal (PYPL) has had some extraordinary growth metrics since going public in 2015, with total payments and users on PayPal and its owned platforms (Venmo, Xoom, Braintree). While most companies are closing doors and expecting declines in customers and revenues, PayPal's growth does not look to be impacted. Although PayPal is preferred for small businesses, their customers and payments on the platform are online and should not see significant decreases in volume with people stuck at home for the most part.Whereas a majority of publicly-listed companies are yanking EPS and revenue guidance for the first quarter(s) of 2020 and the full year, PayPal stands by its guidance, although affirming that its quarterly revenues could come in on the lower range of past guidance, which stood at $4.78-4.84 billion. However, decreases in international cross-border e-commerce and currency volatility could affect YoY revenue growth by one percentage point.Source: Q4 PresentationPayPal's active user base has seen constant growth quarterly and annually, with the platform breaking over 300 million active accounts in Q4. As a result, total transactions, as well as active transactions per account, have increased steadily. Having both increases in active accounts and transactions per account boosts revenue, as having an increase in one while the other remains constant would already increase revenue and total payments.Neither of the growth metrics shows any signs of flattening as of now, and any potential flattening of the growth would occur in the present quarter. E-commerce sales have outpaced retailers, and PayPal's prevalence online and in strategic partnerships (eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), for example) will continue to bring traffic through its platform. PayPal's revenue and take percentage from transactions on eBay might decline with the changing terms of the partnership, but PayPal's presence and powering of typical card transactions will remain.Source: Q4 PresentationPayPal's merchant growth surpasses eBay's marketplace by a large margin, with eBay falling negative in Q4 18. PayPal has seen a slight decline in growth in Q4 but still presents strong double-digit percentage growth within merchant services that will continue as the platform continues with user and transaction growth.Source: Q4 PresentationPayPal has noted a possible one percentage point decrease in Q1 revenues coinciding with a decrease in international cross-border trade. Total payment value for cross-border trade has seen solid double-digit percentage growth YoY, although it has recently lagged total TPV's average growth rate of 22%. Even so, cross-border trade does account for ~17.6% of total TPV annually, and any substantial decrease could weaken total TPV for the first quarter. Once the pandemic ends and trade can resume internationally at scale, PayPal's growth should again fall within the mid 10% range for TPV, as the international market remains large in volume.PayPal has proven a solid track record in revenue growth since 2012 and a similar growth in net income, although the latter fell in 2014 as a result of a higher income tax rate. Minus that small bump in net income, growth has been increasing YoY. Data taken from Seeking AlphaUsing polynomial regression to continue trends of growth in revenue in income puts revenue nearing $27 billion by 2022 with a net income of $4.4 billion. This would represent a ~66% increase from current net income and a ~57% increase in revenue. PayPal has shown that growth exists in these quantities and should have no issues continuing this growth as e-commerce increases.Sustaining PayPal's revenue growth are solid cash and equivalents, access to credit, and high free cash flow generation. PayPal has access to at least $6 billion in credit facilities and has issued $5 billion in notes. PayPal's liabilities are primarily payables and customer dues, but receivables from customers are nearly the same. Cash reserves and free cash generation have increased significantly from 2018, giving PayPal enough liquidity to cruise through the current crisis.Source: 2019 10-KDuring the current crisis, PayPal has taken steps to preserve its customers and businesses and extend forgiveness to them. These actions might have some impacts on fees received and revenues generated, although it seems to be small. PayPal will now be allowing the following: customers deferring repayments on loans with no fee, merchants not facing charge-back fees for customer and card disputes, lengthening the time for response to disputes from 10 to 20 days, and doubling instant cashback for merchants using the PayPal Business MasterCard. These steps seek to soothe customers and merchants alike and allowing them more flexibility with conducting business.Source: 2019 10-KIn future obligations, PayPal only has limited exposure to contractual payments, with two notes coming due in 2022 and 2024 comprising a bulk of the near-term payments. Just under $1.1 billion total in future payments are due by year-end 2021, so PayPal will have no issues with any of these liabilities. Since the sum of these payments annually are fairly small (besides years when notes are due), they will not affect PayPal's liquidity or put any significant dent in cash reserves.PayPal is not expecting any major hits to revenue or income and has reaffirmed previous guidance to still stand, although numbers for the quarter could be at the lower end. Shares have fallen 25.4% regardless and could be underpricing in current growth and earnings numbers. PayPal's growth will not decrease or start to decrease YoY because of the virus, and growth in revenue, net income, and EPS is expected to continue on the current trend. Future payments are low, and PayPal's significant cash reserves, access to credit, and strong free cash flow give it coverage should the outbreak continue for the summer and should have no issues navigating choppy waters. PayPal seems undervalued at the moment, with shares starting to reflect declines in business, although that does not seem to be the case. PayPal can be a bargain at $90 if Q1 numbers fall within previous guidance, and if current growth trends continue, the stock could be headed back above $110 by year end."
4332417,105096,2020-03-17T07:59:37-04:00,"We review PayPal after shares falling to 17.0% lower since our Neutral rating in May 2019, incorporating 19Q4 results into our analysis.
        Most of our original concerns remain valid, with shares still trading on a high P/E multiple, 29.9x on non-GAAP basis and 44.8x on GAAP basis.
        Stock-based compensation costs are still large, the capital intensity of its growth has stayed high, and the transaction take-rate will fall again.
        For 2020, PayPal had expected EPS growth of 15-17% before Covid-19, lagging revenue growth due to acquisitions and investments.
        At $92.72, PayPal's valuation compares unfavourably with payment peers Visa and Mastercard. We reiterate our Neutral rating.","(We previously wrote about PayPal as ""Blue Sky Capital"")We review PayPal's (PYPL) investment case again following the recent market sell-off, incorporating 19Q4 results into our analysis.Since we initiated our Neutral rating on PayPal in May 2019 (""PayPal: Much More Expensive Than You Think""), shares have lost 17.0% of their value (as of Monday March 16th, after a 15.8% drop that day). This is a significantly worse performance than those of Visa (V) (-6.1%) and Mastercard (MA) (-6.9%), both of which have been Buy-rated in our coverage through this period.Even excluding the sharp fall on Monday, PayPal shares have consistently underperformed both Visa and Mastercard, as well as the S&P 500; it was also underperforming American Express (AXP) until late February:This article explains why we continue to believe that, while PayPal has good growth, its shares are still too expensive, and we prefer Mastercard and Visa.Our original Neutral rating recognised PayPal’s strong growth and integral role in the payments ecosystem, but rejected it for valuation reasons:Based on these, we concluded that PayPal's valuation at that time (46.1x P/E on non-GAAP EPS, 65.3x on GAAP EPS, 1.7% FCF Yield) was too expensive, even with management's medium-term outlook for a 20% EPS CAGR.We revisit each of these negative points below.PayPal shares are still expensive. At $92.72, even after another 6 months of growth, shares are still on a 29.9x P/E on non-GAAP EPS (and 44.8x on GAAP EPS). In terms of Free Cash Flow (""FCF""), after subtracting $1.53bn in non-cash share-based compensation costs, the ""real"" FCF Yield is 2.1%:PayPal's valuation compares with Mastercard’s 30.0x P/E and 3.0% FCF Yield, and Visa’s 26.9x P/E and 3.6% FCF Yield. While PayPal's growth targets are impressive, Mastercard's 2019-21 EPS CAGR objective of “high teens” and Visa's FY20 EPS growth outlook of “mid-teens” (both figures excluding currency and were issued before Covid-19) are only a few percentages lower. The P/E multiples are also not completely comparable, because PayPal's P/E is based on its non-GAAP EPS, which has a far larger gap from its GAAP EPS than peers, and its growth is also more capital-intensive.The gap between PayPal's GAAP and non-GAAP figures, primarily the result of stock-based compensation costs, widened again in 2019. Non-GAAP EPS of $3.10 is close to 50% larger than the GAAP EPS of $2.07. Non-GAAP EBIT is similarly about 50% larger, with 84% of the difference due to stock-based compensation costs:PayPal's growth continues to be capital-intensive. Its medium-term outlook explicitly calls for an average $1-3bn of M&A spend each year, which limits the proportion of FCF to be distributed to shareholders to 40-50%, and historically this has all been in buybacks (PayPal does not pay a dividend):In 2019, the M&A spend included the $4bn acquisition of Honey, a shopping and customer rewards platform. With a reported $200m in revenues, Honey was acquired with a 20x EV / revenue multiple. To achieve the growth rate it had, PayPal also funded an $1.63bn increase in its loan receivables in 2019, with the receivables balance now standing at $4.0bn.Acquisition spend and funding of receivables are not reflected in either P/E multiples or the FCF Yield, which is another reason we believe PayPal shares are more expensive than they look.PayPal's transaction take-rate will continue to fall. While it enjoyed a sequential bounce in 19Q4 due to pricing initiatives, and there will be more benefit from these to come, the long-term trend is clearly downward:Management's 2020 guidance (before Covid-19) also implies the transaction take-rate will fall, given it specifies a revenue growth (18-19% excluding currency) that will lag Total Payment Volume (""TPV"") growth (""mid-20s"").The decline in PayPal's transaction take-rate is structural, due to the decline and pending loss of higher-margin eBay (EBAY) volumes (more below), and TPV growth being driven by lower-margin Peer-to-Peer and marketplace volumes with the likes of Uber (UBER) and Airbnb (AIRB).2020 guidance is for an “essentially flat” operating margin, due to acquisitions and investments, after a solid expansion in 2019.Over a longer period, PayPal's operating margin is driven by a mixture of structural trends - transaction take-rate continues to shrink, transaction expense rate remains roughly flat, but non-transaction costs grow less quickly than revenues, which gives operational leverage.Management stated that PayPal's operating margin on incremental revenues is 35%. This means a continuing expansion in EBIT margin, with 157 bps in 2019 (on a non-GAAP basis, smaller at 110 bps on a GAAP basis):We now feel more positive about PayPal's operating margin, and expect it to be flat to slightly improving over time.PayPal is set to lose its eBay business in July 2020, as eBay has decided to intermediate payments on its platform, working with new payments provider Adyen (OTCPK:ADYYF) instead of PayPal (as described in our original article).PayPal management is now guiding to eBay business to be 6% of PayPal's TPV at mid-2020, which we estimate to be worth 10% of revenues (given the eBay volumes have ""almost a 4% take-rate""):Management believes the loss of eBay volume would mean only an 1% headwind to revenue growth in 2020. However, given this only includes the first 6 months of the transition, and PayPal past comments imply it assumes retention of a high proportion of the business, we believe there is a meaningful chance that the actual impact on earnings would be more negative, especially after 2020.At 19Q4 results in January, the outlook for 2020 was for revenue growth of 18-19% (excluding currency) and non-GAAP EPS growth 15-17% :This 2020 outlook implies a continuing trending down of TPV and revenue growth, albeit still at impressive levels and inevitable as the base gets larger:With the deteriorating situation in Covid-19 globally, PayPal updated its guidance for 20Q1 on February 27, reducing year-on-year revenue growth for that quarter by 100 bps (it was 17-18% excluding currency).With Covid-19 case numbers jumping in many countries, full-year 2020 performance is probably unpredictable. Instead we note that PayPal's medium-term outlook has been for a compounded annualised growth rate of 17-18% in revenues (excluding currency) and 20% in non-GAAP EPS:Where our Neutral rating would most likely be wrong is in PayPal's new business initiatives, which may or may not succeed dramatically. However, these are more speculative and will contribute little profit in the near term:Venmo's run-rate revenues grew to $450m at 19Q4, more than doubling from the $200m figure at 18Q4; Venmo's TPV was $102bn for 2019, compared to $62bn in 2018. However, despite this strong revenue growth, Venmo is still loss-making, though management is “beginning to see losses reduce in each year”. Management claimed to have “line of sight” on breakeven but did not elaborate, and it continued to prioritise Venmo's growth over profitability.Honey was successfully acquired in January 2020. On the 19Q4 call, management hinted at a $200m revenue figure for 2019 but did not elaborate; it was described as ""profitable on a net income basis in 2018"" in the original announcement. Honey will be EPS-dilutive in 2020 and, while it is expected to be accretive in 2021, we expect this is at least partly due to the low cost of the bonds (priced at 1.10% above Treasury) used to finance the deal.China is a new market for PayPal, following its acquisition of a 70% stake in GoPay in December, as well as a new agreement with China UnionPay in January. Under the agreement, China UnionPay cards can be added to PayPal wallets, while PayPal cards will be accepted by China UnionPay merchants. However, China will represent mainly new costs for PayPal initially, and investors “won’t see anything outsized in our numbers in 2020”.Point-of-Sale is described as a “big opportunity” for PayPal, which has been issuing cards under both PayPal and Venmo brands. Management claims to have the ability to issue cards in “upwards of 40” countries by 2020 year-end. However, we note that these cards depend on the Mastercard network.Having lost 17.0% of their value since our Neutral rating in May 2019, PayPal shares have clearly become cheaper, with their non-GAAP P/E falling from 46.1x to 29.9x. However, we believe they are still not cheap enough, and other stocks have also become cheaper during the recent market sell-off.At $92.72, our original concerns about PayPal's valuation, its high non-GAAP EPS adjustments, the capital intensity of its growth, etc., remain valid.While PayPal may have strong potential in some new business areas, these are more speculative, and their profits will remain small in the near term.We prefer to wait for a more attractive entry price, and reiterate our Neutral rating on PayPal.We prefer Mastercard and Visa which, with lower but still solid growth rates, are more attractively priced and return more of their earnings to shareholders.Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here."

(NASDAQ:PYPL) provides online payment support for businesses and consumers. It has been growing revenues at 15-20%, and the company is profitable and financially secure. Given the growth outlook from international markets, I believe PayPal could be one of the best investments of the coming 5-10 years.PayPal was founded in 1998 and is a technology platform that enables digital payments for consumers and businesses worldwide. It is part of the growing ""fintech"" sector. Technology has changed the landscape of finance, and PayPal has paved the way in giving individuals and businesses more extensive and often cheaper options to those offered by traditional banks.Let's begin our review with a quick look at PayPal's most recent performance.Source: PayPal Investor 2019 UpdateAbove, we have an account of growth rates for revenue, operating income, and EPS. All metrics have been growing quite steadily at double digits. PayPal has managed to maintain very strong organic growth and has also been making acquisitions at a rate of about 2/year since 2008. More than to boost immediate growth, these have been done to expand the scope of operations and invest in new tech. Now, let's go for the BS:Source: 10-KPayPal has been expanding its balance sheet in both assets and liabilities. While there is a small decrease in cash, this is more than compensated by the increase in S/T investments and other current assets. We also see a substantial increase in long-term investments. PayPal also took on close to $5 billion in long-term debt, probably to finance its latest two acquisitions in 2019; Honey and GoPay. In any case, the company is financially stable, with plenty of cash in hand and a D/E of 0.29.Unsurprisingly, being a profitable, double-digit growth company, PayPal trades at a premium vs. the markets and its peers. As of writing this, the P/E is 46.87, around double what SA calculates to be the sector median.The question we must answer is very simple. Do we believe PayPal can penetrate the global market sufficiently to compete with the likes of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Mastercard Corporation (NYSE:MA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA).In my last article on Visa, I outlined how it is an outstanding company, working in a sector with high barriers to entry, and maintaining its leadership through aggressive acquisitions. But if there is anyone who can stand up to Visa, Mastercard, and the other giants, it must be PayPal.PayPal will have trouble in replacing Visa and Mastercard in developed markets, but that won't stop them from trying. In this space, PayPal has made some strides, also through acquisitions. In 2013, they acquired Venmo, a mobile payment platform that has gained a lot of popularity in the U.S. and currently has over 50 million users. Venmo makes money through transaction fees on P2B and B2B but has no fees for P2P transactions.More recently, PayPal acquired Honey, a browser extension that automatically finds and applies coupons on purchases. Through this, PayPal is trying to improve customer experience and increase transactions. The ""process"" is detailed in its investor presentation on the merger.Source: Honey Acquisition presentation.PayPal is doing a good effort of adding functionality and value to their service, an area where they can compete with the big boys and innovate. However, the domestic market is a small piece of the pie, especially when we look at the medium and long term.In the medium term, PayPal has to look internationally and, most notably, to India and China. Here, PayPal is on a more level playing field and can strive to set itself up as the dominant force. 2019 has been an eventful year in this regard, with the partial acquisition, 70%, of GoPay. GoPay's platform is similar to PayPal's, allowing merchants to accept payments on their websites when customers are shopping online. PayPal has now become one of the first and most prominent foreign companies to enter the Chinese market. According to a report by Frost & Sullivan, the mobile payment market in China market should three-fold by 2023. Of course, PayPal still has to compete with Alipay and Tencent Holdings Limited (OTCPK:TCEHY), but there is plenty of growth left here.In India, the landscape remains even more competitive. Here again, we see the usual suspects; Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Baba trying to enter the space. In 2019, PayPal more than doubled its India revenues, while also more than tripling its losses. But the loss can be considered negligible, given the growth prospects. As we can see in the chart below, India's market remains quite fragmented, and there is even speculation of acquisitions shortly.And finally, the long-term sights for PayPal are set in Africa. A very large part of the population remains unbanked in Africa. One of the most common ways of the transaction is through mobile credit sent via text. PayPal is looking to harness the increased access to internet and mobile usage in Africa to put the power of modern banking, quite literally, in the hands of African phone users. Africa remains an undeveloped and underserved market, and it has some of the fastest-growing economies. In Nigeria, where PayPal has over 1 million users, the platform has become the link between the country and the outside world.Given that PayPal is still growing organically, with over 25% TPV in 2019, and the possibilities of international growth, I expect the double-digit growth to continue well into the second half of this decade. As far as valuation goes, where do I see PayPal in 5 years? Given the currents earnings estimates and the fact that PayPal has a habit of beating them, we could easily see EPS at ~$9 By 2025. Even at a more conservative P/E of 30, I would expect PayPal to trade at or above $250, which would imply an annual return of +16%. Optimistic? Perhaps. But, given the current low valuation offered by the market sell-off, PayPal may be worth the risk. This is, in my opinion, the middle of the road valuation, and I would not be surprised if PayPal goes even further.The bottom line is, the fintech sector is competitive, but also highly lucrative. I would personally recommend opening positions in Visa and PayPal. Square (NYSE:SQ) may also be a good bet, but I haven't yet taken the time to look into it. Some may think that PayPal's best days are behind it, but valuation doesn't reflect this, and neither do the financials. PayPal continues to deliver growth on all accounts, and I will believe in it until proven otherwise."
4320145,103480,2020-01-30T10:30:36-05:00,"Shares of PayPal slid ~3% after the company reported fourth-quarter results and issued FY20 guidance.
        The company beat Q4 estimates on both revenue and EPS, but core metrics including TPV showed some sequential deceleration.
        Investors are also worried about 2020's slightly light EPS guidance, due to dilution from less-profitable acquisitions.
        Still, PayPal's potential for expansion both in the U.S. and abroad is massive. For a company at a ~$20 billion revenue scale, its ~20% y/y revenue growth is incredible.","Earnings season has continued on in full force, and one of my favorite names in the tech sector, PayPal (PYPL), has just reported fourth-quarter results and initiated 2020 guidance. Despite a recent string of strong performance from the payments giant this year, a mixed fourth-quarter report (with good Q4 results but slightly disappointing guidance for next year), as well as some weakening user/TPV metrics, have PayPal shares slightly down to the tune of -3% in after-hours trading.PayPal is a stock that, over the past several years, has resembled something close to a vertical line. There are plenty of secular tailwinds supporting the shift of payments from cash and credit to virtual and P2P, and PayPal’s results speak clearly to that growing trend. In my view, any dip in PayPal shares represents a timely opportunity to buy, unless of course we see any red flags in the company’s results.Make no mistake, PayPal’s fourth quarter results were indeed mixed. We saw some slowdowns in the company’s core metrics (which we’ll cover shortly), but overall we’re not worried about the company’s long-term growth prospects.There are a couple of reasons for this - and these two reasons drive the entire bullish thesis for PayPal. Let’s think about PayPal in terms of its two major markets - the U.S. and China:With this being said, I wouldn’t read too much into a single quarter’s deceleration metrics (especially when we know a lot of that deceleration is comping unfavorably against last-year acquisitions). Stay long on PayPal and keep banking on the secular shift toward mobile payments.With this bull thesis having been reiterated, let’s now dive into the details of PayPal’s fourth-quarter results. The first thing we want to notice is that PayPal’s total payment volumes (TPV), basically the measure of all the payments that are processed on its platform, has seen lower sequential growth. TPVs had seen a reliable uptrend over the past year, accelerating to 27% y/y in Q3. In Q4, unfortunately, TPV is down to +22% y/y, as shown in the chart below:Figure 1. PayPal TPVSource: PayPal Q4 earnings deckThere’s a a pretty solid reason behind this, however - in the fourth quarter of last year, PayPal closed on its acquisitions of iZettle and Hyperwallet, which kicked up TPV volumes. This is the first quarter that PayPal is fully lapping those acquisitions. To me, the fact that a company as large as PayPal (with a >$20 billion annual revenue scale) can still grow total payments volumes at >20% y/y on an organic basis is still quite impressive.PayPal’s active accounts also continued to grow in the quarter, up 14% y/y to end the quarter and fiscal year at a total of 305 million accounts. There are still new users for PayPal to find - and this becomes especially true as the company ramps up operations in China.One other interesting metric that had, up to this point, been relatively flat is customer engagement. PayPal measures the amount of transactions that the average user completes on its platform. For the longest time, PayPal had grown engagement at +9% y//y - but this quarter, that rate accelerated slightly to +10% y/y. Amid softer total TPV trends, this is an encouraging signal that PayPal’s product is sticking with its user base.Figure 2. PayPal transactions per userSource: PayPal Q4 earnings deckPayPal’s guidance for the coming year is also far from disappointing. PayPal’s current revenue forecast calls for $20.8-$21.0 billion in revenues, representing a still-impressive constant-currency growth range of +18% y/y to +19% y/y. Importantly, Wall Street consensus only called for the low end of that range, at $20.8 billion. With this in mind, it’s still far too early to dump PayPal stock due to slight Q4 deceleration.Figure 3. PayPal guidance updateSource: PayPal Q4 earnings deckFor all the more sour news on TPV, PayPal gave us a big concession: huge profitability gains. Now of course, a large payments network like PayPal relies heavily on scale to drive down unit costs and grow profitability. As PayPal has been able to grow total revenues and TPV at a high teens/low 20s rate, it has also managed to drive significant operating leverage to boost profits.This quarter delivered a record performance for operating margin gains. PayPal called out the fact that growth in total payment volumes led to efficiencies in volume-based expenses (which rose +20% y/y, versus +22% y/y growth in total TPV). On the non-transaction side, non-volume related expenses grew just 7% y/y.The net effect of this, as shown in the chart below, is that PayPal was capable of stretching pro forma operating margins by 204bps - as previously noted, a record result for the company.Figure 4. PayPal margin gainsSource: PayPal Q4 earnings deckAs most investors are aware, the market has been incredibly hyper-sensitive to tech companies’ profitability ever since the fourth calendar quarter of 2019, and the stocks that are proving to be winners so far are those that can balance reasonable growth alongside profitability gains. PayPal, in my view, fits this bill perfectly.We note as well that, as shown in the chart below, PayPal managed to grow pro forma EPS by 24% y/y to $0.86, outpacing Wall Street expectations of $0.83 with 4% upside. If we net out the impacts of contributions from PayPal’s equity investments, EPS growth jumps to 28% y/y - which more than compensates for PayPal’s premium P/E ratio.Figure 5. PayPal EPSSource: PayPal Q4 earnings deckNow, there are lingering concerns that PayPal's EPS guidance for the coming year, $3.39-$3.46, is a bit light. This range would imply just 9-12% y/y growth over PayPal's FY19 pro forma EPS of $3.10 (excluding acquisitions, up 18-20% y/y), and it's also well below Wall Street's consensus of +13% y/y growth ($3.49). In my view, these concerns are premature. PayPal has had a solid history of outperforming versus its guidance, and given the company just exited Q4 with its largest-ever increase in operating margins (despite dilution impact from acquisitions), it's likely that PayPal will continue raising operating margins in 2020 (currently guidance calls for operating margins flat to 2019). We also have additional tailwinds from a ramp in China operations, as well as any potential earnings from increased monetization of PayPal's crown mobile jewel Venmo. Use the dip as an opportunity to buy."
4316862,52852,2020-01-14T17:03:17-05:00,"PayPal lagged the S&P 500 by 17% over the past 6 months.While valuation, technical indicators, and sentiment are all positive, I am concerned with the fundaments.My biggest concern is that PayPal may not be able to offset its market share loses with new partnerships.","Over the past 6 months, PayPal (PYPL) significantly underperformed the S&P 500 (lagging by ~17%). I took a look thinking there could be value there. However, I will remain on the sideline due to competitive concerns in an increasingly competitive landscape. Despite being relatively cheaper and bouncing off the a bottom, PYPL remains an expensive stock with consensus estimates calling for an acceleration in earnings in 2021, which may be at risk due to rising competition. In this article, I will walk you through my analysis of PayPal's valuation, technical, sentiment, and fundaments.Valuation and Technical AnalysisSource: All consensus numbers and forward multiples are from FactSet.PayPal is trading at 32x NTM EPS, which is around the middle of its 2-year range of between 27x an 36x. The stock is yielding 3.5% FCF, also around the middle of it's 2-year range.However, relative to the S&P500, which has been on a tear, PYPL is increasingly ""cheap"". On NTM P/E, PYPL peaked at around 115% premium to the S&P 500 back in June 2019 and then steadily declined to a 75% premium currently. The good news is that the premium erosion appeared to have stopped back in November.From July through November of 2019, PYPL lagged the benchmark by roughly 18-19% and have since started to keep up. Overall, the stock looks like it has found a bottom back in November 2019.PYPL has been a massive outperfomer since becoming public back in the middle of 2015 (doubling the S&P 500's performance), so this recent underperformance, erosion in valuation premium, and the bottoming of the stock in in November suggests a buying opportunity.Before I move on from valuation, I think it is important to point out to investors that PYPL looks substantially more expensive on GAAP EPS. While 32x NTM EPS is not cheap, PYPL is trading 45x on GAAP EPS.PYPL cannot seem to outgrow its addiction to adjusted numbers as it consistently report Adjusted EPS numbers that are substantially higher than GAAP EPS. For example, consensus expects FY20 GAAP EPS of $2.45 per share vs. Adjusted EPS of $3.49. As a benchmark, leading fintech companies Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) report adjusted and GAAP EPS are frequently the same number or not not materially different.However, to be fair to PYPL, their Adjusted EPS appear to track FCF a lot better than GAAP EPS.As for whether investors should use GAAP or Non-GAAP EPS, this is one of those things with no clear answer -- investors have no choice but to keep all these factors in mind and triangulate at PYPL's correct valuation. My personal bias is to follow the cash flow, so in PYPL's case I'm comfortable using their adjusted EPS number.PYPL's 1.4% short interest has been about stable over the past year, so it does not look like the bears are circling the wagon.Despite its underperformance, PYPL's sell side sentiment has actually improved from July 2019 through now. Back in July, 75% of analysts rated it as a ""Buy"", 20% ""Hold"" and 5% ""Sell"". Currently, sell side sentiment improved to 85% ""Buy"", 13% ""Hold"" and 2% ""Sell"".Consensus 2020 EPS is $3.39, up 14% y/y. It is a notable slowdown from the 26-28% growth over the past three years, but growth is expected to pick up in 2021. 2021 consensus EPS of $4.23 implies a 21% growth and this growth rate is expected to continue until at least 2023.Consensus 2020 sales is expected to hit $20.7B, up 17% y/y, which is consistent with the growth rates of previous years (ranging from 15 to 21%). Analyst expect PayPal to grow at this rate through 2023 -- which is remarkably consistent.Looking at 2020, growth for the core ""Transaction"" segment (90% of total revenue) is expected to grow 16.6% y/y, while the ""Other Value Added Service"" segment (10% of total) is expected to grow +20%.Everything looks good so far, but what about the fundamentals?I've identified several idiosyncratic levers that could drive consensus numbers up or down. As a long-term investor, I don't want to spend too much time on short-term ""bull vs. bear"" debates. However, I do think it is important to at least be aware of them, and to anchor them within my long-term mental model. These factors includes:There are two idiosyncratic levers I do want to spend more time on: eBay roll off and partnerships.eBay (EBAY) roll off: EBAY is 9% of PYPL's TPV (total eligible payment volume) but is more profitable than average so I estimate is closer to 18% of earnings (due to PYPL's higher take rate and other factors). Around 28% of this TPV is PYPL's white label checkout service and the rest is branded, and this portion is expected to migrate to Adyen (ADYEN) in mid 2020. In addition, a portion of the branded TPV is expected to be in-housed by EBAY.I'm not interested in attempting to model the 2020 impact of this given that there are so many uncertain variables, but the EBAY roll off does appear to be multi-year headwind through 2023. Importantly, I get nervous anytime a major customer moves to a rapidly rising competitor like Adyen, a company that is expected to grow 38% in 2020. To me, this share loss and emerging competitive threat alone would justify PYPL's eroding valuation relative to the S&P 500.Partnerships. PYPL is trying to fend off intensifying competition by partnering with other tech giants. Prominent partners include MercadoLibre (MELI), Uber (UBER), and Facebook (FB).In April 2019, PYPL agreed to invest $500M in Uber to extend their partnership which ha been in place since 2013. This extension includes PYPL's development of Uber's digital wallet.The Uber announcement came a month after two significant announcements. First, PYPL's $750M investment in MELI and an agreement to more closely integrate the two platforms. In December 2019, PYPL and MELI announced a significant step forward by integrating Paypal with Mercado Pago. Second, PayPal announced that will power Checkout on Instagram.The risk-reward looks balanced to me here so I will stay on the sideline. Although PYPL is cheaper than it was a year ago, the stock's underperformance relative to the market and fintech leaders like V and MA is well justified by the increasingly intensive competitive market and share loss to the likes of Adyen. Although PYPL's partnerships shows a valiant effort to fend off the competitors, 2020 EPS growth is expected to decelerated significantly to +14% before accelerating again to 21% a year in 2021. Given how fast the fintech space is evolving and how aggressive its competitors are, I would not feel comfortable underwriting earning acceleration in the out years."
4308436,22717,2019-11-21T19:50:30-05:00,"Since my last article on PayPal in April 2019, I decided to make changes to simplify my model. I simply project out Gross Payment Volume and make some margin assumptions.I have lowered the expected growth rate in GPV, lowered the take rate assumption, and lowered the valuation multiples expected in five years.Based on this, my conservative estimate is that PayPal stock is worth between $162 and $212 per share in five years. My last article estimated $218 per share.This represents an average annual return of between 9.5% and 15.5% per year for investors in PayPal stock.","I wrote an over-complicated article on PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock on April 30, ""Why PayPal's Stock Will Double In 5 Years."" It was probably too complicated. I wanted to simplify my estimate of the company's value.The result is that I came up with a range of value for PYPL stock that is a bit lower than my previous estimate for the company. I now believe the stock is worth between $162 and $212. My previous article said it was worth $218 per share.I am convinced the best investors in the world like Buffett and others look for easy to understand companies with very profitable models. This can be done with PayPal stock. You should focus on its Gross Payment Volume (""GPV"") growth, PYPL's take rate on the expected GPV, and a reasonable set of valuation parameters.I also updated my model on PayPal stock with its latest financials. Subscribers to my Total Yield Value Guide have access to my spreadsheet model.In my article six months ago, I displayed the historical growth of PayPal's GPV, its take rate and also compared it to other companies in the field. So much for that. I am going to just focus on PayPal's GPV, take rate and FCF margins.For example, as of Q3 2019, PayPal's net revenue is mostly a function of how many transactions it processes and how much it charges (i.e., the take rate).Here is the recent history:Source: Hake estimatesHere is how that looks on a quarterly basis, and with FCF added in:Source: Hake estimatesFrom these two tables, you can see PYPL's growth in GPV has been slowing. I expect it will grow by 20% this year. But the average growth over the past 5 years has been 24%.You can also see that PYPL's average take rate has been declining slowly. This past quarter, it was 2.21%. However, FCF margins on the GPV have been fairly consistent, around 54 basis points.Using these tables, I decided to estimate the next five years.Since GPV has been slowing, I decided to cut it by 15%. So, my estimate is that GPV will grow 85% of the 2019 estimated growth rate of 20.4%. The compounded growth rate results in a multiple of 2.23 times (i.e. 2.23 = (1+(75% x .204)) ^ 5) -1). In other words, this results in a compound annual growth rate of GPV of 17.4%. That simplifies to a multiple of 2.23 times existing GPV in five years.I also reduced the take rate in 5 years. For example, in Q3, it was 2.21%. The expected take rate for 2019 is 2.49%. But since 2016, when it was 3.01%, the take rate has declined 17.5%. So, I decided to use a 17.5% lower take rate (than in 2.49%) in five years, or 2.05%.Here is how these two inputs to the model work out:Source: Hake estimatesNote that this model shows a value of $211.72 per share based on a valuation of 7 times revenue. This is today's PYPL valuation. I don't believe that this is sustainable. For example, if 75% of that ratio is used, or 5.2 x revenue, the model works out to $185.71 per share:Source: Hake estimateBut this as well does not seem realistic. Using 50% of today's revenue metric in 5 years, or 3.5 times revenue, yields a value of $162.04 per share:The reason why the revenue metric should be lowered is because the growth rate is lower than today.This results in a range of values from $162 to 212 per share. The average annual ROI for investors will be between 9.5% and 15.5% per year.Note I did not reduce the shares outstanding even though PayPal has been buying back shares. In fact, over the past nine months, PayPal has repurchased $1.1 billion worth of stock.But this is less than 1% of market value. PYPL has been holding a larger amount of shares in its treasury, likely to be issued to employees. I am not yet convinced that PYPL will continue to actually reduce the shares outstanding.PayPal's growth in GPV has been steady but at lower growth rates. This drives its net revenue along with the effective take rates, which have also been falling. I estimate that, over the next five years, GPV will grow 17.4% on average, and its take rate will be 2.05%. This results in about $31.8 billion in net revenue, or 84% higher than today. I estimate its free cash flow will be 122% higher.Based on these figures, and using lower multiples of revenue and FCF yield, I estimate PayPal stock will be worth between $162 and $212 per share in five years. This results in a range of annual ROI of between 9.5% and 15.5% per year.Hopefully, this is a little simpler than the previous model I used in my last article. Subscribers to my Total Yield Value Guide can have access to my spreadsheet model for PayPal stock."
4310810,92456,2019-12-05T12:55:48-05:00,According to the average estimates the revenue growth rate of PayPal is expected to accelerate.The comparable valuation has shown that PayPal is much cheaper than Visa and Mastercard.The bullish sentiment about PayPal is growing.,"Almost since PayPal's (PYPL) IPO, the company's stock price has been following its long-term exponential trend, which is pretty typical of a big public company:Now the actual price of PayPal's shares is more than two standard deviations below the level of this trend. And I think it's already too much:Throughout the last months, the rolling annual total price return of PayPal's stock has been fluctuating around the lower border of the standard deviation. It's also typical when reaching the bottom:So, technically, now PayPal's stock price looks even slightly undervalued.In the context of investment attractiveness, I like PayPal because the payments market as a whole and the mobile payments market in particular are influenced by the network effect. It means, that each new active PayPal account adds value to PayPal in the eyes of the clients not using the company's services. In other words, the more of your friends use PayPal, the more likely, sooner or later, you also will have a PayPal account. This is confirmed by the fact that the growth rate of PayPal user base tends to accelerate:The number of payment transactions is also growing steadily:In my opinion, the stable growth of the client base is a necessary, fundamental requirement for business development, as well as for the growth of its capitalization.Going further, over the last five years, PayPal's capitalization has been in a qualitative linear relationship with its absolute revenue TTM:As you can see, this relationship identifies PayPal's current capitalization as undervalued. Moreover, according to analysts' average expectations, in Q2 '20 PayPal's revenue TTM will be around $19 billion, and in my model, this means that the company's rational capitalization will come close to $160 billion.The relationship between PayPal's absolute EBITDA TTM and capitalization also indicates an undervalued state of the company:In Q3, PayPal's revenue TTM grew by 13.82% YoY, which was the second lowest result in the entire history of the company. But, according to the average estimates the revenue growth rate is expected to accelerate. This will improve the situation.In the long term, companies often demonstrate a strong direct relationship between return on invested capital (ROIC) and the EV/IC multiple. We can find an example of such a relationship in the case of PayPal. In this case, all other things being equal, PayPal's stock price should increase by 27% so that the balanced state can be achieved.Within the bounds of the described relationships, one can't say that PayPal is overvalued now.The comparable valuation based on the P/S (forward) to growth multiple has shown that PayPal is not expensive at all. And by the way, much cheaper than Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA):But, judging by the P/E (forward) multiple adjusted by the expected EPS annual growth rate, the stock price is now 43% lower than the balanced level:I think PayPal is a typical growth company. And the market is more inclined to evaluate such companies through multiples based on revenue parameters. And therefore, I am more inclined to believe that PayPal is now cheaper than the main blue chips in Nasdaq.PayPal's Bearish Beta (a measure of how a stock price tends to drop when the market is only down) is much less than the Bullish Beta (a measure of how a stock price tends to rise when the market is only on the rise):This means that the bullish sentiment about PayPal is growing.Speaking globally, it is very likely that the digital payments market is only at the beginning of its growth due to the inertia of human habits. And therefore PayPal's accelerated development phase is definitely not over.Also, I think that the recent correction wave was useful for PayPal because the company's multiples became attractive again.So, I think that PayPal is now very close to the bottom."
4308371,105459,2019-11-21T15:00:00-05:00,"PYPL's acquisition of Honey suggests that the wallet battle is intensifying and reward/discount program is necessary to retain engagement.Honey's integration with PYPL (via app, PC) remains unclear.Cash rewards or points may be better tools to retain engagement than product discounts.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ Short Ideas subscribers - find out more here.PayPal (PYPL) announced that it is acquiring Honey Science, an online rewards company that keeps users informed of discounts in partner merchants and automatically applies coupons for the users at checkout, for $4b in cash. PYPL expects this acquisition to be non-GAAP EPS accretive to FY2021 earnings and the transaction to be closed in 1Q20 complete to regulatory approval.PYPL’s acquisition of Honey underscores two key trends shaping up in the US payment space.First, the wallet battle is intensifying due to the growth of Apple Pay (AAPL), Google Pay (GOOGL) (see: PayPal: It Only Gets Tougher) and the recently introduced Facebook Pay (FB) (see: Facebook Pay: Late In The Game). The wallet has limited differentiation without merchant and consumer penetration. PYPL has been a leader in both segments but such leadership is dwindling as it faces AAPL that could easily scale Apple Pay and Apple Card penetration within its large iPhone install base and FB that could potentially scale simply by its large active user base. Adding on Honey could allow PYPL to gain incremental merchant and user penetration while that PYPL may not already have.Second, the reward system is becoming a key selling point to drive user engagement for the digital wallet providers similar to how credit card issuers look to drive adoption. Honey’s expertise in digital coupons could increase the stickiness of the PYPL app as PYPL users look for or to be notified of deals across Honey’s merchant partners. Although this sounds plausible in theory, we caution that PYPL and Honey need to scale their merchant partners significantly to drive engagement.Honey is best known for its browser extension that aggregates and applies online coupons for consumers across its partner sites. The company was founded in 2012 and currently works with 30,000 online retailers and 17m monthly active users.Revenue is generated from a commission rate based on the user’s transaction on the partner site. At the end of 2018, Honey generated $100m in revenue, implying that the acquisition price is based on 40x 2018 sales. Assuming Honey doubles its revenue in 2019, we are still looking at 20x sales which is quite aggressive in our view.Honey’s web and mobile applications find and apply savings across its 30k merchants and offer price tracking tools to maintain consumer engagement. The company also has a mobile app that allows consumers to browse, discover and purchase from a variety of retailers through a unified checkout experience. Some of the key merchants that Honey partners with include AliExpress, Walmart, Macy’s and Etsy.Source: PYPLWallet battle is intensifying The digital wallet battle is intensifying in the US with the gradual acceptance of Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and PYPL in both online and offline merchants. According to eMarketer, the number of proximity mobile payment users in the US is expected to reach 67m by 2020 and 75m by 2022.In addition to the internet incumbents, the brand-specific wallet has also gained solid traction most notably with the Starbucks app, which partially responsible for nurturing a cashless society in the US.Digital wallet has its strategic value as a traffic enabler in which it is the first fintech interaction point with the user to increase user loyalty and stickiness. Once the user is accustomed to using a particular mobile wallet, the wallet provider can subsequently cross-sell other higher-margin products such as consumer lending, wealth management, and even insurance. However, getting the first step (ie. Leveraging wallet to draw and retain traffic) is extremely difficult as the proliferation of digital wallets is also gradually resulted in little differentiation of between the wallets in that almost all wallets allow users to conduct credit card payments or pay with their wallet balance. In order to differentiate, a superior reward program is a key selling point and a driving force behind consumer adoption.A reward system is becoming increasingly important for both the consumers and the merchants to drive engagement.On the consumer side, Honey allows PYPL to improve its value proposition by adding product discovery, price tracking, and discounts to its overall experience. The higher engagement could also result in an increase in sales and better conversion.On the merchant side, PYPL could allow merchants to reach their customers beyond the checkout point by offering price and product discovery to draw the consumers onto the merchants’ platform.Source: PYPLAlthough this sounds logical in theory, we are surprised by the lack of details on how Honey can be integrated into PYPL. We also question the competitive moat behind a digital wallet that offers online coupons given that historically the attractions behind any digital wallet or credit card are the points rewards or cashback that are the key selling points.Notably, Apple Card is integrated with Apple Pay and offers 3% cashback on major merchants such as Uber, Walgreens, and T-Mobile. Starbucks offer two stars for every dollar spent that can be redeemed for free food and beverage.Although there are still uncertainties around PYPL-Honey integration, what is certain is the competitive dynamic is forcing PYPL to become aggressive in M&A to retain merchants and users as AAPL and GOOGL expand their consumption settings.We remain bearish on PYPL (see: PayPal: Curb Your Enthusiasm) as we believe that the 2020 outlook is more important and it is becoming increasingly bleak given the eBay (EBAY) separation, looming Brexit, unclear monetization potential behind Venmo and the larger risk associated with PYPL’s position as a wallet player given the growing competitive risk from Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL). We reiterate our bearish view on the stock and our $85 target. We believe that the long-term risks are difficult to ignore despite the positive outcomes in the near-term."
4321425,22148,2020-02-04T20:28:39-05:00,"PayPal trades near all-time highs at $120.The payments company guided below 2020 consensus EPS estimates with a forecast of only $3.43.The stock trades in a wide multiple range, suggesting investors look to buy the next dip toward 25x forward EPS estimates.","Over the years, PayPal Holdings (PYPL) has offered some attractive entry points such as my bullish call in October 2018. The stock was clearly a better deal recently around $100, while the payments processor approaches new all-time highs despite disappointing 2020 guidance. The stock is a better purchase on dips, but existing shareholders should continue holding shares.Source: PayPal website Despite a lot of moving parts, PayPal continues to grow revenues in the 15% to 20% annual range with a boost to EPS from leverage and share buybacks. Due to competitive threats in the payments sector and lumpy earnings due to acquisitions, divestitures and an eBay (EBAY) impact, the stock is probably a lot more volatile than one would expect with their consistent core growth.On a quarterly basis, the company consistently beats EPS estimates. In Q4, PayPal reported 25% EPS growth earning $0.86 per share. Revenues grew over 17% to nearly $5 billion.The business value is greatly boosted by the growing engagement of existing customers along with new active accounts. On an annual basis, PayPal continues to obtain 10% growth from higher customer engagement. In essence, the business would grow at a nearly 10% rate annually just by the existing customers finding new and additional ways to transact on PayPal. The average active account now uses the service for over 40 transactions in the last year or the equivalent of just over three transactions per month.Source: PayPal Q4 investor updateThe transaction growth is so impressive PayPal almost doesn't need to add new customers. Regardless, the stock story is buoyed by the payments company adding over 9 million active accounts consistently on a quarterly basis. The active account total ended Q4 up 14% to 305 million.The larger transactions per customer help increase operating margins. PayPal doesn't have to spend aggressively to acquire customers when new active accounts only account for half of the annual growth rate.Consistent with most payment companies, PayPal is driving substantial leverage in the system with operating margins up 200 basis points over last Q4 to 23.6%. For the quarter, sales and marketing expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were virtually flat YoY at only $368 million.Source: PayPal Q4 investor updateMost of the other expense categories saw costs grow at a lower rate than revenue growth. As the company noted, non-transactional expenses were only 13% of every dollar of additional revenues.The issue with the stock is always when to buy, considering the sometimes volatile trading due to the high P/E multiple. At $120, PayPal trades at over 35x guidance for 2020 EPS of $3.40.Over the last year, the stock has generally traded at over 30x forward one year estimates, which are now 2021 EPS of $4.18. The 2021 numbers are still far away for PayPal to trade at much higher P/E multiples.Data by YChartsThe stock may not seem extremely expensive here, but one has to consider that a 15% rally to nearly $140 would push the forward one year P/E multiple to nearly 34x. The value proposition just doesn't exist here.The key investor takeaway is that PayPal makes for a good long-term hold. The stock was a strong buy on the 2018 dip to $85 and the recent dips to $100, but investors should either hold existing shares or wait for the next dip. After this rally to $120, PayPal isn't a good investment for new money."
4308985,102646,2019-11-25T11:40:59-05:00,"The payment industry is getting to a saturation point.
        PayPal's main assets are facing increased competition from the likes of Stripe and Square.
        PayPal's biggest acquisition is expensive and will not help make it better.","I invested in PayPal (PYPL) in 2017 and exited my investment in October last year and swapped it with Mastercard (MA). I also have a small stake in Visa (VISA), as I wrote in a previous article. I exited the company because I started worrying about its growth prospects as the payment industry approaches a saturation point. So many companies like Square (SQ), Apple (AAPL), Transferwise, Alibaba (BABA), and banks (Zelle) have entered the industry.PayPal is a great company with an exciting model. The company operates a number of leading fintech brands that have a significant market share in the United States and around the world. The company owns Braintree, which it acquired in 2013. Today, Braintree helps provide payment services to some of the leading brands in the world, like Uber (UBER), and DropBox (DBX).It also owns Venmo, which is a beloved payment platform with more than 40 million users. It also owns Xoom, a company that makes transborder transfers easy and cheap. Other companies that PayPal owns are iZettle, Paydiant, and HyperWallet.All these companies have helped PayPal become one of the biggest payment companies in the world, with a market value of more than $122 billion. The company made more than $15 billion last year and is expected to make $17.7 billion this year and $20 billion and $24 billion in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In the most recent quarter, the company said that it had more than 295 million active users. This was 9.5 million more than what it had in the previous quarter. It expects to end the year with more than 304 million users.PayPal is also not overvalued. At the current valuation, investors are paying 5.8x next year’s sales, which is lower than that of Mastercard and Visa. They are also paying 29x next year’s earnings, which is lower than Mastercard’s 31 but slightly higher than Visa’s 25. This is a good valuation for a profitable, fast-growing company that is actively buying back its stock. The company also has a good market share in the payment industry, as explained above.While PayPal is a good company, with a substantial market share, the reality is that it is also going through a challenging period. The company faces competitive pressure in all industries that it competes with. On Venmo, Square’s Cash App has continued to take market share. On Braintree, companies like Stripe and Square are taking share. Also, companies like TransferWise and WorldRemit are competing with Xoom and PayPal. A quick Google Trends comparison shows that new companies like Cash App and Transferwise are outdoing PayPal’s assets.Yesterday, we received news that PayPal was acquiring Honey Science Corporation for $4 billion. The company will use part of its $5 billion cash hoard and stock. This will be PayPal’s biggest acquisition ever. To starters, Honey offers extensions that help users find the best deals when they shop online. It does this by finding coupons and scouring its partners’ websites for the best offers. The company has about 17 million MAUs. This means that PayPal paid about $235 per active user. In the statement, PayPal’s CEO said:Honey was always an under-the-radar company that many people in the tech community have never heard of. According to Crunchbase, the company had raised more than $31 million from investors. While its financials are not public, the company is said to be profitable. This is uncommon among many VC funded companies.Honey seems like a good company that helps solve real problems, as evidenced by its 17 million users. The company has achieved this growth with minimal advertisement. As a result of the acquisition, I expect PayPal to invest more money in making the brand a household name. However, I was not pleased with this acquisition.First, I believe that $4 billion is a lot of money for a company like Honey. As mentioned, it is almost impossible to calculate the company’s real valuation because we don’t have its numbers. According to WSJ, the company expects to make between $250 million and $300 million this year. It is possible that the company’s margins are extremely narrow because of its business model. Also, the WSJ wrote that the company was valued at about $700 million in its latest funding last year. Therefore, it is impossible to comprehend what happened since that acquisition to value the company at $4 billion.Second, the coupon industry is greatly competitive because of the low barriers to entry in the business. A quick look at similar extensions in Google Chrome shows many similar applications. Obviously, Honey is well-positioned because of its new hoard of money. In addition, I don’t see how Honey’s acquisition will help improve PayPal’s GMV. In the announcement, the company said that it would incorporate Honey with its other products like Venmo and PayPal.Source: GoogleThird, Honey will continue operating independently, and its founders will continue heading the company. The question is whether these founders will continue running the company with the zeal they had before the acquisition. Previously, these founders managed the company with zeal and dedication because they hoped for an exit someday. This could have been through an IPO or acquisition. This dedication will likely wane as they move to start other ventures with the current windfall. We have seen this happen in the past. We saw this when Instagram founders left Facebook. Jan Koum, the Whatsapp founder, also left Facebook after disagreements on its future. At PayPal, Bill Ready, who was the Chief Executive of Braintree announced that he would leave this year.Finally, there is the issue of data, which is one reason I believe PayPal made the purchase. As we head to the next year’s election, there is general distaste of how big companies use data. As a payment company, PayPal has been a bit immune mostly because it does not offer any advertisements. Honey is different and could bring some data concerns to PayPal. The company collects and shares data with its business partners as outlined in this privacy policy. This could lead to significant issues in future for PayPal.PayPal is a good company that is valued reasonably. However, I believe that the company’s management expects growth to slow as the payment industry reaches saturation point. This is probably why the CEO, Dan Schulman, has committed to continue with the acquisition binge. I also believe that the Honey acquisition will not add significant value to PayPal. This does not mean that investors should short PayPal. While I won’t be buying its stock any time soon, I recommend that you wait for its stock to drop further before you invest."
4311709,71685,2019-12-10T15:52:05-05:00,The stock has had a horrible second half of 2019.Bullish betting and an improving technical chart suggest shares may rise.The stock is trading at an historical low one-year forward P/E ratio.,"PayPal (PYPL) hasn't had the best second half of 2019, with shares falling by nearly 15% since their peak in late July. However, that may be about to change, and the stock may be getting ready for a year-end rally that may spill into the start of 2020, based on some options betting and improving technical chart.The stock's valuation may also support the shares rising in the future. Currently, the shares trade for roughly 25 times 2021 earnings estimates. It places the one-year forward P/E ratio at the lower end of its historical range and gives the stock plenty of room to see multiple expansion in 2020.There have been some bullish options betting in PayPal since December 3. The January 17 $110 call options have seen their open interest levels rise by almost 9,000 contracts to around 29,000 total contracts. Additionally, the January 17 $115 calls have seen their open interest rise by 8,000 contracts to approximately 30,000 open contracts.The data from Trade Alert shows the $110 call volume was traded on the ASK for a price of roughly $1.40 on December 6. It would mean that for the buyer of these calls to earn a profit; the stock would need to rise to around $111.40 by the expiration to breakeven. That is an increase of about 7.2% from the shares' current price on December 10.Additionally, the data shows that the January $115 calls also showed volume trading on the ASK. These calls traded for around $0.80 per contract at the time. Adding the cost per contract, plus the strike price means a buyer of the calls needs the stock to rise to $115.80 to break even. That is a gain of 11.4% over the next few weeks.The technical chart also points to a stock that is changing the direction of its trend. The relative strength index has risen above a downtrend that started in May. Now the trend has turned steadily higher, suggesting that bullish momentum is entering PayPal's stock.Also, the chart shows that the price has been trending higher, too, since bottoming in October. Another bullish indication is that the stock is breaking free of a downtrend, which started in late July. Should the stock rise above resistance at $106.25, it could go on to climb back to $109.50, a gain of more than 5%.Another thing PayPal has going for it is valuation. Consensus analysts estimate forecast earnings growth of nearly 21% in 2021 to $4.22 per share. It leaves the stock trading for just 24.6 times its 2021 earnings estimates. It makes the shares cheap when adjusting for growth.Historically, since the beginning of 2016, the stock has traded in a range of 18 to 35 times one-year forward earnings estimates. However, since 2018, the stock has only traded below 25 times one-year forward earnings once, in January of 2019. It would suggest that the stock is undervalued on a historical basis, and should the stock return to the middle of the range around 29, the stock would trade for roughly $123.There are risks because the technical chart does suggest if the stock falls below the uptrend and dips below $101, shares could fall to $94.60. Additionally, it isn't possible to know for sure if the option buying was done as a bet that stocks will rise, or if it was done as a hedge against an investor's short position.PayPal stock has suffered since the end of July, but there may finally be a light at the end of the tunnel. Perhaps, 2020 will start on a stronger note of how 2019 is finishing."
4299591,103480,2019-10-28T13:00:00-04:00,"Shares of PayPal have rebounded ~7% since reporting Q3 results, putting the company on track to reverse a losing trend since cutting its guidance outlook in Q2.PayPal upped and narrowed its guidance range for FY19 this quarter, though not quite fully restoring the company's pre-Q2 guidance levels.TPV growth saw an acceleration to 27% y/y, while net new account additions reached a record in Q3 and customer engagement also ticked higher.PayPal also recently got a license to operate in China, making it the first foreign payments company to compete in the world's largest market.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.The tide is turning for PayPal (PYPL), the P2P payments giant that has been stuck in a rut since lowering its revenue outlook last quarter. After a strong third-quarter print that beat Wall Street's top and bottom line estimates, as well as guiding above consensus for the remainder of 2019, shares of PayPal rocketed up more than 7%:Data by YChartsThis considered, PayPal is still down more than 10% relative to all-time highs notched in June. The question for investors now is: does PayPal's rally still have steam left? In my view, PayPal's recovery is still in the early stages, and the company's third-quarter print included a lot of bullish updates that make me confident in the company's growth. Investors would be wise to remain long here. Let's review the bullish case for this stock with the company's latest data:Every company has that one unique business metric that investors should be watching above all others. For Netflix (NFLX) it's the number of subscribers that investors obsess over; for social media companies like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR), it's MAUs and DAUs that are key to revenue growth.For PayPal, this key metric is total payment volumes, or TPV - measuring the dollar value of all the transactions conducted on PayPal's platform. You'll recall that one of the reasons PayPal lowered its guidance outlook last quarter was due to slower-than-expected implementation of several key partnerships with MercadoLibre and Uber (UBER), which drove a slowdown in both TPV and revenues. This headwind clearly isn't weighing on the rest of PayPal's results in Q3, as TPV saw its strongest growth in six quarters - accelerating one point to 27% y/y growth on a constant-currency basis in Q3, and hitting an impressive nominal value of $179 billion. Figure 1. PayPal TPV trendsSource: PayPal Q3 earnings deckPayPal's TPV growth powered 19% y/y revenue growth to $4.38 billion, beating Wall Street's consensus estimate of $4.35 billion (+18% y/y) by one point. Underneath PayPal's headline TPV metrics, we also note strong underlying user trends. Most notably, the company reported 9.8 million new active accounts added in Q3, a record achievement for the third quarter. This brings PayPal's total count of active accounts to 295 million, up 16% y/y. Alongside a bigger base of users, PayPal also noted that the average frequency of transactions per active account is also up 9% y/y, indicating strong engagement trends: Figure 2. PayPal user trendsSource: PayPal Q3 earnings deckOf course, a big driver of PayPal's user growth is Venmo, its highly popular mobile P2P payments app that has become one of millennials' most frequently used applications. Venmo accounted for just over 15% of PayPal's TPV in Q3, and is on track to deliver $400 million of annualized revenue going forward: Figure 3. Venmo growth metricsSource: PayPal Q3 earnings deckAside from being just a consumer-facing P2P app, PayPal has also driven growth via wider acceptance of Venmo among merchants - Uber (UBER), for example, takes Venmo as a payment method, and several grocery stores like Trader Joes periodically offer cash-back incentives for using Venmo in stores. Venmo has frequently been criticized as a driver of TPV growth, but with minimal associated revenues. Over time, this trend is improving - as PayPal brought the percentage of monetizable Venmo users to 35% this quarter, up sharply from just 24% in the year-ago quarter.Along with strong TPV growth and improving user trends, PayPal has also committed to delivering operating leverage. This quarter, PayPal delivered an impressive 200bps of operating margin improvement, with pro forma expenses falling to 76.6% as a percentage of revenues, down from 78.6% in the year-ago quarter. The company noted that in the third quarter, non-transaction related expenses grew only four cents for every incremental dollar of revenue:Figure 4. PayPal expense trendsSource: PayPal Q3 earnings deckPro forma operating income also grew 30% y/y to $1.03 billion, while pro forma EPS, excluding the earnings impact of acquired subsidiaries, grew 31% y/y to $0.76:Figure 5. PayPal operating incomeSource: PayPal Q3 earnings releaseLastly, as we look ahead of PayPal's future, we note that the company recently received approval to operate in China (granted in September), and will be the first foreign payments company to be given this permission, needless to say, a major win for PayPal. As shown in the slide below, the company is achieving this through a 70% stake in local company Guofubao, also known as GoPay:Figure 6. PayPal China announcementSource: PayPal Q3 earnings deckEntry into China is especially critical given how common e-payments are in China relative to the U.S. I've frequently noted that one of PayPal's biggest growth opportunities domestically is the gradual conversion of digital vs. physical (cash and credit card) payments, driven by added ""smart terminals"" that accept mobile phone scans at point of sale. China is already leagues ahead of the U.S. in this regard, with services like AliPay dominating over traditional credit cards.With PayPal's entry into China, the company is gaining a huge market that is already accustomed to P2P payments as the default mode for transactions. PayPal's opportunity to scale in China is massive, and CEO Dan Schulman remarked as follows on the Q3 earnings call:There's a lot to like about PayPal coming out of the third quarter. The company's TPV growth rate has accelerated for the second quarter in a row, Venmo monetization is up and user counts are exploding, and as an added bonus, the company is rolling out ambitious plans to expand into China, becoming the first foreign payments company to do so. I like the fact that PayPal is trading more than 10% below all-time highs, despite the bullish momentum on its side. Stay long here and look for an entry point in this name."
4301594,102764,2019-11-01T15:35:28-04:00,PayPal is producing rapid revenue growth and expanding profit margins.User growth and engagement levels keep moving in the right direction.The company has consistently surpassed expectations for 16 quarters in a row.The stock is reasonably valued for such a strong growth business.,"PayPal (PYPL) stock has been quite volatile in the past year. The company is up by more than 25% year to date, but it has also declined by almost 15% from its highs. From that perspective, we could say that PayPal stock is in a long-term uptrend and not too overbought in the short term.Data by YChartsLooking at the fundamentals, the company keeps growing at full speed as of the most recent quarters, it continues thriving operationally, and valuation is not excessively high for such a high-quality business.PayPal had announced fairly conservative guidance numbers in the second quarter, for this reason, investors have been cautious about the stock leading to the third quarter results. But the company dissipated those concerns with remarkably strong numbers across the board. Both sales and earnings for the third quarter outperformed expectations, and forward-looking guidance was also quite solid.Revenue came in at $4.38 billion during the period, an increase of 19% versus the same quarter in the prior year. For the first time ever, PayPal processed over 1 billion transactions per month in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year to 3.1 billion transactions. Total payment volume (TPV) growth accelerated 80 basis points from last quarter and was up 27% on an FX-neutral basis, to $179 billion.Source: PayPalThe company added 9.8 million net new active accounts during the quarter, bringing total active accounts to 295 million. PayPal processed 9.8 payment transactions per active account on a trailing twelve months basis, up 9% and showing that engagement levels keep moving in the right direction.Source: PayPalVenmo keeps growing at full speed. The company processed more than $27 billion in volume for the quarter, growing by 64% year over year. That's almost $300 million in payments per day and an annual run rate that now exceeds $100 billion for Venmo.PayPal delivered more than 200 basis points of operating margin expansion on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the third quarter grew 30% and it exceeded $1 billion for the first time.All in all, PayPal is delivering rapid revenue growth, gaining new users and increasing engagement levels across those users. Revenues are outgrowing expenses, so profit margins are expanding. Both in terms of operational and financial performance, the numbers look pretty good.PayPal stock is not particularly cheap, but it is not overvalued either when considering the company's growth potential. Successful players in the payment industry generally trade at above-average valuations because of the remarkably attractive opportunities offered by the payments revolution.In that context, PayPal stock is reasonably priced in comparison to other companies in the sector. The table below compares forward price to earnings, price to sales, and price to free cash flow for PayPal versus Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), and Square (SQ).Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialIt is important to keep in mind that valuation is always dynamic as opposed to static. Ratios like forward price to earnings are calculated on the basis of earnings expectations in the year ahead. If the company can consistently deliver numbers above expectations and those expectations tend to increase over time, then the stock price needs to rise too in order for the valuation to remain stable.PayPal has an impressive track record in that area, the company has delivered earnings above Wall Street estimates over the past 16 quarters in a row. The chart below shows the consensus earnings estimates and the actual reported numbers for the company over those periods.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialThe chart shows how earnings estimates for PayPal in both the current fiscal year and next fiscal year have consistently increased over time. This can be a powerful tailwind for the stock as long as earnings estimates keep moving in the right direction.Data by YChartsValuation needs to be analyzed in the context of other return drivers. A company producing strong growth rates and consistently delivering earnings above expectations deserves a higher valuation than a business producing mediocre financial performance and underperforming expectations.PayPal is very reasonably priced in comparison to other stocks in the sector, and the company is remarkably solid in terms of both financial performance and its track record of consistently outperforming expectations. With this in mind, current valuation can be considered attractive for such a high-quality business.The company operates in a very dynamic industry, and it faces competition from big and powerful players coming from both the financial services and technology industries. In addition to this, all kinds of smaller companies in the fintech space are trying to gain ground in the market.PayPal is making the right moves by building alliances with several of the top players in the sector, and the company has solid competitive strengths powered by the value of its network. That said, competitive risk is always a factor to keep in mind for a business operating in a high growth market prone to technological disruption.Now that PayPal is expanding into China, it's worth noting that the government in China tends to benefit local players such as Alipay and WeChat, and regulatory risk all over the world can have a considerable impact on a company operating in such a sensitive industry and dealing with valuable information.Those risks notwithstanding, PayPal is a high growth business consistently outperforming expectations and trading at valuation levels that are not unreasonable at all for such a high-quality stock. As long as management continues leading the company in the right direction, PayPal stock looks well-positioned for attractive returns going forward.PayPal is a position in both my own portfolio and The Data Driven Portfolio since I replicate such a portfolio with my personal money. The stock was purchased at $68.5 per share in July of 2017 and we now have a big gain of more than 78% on the name.In spite of such a strong appreciation, I think it still makes sense to hold on to PayPal's stock over the long term since the company has enormous potential for growth and valuation is not excessive at all. For those who don't have a position in PayPal, it makes sense to start building one, and any pullback down the road could be considered an opportunity to buy more as long as the fundamentals remain intact."
4298591,105459,2019-10-24T10:55:22-04:00,"PYPL's Q3 give investors to be bullish but we remain bearish on the 2020 outlook; reiterate our $85 target price.
        Operating metrics appears to be fine but signs of deceleration was evident in user growth and value per transaction.
        China is unlikely to be accretive to PYPL given the increasing competition.","PayPal’s (PYPL) better than expected Q3 numbers and higher than expected 2019 guidance give investors a reason to cheer, sending the stock up 8% following the print. We believe that the price appreciation gives investors a chance to take profit as we believe that the 2020 outlook is more important and it is becoming increasingly bleak given the eBay (EBAY) separation, looming Brexit, unclear monetization potential behind Venmo and the larger risk associated with PYPL’s position as a wallet player given the growing competitive risk from Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL). We reiterate our bearish view on the stock and our $85 target. We believe that the long-term risks are difficult to ignore despite the positive outcomes in the near-term. (see: PayPal: It Only Gets Tougher). As expected, TPV growth and engagement metrics all delivered within expectations. Additionally, margin improved incrementally due to operating leverage. However, consolidated take-rate continues to trend lower. Although Venmo generated some revenue (~$100m/quarter run-rate), we believe that it remains a show-me story and do not expect material monetization given the surplus of comparable products on the market that charges less or no fees compared to Venmo.Finally, management remains optimistic at the prospect in China following the acquisition of GoPay and expects an incremental ramp up on cross-border business. We remain skeptical as PYPL is unlikely to differentiate compared with other global players such as Payoneer which recently begin to apply for a payment license in China and the local competition such as Lian Lian and Ping Pong.Consolidated numbers look fine for nowRevenue of $4.38bn and non-GAAP EPS of $0.61 was ahead of the consensus expectation of $4.35bn and $0.61bn, respectively.Although the consolidated TPV growth of 25% (FX-neutral 27%) remains largely solid, the consolidated take-rate continues to decline due to the higher TPV contribution from Venmo.Management indicated that Venmo has a quarterly annual run-rate of $100m and suggested that monetization potential is clearly there. We will remain skeptical as Venmo is largely a show-me story. Worth reminding investors that alternative P2P transfer services charge no fee and as long as these services are fee-less, we do not expect material monetization for Venmo and as such it will remain a drag to the overall take-rate profile in the foreseeable future. Under the best-case scenario, we expect Venmo to largely break-even so investors can expect Venmo to not be a profit drag to PYPL.Engagement metrics appear to be fine for now. PYPL defines engagement as the transaction per active user. We cannot against this metric as it seems quite reasonable but what troubles us is that TPV per transaction, as calculated by TPV per account divide transaction per account, seems to continue its gradual decline.We suspect the PYPL’s declining ticket size could be due to its losing market share to the emerging competitors such as Apple Pay and Google Pay. Although this is certainly a bit early to make that conclusion, we think it is nonetheless an important metric to keep an eye on.Tempering the expectation of ChinaManagement appears to be very bullish on China. As the first western payment company to obtain a payment license in China, we applaud PYPL on this accomplishment but we want to remind investors that this is not a result of PYPL’s execution but rather work of the Chinese central bank on the gradual opening of its financial market.Given that PYPL is focusing on cross-border payment, we expect this field will become increasingly crowded as the Chinese regulators open up this market. We note that Payoneer, perhaps one of the biggest competitors to PayPal, is also applying for a payment license via its majority owned Shenzhen Anfu Tech. The certification process for Payoneer has largely completed and we think this paves the way for Payoneer to eventually obtain its license for online payment and debit transactions.Worth pointing out that Payoneer’s entry into China is different from that of PYPL in that it is applying for a brand-new license whereas PYPL acquired a local entity. We expect Payoneer to receive the official license by the time PYPL closes the GoPay acquisition in Q4 as the Chinese regulators is largely supportive of Payoneer’s entry into China which helps to clean up the under-regulated cross-border payment space.That said, PYPL’s cross-border payment in China will certainly face some competition from Payoneer but also from local rivals such as Lian Lian that is based in Hangzhou. As for PYPL’s potential in China’s domestic payment market, we do not expect PYPL to disrupt the current duopoly of Tencent and Ant Financial."

It's PayPal's biggest acquisition so far.It's also the first acquisition for PayPal outside of its core payment market.We look at what Honey is and does.Is Honey worth the money?,"On Wednesday, November 20, after the market closed, PayPal (PYPL) announced that it will buy Honey for $4B. Although the company has done quite a few acquisitions before, this is PayPal's biggest acquisition up to now and the first one that is actually outside of its core payment market. The market sold PayPal a bit after the announcement but not that much:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Let's look at what PayPal has bought and what to think of this big acquisition (compared to previous ones, that is).(Source)What has PayPal actually bought? Honey originally was a desktop browser extension that can be downloaded for free. It works on all common browsers: Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox and Opera. The purpose of the extension is to help the customer save money by searching for coupon codes, mostly around 1% to 5%, sometimes up to 20%, depending on the product and the store. On Amazon, Honey helps you to find a cheaper seller and that makes Honey different from the many coupon sites.Honey launched a mobile app as well this year, for iOS in February 2019, for Android in September 2019, just a few months ago. It's called the Honey Smart Shopping Assistant and it is a bit different from the extension. Here you go into the app to shop, whereas the extension follows you everywhere you shop. The interesting thing about Honey is that it automates a process. You don't have to manually search for the cheapest seller or Google for a coupon. That doesn't just save you time but also money.There is also Honey Gold. Whenever you buy something online, you get points. If you have enough of these Honey Gold points, you can exchange them for a gift card.Another part of Honey is Honey Droplist. If you save a certain item that you want to that list, you will automatically be alerted if that item drops in price.The last part of the business is Honey Travel, which works with travel discount sites and tries to find deals there too, but this time for hotels and flights. And it works. According to the LA Times, Honey users saved about $32 or $384 per month. That can buy you three shares of PayPal and you can still order pizza for the whole family. That's pretty good for doing nothing special as a customer. But from the merchant's side it makes sense too. Again from the LA Times:Besides that, Honey's reputation around privacy and the security of data is quite good. If this was not the case, I don't think PayPal would have made the acquisition. The problems Facebook (FB) has experienced since the privacy issues started are a warning to any company, I think.This is what PayPal's press release said about Honey:(Source: PayPal's acquisition presentation)Honey was profitable on a net income basis in 2018. The company gets money from commissions online shops pay to get exposure to the higher closing rate.Even though it was only spun off from eBay (EBAY) in 2015, PayPal has already a history of great acquisitions. It bought Braintree for $800M. That sounds a lot, but the estimates are that Braintree has a yearly revenue of around $17B. Not bad, but then you also have to know that Braintree had acquired a company called Venmo before for just $40M, so PayPal got Venmo too, as a sort of bonus to Braintree. Look at what it has done with it, and this is just the start.PayPal lists the advantages for both parties in its acquisition presentationPayPal sees Honey as a means to diversify from just checkout to reaching shoppers at the beginning of the experience. I think we all know that data is the new gold and Honey has a huge data pool that PayPal can use to target its customers better.TechCrunch cited John Kuntze:There is quite a lot of criticism already about the fact that Honey is PayPal's most expensive acquisition at $4B. After all, Honey has revenue of just $100M although it grew by 100%.That means that if the company can keep up these numbers, the acquisition might look cheap in a few years' time, and probably Honey will be able to pull the trick. After all, PayPal has a huge network of users spread all over its platforms, but especially PayPal itself and Venmo. After all, there are 275 million active consumer accounts. But for Honey, the other side will be very interesting too: PayPal's network of 24 million merchants can be leveraged to strike more deals and more revenue for Honey.I think most people will definitely see the new market that PayPal is exploring with this acquisition. This could be the big breakthrough of digital couponing and price tracking for the big public.But most comments after the news broke were about the price that PayPal paid. $4B for a company with 17M users and $100M in sales. That is buying at a P/S of 40, not cheap by any measure. Or, seen from a different perspective, it's $235 per user.I'm pretty sure, though, that the acquisition alone will boost Honey's number of users. When you hear what the company does, you get interested and download the extension to try it out. I did when I heard the news. I think this acquisition makes a lot of sense for PayPal. This is how PayPal visualizes it:(Source: PayPal's acquisition presentation)Although at first sight, the price may seem steep, I think that over time, Honey could become a very valuable part of PayPal's business. PayPal spreads its range for both the customers and the merchants, which are both important in its ecosystem.The Honey acquisition by PayPal makes a lot of sense. PayPal has made excellent acquisitions in the past and I think that this will prove to be one as well. After all, if Honey is promoted on PayPal's platforms, it will extend its reach multiple times over and it could become the big breakthrough for digital couponing and automatic price comparisons. The advantage for consumers (saving money) and merchants (getting a higher closing rate) is obvious. For PayPal, the advantage is that its customers can use the extension and the app to shop around and then pay with PayPal's technology. PayPal goes to the consumer at the beginning, when the shopping fun starts, and not just at the end, when it offers its easy payment.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!P.S.

4298841,105096,2019-10-25T10:15:07-04:00,"We published our Neutral recommendation on PayPal in May, and shares had fallen 13% by 23rd October, before 19Q3 results were released.19Q3 results were impressive by any measure, with approx. 30% year-on-year growth in both non-GAAP EBIT and EPS.Other positive developments include a significant margin uplift during Q3 and a low estimated impact on the pending end of the eBay contract.However, PayPal continues to have largeshare-based compensation costs and only returns a limited percentage of Free Cash Flow to shareholders.After its near-10% rebound, at $105.85, PayPal’svaluation is too expensive again. We reiterate our Neutral rating and prefer Mastercard.","We published our Neutral recommendation on PayPal (PYPL) (""PayPal: Much More Expensive Than You Think"") in late May, after which shares fell 13.3% by 23rd October. However, with the release of 19Q3 results after market close, shares rebounded strongly, and were up 9.5% as of 10 a.m. in New York the following day. Even with the rebound, PayPal shares were still 5% lower than at the time of our initial recommendation, significantly underperforming Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) (both Buy-rated) and the S&P 500 index:After reviewing PayPal's 19Q3 results, we have concluded that shares are still too expensive, as we will explain below.Our Neutral view in May recognised PayPal’s strong growth and integral role in the payments ecosystem, but rejected it for valuation reasons:Based on these, we concluded that PayPal's valuation at that time (46.1x P/E on non-GAAP EPS, 65.3x on GAAP EPS, 1.7% FCF Yield) was too expensive, even with management's medium-term outlook for a 20% EPS CAGR.We now review PayPal's 19Q3 results to see if these negatives remain valid.For 19Q3, PayPal delivered an approx. 30% year-on-year growth in both non-GAAP EBIT and EPS, which was impressive by any measure:PayPay's Total Payment Volume grew 24.9% year-on-year, net revenues grew 18.9%, but total operating expenses only grew 15.3%, giving a 207 bps uplift in non-GAAP EBIT margin.Year-to-date revenue growth was negatively impacted by the sale of the U.S. consumer card portfolio in July 2018, with an estimated 3.5% impact on full-year revenue growth. On the other hand, revenue growth was helped by acquisitions (including iZettle and Hyperwallet), with an estimated 1.5% benefit to full-year growth.Expenses grew more slowly than revenues during 19Q3, due to a combination of Customer Support & Operations and General & Administrative expenses growing more slowly than revenues, and Sales & Marketing expenses falling in absolute terms. Lower non-transaction operating expenses, along with improved Transaction & Loan Losses, drove margin uplift (as transaction expense rate remained flat), as shown below:A large gap gas continued to exist between GAAP & non-GAAP figures, with non-GAAP EBIT being more than 50% larger than GAAP EBIT for 19Q1-3:Share-based compensation, which represents a real cost to shareholders, again accounts for approx. 80% of the difference between non-GAAP and GAAP EBIT figures (similar to 2018).In 2019, the percentage of FCF distributed to shareholders continues to be limited, as much of FCF is spent on acquisitions and investments, meaning management's FCF figures overstate the amount of cash that is actually ""free"". During Q1-3, out of $2.8bn in FCF, $1.3bn was spent on acquisitions and investments, with only $1.1bn returned to shareholders in buybacks:On the impact of the end of the agreement with eBay in July 2020, 19Q3 results provided a positive surprise. Management shared its estimate that the impact on 2020 revenue growth would only be 1%, a much lower figure than many investors and analysts had expected.During 19Q3, eBay was still 6% of PayPal's Total Payment Volume, and likely a much close to 10% of revenues, given it has always had a higher revenue margin (100-150 bps higher by some estimates; eBay represented 11% of PayPal's volume and 17% of its revenues in 2018):Management justified its low estimate of an 1% impact by its experience observing eBay's ramp-up with Adyen (OTCPK:ADYYF) so far. Under their agreement, in the run-up to the end of their relationship, eBay has the right to start transferring some volume from PayPal to a new provider. PayPal stated its belief that eBay has now transferred 10% of its business with PayPal (in the U.S. and Germany) to Adyen, and that this experience showed that the loss of eBay business would be smaller and slower than many expected.PayPal's transaction take rate has continued to decline, falling another 13 bps year-to-year in 19Q3 to 2.21%, in contrast to American Express's (AXP) (much higher) merchant discount margin, which has been stable:A large part of the decline in PayPal's transaction take rate is due to a change in mix. PayPal is growing fastest in low-margin areas like peer-to-peer (""P2P"") payments, and P2P was responsible for roughly ½ of the margin decline in 19Q3. In addition, the high-margin eBay business is shrinking (down 2.6% year-on-year, excluding currency, in 19Q3).However, one positive surprise from 19Q3 results is how much PayPal has been able to offset this transaction take rate decline by controlling other expenses. Management stated that, for every $1 increase in revenues, they only needed to increase non-transaction operating expenses by $0.04. As described above, PayPal's EBIT margin rose 260 bps year-on-year on a GAAP basis (reversing a falling trend in 2017-18) in 19Q3, and by 207 bps on a non-GAAP basis:We now expect PayPal to be able to deliver a continuous margin uplift in the next years.As part of 19Q3 results, management provided the initial outlook for 2020, which includes a 17-18% year-on-year growth in EPS, based on a 17% growth in revenue and a 50 bps uplift in operating margin (all figures are non-GAAP and currency-neutral):The 2020 growth rates guided are lower than PayPal's medium-term outlook (for a 17-18% revenue CAGR and a 20% EPS CAGR), partly because they do not include acquisitions, and partly because of the interest expense from the $5bn new long-term debt issued during 19Q3.For 2019, management raised outlook slightly, and now expects GAAP EPS of $2.03-2.06 and non-GAAP EPS of $3.06-3.08, reflecting a currency- neutral revenue growth of 18.5% (excluding the sale of the U.S. consumer card portfolio). 2019 FCF is expected to be $3.5bn, and share-based compensation costs are expected to be $1.06-1.10bn.At $105.85, PayPal shares are trading on 34.5x P/E relative to the ($3.07) mid-point of its 2019 non-GAAP EPS guidance range, and 51.8x relative to the ($2.045) mid-point of its GAAP EPS guidance range.For FCF Yield, we use an adjusted FCF figure of $2.4bn, which subtracts the share-based compensation costs from the management FCF figure. This gives an 1.9% FCF Yield - we believe this to be the best valuation metric.Management has estimated that the end of the eBay agreement in July 2020 will have limited impact (only 1% hit to revenue growth that year), and we make no adjustments to the valuation multiples on this basis.PayPal's investment case has improved since our original article in May, but today’s near 10% rebound in share price makes the shares too expensive.Improvements in the investment case include a lower valuation (share price has fallen 5% while earnings have grown), a lower estimate of the impact from eBay and a better offset for the declining transaction take rate. We believe PayPal can likely deliver a “real” EPS CAGR of 15-20% in the medium term.However, on a 2019E expected FCF Yield of 1.9% and P/E of over 50x on GAAP EPS (near 35x on non-GAAP EPS), the shares are still too expensive.We prefer to wait for a more attractive entry price, and reiterate our Neutral recommendation on PayPal.In the payments space, we prefer Mastercard, which also guides to a “high-teens” EPS CAGR in the medium term, but has a more attractive valuation (with 2019 expected FCF Yield of around 2.4%) and actually returns nearly all of its FCF to shareholders in dividends and buybacks.Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here (updated)."
4302012,69965,2019-11-03T22:19:03-05:00,"Venmo has a $100-billion payment market to go after and currently it holds roughly 5%.Venmo looks like peanuts compared to PayPal's opportunity in China.PayPal's projected P/E looks high, EPS growth looks low, and if both are wrong, investors should take advantage.","I think it’s fair to say that PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been a market darling since being spun out of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Investors who were fortunate enough to get in at the beginning have seen their shares rise from under $35 to over $106 recently. This type of gain over a four-year period is why investors flock to the stock market. With that in mind, the shorter-term story of the stock is a bit different. Though the shares are up on the full year, over the last six months, the stock has only recently approached a positive return. The good news is whether you are a long-term holder of the stock, or you are looking to get in now, PayPal offers a decent value and future growth that’s hard to beat.PayPal essentially operates two different businesses. The first is the company’s personal business, which is comprised of PayPal personal accounts and the socially popular Venmo. The phrasing to “Venmo” someone is becoming relatively common terminology. Generally speaking, when a brand name becomes synonymous with an action that is a good thing.In the personal payments market, Venmo faces no shortage of competition. Zelle is a money transfer service owned by some of the largest financial institutions in the world. This service is being integrated into online banking from each of the institutions, with the idea of keeping these customers away from services like Venmo. According to eMarketer, there are about 80 million mobile phone person-to-person (P2P) users in the U.S. alone.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has been pushing Zelle through its online and mobile banking, and the company said in the second quarter of this year, customers sent and received $18 billion through the service. If we move out to a broader perspective, the volume of P2P payments in the U.S. exceeds $100 billion. Just as a quick point of comparison, PayPal said P2P payments totaled $5 billion in the last quarter.Venmo is constantly on the offensive, trying to pull more and more users into the service. The company already offers transfers to and from bank accounts. Venmo users can get a branded debit card to make purchases where the service isn’t accepted yet. The company’s CEO Dan Schulman pointed out, Venmo has a deal with Synchrony Financial to offer an upcoming Venmo credit card. To make the point of how fast Venmo changes its offerings, while I was writing the first part of this article, the company announced Venmo Rewards.(Source: Venmo Rewards)This service seems to be a direct shot at certain banks (*cough* Bank of America), where you are required to select offers before you are eligible to earn cash back. Venmo Rewards just requires the use of the company’s debit card. While Venmo may have initially started as a way to pay individuals, PayPal is doing everything it can to get users paying with Venmo.The company says, “millions of websites accept Venmo as a payment option through PayPal.” The ever-popular split option is available even for these purchases. The system remembers the total and you can request to split the cost after the purchase. Through P2P or purchases, Venmo processed $27 billion in total payment volume last quarter, which represented an annual increase of 64%. Venmo’s market opportunity, social capabilities, and new features like cash back, should allow PayPal to continue to capture more wallet share in the future.For growth investors, one of the most important factors in picking stocks is figuring out how long their growth will last. In large part, this means figuring out what the company’s addressable market looks like. PayPal offers services that have utility worldwide, yet certain markets are going to be more important over the long term.Whereas Venmo’s domestic market potential is around $100 billion, by 2027 total payment volume in the U.S. is expected to exceed $10 trillion. While this seems like a crazy dollar amount, this figure would represent an 87% increase over the ten-year period. A faster-growing geography such as Europe is expected to grow by 139% from 2017 to 2027. This is a significant growth rate, yet the market value is expected to reach $6.3 trillion. For most companies, a $16-trillion opportunity in two markets would be more than enough to keep them busy for longer than most of us will be alive.(Source: The Nilson Report – Charts & Graphs Archive)However, the biggest market is the Asia-Pacific region and this opportunity makes everything else look like child’s play. From 2017 to 2027, payment volume in this market is expected to grow by 330% to a total of $57 trillion. Yes that’s $57 trillion with a capital T. PayPal wants to move into China with the help of a 70% equity interest in GoPay. The company is a provider of online payment services in the market, and in PayPal’s own words this, “has the potential to dramatically expand our total addressable market and our long-term growth prospects.”To say this expands PayPal’s potential is the understatement of a couple of decades. In the last quarter, PayPal’s revenue of roughly $4.4 billion came from $179 billion in total payment volume (TPV). This means every dollar of TPV, converted to revenue of $0.024, or about 2.4%. If PayPal were to take just 1% of the Asia-Pacific market by 2027, this would work out to $570 billion in TPV.At the same rate of revenue conversion as the last quarter, PayPal would generate about $13.7 billion in international revenue just from this one area. Just by point of comparison, PayPal generated just over $2 billion (or $8 billion annualized) in international revenue last quarter.Of course, there is risk of going into the Chinese market, not the least of which is entrenched competition. One of the more daunting challengers is Alibaba’s (NYSE:BABA) Alipay. This Chinese payment solution is already in, “more than 8 million brick-and-mortar stores in China.” In addition, Tencent’s (OTCPK:TCEHY) Tenpay, WeChat Pay, and QQ Wallet, represent even more competitive pressure. A report from the beginning of this year suggested between Alibaba and Tencent, they held almost 93% of payment market share.Though PayPal’s business in China will be challenging, as we saw, just a 1% market share in a handful of years would be worth billions. The point is, PayPal doesn’t have to dominate the market for this to be a huge win for the company.With PayPal investing to grow its Venmo service, and attempting to gain market share in the world’s largest payment market, investors should be excited already. When we add these positive developments, to the company’s relative valuation, long-term investors have a reason to buy.PayPal’s projected P/E sits at about 30 and analysts believe the company will grow earnings over the next five years by an average of 18%. There are two things that make these assumptions seem conservative. First, over the last four quarters, PayPal has beaten estimates by an average of almost 13% per quarter. If the company continued this streak, its forward P/E would drop to less than 27. Second, PayPal’s CEO Dan Schulman said in the last earnings call, “continued expansion of our operating margins… provides us with increased confidence in our medium-term guidance of 20% EPS growth compounded annually.”The company’s top-line growth seems to support PayPal’s argument for 20% EPS growth. This year, analysts expect revenue to increase by 15%, whereas next year the estimate moves up to almost 17%. In the company’s current quarter, revenue increased by 19% and adjusted EPS jumped by 31%. It’s hardly a stretch to believe that PayPal can take 17% revenue growth next year and turn it into at least 20% EPS growth.What’s odd is analysts are only calling for 14% EPS growth next year. Considering the momentum of PayPal’s business, investments in Venmo and international, plus the company’s consistent ability to beat estimates, suggest an opportunity. Investors looking for a fast growth company with massive potential need only type PYPL and place their buy order."
4298680,105256,2019-10-24T13:41:32-04:00,"$60 billion on the sidelines is fuel to power the S&P to a breakout and why breakouts are important to traders.ServiceNow is an even better story than we thought. I'm hoping for some big contract wins fairly quickly from McDermott and an empowered sales team.Microsoft and Azure gives us confidence, and it will get sponsorship to break into all-time highs just like Apple.I am worrying about Amazon and what it might do to this optimism. We need to see above 37% growth in AWS to add more impetus to cloud stocks.","This market is hated: In the third quarter, investor sentiment was negative. Morningstar stated that $60 billion left mutual and ETF equities. This is the highest outflow since 2009. Those kinds of outflows don't happen before stock market peaks and ahead of a correction. That kind of negativity says there is a lot of money on the sidelines, making for buying in the coming months.Right now, we are about 12 points from a breakout according to the futures. Katie Stockton, a brilliant technical analyst, was on CNBC's Squawk Box yesterday and said that 3,028 was the breakout point; I had 3,024, but no matter. Once we do close above this level, it will draw a lot of traders back into the market. I know a lot of you eschew technical analysis and might think charting is voodoo, but let's just agree that a LOT of professional traders use it and even total bottom-up money managers know the levels.Aside from the fact that a new level in a widely followed index draws less active traders and investors back into the market, it will embolden the aforementioned skeptics on the sidelines to take more risk. Risk is not always a bad thing if the reward is there. Breaking out is proof that reward is in the offing. There are also no ""stranded buyers"" overhead to sell against the rally. Let's step back from the indexes and talk stocks. No one seems to remember but only a year ago Apple (AAPL) fell from about 228 to 144, more than 40%. Many critics at the time said that AAPL's best days were behind it, etc. It took a year for AAPL to break above all those stranded buyers (this is what is meant by overhead resistance) to approach even. At this higher point, the resistance is the strongest since you then had traders with profits from the low plus the long-suffering buyers who bought at the top and never thought they'd get money would begin to sell. Once AAPL broke out, there were no longer any ready sellers, and naturally, the stock would rise and is now rising day after day. It is now above 240 (up about 10% from breakout), and all the analysts are falling all over themselves to raise the price target. This is why you should care about breakouts if you are a trader. If you are an investor, you should let dividends be your first filter. When a stock is moving up so fast the dividend becomes smaller, you should hold off, and look for other stocks that have better income profile.Microsoft had a very good quarter. Some criticized Azure that it is growing less fast at 59%. Let's bear in mind that this growth rate is 1/3rd faster than Amazon's (AMZN) AWS (more on that later). MSFT is easily the safest growth stock for a money manager to get behind in a breakout. MSFT itself has been contending with overhead resistance for months and I believe is destined to break out. Market participants are not blind to what just happened with AAPL, and they will take the next logical step and look at MSFT. Let's take a quick look at the chart ourselves and think about where it could go.The above chart reflects yesterday's close. MSFT opened up 2 points and clearly is showing that it broke the downtrend (the red line). The lower line is at about 133, so with the all-time high at 142, it gives us 9 points. We should see MSFT hit 150 in very short order. All this is technical analysis; adding the recent bottom to the top to see where a stock could go is a guesstimate that many traders will use. I would even say that traders that rode AAPL up 10% will go over and ride MSFT and hope for the same. I never thought I'd say this, but MSFT is a fast money trade, and it is a longer speculation. If you have room for a growth name (it has a dividend), then MSFT is an investment. That's a trifecta in the making.Now, what does this mean for the overall cloud market? A 59% growth in Azure means that there's more demand for Elastic (ESTC), Twilio (TWLO), Okta inc. (OKTA) and all the tools that make the cloud work. It is true that much of the growth in Azure is corporate legacy applications leaving corporate servers and moving to Azure. Still, the momentum of moving to the cloud is alive and well. Any new applications will need the services of a VMware (NYSE:VMW), and a Nutanix (NTNX), etc. Put it another way, if Microsoft is healthy, then Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud is healthy, and AWS is healthy. There is plenty of business to go around. There is so much demand for cloud platforms to support new applications and old that the triumvirate is not yet bumping into each other.We now have confirmation that Donahoe is turning over NOW at the height of its game. No wonder McDermott was so excited. I boosted NOW as a trade yesterday, and I hope some of you took advantage. NOW is up an additional 9% this morning at 240. The all-time high is 300ish, so there will be a point that overhead resistance will kick in. I bet there will be a bunch of upgrades based on McDermott taking over. Is McDermott a better CEO than Donahoe? We don't have to go there. McDermott is a DIFFERENT kind of CEO, sort of in the mold of the late great Mark Hurd who sadly passed away recently. McDermott knows enterprise sales, he understands that market really well, and he grew SAP (NYSE:SAP) against the toughest competition like an Oracle (ORCL) and Hurd who was co-CEO there. SAP is also a horizontal application, while NOW is THE corporate digitization application and horizontal as well. I think we will see a new ""sales forward"" style of management and some big enterprise wins fairly quickly. What the results for NOW mean for the overall market is another confirmation that the cloud names like MongoDB (MDB), Splunk (SPLK), or an Arista Networks (ANET) and the other previously named cloud tools and platforms are still in growth mode. The jury is out on Workday (WDAY) that is more of a business app, if only because the field is getting more crowded there, or that an SAP or an ORCL is getting more competitive. We do see it with New Relic (NEWR) competing with a Datadog (DDOG), so there is no question that over time the horizontal space will further differentiate and new winners will emerge. However, for now, I expect good things from many of these names.PayPal's total payment volume, a closely watched metric, reached $179 billion in the third quarter, up 25% from a year ago. That should read through to American Express (AXP), Visa (V), Mastercard (MS), Square (SQ), Discover Financial (DFS). For the third quarter, PayPal said on Wednesday that it earned an adjusted $723 million, or 61 cents a share, and is well ahead of analysts' consensus expectation of 52 cents. PayPal's revenue came in at $4.4 billion, even with estimates higher and up 19% from last year's $3.7 billion. The health of payments is a great indicator of the health of the consumer and the willingness to adopt new services like Apple Pay and the joint venture between Apple and Goldman Sachs (GS). I didn't include GS with the other Fintech names, but rest assured, GS is the sleeper in this space. GS was always a technology powerhouse, and now it is focusing on the Fintech space instead or in addition to trading technology. Of all the banks, GS is the one that excites me the most. I digress, PYPL is a good trade, though I might wait a day or two to find a lower entry point.The first hurdle is AWS. We need to see at least 37% growth. That is just table-stakes more than that, like a +39% level, and we are off to the races for the cloud names overall and maybe we get some leadership from AMZN. The other piece is that I am concerned that expenses are about to get to the level that will hammer overall earnings. I think that the current AMZN investor is not the old style that looks at low profits and even no profits as the company making growth investments for the future. Same-day delivery and taking up the infrastructure for more and more of the last-mile delivery cost mucho dinero. Of course, AMZN has other ambitions, namely the desire to totally disrupt healthcare.Right now, it is about drug distribution and online pharmacy, but it's going to get bigger in overall healthcare going forward. I wouldn't be surprised if that is discussed in the conference call. Also, the overall logistics approach and competing with FedEx (NYSE:FDX) from the airfreight perspective is a big investment. Finally, I am sure there'll be an analyst on the call that'll ask about JEDI, the $10 billion winner-take-all defense contract. This is a marquee contract. Anyone who gets this will be the acknowledged technology leader and also to having the corporate heft to tackle any mega-enterprise services contract. The accepted wisdom was that AWS was the ""shoo-in"", not so. Word is that now it's 50/50, with Microsoft tipped as the come-from-behind favorite. Why? Everyone in Washington hates Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google and Amazon. It is the only place that Trump is aligned with Bernie, AOC, and Pelosi in hating on AMZN. I think AMZN will have to acknowledge on the call that it is anyone's guess who walks away with the trophy. I think more than one analyst will comment that it's more than 50/50 that AWS doesn't get JEDI. On the other hand, if AMZN finds a way to preserve earnings, grows AWS above expectations (even a little), and still makes progress on new initiatives, then it gets back to old highs, and the cloud names get even more of a head of steam. As an aside, if AWS does lose the JEDI, the clamor for spinning out the cloud business will accelerate.I would hold off on trying to ride Tesla (TSLA). There is a lot of short covering going on. It might take a few days, but I think we will get some kind of a retracement. I would then trade it. TSLA has answered all the naysayers and is once again rallying. I think the old pivot point of 320 will be an interim top, and maybe look for 270ish as an entry-point as TSLA fills in some of this up-gap.MSFT is a trade. If you are really a technician, wait for the breakout and ride the new highs. I think MSFT IS going to break out. I think it attracts sponsorship from traders who have been riding AAPL and all of those money managers who are sitting on the sidelines. I am long MSFT options.NOW is still a trade. If you got in yesterday, no one would blame you if you took profits today. I might wait a little for NOW. Perhaps there is a sale on Friday. Look at it then, but NOW is going higher.Trade cloud technology names. There are a bunch of great cloud platform tools that I have mentioned. Look into them and pick a few that had good earnings reports that surprised to the upside previously. Chances are they will again. Start small. I still feel there is a good chance that some names will sell off on earnings.Long-term investors or speculators with patience should really take a look at GS. Make up your own mind, but I think it will be a disruptor like Square (SQ) and still has all the heft of a mega-bank.I still like DocuSign (DOCU) as a trade, and Boeing (BA). I keep trying to buy them cheaper and am not getting filled. Buying right is a challenge, especially options. Keep emotions out of buying. If you don't get filled, try not to chase.Just a reminder I will be starting a subscription service through Seeking Alpha for options education and community. It is called ""Put-Call Community"". In the community, I will be sharing how I would set up options trades on the above trading ideas and how to surface new opportunities. It is a community, so you will have a chance to participate, contribute and learn. I want to learn, too!"
4296120,104361,2019-10-11T12:42:40-04:00,"PayPal entered the Chinese payment market by acquiring a local payment platform GoPay.We think the timing of the move is bad though, due to political tension, market competition, and the quality of the target.PayPal needs to be cautious in expanding their business in China.","On September 30, PayPal (PYPL) announced China's Central Bank, People's Bank of China (PBoC) had approved its purchase of a controlling (70%) equity stake in local payments processor GoPay (Guofubao Information Technology Co. [GoPay], Ltd.) that holds licenses to process online and mobile transactions and primarily operates in the e-commerce and cross-border commerce spaces.As stated by PayPal CEO Dan Schulman in an online statement:The move actually marks a return to the Chinese market for PayPal, which entered China in the early 2000s alongside eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) but left when eBay pulled out of the market in 2006. Around the same time, Beijing introduced regulation for the payment processing industry and shut out foreign competitors. It was until March last year that PBoC announced it would open the payments processing space to foreign firms but has since been accused of slow-walking the process.As glamorous as it sounded for PYPL to be the first and only foreign player in China's market, we think the timing is probably the worst. And the fierce competition on the market could squeeze the profitability for PYPL, aggressive expansion may even bring significant losses to the company.There are a couple of reasons why we think it's a bad time (if not the worst) for PYPL to enter the Chinese market.First of all, political tension. The White House has been reportedly considering curbing some U.S. investments in China amid the trade dispute between the countries. Although we previously stated that this might be more like a political ploy for the Trump Administration to gain leverages in the upcoming trade talks, one thing we can't deny is the hostile atmosphere between the world's two largest economies. It's hard to forecast what will happen to foreign companies (such as PYPL) in China in case the tension escalates in the future.Secondly, the market has already been very crowded. It was reported that incumbents Ant Financial (a subsidiary of Alibaba (BABA)) and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) occupy 90% of the payments market in China already, which leaves little room for new players like PayPal.More scary than the market concentration is the giant FinTech Ecosystem that Ant Financial and Tencent have already built. In our previous article, we have stated that WeChat (the major messaging app from Tencent) has pretty much become the mega app that dominates people's daily life. The financial arms from Tencent are just enjoying the monopoly power inherited from the overall ecosystem:Similar to Tencent, Ant Financial also maintains a dominating position in all key areas: payment (Alipay), wealth management (Ant Fortune), credit services (Zhima Credit), and lending (MYbank).The current competing landscape of China's payments market leads us to believe that it will be very tough for PayPal to get a meaningful share of the market.On top of that, the payment business in China is quite different than that in the U.S. While the American payment platform can get 2-3% transaction fees from merchants, Alipay and Tencent Pay only require 0.3-0.4%. The reason being that Alipay and Tencent Pay act more as the supplementary service within the overall ecosystem, rather than a standalone business.This leads to a deep concern that if PayPal starts to make aggressive moves in China hoping to acquire market shares, most likely they will be disappointed by the profitability.Thirdly, the target could have been better. GoPay, founded in 2011, got their payment license issued by the government in 2016.Source: GoPay WebsiteHowever, due to the competition within the market, GoPay has been struggling to grow their business. On their website, only a few business partners were listed, including their previous parent company, Hainan Airlines:Source: GoPay WebsiteAlso, it was reported that in 2018, GoPay got a ticket from PBoC, with a fine of over RMB 44 MM (more than $6 MM). The reason for the ticket was ""providing payment services to unidentifiable individuals/institutes"":Source: PBoC AnnouncementIt's not clear whether the regulatory ticket was the direct trigger for Hainan Airlines to sell GoPay, it is certainly something that PayPal should take care of once they complete the transaction and roll into real operation.Although we agree that PayPal made a remarkable achievement as the first foreign company to enter China's payment market, this might be the worst time for the move. Our outlook from this market is conservative, based on the political tension, market competition, as well as the target PayPal acquired."
4294359,105417,2019-10-01T08:45:16-04:00,"While constituting only 1% of PayPal's total account and revenue base, Xoom, in our view, is a very overlooked story.Xoom can offer access to new geographic markets and a new offline channel to PayPal, presenting an entirely new customer cohort.Xoom's customers are of higher ""quality"": they are more recurring and are less likely to engage in fraudulent activities.","For PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), a very overlooked story is that of Xoom, a money transfer company that it acquired in 2015, the same year it spun off from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). While transaction itself was relatively small in size (about $1 billion) and Xoom's customer base stood at only 1.3 MM accounts (about 1% of Xoom's total active user base), it is Xoom's potential that matters for PayPal in the long run. Specifically, as an online company, Xoom was formed as a direct challenge to Western Union (NYSE:WU) and MoneyGram (NASDAQ:MGI), two money transfer companies that specialize in the offline channel.It's very simple: PayPal enables customers to send and receive payments online. It is one of the most well-recognized brands in the US and internationally today, with approximately 267 million active users, 9.9 billion payment transactions, and $578 billion in total payment volume; all three metrics grew in double digits in 2018, in the 17-27% Y/Y range. PayPal earns revenues by charging fees for payment transactions, based on the total volume; in addition, PYPL generates revenue from FX fees. The company also derives revenue from value-added services (via various partnerships).We see four key reasons that could make PayPal a meaningful opportunity over the next several years. While to-date Xoom has been only marginally adding to PayPal's P&L, we believe that the following catalysts are being underappreciated:1. The rate of conversion of offline-to-online money transfer customers stands at 30-40% for Xoom: in other words, 30-40% of new Xoom (i.e., PayPal's customers) come from the offline platforms of Western Union and MoneyGram. This means that potentially PayPal as a company needs to do a more aggressive and targeting marketing outreach to the customers of those two companies, thus potentially boosting Xoom's revenues and bringing more active users to PayPal's overall platform.2. The three core markets of Xoom are India, Philippines, and Mexico (they make up about 65% of its GSV (gross sending volume). PayPal, however, thus far struggled to build a meaningful presence in those three markets, mostly being a US and European brand. Meanwhile, Xoom could become a strong launching pad for building PayPal's presence in Asia and Latin America, even linking remittance to everyday transfers. With electronic funds processing, the key hurdle is to set up a bank account that is linked to PayPal (or Xoom) - once it's established, customers should feel comfortable using both brands interchangeably.3. Xoom's fraud loss rates are lower than PayPal's by at least 10-12 bps. This does not mean that Xoom has better fraud protection systems; PayPal actually has one of the most secure networks in the payments industry. Rather, Xoom's customer base is far more recurring and sticky: customers are used to sending weekly or monthly payments to their loved ones. The profile of the average PayPal customer is more random and, as a result, leaves greater room for fraudulent activity.4. Pricing matters! Xoom regularly recruits customers from the offline channel to the online channel, since the latter's transaction fees are much lower (it takes, on average, $5 to send $1,000 with Xoom and about $18 with Western Union). Therefore, Xoom can tap into the network, where PayPal has very limited access.We believe that the 45x PE multiple on our 2019 EPS estimate of $2.72 is appropriate, yielding the target price of $123. This multiple is not out of line with the TMT space and can actually be much higher, in our view, if the Xoom opportunity can be meaningfully tapped. While at present it is too early to assign an incremental multiple to the Xoom business, we believe that PayPal can achieve an extra $0.021 EPS per every 1 MM new accounts that Xoom acquires."
4295744,105459,2019-10-09T12:35:26-04:00,"Brexit, eBay separation, Venmo monetization, and execution risks remain some of the key challenges facing PYPL.Lack of wallet competitiveness is a long-term risk.Initiate with a bearish view and an $85 target price.","I am initiating on PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) with a Sell rating and an $85 target price, implying an 18% downside. I find PYPL’s recent guide down following the Q2 result to be a clear reminder to investors on the near-term and the long-term risks that the company is facing. With analysts’ consensus expectations appearing to remain at a high level, I think the market could be in for a major disappointment as we head into 2020.In the near term, eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) transition towards Adyen remains a clear negative along with Brexit and the evolving regulations in Europe such as PSD2 and SCA. In addition, Venmo’s monetization remains unclear. Although I can see why the market expects Venmo to eventually be monetized, it is worth pointing out that no clear monetizing strategy has been presented, and it is most likely that Venmo will never be monetized, given that it has been more than six years since Venmo’s introduction. Finally, key executive departures raise the concern on PYPL’s execution ability amid an increasingly competitive environment with Square (SQ), Adyen, Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Stripe to encroach on PYPL’s market share.In the long term, the single biggest question investors should ask is “what will be in your wallet?”. Sure, PYPL revolutionized the way consumer conduct transactions online, but the winning formula for any payment company lies in two ingredients: consumer penetration and consumption settings. Consumer penetration involves how well the payment method is being adopted by the mainstream consumers, while consumption settings include the places where consumers can use the payment method in both online and offline. Although PYPL had a first-mover in the online world, it severely lags in the offline payment space where Apple Pay and Google Pay (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are gaining traction. Given that offline sales remain 85% of total retail sales in the US and a critical area to harness user behavior, I believe PYPL’s long-term competitiveness in ecommerce will likely to erode as AAPL and GOOGL shift online with the emergence of integrated payment gateways.Finally, China is unlikely to be a growth market for PYPL due to the well-entrenched incumbent payment giants in Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Alipay (NYSE:BABA) that are well penetrated in terms of users and merchants. Although China’s evolving payment regulation is supportive for PYPL’s entry into China, a considerable amount of investment is needed in order to gain adoption on both the users and merchants. I believe an incremental $200m-300m/year in marketing expense is required on top of my current estimate of $1.2bn and $1.3bn for 2020E and 2021E, respectively, which will be a further drag to the profitability.My DCF-based target price of $85 on PYPL assumes 10% cost of equity (2% RFR, 1.2x beta, 6.5% ERP) and 5% terminal growth rate. For 2020E, I forecast +12% revenue growth as I factor in eBay separation, increased competition from other tech giants and regulatory headwinds from Europe. For 2021E and beyond, I believe PYPL will likely to face payment volume stagnation as a significant portion of its key markets (i.e. the US and Europe) enters a maturing state and believe that China is unlikely to be a source of payment volume growth despite the favorable regulatory landscape.The target price implies 26x target multiple for 2020E EPS, which I think is justified due to the lower revenue growth outlook of 10-15% normalized TVP growth for 2020E and beyond.PYPL guided 2019 revenue down due to the timing of large product integration with some of its partners, the introduction of new pricing initiative, and negative FX headwinds with the cross-border business. Although the sell-side consensus appears to be brushing off this near-term weakness for the prospect of longer-term gain in 2020, I think it is important to stress the growing headwinds with eBay separation, Brexit, and evolving regulations on PSD2/SCA.On eBay separation, investors should be mindful that eBay’s transition towards its managed payment platform is an indicator of a broader trend in which ecommerce sites are providing more choices for the consumers at the point of sale. In the case with eBay, consumers can select Apple Pay, Google Pay in addition to PayPal. Losing exclusivity is a concern in that it could result in potential loss in transaction revenue. Consumers are certainly voting with their wallet, and it was interesting to see that eBay management pointed out how consumers are increasing selecting alternative form of payments such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, or credit card when making a purchase, thereby circumventing PYPL. The benefit of managed payment platform could be summarized in two-folds: First, consumers can use the payment method that they are most convenient with. Second, merchants can offer an alternative form of payment that may result in lower fees compared with what PYPL is charging. More importantly, eBay’s management payment platform simplifies the payment experience that allows the seller to manage all the selling and payment needs within their eBay account and eBay invoice while maintaining the same level of security as when PayPal was the dominant option. With eBay expecting most of the merchants to migrate to the management payment platform by 2021, I expect a gradual loss in payment transaction for PYPL on eBay.More importantly, investors should not forget that the managed payment platform could also be adopted by other ecommerce or online market/service places that look to give consumers broader choice and merchants lower cost. With the growth in integrated payment gateways that facilitate more payment choices, it is likely that PYPL will gradually lose its dominant position in online transactions.Source: DatanyzeOn Brexit and the evolving regulations in Europe, PYPL’s ~10-12% of consolidate revenue could be at risk. Per PYPL’s 2018 annual report, we think it is worthwhile for investors to read the fine print:Given that Brexit is creating much uncertainty with PYPL, I expect to negatively impact transaction volume and, by extension, revenue growth. To be fair, PYPL is not the only payment company feeling the pain from Brexit as Visa (NYSE:V) also pointed its weak volume growth in the UK.In terms of regulations, I expect further headwinds that will impact transaction volume growth. Europe is looking to roll out Payment Service Directive 2 (PSD2)/Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) that looks to challenge the banks’ monopoly on user data and allow a more streamlined payment process.In essence, PSD2 allows businesses and consumers to give third-party permission to retrieve their account data from their banks and may initiate payment for users directly from their bank accounts. The objective for the European Commission is to create a single integrated market for payment services with a standardized regulation for the banks and the payment service providers while ensuring transparency and fair competition, so the barriers to competition of new payment player can be lowered. For example, consumers pay bills through the banks nowadays, but under the new regulation, the consumers could pay bills through messaging or social media apps that are linked to their bank accounts. The SCA also places a strong identity check at the point of sale, which could result in incremental cart abandonment due to poor user experience. In short, SCA will negatively impact not only PYPL but its competitors as well.Stripe recently did a case study and forecasts EUR57bn in loss in economic activity in Europe as a result of SCA and that only 50% of the businesses are expected to be compliant (with 60% of the SMEs likely to be noncompliant due to poor understanding). As such, it is likely that not all of PYPL’s merchants will be ready for the SCA and that lower consumer conversion will result in lower payment transaction.While I understand everyone’s enthusiasm over Venmo (I am a user myself), I cannot get over the fact that it is not making money for PYPL. I think it is worth reminding investors that PYPL does not generate revenue from Venmo transactions. For example, if I send a Venmo request to a friend who sends money back to me, PYPL does not charge either of us a fee for such transactions.The issue with Venmo is that it is becoming a bigger component of PYPL’s transaction volume profile at approximately 14% of the total TPV in 2Q19 compared with just over 10% at the end of 2018. The growth for Venmo remains robust at >50% YoY as of 2Q19.Put it another way, non-revenue TPV is becoming a bigger part of PYPL’s consolidated TPV, and this is a cause of concern because non-revenue TPV is deemed to be lower quality.Ever since PYPL’s introduction of Venmo in 2013, the firm struggled to find a monetization roadmap for the platform, and it is unlikely for Venmo to be monetized, given the number of alternative P2P transfer services that charge no fee. As long as the competing services are fee-less, Venmo is unlikely to have a fee, which means it is unlikely to be monetized anytime soon.The inability to monetize P2P transfer is a common challenge for payment companies large and small. For example, Tencent in China has struggled to monetize its red packet P2P transfer service ever since the founding of WeChat Pay in 2014. Even nowadays, most of the money transfer service was monetized when a user withdraws the money from its app into its bank account. However, the fee charged on withdraw only covers the bank handling fee (i.e. breakeven at gross profit level), meaning it is still loss-making at the operating level.The long-term risk that PYPL investors should consider is how will the payment platform in the US and Europe evolve over time.I think it is important to focus on the wallet and whether such wallet can have a sustainable competitive advantage in the long-run. In my view, a successful wallet needs to have both user and merchant penetration in order to succeed.PYPL’s wallet certainly has a first-mover in the online world in the earlier days with the help of eBay, but it has since lost ground to the emerging wallet players such as Apple and Google Pay in the offline world.Given that 85% of the retail transactions are still in the offline space and that both Apple and Google are making inroads to harness consumer adoption, I believe that users will eventually use the wallet that they are most comfortable within the offline world when conducting online transactions.Apple has an estimated 700m iPhone users globally (with 120m in the US), and this alone establishes a good foundation for Apple Pay on the user side. I think it is just a matter of time before merchants begin to expand their payment offering to accommodate Apple Pay, and this could severely challenge PYPL’s position in the online space.PYPL finally enters China after the country’s central bank, People’s Bank of China, approved its acquisition of a 70% equity stake in Guofubao Information Tech (commonly known as GoPay), marking the first foreign payment platform to be licensed to provide payment-related services in the country. No terms of the transaction were disclosed, but I suspect it is less than $50m as GoPay is largely inactive in China’s payment landscape and the only value of the company lies in its payment license. The transaction is expected to close by Q4.GoPay was established in January of 2011 with a registered capital of RMB142m. By December of 2011, it received a payment license covering online payment and telephone payment as much of the digital payment transactions were conducted via PC and over the telephone. By December of 2016, GoPay acquired the permission from the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, on expanding prepaid card in provinces including Hainan, Shanxi, Yunan, Hubei and Beijing. Over this period, GoPay received its RMB cross-border payment license, which is a separate license given to companies that conduct cross-border transactions (mostly helping merchants to sell overseas).Source: PBOC, mPayPassPYPL’s acquisition is beneficial to both parties.For GoPay, the company has been a subscale player in China’s payment market. Last year’s RMB46m fine from the regulators made it difficult to conduct business, and the company has been looking for a buyer ever since given its ownership of the domestic and cross-border payment license. This deal with PYPL effectively allows the shareholder of GoPay to exit, thereby reaching a satisfactory conclusion with some financial gain.For PYPL, I believe this acquisition is quite significant in several ways:First, China could potentially become a key market for PYPL as the company is looking for new source of revenue amid a maturing market in both Europe and the US, where eWallets have yet to catch up to those in Asia. Given that China has largely become a cashless society after Tencent and Alipay have laid the groundwork on both the user and merchant side in terms of eWallet penetration and usage, I think there is a good chance that PYPL’s eWallet app could gain some traction on the user side, while merchant side might require additional partnership with merchant acquirers such as the banks and/or independent acquirers such as Huifu Payment, Lakala Payment and so forth.Second, and more importantly, current regulations in China are supportive of foreign payment companies on the eWallet side as the People’s Bank of China, the nation’s central bank, outlined in the latest “2019-2021 Fintech Development Plan” the introduction of a unified QR code to facilitate offline payment by allowing multiple wallets to scan a single QR code at point of sale.Currently, Chinese users face multiple QR codes at the point of sale with the most common ones being WeChat Pay and Alipay. In some cases, there are Meituan Pay and UnionPay.Source: TechnodeMultiple number of QR code is inconvenient to the users according to the regulators, hence they a single QR code that accommodates multiple eWallets is necessary to address this issue.That said, the PBOC is looking to roll out a unified QR code that can accommodate all the wallet. Currently, all the Chinese banks are using a unified QR code that is compatible with eWallets and apps from multiple large and medium-size banks. I think the unified QR code that the regulators look to introduce by 2021 will likely to be based on this standard. By then, any payment company that has an eWallet (such as the case with PYPL in China) could link its wallet with the PBOC system and conduct transaction via unified QR code.The introduction of unified QR code will likely to result in a growing number of eWallet players in China. Currently, the market is largely dominated by Tencent and Ant Financial that have a combined >90% market share in eWallet transactions.Because that China’s third-party payment market is still growing and estimated to be over RMB45trn in 4Q18, I think there is room for multiple eWallet players to challenge the Tencent and Ant duopoly, and PYPL could potentially be one of the challengers along with UnionPay, whose CloudPass payment app is backed by all the banks in China.While I think PYPL’s entry into China is a good first step, it is worth reminding investors that merchant and user penetration will be costly.Over the past five years, both Tencent and Alibaba spent a significant amount of money on both promotion on the user end (i.e. Discount on transactions) and merchant end (i.e. Merchant rebate based on transaction volume) to nurture user and merchant habit, and to drive adoption.If PYPL wants to have a sizeable share in China’s payment market (i.e. 5-10%), then an incremental investment of $200m-500m on promotion and discount will be required. Even at that level, it is worth pointing out that both Tencent and Alibaba will unlikely to sit still and likely to use their cash balance to counter PYPL’s entry with an even greater merchant and user discounts.In conclusion, while I am positive on the fact that PYPL becomes the first foreign company to obtain a payment license in China and that the current regulatory landscape favors PYPL to establish a sizeable market share, a significant investment on user adoption is still required for PYPL to convince the users its value proposition relative to WeChat Pay and Alipay. I am staying on the sideline until there is additional evidence of any traction PYPL has in the local market."
4295299,104579,2019-10-06T18:46:26-04:00,"PayPal has sold off from recent highs allowing investors and opportunity to invest in the payments juggernaut.The company has strong competition but its strong earnings and expanded relationships should allow it to continue to grow.During a recession, results would of course suffer, but the company has what it takes to make it through.Long term the company is a great way to invest in the larger adoption of online shopping.","Source HowStuffWorks.comPayPal (PYPL) shares have fallen of out favor with investors recently. This has given those waiting for an entry point a chance to enter the stock. While the company did lower its guidance in the last earnings report leading to a sell off, I believe it has been overdone. In the long term the company stands to benefit from the world of online shopping continuing to grow. PayPal continues to offer consumers a safe and easy way to shop online. While competitive threats have grown, the company still continues to find a way to grow at an impressive rate and is coming out with more and more merchant offerings. This in my opinion is the number one competitive advantage that other ""payment technologies"" don't have and prevents them from being able to disrupt PayPal completely. Investors with a long term time frame such as myself should look at PayPal as a way to invest in the online payments space and the inevitable runway for growth that is ahead. Ultimately, PayPal will if successful become a payments staple and offer returns to shareholders that will become increasingly lucrative. While I typically only invest in companies with dividends, the payments space is one I am willing to forego dividend payments in exchange for greater stock price appreciation.PayPal last reported Q2 earnings that beat on the bottom line and missed ever so slightly on the top.Source: Seeking AlphaWhile revenue growth came in at 12% adjusted for currency, earnings growth was an even more impressive 58%, and non-GAAP earnings increased 47%. The company generated an impressive $1.04 billion in cash flow.PayPal is not a new player in the payments technology space, it was founded in 1998. That being said, the impressive number of new accounts should catch investors attention.Source: Investor UpdateThe company saw a 17% increase in new accounts and further more saw more transactions per active account. This means the consumer is using their PayPal account more, despite the new competitive threats. The growth in accounts also leads to the growth in merchant adoption. Knowing so many users have PayPal and probably prefer to use the service, they are more likely to include the payment processor on their websites. Personally, for my own website, I have seen about a 70/30 split between PayPal and credit card processing for payments. There is a small amount of customers who use Amazon (AMZN) Pay as well.Total Payment volume increased an astonishing 26% on a currency neutral basis as well. This was driven mostly from the in the 70% increase of Venmo transactions.More importantly, the worry about the eBay exclusive relationship expiring is not as important as one may think.Source: Investor UpdateThe company only recognizes 9% of total payments volume from eBay, and this will continue to decline as the company sees growth from other areas. The company has extremely important relationships with many new and established consumer companies such as Uber and Grubhub that are growing rapidly as well. This is important as it puts PayPal again in the face of more consumers and comes back to higher adoption.Now, while we know the core business is strong and adoption is increasing, the company reduced revenue guidance for the remainder of the year.Source: Investor UpdateImportant to recognize, the company actually boosted earnings guidance which is what I personally care about more as the company trades at a higher valuation. Revenue guidance being cut is not great, but this signals the company has become more efficient in generating profit on less revenue which is important. Additionally, the company will inevitably continue to grow revenue despite the slight cut. This cut was attributed to currency headwinds and slower product integration. This is not because the core business is not doing as well as expected. Lastly, one of the many strengths investors should appreciate about PayPal is that unlike most technology companies, PayPal has a strong balance sheet.Source: 10QThe company has cash on hand of $4.9 billion, and with short term investments and other equivalents it has $10.7 billion. This compares to $2.5 billion in short term notes payable. This means the company is in a net positive cash position. This applies a premium to any company in my opinion and especially one with such positive cash flow.While there aren't too many peers close to doing what PayPal primarily does, there is some overlap by payments processors such as Square (SQ).Data by YChartsAs we can see PayPal trades at a lower forward P/E ratio than all peers except Visa. The company also has the lowest P/S ratio and lowest PEG ratio. Additionally, I expect the company to continue to grow at a similar rate as it has been but improving profitability. As it does this, the multiple being maintained should allow for stock price appreciation. Should the company earn $4 per share by 2021, the company would be trading at 25X forward earnings before accounting for cash on hand. We are not that far from 2020 at this point, so as a long term investor I am starting to look a bit further out to see where this company may offer future value. Beyond 2021 it is hard to predict where earnings may lie to due to various factors such as a recession. However, I believe the company will continue to repurchase shares and increase profitability and ultimately as investors know, increase earnings. This should lead to a higher stock price.Ultimately, PayPal should continue to benefit from the increasing amount of shopping being done online. While competition is strong, it is evident by the fact the company is still seeing impressive increases in new accounts and number of transactions per account that these competitive forces aren't affecting PayPal much if at all. The company will continue to earn more and as it does I expect it to see a higher share price. The company will also start to see new initiatives such as the expansion into China recently made, and its partnership with Mercado Libre (MELI) the Amazon of Brazil pay off. These offer long run ways of growth that can only continue to build the brand and value that is PayPal. I have started a position and recently added when it dropped under $100 per share as I believe the shares will continue higher in the coming quarters and years."

While US accelerations in the past have been a key determinant of Global growth, decelerations in China and earlier stage markets have reached a scale that can impact overall global forecasts, with growth in China expected to slow from 30% to 24%.

The revenues reported in Q2FY19 was $4.3bn, an increase of 12% compared with $3.85bn in Q2FY18.[Source: Author]PayPal generates revenue from two categories, transaction revenues and revenues from other value-added services.Transaction revenue was $3.87bn, an increase of 17% compared with $3.31bn in Q2FY18. The increase was primarily due to growth in TPV, mainly from its PayPal, Braintree, and Venmo products, and in the number of payment transactions, both of which resulted primarily from an increase in its active accounts. Acquisitions completed in FY18 contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate of transaction revenues in Q2FY19.Revenues from other value-added services were $427mn, a decrease of 21% compared with $539mn in Q2FY18. The decline was due primarily to lower interest and fee income earned on its consumer loans receivable driven by the sale of its U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio.Active Accounts:An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on the Payments Platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months.PayPal ended the quarter with 286mn active accounts, an increase of 17.2% compared with 244mn accounts in Q2FY18.Active Accounts in mln units:[Source: Author]PayPal in the quarter added 9mn net new active accounts, up 16.8% compared with 7.7mn accounts added in Q2FY18. Active account growth is predominantly driven by core PayPal and Venmo. We expect that the broader assimilation of a dedicated ""Pay with Venmo"" button on merchant websites will continue to create further monetization lift, benefiting TPV, revenue growth, and take-rate, highlighted by management's comments that Venmo as a whole is exiting 2018 at a $200mn revenue run-rate.Total Payment Value in USD bln:[Source: Author]Total Payment Volume is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through PayPal Payments Platform, or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution.

4298338,102404,2019-10-23T16:50:57-04:00,"PayPal has a huge and dense network and can grow its customer engagement and number of active accounts at a stable pace.But PayPal is also facing competition from several companies like Apple, Google, Mastercard or Visa with sometimes much large networks.Facebook will face additional competition in China – especially from Tencent.When assuming very optimistic, that growth will continue to be way above average despite slowing down, PayPal could be fairly valued right now.","I usually analyze companies with a wide economic moat, and among the four existing different types of moats there are, the network effect is often considered to be one of the most effective: Companies like Facebook (FB), Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), Mastercard (MA) or Visa (V) have all built the success mostly on the powerful network they established over time. Another company with a large and growing network is PayPal Holdings Inc (PYPL), which is operating a worldwide online payment system.In this article, I will analyze if PayPal can be a good long-term investment and rely on a wide economic moat and high levels of defensibility, that will protect the business against new and existing competitors in the highly competitive (online) payment field. I will start by looking at some of the metrics that can help us to identify a wide moat company and following that we will take a closer look at the company's network and especially examine the strength of that network. We will end the article with a glance at the stock's valuation.PayPal was founded in December 1998 and had its initial public offering in 2002, but became a wholly owned subsidiary of eBay (EBAY) later that year before eBay spun off PayPal again in 2015. PayPal is already a well-known brand, and Interbrand lists it on spot 73 among the most valuable brands in the world.Numbers alone can never be an unambiguous proof, that a company has a wide moat, but they can give strong hints that we are dealing with a ""wide moat company"". A first hint, that we are dealing with a wide moat, can be sent by stable and consistent revenue growth. Since 2012, revenue increased every single year and with high consistency. On average, revenue increased 18.21% annually over the last six years. Aside from revenue, earnings per share and free cash flow are also important metrics, and while revenue should definitely grow every single year with high consistency, EPS and FCF sometimes fluctuate a little more - even in case of high-quality businesses. PayPal could increase earnings per share about 18.1% on average during the last six years and aside from 2014, EPS could also increase every single year. Free cash flow fluctuated a little more, but could increase 20.0% on average during these six years (we used the lower, adjusted free cash flow from 2018).(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)Aside from the different growth metrics, we also look at the gross margin as well as the operating margin and especially a stable gross margin can indicate pricing power (which is a good sign for some kind of moat). In case of PayPal, we see a decreasing gross margin over the last few years, but PayPal is still a rather young company, and margin fluctuations are not uncommon for young companies. Operating margin on the other hand is very stable over the past few years. Aside from the two margins, return on invested capital is another very important metric: a company with a superior business model and an economic moat should at least report annual return on invested capital of 10% or higher. PayPal could report an average RoIC of 9.8% during the last few years, which is not a bad number, but many other companies (and competitors of PayPal) can report much higher numbers.(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)A final aspect we can look at is the performance of the stock price. PayPal has clearly outperformed the S&P 500 (SPY) since 2015. When a stock is outperforming the market over a long time frame, it can be a hint for a superior business model, but in case of PayPal, we have a problem as we are only looking at four years, which is not a very long time frame, and it could just be the case, that the outperformance is the results of an extreme overvaluation.Data by YChartsThe fact that we are only looking at six (or seven) years of data is a problem in itself as the metrics can only give reliant information when long time series of data are available and six/seven years is almost too short. And while some of the numbers might indicate a wide economic moat, others are rather mediocre (like the average RoIC).The reported numbers are not perfect, and we certainly find a lot of companies with better numbers (higher RoIC, higher and more stable margins), but PayPal definitely seems to be a good business. However, quantitative aspects alone are not enough to identify a great business (and great investment). When searching for long-term investments, we have to identify those aspects about a business model, that create high levels of defensibility and enable a business to protect itself against competitors and enable price increases and organic growth for a long time. We already mentioned above, that the (probably) most important asset for PayPal is its network, which is also the source for its competitive advantage.Right now, PayPal has a network of about 286 million active accounts (which would be the dots in the network) and about 23 million of these accounts are active merchant accounts. Over the last quarters, active accounts increased about 15% YoY. PayPal adds about 9 million net new active accounts every quarter, and during the last 12 months, PayPal added over 41 million net new active accounts.(Source: PayPal Investor Presentation)And aside from a huge network of active accounts, it is also important that the customers actually use PayPal more frequently. Customer engagement is also increasing with a very steady pace. In the last few quarters, customer engagement increased about 8-9% YoY and the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 39.0 right now.(Source: PayPal Investor Presentation)The total payment volume is increasing about 25% YoY in the last few quarters and the growth seems to be very stable. In the recent past, the total payment volume was driven by Venmo, Braintree, by acquisitions as well as person-to-person volume. In the second quarter of 2019, the total payment volume reached $172 billion, with the Venmo volume increasing to over $24 billion in the quarter. About $98 billion of the total payment volume stems from PayPal's Top 20 Marketplaces & Partners - these are companies like Uber Technologies (UBER), Airbnb (AIRB), Lyft, Inc. (LYFT) or Etsy, Inc. (ETSY). The total payment volume of these Top 20 grew 36% YoY, and these are therefore the strongest drivers of growth for PayPal.Very simply put, PayPal is a 2-sided network, with the distinguishing characteristic being, that there are two different classes of users: supply-side and demand-side or customers and merchants. Each side comes for different reasons into the network and both produce complementary value for the other side. Each new seller (merchant) directly adds value for all the buyers (customers) by increasing the number of shops where I can pay by using PayPal. Likewise, every additional buyer (customer) is a new potential customer for all the merchants and one more customer that can pay by using PayPal. People can also send money to each other without differentiation in customer and merchant and hence we could describe PayPal also as direct market network, but 2-sided network is probably the best description.PayPal has the first mover advantage and is still able to uphold its favorable market share and can't be attacked by just replacing a small part of the network as the different connections are equally important (more or less) and a competitor would have to replace the entire network. But when considering that the network seems to be the most important asset, we have to examine how strong the network really is as PayPal is faced with several (potential) competitors, which already have a strong and dense network in place and don't have to replicate a similar network any more.PayPal might be first mover and market leader in the online payment world, but to compete with the major payment companies, a payment method should not just be adopted by consumer and merchants online, but also offline. And when looking at offline payment, PayPal is competing with industry giants like Apple (AAPL) - Apply Pay - and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) - Google Pay. Both companies not only have a high cash flow and R&D power, but also have a large user base and can market its products very effectively.Aside from these two corporations, PayPal is also faced with the competition of the two major credit card companies Mastercard and Visa, which are competitors to PayPal - especially for offline payment in physical stores, but also for online payment. And despite the huge network PayPal already has, the competitors it is facing have a much bigger and denser network. We can start by looking at the number of issued cards of Visa and Mastercard, which are equivalent to PayPal's active accounts and see much larger numbers. Mastercard has about 1.8 billion issued cards, and Visa has more than 3.2 billion cards (more than ten times the amount of active accounts). And we have to take into consideration that these numbers are only one side of Mastercard's (or Visa's) 2-sided network - only the customer side. It does not reflect the number of participating merchants, stores or retailers, while the 286 million active accounts are both sides.(Source: Visa Annual Report 2018)One might point out that PayPal is still a rather young company and growing at a high pace - active accounts grew 17% YoY in the last quarter. But Mastercard can also grow its number of cards at a high pace - the consumer credit cards grew 8% in 2018, the consumer debt and prepaid cards grew 15%, and the consumer credit and debit cards grew 11%. And as networks often see a ""winner-takes-it-all"" effect, it could very well be that PayPal will lose out to these two established major credit card companies. And when looking at metrics like the operating margin or return on invested capital, Mastercard and Visa seem to have an edge over PayPal as well.Serious additional competitionBut the list of potential competitors with huge and dense networks is not finished. Facebook is currently working with many different partners on its Libra project and plans to introduce its own cryptocurrency. PayPal was also part of the project, but dropped out a few weeks ago. We have to see how the project will evolve over time and if this could become a serious competition for PayPal, but the network Facebook by itself can rely on is impressive: Currently, Facebook has 2,414 million monthly active users, which is more than 8 times the amount of active accounts PayPal has, and this would be another massive network, PayPal could be faced with as competition.Difficulties to enter ChinaPayPal is currently also trying to enter China, which will be tough in my opinion as PayPal is confronted with two very serious competitors - Alibaba (BABA) with its payment system Alipay as well as Tencent and both have already achieved a high level of market penetration in China. In case of Tencent, the payment is embedded in WeChat and the combined monthly active users of Weixin and WeChat are currently 1,132 million and the number of users is still growing 7% YoY. The network of Tencent must be seen as an especially powerful network - not only because it is huge and dense, but many other applications and services are embedded within WeChat and Weixin making the stickiness especially high. This makes it unlikely that customers - or merchants - will switch to another payment system like PayPal.Multi-TenantingA final problem, PayPal (and its network) is faced with, is ""multi-tenanting"", which basically describes the problem, that users can switch between different payment services simultaneously without facing huge costs and PayPal is not really able to prevent its customers from switching to a competitor. I myself have a PayPal account, I use my Mastercard regularly, but I am still paying a lot of things in cash every day. This is a problem networks are often confronted with, and it seems unlikely that PayPal (or other companies) will solve that problem anytime soon.And finally, to decide if PayPal could be a good investment despite the competition, we have to look at the current valuation. PayPal is currently trading with a P/E ratio of 40.2 (when using the non-GAAP numbers of 2018). When using the GAAP numbers, PayPal is trading with a P/E ratio of 56.9. When using management's own guidance, PayPal is trading with a forward P/E ratio of 31. These are all high valuation metrics, but we saw above, that PayPal is growing with a high pace.But P/E ratio can only be a rough estimate. A more accurate valuation metric could be a discount cash flow analysis. On average, PayPal could increase about 18% annually and in 2018, revenue increased 18%, operating income increased only 10.8% and net income increased 14.6%. We will assume that growth will slow down over the years - staring with 18% growth in the first year and after ten years, PayPal - due to its economic moat - will grow 6% for perpetuity. On this basis, we take the free cash flow of 2018. This leads to an intrinsic value of $100.14 and would make PayPal fairly valued. But we also have to acknowledge that these growth numbers are optimistic and growth could slow down much faster for PayPal if competition intensifies.PayPal is certainly a good business, with a strong 2-sided network. It is growing its network as the number of active accounts is still growing healthy in the double digits, and we can also argue, that the network is getting denser as the customer engagement as well as the number of transactions is increasing, which could be interpreted as people using different connections within the network more often. The resulting economic moat around the business will protect PayPal and add high levels of defensibility against other, smaller competitors entering the space, and the company is still market leader among its peers (in a narrower sense). But, unfortunately, PayPal is confronted with competitors that have even bigger and stronger networks. And considering the current valuation of PayPal, I would not invest right now. Mastercard and Visa also seem overvalued, but have a much stronger moat and would therefore be my preferred choice for an investment in a payment company."
4290329,104739,2019-09-07T13:44:50-04:00,PayPal provides digital wallet solutions and lies at the center of mobile and e-commerce.Partnerships and collaborations are extending the company’s ecosystem.Looking beyond the high PE ratio and valuation is attractive on a forward-based free cash flow multiple.,"Rapid growth and acceptance around the world has propelled PayPal (PYPL) to become a leading digital payment provider. Following its 'divorce' from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), we explore how PayPal has adopted a partnership approach to extending its ecosystem whilst adding a high level of service and value to its customer base.PayPal is a technology platform which facilitates mobile and digital transactions on behalf of customers and merchants. The business was spun out of eBay on 17 July 2017. In the second quarter of 2019, the company reported 277 million customer accounts, of which 255 million are consumers and 22 million are merchants. As indicated in the table below, user growth has been accelerating since the spin-out.Source: Company ReportsThis is possibly attributable to senior management’s emphasis on rolling out initiatives which drive customer satisfaction. For instance, consumers now have the choice of how to fund their digital wallets – either through credit cards, debit cards or bank transfers. Funding was previously a clunky process which involved direct wire transfers from bank accounts which served as a friction point for consumers and their bank partners. Whilst these measures risked reducing PayPal’s margins since direct bank account funding is costless to PayPal, it is a decisive measure to put the customer’s needs ahead of the business. Given CEO Dan Schulman owns over $58 million of stock, management is clearly well aligned with shareholders.On paper, this is a very good business. The company operates a two-sided network which benefits from classic network effects, such that the more people pay through PayPal, the more merchants are incentivised to offer digital payment through PayPal. When checking out on a website, consumers can protect their personal information as PayPal shields the merchant from accessing sensitive payment information, such as card details or bank account numbers. It is also quick to log into PayPal either through mobile or desktop than having to enter one’s card details. In short, PayPal serves a useful role in reducing friction at the point of payment. The recently rolled out “One-Touch” button further enhanced speed, allowing consumers to breeze through check-out. It also saves the hassle of having to enter a password. The company recently reported that 136 million consumers have adopted One-Touch.Finally, the service offers payment protection and dispute resolution to guard against fraudulent transactions.My interviews with vendors reveal that many merchants that have dropped PayPal have returned because of lost sales. According to ComScore, check-out conversion using PayPal measures 88.7% versus 55.3% for other digital wallets and 48.7% for all payment types.The company is not standing still. The acquisition of Venmo in 2013 was an early signal of the group’s ambition to dominate the payment and money transfer market. Whilst still a drag on free cash flow today, Venmo has proven a social phenomenon given it is the main way young people are sending each other money. Venmo processed $62 billion of volume in 2018, a year-on-year growth rate of 79%. Through the first quarter of 2019, run-rate volume expanded to $85 billion and generated $300 million in annual revenue run-rate. The company only started monetising Venmo in early 2018 and the unit now generates revenue from fees on instant deposits to bank accounts, a Pay with Venmo button on key e-commerce sites (available on sites such as Gametime, Shopify, Grubhub, Poshmark, Uber and Hulu).To further reinforce its durability, management has entered into strategic collaborations with other players in the payments ecosystem through partnerships and investments. During the first quarter, the group announced a deal with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to process payments on Instagram. Major issuing banks electing to partner with PayPal include Barclays (NYSE:BCS), Citibank (NYSE:C), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and American Express (NYSE:AXP). Each is seeking to improve the banking and payment experience for their customers. In October 2018, American Express signed a deal with PayPal to improve the digital payments experience for their customers paying with Venmo and PayPal and partners for loyalty spending and peer-to-peer transfers. This initiative will allow American Express card members to use membership reward points for purchases across the millions of PayPal’s online merchants.PayPal’s $750 million investment in MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), the ‘Amazon’ of Latin American e-commerce, allows for the integration of its payment services into the platform’s e-commerce activities, which should accelerate growth in the burgeoning South American market.PayPal generates over $3 billion of free cash flow annually which is set to grow significantly in coming years on the back of continued new customer adoption and mid-teens growth in digital commerce more broadly. Mobile commerce accounts for 41% of PayPal’s volume which exposes the company to high growth markets. Rather than distribute excess capital, it is expected that management will continue to make strategic investments and acquisitions. Trading on an estimated 22.8x multiple of 2022 forecast free cash flow, the shares offer good value given attractive future growth prospects.There is no shortage of payment solution providers all vying for a share of consumers’ digital wallet; however, PayPal has built the largest network of online vendors. Facebook’s Libra currency potentially poses a threat, though it is too early to quantify such a risk. Within peer-to-peer there is a massive land grab emerging involving Venmo, WhatsApp, ApplePay Cash and Zelle all vying to become the dominant cashless solution.PayPal accounts for 82% of the top 500 online retailers in the United States, dramatically higher than other digital wallet peers, including Google Checkout. Ultimately, the service enables a seamless payment experience for the consumer and merchant by serving both sides of the network effectively. The strength and potential durability of this value proposition may be underappreciated by investors."

Over the past month, which coincided with a strong correction of the US stock market, PayPal (PYPL) has fallen in price more than its closest competitors. This is a sign of overvaluation.Data by YChartsThe long-term price dynamics of a public company’s stock very often follows an exponential trend that acts as a specific average. And in this respect PayPal is not an exception:The company's stock price is now below this trend by more than one standard deviation. Technically, this means that PayPal's stock price is undervalued at the moment. On the other hand, such a situation indicates that PayPal shares are now under pressure and that will not necessarily weaken soon.The rolling annual total price return of PayPal is below the mean. But, as a rule, only a decrease below the standard deviation indicates bottoming.Technically, it’s too early to say that PayPal’s stock price has reached a clearly undervalued state.PayPal is a relatively young company but there are at least two strong dependencies that allow us to judge how balanced the company's market price is.Based on the relationship between the revenue TTM absolute size and the company's capitalization, PayPal's current market price is balanced:There is also a gradually emerging direct relationship between PayPal's revenue growth rate and the EV/Revenue multiple:In Q2, PayPal’s revenue TTM grew by 12.51%, YoY, which was the lowest result in the entire history of the company. But at the same time, the EV/REVENUE multiple is near its historical maximum. This indicates that the current PayPal revenue growth rate does not justify the current EV/Revenue multiple. It is worth noting that the analysts’ average expectations suggest an acceleration of the company's revenue growth rate in the next three quarters. But within the bounds of the proposed model, this is still not enough to ensure that the balanced price of PayPal shares will reach at least the current level.Within the bounds of the described relationships, one can't say that PayPal is undervalued now.Despite the recent fall in PayPal stock price, the comparable valuation based on the EV/Revenue to growth multiple has shown that PayPal is still expensive:Comparing PayPal through the EV/EBITDA to growth multiple, we obtain almost the same result:But maybe all this doesn’t tell the whole story, because the listed multiples are based on the historical data. So, let's look into the future.This is what we get by analyzing the P/S to growth (forward) multiple:As we can see, in this case, PayPal is overvalued by about 40%.Judging by the P/E to growth (forward) multiple, PayPal is undervalued by an impressive 90%:But the most interesting thing is that until recently the implied price had been corresponding to the actual price. This means that the average analysts’ expectations of PayPal's EPS in the next fiscal year have deteriorated in comparison to the average expectations of other companies on my list.So, we can state that PayPal is definitely more expensive than the main blue chips on the Nasdaq.I like to repeat that the stock market is best associated with a pendulum. It's rarely balanced, but inevitably comes back to the balanced state from time to time. A month ago, PayPal was definitely overvalued (and I had written about this five times). But based on my current analysis, I can't conclude that PayPal has already reached the balanced state. I think there should be another wave of correction."

The stock market, in general, is being hurt by macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties. Adding to the negativity, the most recent earnings report from PayPal turned out as a disappointment to investors.Nevertheless, the long-term fundamentals remain intact, the company has enormous room for growth, and the stock is offering an attractive entry point. For these reasons, the short-term dip in PayPal's stock looks like a buying opportunity for long-term investors.PayPal is now expecting revenue for the full year to be in the range of $17.6-17.8 billion; this represents a modest adjustment versus the company's prior guidance of $17.85 to $18.10 billion. Importantly, the new guidance still represents a vigorous year-over-year increase of 18-19% in revenue when adjusting for the impact of the sale of the Synchrony Financial receivables. PayPal actually increased earnings guidance for the full year, so profitability is no reason for concern.Management attributed this small adjustment in revenue guidance to three main factors: A delay in product integrations with big partners - presumably companies such as Uber (UBER) and MercadoLibre (MELI) - a delay in some price changes, and the negative impact from a strong US dollar on cross-border revenue, which accounts for nearly 20% of total revenue for PayPal.On the other hand, the numbers from the second quarter came in above expectations. PayPal has an outstanding track record in this area, the company has reported better-than-expected earnings in each and every quarter since the third quarter of 2015.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialAll of the key indicators continue pointing in the right direction. Revenue excluding the impact of the consumer credit portfolio and currency effects grew 19% year over year. Active accounts grew 17% and transactions per active account expanded by 9%. This shows that the company is both attracting more users and driving increased engagement among users.Total payment volume grew 26% on a constant currency basis, with mobile payment volume growing by an even larger 37% year over year. Venmo is clearly firing on all cylinders, with volume increasing by 70% during the quarter.Source: PayPal Investors RelationsIt's easy to miss the forest for the trees when you put too much attention on the short-term news. PayPal reduced revenue guidance for the full year, but this was mostly due to temporary factors. When looking at users, engagement, growth engines and financial performance, the business fundamentals remain as strong as ever.In terms of valuation, PayPal's stock is now trading at fairly reasonable levels. The chart shows the forward price to sales ratio for PayPal versus Square (SQ), Visa (V), and Mastercard (MA). After substantially pulling back over the past several weeks, PayPal is now trading at a considerable valuation discount versus other successful players in the payments industry.Data source: Seeking Alpha EssentialValuation needs to be analyzed in the context of other return drivers. A company producing strong growth rates and consistently delivering earnings above numbers expectations deserves a higher valuation than a business producing mediocre financial performance and underperforming expectations.But sometimes it can be challenging to incorporate the multiple factors into the analysis in order to see the complete picture from a quantitative perspective. The PowerFactors system is a quantitative system that ranks companies in a particular universe according to a combination of factors, such as financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum and relative strength.In simple terms, the PowerFactors system is looking to buy good businesses (quality) for a reasonable price (valuation) when the company is doing better than expected (fundamental momentum) and the stock is outperforming the market (relative strength).Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123The backtested performance numbers show that companies with high PowerFactors rankings tend to deliver superior returns over the long term, and this bodes well for investors in PayPal's stock. The company has a PowerFactors ranking of 97.8 as of the time of this writing, meaning that PayPal is in the top 2% of companies in the US stock market based on financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength combined.After a huge rally over the past year, the stock has pulled back substantially in the past month, and it's now testing the lows from June, which could be an important support level. The RSI indicator is close to oversold levels, which has provided attractive entry points in PayPal's stock in the past.Source: Think or Swim.PayPal has an impressive track record of consistently delivering solid earnings growth and profit numbers above Wall Street expectations. From that perspective, management has earned the benefit of the doubt, and the company deserves some credit when it says that any slowdown in growth should be only temporary and due to delays in product integrations.The numbers from the last quarter were certainly strong, and the company is a high-growth player in remarkably promising markets such as online and mobile payments.The network effect is a key source of competitive advantage in the industry, as consumers and merchants attract each other to the leading payment networks. PayPal is not only a well-established name in the sector, but it also has major alliances with many of the most important players in technology, financial services and the consumer sector.According to management, approximately 85% of all commerce transactions around the world are still made in cash, and the total addressable market for the company over the long term is worth nearly $100 trillion. Thanks to the power of the network effect, PayPal is in a strong position to substantially profit from such a massive opportunity over the years ahead.PayPal is a position in both my own portfolio and The Data Driven Portfolio, since I replicate such a portfolio with my personal money. The stock was purchased at $37 per share in July of 2017 and we now have a big gain of more than 180% on the name.In spite of such a strong appreciation, I think it still makes sense to hold on to PayPal's stock over the long term, since the company has enormous potential for growth and the entry price looks quite attractive. For those who don't have a position in PayPal, it makes sense to start building one at current prices and with a long-term horizon."
4279379,104809,2019-07-31T05:03:02-04:00,"PayPal's bulls talk about the growth opportunities, including Venmo monetisation and continued expansion of its financial eco-system (future revenue drivers).Bulls also speak highly of the increasing use-case of PayPal and Venmo which makes PayPal/Braintree a popular option as a payment gateway, revenue should still grow in the low teens.However, under-discussed is the increasing competition particularly from Adyen and Stripe for limited payment volume as well as from Square's Cash App whose use-case has expanded beyond Venmo.Valuation also appears high based on DCF and comparable metrics despite uncertainty around the timeline of continued margin contraction, increasing competition and slowing revenue growth.However, despite the over-valuation of PayPal, I still see it as an important player in our increasingly cashless society and will add at a more appropriate price.","This is part 2 of my two-part series on PayPal (PYPL). Part 1 was focused on understanding the trends in the overall digital payments industry as well as how it relates to PayPal. I also examined PayPal's business model and how it generates revenue from its various services and offerings.Part 2 will be centered around an analysis of both the bull and bear case and why I believe that PayPal is over-valued especially considering increasing competition, continued margin contractions and slowing revenue growth.Since 2014, PayPal has enjoyed YoY revenue growth of mid to high teens (15-20%), with stable operating and net income margins, approximately 15% and 13% respectively.Competition from payment gateways which facilitate payments in the e-Commerce & m-Commerce space.Stripe: known to be payment gateway for technological startups who deal mostly with online transactions.Adyen: Like PayPal & Stripe, it fulfills the roles of Gateway, Risk Management, Processing and Acquirer. It generally caters to big international operations (Nike, eBay, Netflix) which has allowed them to increase TPV from $10 billion in 2012 to $177 billion (159 billion euros) in 2018, 47% YoY growth.PayPal’s Pros & ConsCompetition from “providers of card readers for mobile devices and of other point-of-sale and multi-channel technologies”With its acquisition of iZettle, PayPal has made it clear that it is going after in-store payment processing (POS hardware and software) as it bolsters its current PayPal here offering. This would also allow PayPal to provide omni-channel payment processing/gateway for online retailers who also want to have an offline presence. However, this is a very crowded space, one where I don’t think PayPal has any real competitive advantage since there is no real demand to pay by PayPal in-store. Besides Square, there are also numerous other companies offering similar products such as Worldplay, Shopify, Vend, Wirecard, Stripe and Adyen, etc.Square: I believe that Square is the most appropriate competitor in this space especially because Square and PayPal have similar demographic targets – SMBs.Venmo’s competitors: Square’s Cash App, Zelle, etc.Square’s Cash App: closest comparison to Venmo though Venmo has the first mover’s advantage. Both started out as P2P payments but has since expanded to allow consumers to make both online/offline transactions through debit cards and act as an extension of the Square/PayPal eco-system of financial services.Weakness in high growth geographies leading to underperformance.Temporary margin contraction until at least 2021. Despite improvements in operating expenses (as mentioned previously), gross margins will see further contraction until at least 2021. While one of the tailwinds for PayPal is continued improvements in operating expenses as well as possible future margin expansions, this will probably not occur until 2021, if at all.*Those interested in the complete write-up please comment or message me."
4278627,103480,2019-07-29T10:10:52-04:00,"Shares of PayPal have dipped about 5% after reporting mixed Q2 results as well as offering a mixed guidance update for FY19.
        While PayPal boosted its EPS targets by about 6% for the year, it also slated its revenue forecast by nearly 2%.
        The company cited a delay in deployment dates for two new key partnerships, Uber and MercadoLibre, as one of the primary drivers behind its revenue cut.
        Investors should focus, however, on continued strong TPV growth as well as operating margin expansion rather than on short-term delays that do little to affect PayPal's long term thesis.","Payments giant PayPal (PYPL) rarely ever has a bad moment, but the company slipped after reporting Q2 results that beat on the bottom line but missed revenue estimates. The company's guidance update for the full year also mirrored this quarter's results - PayPal lifted its earnings forecast, while lowering its revenue outlook. Unsurprisingly, investors took rather poorly to the news, sending shares of PayPal down approximately 5% since reporting earnings.That's not to say, of course, that PayPal hasn't already had a banner year. The stock crossed $100 for the first time this year and is up 34% year-to-date, handily outperforming the S&P 500's own 20% returns. In my view, the temporary dip in PayPal is an opportune time to keep on loading shares of a growth company with plenty of momentum.PayPal's mixed Q2 and guidance slip alter very little about the company's long-term bullish thesis, which can be neatly summed up by the key points below:Stay long here and use any further dips to add to your position.Let's first dig deeper into PayPal's FY19 guidance update, which was the biggest factor causing investors to stir over this quarter's earnings release:Figure 1. PayPal FY19 guidance updateSource: PayPal 2Q19 earnings deckPayPal cut its full-year revenue forecast to $17.6-$17.8 billion, representing a constant currency growth rate of 14-15% y/y (and 18-19% y/y after netting out the impact of PayPal's sale of Synchrony Financial receivables). This is about 1.5% lower than the company's prior guidance outlook of $17.85-$18.10 billion.This revenue cut isn't due to fundamental business softness, however - which is the big red flag that has caused many other tech companies, particularly in the SaaS space like Docusign (DOCU) and Box (BOX), to disappoint on their full-year outlooks. Management backed up its revenue cut, with CFO John Rainey noting as follows on the Q2 earnings call:The partnerships referenced above are with MercadoLibre and Uber (UBER), and PayPal's CEO Dan Schulman noted that a deeper scope than intended on these projects caused the delays. Our key takeaways from the above: first, PayPal is undergoing a timing shift from the expected contribution of its new partnerships, and second, a stronger U.S. dollar is weighing on revenue - which is the case for virtually every U.S.-based company with a significant presence overseas.Neither of these drivers represent bona fide business weakness, so investors should view them less harshly. And on the bright side, this guidance update comes with a silver lining: PayPal's pro forma EPS forecast was lifted to $3.12-$3.17, which is 6% higher at the midpoint versus a prior range of $2.94-$3.01. Part of this guidance increase is associated with unrealized gains in investments (which is also not a material fundamental driver), but a portion is also due to the 100bps in operating margin expansion that PayPal expects to deliver through the end of FY19. It should be noted that PayPal's new EPS range represents a whopping 30% y/y lift over FY18 pro forma EPS of $2.42. We also note that PayPal's EPS growth performance in the first half of FY19 has been even stronger than the projected growth for the full year - 1H19 pro forma EPS of $1.64 is up 43% y/y over 1H18 pro forma EPS of $1.15. Considering also that PayPal tends to generate more EPS in the back half of the year relative to the first half, the fact that PayPal has already earned 52% of its full-year high end EPS guidance also gives us comfort in PayPal overachieving in FY19.PayPal's absolute P/E ratio of 36.5x, based on its updated pro forma EPS range of $3.12-$3.17, certainly looks expensive. But when we stack it up against the 43% y/y pro forma EPS growth rate that PayPal has achieved in 1H19, its PEG ratio stands at only 0.85x - marking an undervalued stock ripe for bulls. We also note many positive factors emerging out of PayPal's Q2 results, signaling strength in the company's core business that have nothing to do with the partnership delays expected in the back half of FY19. In particular, we note that TPV growth saw its strongest performance at 26% y/y in four quarters:Figure 2. PayPal TPV trendsSource: PayPal 2Q19 earnings deckBecause TPV is the underlying driver that dictates PayPal's revenue and ultimately earnings growth, this is the primary metric that investors should be watching. As per usual, Venmo is a huge contributor to TPV growth, with volumes up 70% y/y to $24 billion - representing 14% of PayPal's TPV.Another positive sign is the fact that PayPal managed to accelerate its TPV growth even as eBay, once PayPal's largest partner, continues to dwindle (recall that eBay is planning to defect to Dutch rival Adyen by mid-2020). in Q2, PayPal's eBay volumes declined 4% y/y and represented just 9% of TPV, down three points from 12% of TPV in 2Q18. Alongside payments growth, PayPal also achieved huge wins on the cost side this quarter. PayPal's transaction expenses as a percentage of TPV was 94bps, an improvement of 4bps relative to 2Q18. In addition, PayPal managed to grow non-transaction expenses by only 2% y/y last year. Overall, PayPal grew pro forma operating margin by 190bps to 23.2%, up from 21.3% in the year-ago quarter - well ahead of its full-year target of delivering 100bps of operating margin improvements. After normalizing for the effect of the Synchrony receivables sale, PayPal noted that operating margin growth would have been 300bps.Also worthy of note is the fact that PayPal delivered healthy 40% y/y growth in free cash flow to $1.03 billion, and its FCF margin of 24% was the best seen over the past six quarters:Figure 3. PayPal FCF trendsSource: PayPal 2Q19 earnings deckThe net takeaway for investors: traders reacted too sharply on PayPal's revenue cut, which effectively pushed revenue into FY20 and is more of a timing issue than a bona fide business slowdown. The core business is actually blooming: total payment volumes saw a slight uptick this quarter, while operating expense discipline led to huge EPS and free cash flow growth as well as an increase in the pro fora EPS forecast for the year. Stay long here and ignore the short-term noise."
4291944,41961,2019-09-16T23:08:06-04:00,"PayPal has trended down post recently reported earnings, falling more than 10%.Recent results were suggestive of timing problems in ramping a couple of meaningful partnerships which should be major contributors over time.PayPal has a competitively advantaged position in a market that is experiencing strong secular tailwinds.","PayPal (PYPL) occupies a very unique position in the payments and commerce ecosystem globally. Its early entry into the market has given the company a dominant position in online payments, one that isn’t likely to be easily displaced. PayPal will benefit from the ongoing secular trend toward increasing e-commerce volumes, and is complementing natural organic growth with some interesting partnerships that could auger well for long-term growth. PayPal stock has pulled back more than 10% recently, and the decline represents opportunity.PayPal’s very early entry into the online commerce market to solve consumer distrust in handing oversensitive card information to merchants that they didn't know has delivered a windfall to investors over many years. In solving a particularly acute problem for users of online commerce, the company has gone on to cement a very powerful network effect where increasing users attracted increasing numbers of merchants who were willing to accept PayPal. With over 267 million consumers using the service, PayPal has amassed a valuable consumer base, which online merchants are keen to leverage.Another unique aspect of the service is the relative decline in cart abandonment that merchants experience when implementing PayPal checkout. Transactions convert at a higher rate, almost 90% with PayPal versus other online checkout mechanisms. Due to this fact, merchants are particularly keen to pursue a PayPal implementation, something which further boosts the utility and value of the service to merchants. Finally, integrating different means of payment flow into a cart checkout experience is something that merchants are loath to do. The process is time consuming and disruptive to the aesthetics of the commerce experience. Thus, the likelihood of PayPal being displaced from any online checkout flow where it has already been implemented is relatively low.PayPal's acquisitions of Venmo and Xoom further extend the company's utility as a place to manage all the payment needs of a user and will serve to increase engagement and transaction volume flowing through the PayPal network. Venmo positions PayPal well with a millennial audience, and is commonly used for bill splitting by groups of college students sharing meals. Xoom is a money transfer service that is also getting very good traction amongst digital natives and competes with the likes of Western Union (WU). Both services will allow PayPal to meaningfully increase its base of users flowing into the PayPal ecosystem. With successful cross-marketing, users of these individual point services will no doubt leverage their PayPal accounts to complete a broad variety of payment transactions.PayPal reported healthy metrics around revenue growth and user engagement, yet has seen its share price fall close to 10% from the recent high. Revenue increased 12% on a constant currency basis, with user engagement per account (or ""account opens"") also up 9% per user account per year. The company shows no signs of slowing user account acquisition, with user account growth also increasing 17% year over year. These metrics all speak to the core health of the platform. Payment transactions and payment volume also both increased 25% year on year.Yet, in spite of this, PayPal made marginal cuts to revenue guidance, which was what largely triggered the slump in share price. This was explained away by management as a result of a timing hiccup in the implementation of partnerships with MercadoLibre (MELI) and implementation of the Uber (UBER) digital wallet.It would be a mistake to view the reduction in guidance as a start of some prolonged slowdown in PayPal's momentum. PayPal is riding the secular shift in the market from online to offline commerce, a shift that is still in its relative infancy. Growth is only expected to accelerate over the next decade toward online commerce, particularly internationally. Forecasts suggest retail e-commerce will grow solidly at a rate somewhere in the mid-teens over the next 4 years or so. With PayPal’s large embedded base, it is extremely well-positioned to capture a significant amount of this volume.Source: eMarketer.comPayPal is working on material partnerships with MercadoLibre and Uber, which should have meaningful implications for future growth. The joint collaboration with Uber to develop the Uber digital wallet should not only enable a more meaningful on ramp of new users into the PayPal ecosystem, but should over time spur tens of millions of additional transactions.Equally as meaningful is the equity investment and collaboration with MercadoLibre in Latin America. MercadoLibre is the dominant online commerce marketplace and digital payments player in the region. It has almost 300 million registered users in the Latin America region using its platform today, easily north of 50% of the total internet users in the market. Its Mercado Pago platform processes $6.5 billion in payment transaction both online and offline in the last quarter, and is the jewel in the MercadoLibre crown. PayPal and MercadoLibre are working on a number of initiatives which will enhance the utility of their respective services and increase network effects for both. Relevantly for PayPal, the effect of the integrations will allow PayPal account users to accept payments from MercadoPago account holders, and also allow PayPal merchants to accept MercadoPago payments. The impact of both of these moves should be to increase volume of payment flows over the PayPal network, but more significantly, to make PayPal much more relevant and dominant in Latin America and propel PayPal's growth in the region.At its current price, PayPal trades at roughly 30x forward earnings, while analysts expect average long-term EPS growth over the next 5 years at close to 18% annualized. This represents a fairly attractive entry point. Investors should see the recent hiccup in earnings as a mere timing issue associated with delays in ramping some key strategic partnerships, and consider this an opportunity to enter a solid network effect business riding secular tailwinds at an attractive entry price."
4291313,69175,2019-09-13T09:00:21-04:00,"Institutional investors collectively bought about 1.7% of PayPal's overall shares outstanding in the last 13F reporting cycle.18 of PayPal's 30 largest institutional investors maintained or increased their exposure to the payment processing giant.The company is posting operational and financial growth quarter after quarter, and it's yet to start showing signs of slowing down.In light of its strong operational performance and a relatively favorable valuation, PayPal is an attractive investment opportunity.","Shareholders of PayPal (PYPL) have had an extremely rewarding run over the past few months; its shares are up by about 50% from its 52 week lows. But the rally may not be over yet. Latest 13F filings data reveals that institutions actively bought PayPal stock in a price-band of roughly $103 and $117 per share in the last reporting cycle. This suggests that PayPal shares may have a significant upside from the current levels, or at least this class of sophisticated investors believes that there’s impending upside in its shares, which should encourage long-side investments in the scrip. Let’s take a closer look at it all.(Source: Bigstockphoto, Image license purchased by author)Let me start by saying that institutional investors tend to have a long-term time horizon. The sheer size of their positions can be huge, so much so that their trading activity can sometimes move the price of the concerned security. So, it just makes business sense for entities registered as institutional investors –hedge funds, mutual funds etc. – to invest in opportunities that offer a significant upside potential and have sufficient liquidity levels so that they can trade without moving the price too much.In the case of PayPal, institutional investors accumulated a little over 19.6 million shares over the last 13F reporting cycle. This figure may not mean much in isolation but it accounts for roughly about 1.7% of its overall shares outstanding. This is a significant degree of accumulation.(Source: Nasdaq)I dug deeper into the trading activity of PayPal’s 30 largest institutional investors and an interesting picture came to light. Only 12 of its 30 largest investors reduced their positions in the company. Out of those 12, 8 entities reduced their positions by 1% to 5%. This is perfectly normal in my opinion; it indicates partial profit booking as PayPal shares have been rallying of late. The remaining 18 entities either held onto their positions or they increased their exposure to the payment processing giant.(Source: Nasdaq)Also, its 8th and 9th largest investors, Nuveen Asset Management and Capital World Investors increased their positions by over 6700% and 680% respectively and they collectively bought over 33 million shares in the last 13F reporting cycle. I had to exclude their rate of increase from the chart below to preserve its scalability and readability. This highlights how bullish these investors are on PayPal.Moreover, these entities bought PayPal’s shares while they were still rallying. Institutions that bought PayPal’s shares during the last 13F reporting cycle – beginning on 1 April and ending on 30 June – probably believe that its shares are significantly undervalued and offer a material upside from current levels. Otherwise why would they go long on a stock that’s already breaching its 52-week highs?(Data from Yahoo! Finance, chart compiled by author)Note that the stock was trading roughly between $103 and $117 per share during this time window and they’re down to $102 apiece at the time of writing the report. This means that retail investors who plan to go long on the scrip, still have a chance to attain a similar cost-basis as the big guys. This leads us to the next question -- why is this class of sophisticated investors so bullish on the scrip?There are multiple reasons to be bullish on PayPal. For starters, it’s been adding new accounts to its platform and growing its payment volume consistently for the past several quarters now. There have been minor fluctuations in its growth rates, but the company has overall been able to grow its payments volume and active accounts by 20%-plus and 10%-plus rates, respectively, in the past 10 quarters.(Source: BusinessQuant.com)These growth rates are generally the norm in small companies. However, it’s quite an impressive feat in PayPal’s case considering that it’s already a sizable company with over 286 million active accounts, $172 billion in Total Payment Volume just during Q2 and over $125 billion in market capitalization.Secondly, PayPal isn’t priced at lofty valuations compared to some of the other prominent names in the industry. Analysts are forecasting PayPal’s revenues to grow at a faster pace than Visa or Mastercard, and yet the former is trading at a discount compared to the other mentioned names. So, it makes sense to invest in PayPal at the current price.(Data from Ycharts, chart compiled by author)Moreover, PayPal’s top-brass isn’t sitting idle and simply counting its achievements. The company has been actively involved in M&A activities. It acquired iZettle, Hyperwallet and Simility last year for a collective sum of $2.72 billion and there are no signs to suggest that PayPal would slow down on M&A.Its management noted during the last earnings call that “you can expect us to be acquisitive going forward. That will be a part of who we are on an ongoing basis.”Its management’s aggressive approach to growing their business both organically and inorganically has already resulted in a significant growth in payments volume and active accounts. So, it’s likely that PayPal’s management would continue pursuing this route to bolster their product, strengthen their market position and to keep growing, as it’s clearly working well for the company and its shareholders.Besides, traders and investors were skeptical about PayPal’s ability to grow its payment volume post the expiration of its operating agreement with eBay in July next year. But the company has posted significant growth in their non-eBay business (merchant business) so much so that the loss of eBay as a preferred partner is no longer a cause of concern amongst investors.(Source: BusinessQuant.com)To put things in perspective, PayPal’s payment volume from eBay stood at $15.51 billion in Q2 FY19. This figure is certainly huge when seen in isolation. However, the figure is comparable to PayPal’s overall payment volume growth of $11.36 billion between Q1 FY19 and Q2 FY19 alone. So, at best, PayPal’s eBay TPV is only a few quarters' worth of the company's overall TPV growth, which isn’t crushing news for its investors anymore.PayPal has been growing its operations at healthy rates in spite of its already sizable operations and the company as a whole is yet to start showing signs of slowing down. Its management intends to continue growing the business, by way of organic development and inorganic M&As, so I'm confident that its growth momentum would more or less remain intact going forward as well. So, it’s no wonder why institutional investors bulked up on PayPal in the last 13F cycle. Hence, I believe retail investors with a long-term time horizon should consider going long on the company.

4277050,104743,2019-07-24T11:24:00-04:00,PayPal remains bullish on the international markets and looks to tap the $110 trillion total addressable market opportunity across payments.Venmo monetization-related products represent a significant earnings growth driver in the long term.The company raised its full-year EPS guidance to $2.94 from $2.91 as a result of stronger TPV and capital returns from M&As.,"Image credit: Eric Piermont/AFP. Getty Images.There is a considerable opportunity for PayPal Inc. (PYPL) in the digital marketplace. The company has been quite successful penetrating the US digital commerce platforms and marketplaces and that opportunity outside the US is considerable and remains untapped.The forecasted 2021 total addressable volume of marketplaces not currently served by PYPL is estimated at $413 billion. It remains big even if Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and China's enormous marketplaces are excluded in the total addressable volume. Potential volume growth could translate to an 8% upside to PYPL's earnings if PYPL can maintain a 15% (or higher) penetration rate at a 2.0% take-rate.Industry players such as PYPL with global processing footprints are increasingly being required by regulators to build out and maintain redundant systems/platforms on a country-by-country basis to promote transactions monitoring. Hence, PYPL developed and introduced some innovative products to the market such as Venmo.PYPL remains bullish on the international opportunity. The company's strategic focus in terms of international growth is to increase existing user engagement in core non-U.S. markets such as Canada, Australia, U.K., and Germany. At the same time, in the Emerging Markets, the increasing net active users are the primary growth lever.The company looks at the $110 trillion total addressable market opportunity across payments, noting that market share is presently below 1%. PYPL expects global internet users could reach 6 billion (presently at 3.5 billion) in the longer term. PYPL hopes it can achieve 10% to 15% market share.According to a comScore online panel, PYPL online checkout conversion is roughly 80% higher than the e-commerce average. This statistic is 60% higher than other digital wallets, driving value for merchants and consumers that should continue to drive significant market share gains for the business (in addition to customer choice and partnerships across a selection of stakeholders worldwide).The top 100 online marketplaces in the world sold $1.86 trillion in 2018, up 23% from 2017. This accounted for over 95% of global marketplace sales. The majority of these marketplaces are located in North America (61 marketplaces of the Top 100). Asian marketplaces are disproportionately represented by sales volume largely due to Taobao, JD.com (JD), and Tmall.There are three Venmo monetization-related products: Instant Deposits, The Venmo Mastercard Debit Card, and Pay With Venmo. Market trends revealed increased progress on Venmo monetization. PYPL still expects that Pay with Venmo would eventually outpace Instant Deposit as the largest monetization contributor given that Instant Deposit is currently the biggest contributor to monetization based revenues.I remain positive on the Venmo monetization. It represents a significant earnings growth driver in the near term. Venmo monetization has already strengthened the company's strategic efforts, indicating 29% of customers have already taken part in the monetizable experience (up from 24% in the third quarter of 2018).After 2018, the company already had a revenue run-rate of $200 million with the contribution from Instant Deposits along with Venmo Card/Pay with Venmo split evenly. Venmo is still on breakeven, while it is not yet profitable on a standalone basis.Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research. Sensor Tower.Venmo remains to be an absolute driver of Total Payment Volume (TPV) growth over the next several years. Its merchant base remains underpenetrated at an estimated 18 million merchants globally. The product was only rolled out to 2 million merchants initially. PYPL generated $1 billion of instant transfer volume on the Venmo platform in September 2018, while taking into account the 1% fee for users.The company now expects greater than $100 million annual revenue opportunity. The user base of Venmo is skewed towards the millennials which provide a big cross-sell opportunity for businesses that were not previously customers but want to access Venmo's unique user-base. One good example, Venmo's dedicated button on Uber highlights the value of a consumer's ability to split payments with friends through the platform.Source: Barclays ResearchI noted that bank card issuers have already expressed interest in Venmo-branded credit cards. I'm sure Venmo-branded credit cards could represent another potential monetization.PYPL reiterated its 2019 revenue guidance of $17.85 to $18.10 billion translated to year-on-year growth of 16% to 17% (excluding the impact of forex risks). This revenue guidance compares with the analyst consensus estimate of $17.99 billion. Operating income was $934 million, slightly below the analyst consensus of $947 million due to higher non-transactional operating expenditures.The company raised its full-year EPS guidance to $2.94 to $2.91 (versus prior guidance of $2.84 to $2.91) with the analyst consensus of $2.88. The company manages the business towards the transaction and operating margins rather than take-rate.On the customer service side, the number of contacts to customer support decreased in that period as the company has introduced chat and implemented other efficiencies. This despite adding more than 70 million users over the last three years and increasing customer engagement across the overall user base.Source: Statista.In the first quarter of 2019, PYPL's net TPV amounted to $161.5 billion, representing a 22% year-on-year growth (+28% in the fourth quarter of 2018). Although the average payment volume (APV) declined by 4.8% year-on-year. TPV was generated through the 2.8 billion transactions which PYPL processed during that period. In 2018, the payment provider's annual payment volume came to $578 billion.Source: Company data. Goldman Sachs Global Investment ResearchAs the company's contract with eBay (EBAY) rolls-off in 2020, PYPL is on track to maintain a presence on the platform with its branded offering. Around 14% of PYPL's transaction volume today is generated by eBay. The company is still able to maintain some 35% to 40% of overall eBay TPV. The elimination of costs associated with unbranded processing including large customer service costs will then lessen the adverse impacts on margins.However, the existing operating agreement with eBay restricted PYPL's ability to perform business with certain marketplaces in varying capacities. As per existing agreement:Several eBay sellers (per forums) have now seen a large fall in sales after being moved to intermediate payments (which does not include PYPL as a purchase option).Meanwhile, the opportunity with Amazon is tough to assess. PYPL has noted in the past that they would like to be a payment option. Conversely, Amazon made it clear that the company is not hearing from its customers that they would like to use PYPL on the AMZN marketplace. The company is currently fielding its PYPL competitor, which is Amazon Pay, which may complicate the possible addition of PYPL as a payment option.PYPL generated $809 million in free cash flow in the first quarter of 2019. The company expects more than $3 billion in free cash flow (FCF) for the full year 2019.The company targeted $1 billion to $3 billion in M&A per year, with a capital return plan of 40% to 50% of FCF. The company maintains a positive outlook on its ""risk-as-a-service"" capabilities due to its acquisitions. Further, the acquisition of Swift Financial also bolstered PYPL's merchant working capital business. It will also sustain the required geographical exposure and cross-sell opportunities from the company's acquisition of iZettle.After the company announced the acquisition of iZettle, PYPL expects to have roughly $15 billion in cash available to invest in 2019. It is estimated to generate more than $4 billion to $6 billion in FCF annually over the next four years. With this level of capital, PYPL is targeting roughly $1 billion to $3 billion in M&A per year. Capital returns are expected to be around 40% to 50% of FCF.I anticipate a potential year-on-year 23% earnings growth over the next three years as a result of these M&As. The company is strongly positioned across mobile with considerable incremental growth opportunities in peer-to-peer (P2P) monetization, wallet, merchant adoption, Braintree, and recent partnerships like MercadoLibre (MELI). Its strong engagement levels on Alipay/Wechat in Asia would also achieve greater traction in payments.The company called out priorities for capital allocation as being higher returning growth opportunities. It involves organic/inorganic opportunities, including driving growth for the Synchrony Financial (SYF) acquisition or M&As that could tap a variety of potential attractive assets found abroad.PYPL acquired the $6.8 billion receivables of SYF including $5.8 billion of consumer credit card receivables and $1 billion in participation interests in receivables held by investors and Comenity Capital bank. SYF maintained its 20% operating income growth guidance in 2019.I believe that once a significant portion of its debt is offloaded from PYPL's balance sheet and SYF assumes responsibility of future debt issuances, PYPL will benefit significantly from: (1) risk reduction without credit on its balance sheet, (2) liberating $1 billion in annual FCF which was previously used to fund the debt and capital requirements, and (3) the opportunity to deploy the $6 billion in cash associated with strategic capital return.PYPL shares rose by 36% in the first six months this year and have more than doubled over the past 2 years. I noted that PYPL is extremely well-positioned to take advantage of all aspects of earnings growth around eCommerce, services, and digital payments.I also noted that the company's accelerating EPS growth rate from 2018 to 2021, substantial cash optionality and high FCF justifies a valuation premium to industry peers. Notwithstanding that the Venmo monetization is still an underappreciated growth opportunity.Trading at an EV/EBITDA of 24.8x, I recommend a buy rating on PYPL stock with a price target of $124/share.Source: FactSetTo recap, PYPL has made early progress in moving-up the payments experience of customers in an eCommerce transaction and reducing friction for consumers by introducing and innovating on Venmo monetization-related products.The Venmo monetization-related products have a strong potential for serving customers in financial services cheaper than traditional banks. The significant engagement levels on PYPL has much more traction to gain in socially-integrated payment systems.The company manages the business towards the transaction and operating margins rather than take-rate. PYPL is well-positioned to address its untapped and addressable market by building on platforms to improve scale efficiencies across payments, particularly as mobile commerce penetration increases.I believe that PYPL has one of the most compelling secular growth stories on the internet. I can see that the company is eager to invest in or acquire companies that advance its strategic agenda. I would not be surprised to see additional strategic investments or acquisitions to be made over the succeeding quarters. While the company reiterated its previous guidance on potential M&A allocations, I believe this would not prevent the company from doing a larger transaction given the right opportunity.With regards to PYPL's operating agreement with EBAY, I believe that the transition may take longer than expected. The PYPL brand remains at checkout on EBAY merchants through at least 2023. Transaction volume will be driven by consumer choice, while EBAY remains indifferent given the restrictions on its operating agreement with PYPL."
4277483,105265,2019-07-25T10:41:42-04:00,"Paypal reported solid Q2 earnings but was punished by the street.
        Paypal is a unique company combining secular growth, healthy financials, and an ideal capital allocation strategy.
        The sell-off presents an opportunity for investors of all time horizons.","We view Paypal (PYPL) as strategically positioned to win from very long-term growth trends of digitization of commerce and digitization of payments. We like the Management’s track record regarding strategic investments, capital allocation, and execution performance. Unlike the street, we view the Q2 results as a positive and that the sell-off presents an opportunity. We think that buyers of Paypal at current levels will be rewarded both in the short and long-term.Although Paypal reported a quarter which looked good to our eyes, the shares sold off +4% in after-hours trading. The quarter was marked by a slight revenue miss and a top-line guidance cut. Paypal reported $4.31 bn in Q2 revenue, just missing consensus of $4.33 bn by 0.5%, but showing 12% YoY FX-neutral (NYSEARCA:FXN) growth. FY 2019 revenue growth guidance was cut to 14-15% from the previous 16-17%. Management gave the sale of its credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony as the reason for the miss. They said that the sale caused a 7% headwind for the quarter, and 3.5% for the FY19 guidance. After adjusting for this, we see a solid growth profile in the report, and think that market gave too much weight to this one-off cost.Usual suspects of Paypal’s growth driving metrics were impressive as well. FXN total payments value (TPV) growth accelerated to 26% YoY from 25% in Q1. This was thanks to merchant services growth accelerating. eBay TPV was a drag on the quarter with a 3.5% YoY decline. P2P volume grew 40% to $46 bn and now represents 27% of all TPV while Venmo also had a stellar quarter, again, with 70% TPV growth reaching $24 bn. The underlying metrics of the quarter are exciting, especially considering the large base off of which Paypal is achieving the growth.Bottom-line performance was much more easy to judge with a strong beat and raise. Paypal reported $998 mn in operating income, beating the $964 mn consensus which raised the adj. operating margin by 210 bps YoY. The Company reported $0.86 for Q2 EPS, clearing consensus of $0.83, and Q2 2018’s EPS of $0.53. Paypal also raised its full year EPS guidance to $3.12-$3.17 from the prior range of $2.94-$3.01, consensus is at $3.12. The solid beat and raise wasn’t enough to help the shares.Paypal has key exposure to two very strong secular growth trends: digitization of commerce and digitization of payments. Despite all the news around transformation of retail, US Census Bureau data states that US e-commerce sales still make up just ~10% of total retail sales. The growth to 10% has been fueling the growth of Paypal to today, and will continue to do so for a long time. As this number keeps climbing, so will the digital payments space. This benefits Paypal both nominally, as its main commerce use is online, and relatively, as it has a higher e-commerce revenue exposure than its peers. Paypal is bound to grow due to higher portion of sales going online.Paypal is the leading provider of P2P payments services. P2P is the most convenient way to use money. The digital transactions don’t have the inconveniences of cash such as: lack of flexibility in splitting total sums, physical burden of carrying and not losing, physical and monetary burden of finding / using ATM’s, limitations of only being able to spend what you physically have on you, not being able to transact over distance, etc. As it is cheaper and more convenient, use of P2P payments is bound to grow. According to Forbes, Paypal is the single largest provider of P2P transaction volume (when assessing banks individually and not as a group), Paypal owned Venmo is high on the list as well. Paypal will see massive TPV growth from its P2P payments operations.Paypal has managed to combine its strong mid-teens growth rate (18.7% top-line CAGR for the past 3 years) with financials of an industry stalwart. Paypal’s operations are defined by high margins, excellent returns and cash generation. With 46% gross, 18% EBITDA, and 14% net margins, the Company is very good at carrying revenue down its income statement. With ROE of 15% and ROIC of 22%, Paypal earns good returns with its shareholders’ capital. It is also highly cash flow generative with management expecting $3 bn in free cash flow for FY19. The cash flow generation is supporting the fortress of a balance sheet which has a $5.85 bn net cash position.The Company has altered its capital allocation strategy to the benefit of its shareholders in May of last year and is executing on it. On the Q2 call, the Management reminded again of the 40-50% of free cash flow going to shareholders and $1-$3 bn going to acquisitions and strategic investments. Many investors criticize Paypal for buying stock too early in its growth cycle, and that they should invest in their future instead. We disagree. We think that Paypal has found a good balance between returning capital to shareholders and growing its business. We view Braintree and Venmo acquisitions as proof of management vision, and think that more capital allocated to investments than what management thinks is appropriate could be value destructive.The long term value proposition of Paypal is clear, and to our eyes, so is its near term performance. We think that the street was short sighted with the post-market sell-off and that investors should take advantage of the situation. We think that the price will recover in the short term and continue its business as usual of reaching new highs."
4274737,92456,2019-07-12T15:19:04-04:00,"There is excessive optimism regarding PayPal.Even on the basis of the extremely optimistic development scenario of PayPal, the DCF modeling does not justify its current price.I personally think that a certain bubble is going on here.","Recently, I have been observing excessive optimism about PayPal (PYPL). In any case, at Seeking Alpha, at least 10 recent articles on PayPal describe this company positively (with the exception of my articles). But I personally think that a certain bubble is going on here. To prove it, I propose to estimate the rational price of PayPal using DCF modeling.The quality of any DCF model is significantly determined by the quality of the revenue forecast included in it. So, let's start with that.A fundamental indicator of PayPal's future revenue growth is the dynamics of active customer accounts. And here we should admit that it has been growing with acceleration over the last three years. This is a sure guarantee that it is not worth expecting a considerable slowdown in the company's revenue growth rates in the near future.Against this background, I expect PayPal's revenue growth will continue to accelerate at least until 2021, and the CAGR will amount to 14.75% in the next 10 years:It is worth noting that my forecast of PayPal's revenue on the horizon for the next five years is higher than the average expectations of analysts:Source: Seeking AlphaMoving on to the Weighted Average Cost Of Capital of PayPal:To calculate the WACC, I used a one-year rolling beta coefficient, which is close to the absolute historical peak now:I proceed from the assumption that PayPal's beta coefficient will decrease in the long term. Accordingly, this will reduce the WACC.Over the last five years, the operating margin of PayPal has been 16% on average. There is no reason to believe that this figure will increase in the future. Firstly, speaking about a 10-year perspective, it should be assumed that competition in the digital payments market will inevitably increase. Secondly, PayPal is developing its ecosystem, embedding its services in the ecosystems of other companies. Such a business model does not, in principle, imply high profitability.Against this background, I assume that the operating margin will remain at the average level of the last five years. This scenario can also be considered an optimistic one.Further, I assume that CAPEX will remain at the current average level.And the model assumes only a gradual increase in the relative size of the tax rate to the average worldwide level of 25%.It must be admitted that all the input parameters of the DCF model correspond to a favorable development scenario of PayPal in the next 10 years.Here's the model itself:As you can see, the result is not satisfactory; the reduction potential is 43%.DCF modeling is exactly the tool that makes it possible to objectively estimate a company's value solely on the basis of its development trend. You must admit that I have considered a fairly optimistic version of PayPal's future, and even so its fair value within the DCF model has not even approximated to the current level.I don't want to be a bore at a party and spoil the festive occasion, but let me remind you once again that PayPal is an excellent company with excellent prospects, but it is overheating very much, and everyone who is buying its shares now is most likely to regret it in the near future."
4278554,92586,2019-07-29T06:28:39-04:00,"PayPal takes a hit following another ill-received earnings report and outlook revision - but I expect bearishness to subside quickly.Revenue-timing shifts and currency headwinds are not strong enough reasons to support the $7 billion loss in the stock's market value.PYPL has proven to be a ""storm-resistant growth"" name for its historical ability to rise without being as sensitive to the broad market's dips.","PayPal (PYPL) has briefly come under bear attack once again, just as it did for a hot second after the 1Q19 earnings release.Not unlike last quarter, softness in share price came accompanied by robust 2Q19 financial results. Although revenue of $4.3 billion fell short of consensus expectations, a rare occurrence for the San Jose-based fintech company, the miss amounted to less than $30 million. Adjusted EPS of $0.86 topped estimates by three cents, while the full-year earnings guidance was raised on the back of ""out-performance of the business in the first half of 2019"". Credit: Pymtns.comPayPal continues to be a strong double-digit grower across virtually all its key operating metrics: Net new active accounts increased 17% (matching last quarter's rate); total payment volume was up 26% on an FX-adjusted basis (vs. 25% last quarter); payment transactions spiked 28% (as it did in 1Q19); and Venmo maintained the impressive 70% growth pace in TPV. All put together, total revenue increased 19% after adjusting for the disposition of the consumer credit receivables portfolio, in line with guidance.The even-better news came in the form of adjusted operating margin that expanded an impressive 155 bps (vs. only 13 bps last quarter). There are a few factors at play justifying the boost in profitability, including what was likely an improvement in monetization of Venmo - e.g. instant withdrawal, Pay with Venmo, etc. But the key driver, in my view, is a scaling payments platform that is benefiting from robust expansion coupled with non-transaction expenses that were up a very modest 6% YOY in 2Q19 (after adjusting for held-for-sale accounting matters and 2018 acquisitions).Source: Earnings slidesBut none of the above seems to have mattered much for investors, who chose to dump shares on earnings day. The likely reason was PayPal's trimming of full-year revenue projections, from YOY growth of 16.5% to 14.5% at the midpoint of the guidance ranges, despite the 17-cent increase in EPS outlook (which, to be fair, was also largely impacted by sizable gains in PayPal's equity investments).The following quote, from the earnings call, better explains the top-line guidance cut:So, in summary, what appears to have been the key factors driving the 5% post-earnings drop in PayPal's stock price (other than maybe profit-taking) can be summarized as (1) delayed timing of revenue recognition and (2) unfavorable FX movements. I will respect opinions to the contrary, but it seems unreasonable that these two items should justify loss of about $7 billion in the company's market value over a couple of days.Following strong 2Q19 results, I maintain my bullishness towards the stock. I could make the argument that the company has maintained its growth momentum, with margin expansion materializing and valuations now looking a bit more de-risked. As the chart below illustrates, PYPL's forward P/E premium to Mastercard (MA) is the smallest that it has been in 2019 so far.Data by YChartsBut to explain why I like this name, I prefer to take a step back. As I have argued in the past, ""PYPL has proven to be a 'storm-resistant growth' stock for its historical ability to gain market value without being as sensitive to the broad market's dips"". I have no reason to believe that this dynamic will change in the foreseeable future, despite the eventual share price hiccups caused by concerned growth investors heading for the exits.For these reasons, PYPL remains one of the holdings in my model All-Equities SRG portfolio."
4272924,100666,2019-07-01T08:16:15-04:00,"Our 5-year-old daughter gets $150 per month for her Pink Portfolio.I buy stocks and update with an article when there are new stocks in the portfolio.I have added PayPal.PayPal has bought itself a whole family of apps and that gives it a lot of options for the future.In this article, we look at all the different services in the PayPal family.","In May 2016, I started up the Pink Portfolio for our little girl. She was almost two years old then and she has just become five on June 11. The system is quite simple: my wife and I add $150 per month for her portfolio and buy stocks with it. I focused mainly on dividend stocks in the beginning, but I have started adding growth stocks too and plan to add more.The last update that I have written is from April 2019. I promised to update the portfolio more often and that is exactly what I will do in this article since I have added a new stock to our daughter's portfolio. But before that, a little explanation about the Pink Portfolio itself.In May 2016, three years ago now, I set up the Pink Portfolio for our little girl. My wife and I are the proud parents of a wonderful five-year-old girl. She became five on June 11. When you have children, the ideal moment to start investing is from birth. But as is the case with many middle-class people, we don't have thousands of dollars lying around to invest for the apple of our eye. We decided to put aside $150 every month for her that we use to create her stock portfolio. For special occasions, such as her birthday, she gets some extra money from her parents and grandparents. Later, we might raise the amount, but for now, we keep it at $150.I chose to call her portfolio the Pink Portfolio because that is her favorite color, not that uncommon for toddler girls.(Source: artfire.com)I want to put a few things in context: I have a real low-cost broker (just $0.58 per transaction), and I live in Europe, which means that I don't really put the money aside for her education, because the system is different here and often (much) cheaper. So we don't have special plans for the money in the Pink Portfolio. It is really for her later life.This means that the time frame for this portfolio is really long: 20 to 50 years or maybe even longer, depending on what our daughter wants to do with it once she is an adult: make the honeymoon of her dreams, buy a house or use it to retire early.I am sure you all know PayPal (PYPL) and its core product. The company is best known for its online money transfer system and as a payment system for online merchants. The company then charges a fee and that is basically how it makes money. But first a little history.(Source)The company was founded in 1998 as Confinity, not as fintech yet, but as a security software company. One of the founders was the controversial entrepreneur Peter Thiel, who later became venture capitalist and also co-founder of Palantir (PALAN), which is also rumored to go public in this hot year for IPOs. The service that later became PayPal was developed inside of Confinity in 1999.Then Elon Musk (TSLA) comes into the picture. He had an online banking site, X.com, and the two companies merged. The name was changed to PayPal and the company came to the market in 2002. In that same year, it was gobbled up by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in a $1.5B all-stock buyout. In 2015, eBay spun off PayPal again and in February 2018, eBay even dropped PayPal as its main payment processor and chose the Dutch company Adyen. It says a lot about the power of PayPal and about how big it has become that the impact was rather small. From the Q1 2019 earnings press release:PayPal was a subdivision of eBay, but this child has definitely become bigger than its parent. PayPal was only split off from eBay in 2015, but it now has a market cap of $135B, while eBay, its former owner, has more than $100B less value at about $33B. The irony is now that PayPal has invested $750M in MercadoLibre (MELI), which you could call the eBay of South America, but with PayPal included, since MercadoLibre has MercadoPago, an online payment system.PayPal is both a technology platform and a digital payments service and it has a lot of users. From the Q1 2019 earnings press release:PayPal (the service) itself is the biggest and best-known product of PayPal (the company). But actually, PayPal (the company) looks more and more like a consortium. Next to PayPal it also has PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and iZettle. Let's take a look at all the parts and how they are doing.The legacy product, you could say. PayPal (the product) still accounts for the big chunk PayPal's (the company) revenue. For a rather mature service, it is still very vital. While revenue streams are not split out (except for Venmo), you can have an idea if you look at the total numbers of PayPal: $161 billion of TPV in Q1 2019, up 25% on an FX-neutral basis. That would have been 29% without the eBay impact. That is a big growth for such a large company. And the number of users keeps increasing. PayPal CEO Dan Schulman on the Q1 2019 earnings call:This is the total number of transactions over the years:(Source)As you can see, the total number of transactions is still increasing at a very high speed. Although the numbers have become bigger, there is no sign of the law of big numbers kicking in yet, which would mean that the growth would slow. But the big clients are not showing any signs of saturation so far:(Source: Q1 2019 earnings call slides)In Q1 2019, PayPal also announced a partnership with Instagram, which is very important in my opinion. It means that the payments from Instagram’s new checkout feature for shopping will be processed by PayPal. That will be a huge driver for more growth for PayPal.PayPal's total payment volume keeps increasing at a very constant rate in the middle to high 20s:(Source: Q1 2019 earnings call slides)I don't expect this trend to fall significantly. PayPal has years of solid growth left and that is exactly what I want to see for the holdings in the Pink Portfolio, with its very long investment horizon.The second product from PayPal that a lot of readers will know is Venmo. The payment app has become very popular, with 40 million active accounts already. For those who don't know Venmo, a short explanation first.(Venmo's logo, source)Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail started Venmo. The story goes that the final push to develop Venmo was that Magdon-Ismael had forgotten his wallet when he visited Kortina. He had to borrow money, but it was a complicated process to pay back everyone. So the two started working on a system that allows you to send money through mobile phones, first via text messages, later with an app. Venmo was bought by Braintree for $26M and later Braintree got acquired by eBay, PayPal's parent, for about $800M.Venmo is like a digital wallet. You can make your payments to people by using their phone number, their Venmo username or their email address. Your Venmo account is linked to your bank account, debit card or credit card. If you use the credit card option, you pay 3% of the transaction as a fee. You can also use the Venmo Mastercard (MA). The Venmo Mastercard is not virtual, but an actual physical card.(Source)Card purchases show up in the transaction history of a Venmo user and Venmo includes a social feed, both worldwide and personal. It looks like this:(Source)That basically means that everybody can see what you are paying for (but not how much). While a lot of disadvantages are not hard to find, mostly in privacy-related issues, there is a 'look-at-me-doing-this-cool-thing' element to it too, which a lot of millennials seem to like. The experience economy is hot and the more people see that you have paid in a certain fancy restaurant, the more some will like it. People who don't like it can make the transaction private, but most users don't do that. Just to show the informality: 30% of the transactions of Venmo include one or more emojis.Venmo is firing on all cylinders if you look at the payment volume it handles. This is a graph that illustrates the huge growth:(Source)In Q1 2019, Venmo processed $21B in TPV (total payment volume), up 73% YoY, still very high growth. Here too, you can expect high growth for years to come.As I wrote before, Braintree, that had bought Venmo, was itself acquired by eBay/PayPal for $800M in September 2013. In August 2015, PayPal also acquired Modest, a mobile commerce company, and integrated its products in Braintree.(Braintree logo, source)Braintree's product is mainly aimed at businesses. It provides online and app payments for them. It seamlessly links your shopping cart payment with your PayPal account and other payment methods, in Shopify (SHOP), Magento (ADBE) or other e-commerce platforms. Braintree was also an early bitcoin adopter: it already has a collaboration with CoinBase since 2014.Unlike Venmo, that can only be used in the US, Braintree has an international presence too: Australia, Europe, Canada and several South Asian countries, totaling more than 40.Here again, the numbers are not split out in the earnings reports, but in 2017 already, Braintree passed the 1 billion payments per quarter benchmark and PayPal still cites strong growth for Braintree. The estimates are that Braintree had a revenue of around $16B in 2018.Paydiant is another one of PayPal's acquisitions. It was bought in 2015 for $280M. This is how the company describes itself:(Source)Paydiant is cloud-based and within the PayPal family, it is important for new initiatives that could boost the other product's reach. Its revenue for 2018 was estimated at only $20M.(Source)Another acquisition of PayPal is Xoom, also bought in 2015 for $890M. PayPal described its acquisition like this back then:(Source)So, Xoom is focused on international money transfers. According to Owler.com, Xoom had about $176M in revenue in 2018.TIO Networks is another PayPal acquisition, this time for $238M and dating from 2017.(Source)TIO Networks is also a multi-channel payment processor, but it has its own niche too: telecom, wireless, cable and utility bill issuers. It's a Canadian company and is based in Vancouver. It has an estimated revenue of $1.1B for 2018.Another bought family member of PayPal is iZettle. This company is European and it is sometimes referred to as 'the Square (SQ) of Europe'.(Logo of iZettle, source)iZettle was bought in September of 2018 for $2.2B. It was founded in Stockholm, Sweden, just eight years before the acquisition. Of course, it's fintech. Similar to Square it also launched a mini card reader and software to help merchants with their payments. It also operates in Latin America. Owler estimates its revenue at $165M. On its website, it describes itself like this:One of the things I like in a company is optionality. It means that the company has a lot of possible ways to leverage its existing products. With Venmo, Braintree, Paydiant, Xoom, TIO Networks and iZettle, PayPal has bought itself an extended family with tons of optionality. Venmo shows that these things can take off like a rocket once the time is right.With all that potential under the hood, I thought PayPal was an excellent addition to the Pink Portfolio.After all the explanation, it is time to have a look at how the Pink Portfolio looks now. First, an overview of the performance of the previous picks:The first buy in the Pink Portfolio was Nike (NKE), as her favorite sweater of that period was produced by Nike. She still loves the brand and she already has her third pair of Nike sneakers, which she is really attached to and always wears on Saturdays for her (toddlers') gymnastics. Nike has performed well since the buy:The second buy was around her second birthday, and it was Disney (DIS) since she loved Mickey Touse (that is how she pronounced it back then) so much. By now, she doesn't only love Mickey and Minnie Mouse but also Donald Duck, Goofy, and especially Elsa and Anna, the two leading ladies from Frozen. I haven't told her yet that a second movie is coming later this year, because she would ask at least once per day.(Source)Disney had a jump recently when the streaming plans were revealed. And that was about time. The stock had not really done great since I had added it to the Pink Portfolio.I have also bought shares of Apple (AAPL) because my wife has an iPhone, which intrigues our daughter a lot more than my simple and much cheaper Android mobile phone.My wife and I are both real coffee addicts. We love coffee so much that we have a rather fancy built-in coffee machine at home. One of our daughter's favorite moments is when she is allowed to push the button to make her parents a great cup of coffee. Now she is almost five, she still really loves that ritual. As real coffee aficionados, we regularly change our brand of coffee beans, so our taste buds get new sensations. One of the brands of coffee beans we regularly buy is Starbucks (SBUX). So, that was an obvious stock choice for the Pink Portfolio as well.I also added V.F. Corp. (NYSE:VFC), the first dividend aristocrat in the Pink Portfolio. Our daughter still loves the Kipling brand (or actually especially the Kipling monkey), and she also has an Eastpak toddler rucksack. She used it for school, but now she uses it to go dancing on Tuesdays. Guess what color it is?(Source)In August 2017, I added Hasbro (HAS). I thought the maker of great games such as Scrabble and Play-Doh (there is the link with our daughter!) was worth more than the 11 points score of its name.As you can see, that stock hasn't really played out well yet. But I think Hasbro has a lot of intellectual property it can leverage.I have also added some growth stocks to the Pink Portfolio. I added Activision Blizzard (ATVI) in April of 2018. That is the worst performer so far:Here too, I don't worry too much. Activision Blizzard has a real strong portfolio of games and I don't see them getting disrupted any time soon.Match Group (MTCH), which I picked for the Pink Portfolio in August 2018, has done a lot better:And, my last pick before this one, Twitter (TWTR), was just in April. The graph doesn't say that much, but for completeness sake, I give it anyway:These graphs just show the return from the beginning. Some stocks have done better since I have added at lows, others have done about the same. Since I considered all positions as very valuable stocks for the long term, I don't mind that much for temporary underperformance.(Source: Compiled by the author; price = current price, purchase is average price of the several purchases per stock, cost is the cost of the broker, div py is dividend per year, prices: closing price June 28, 2019).As you can see, $150 per month (with extra bucks for birthdays and Christmas) can grow to a substantial amount. The total worth of the Pink Portfolio is already $9000. That is in less than 3 years, with a small amount each month. That is the power of compounding!A few remarks:Even with $150 per month, you can make a great portfolio. I will keep adding money to the Pink Portfolio and I intend to update you of every new purchase or on special occasions. I have added PayPal to the Pink Portfolio because the company has a great set of products and a lot of options to grow its products.If you want to see how the Pink Portfolio keeps growing, please push the ""Follow"" button.In the meantime, keep growing!"

Now, this figure does not reach 18% YoY.Proceeding from the current earnings forecasts, PayPal is more expensive than the key blue-chips of NASDAQ.","I think no one will argue with me that analysts’ forecasts exert considerable influence on a company’s market price. But the dynamics of these forecasts exert a still greater influence, and it is in this context that I suggest looking at PayPal (PYPL).Yahoo Finance provides regulatory data regarding opinions of more than 40 analysts on the EPS of PayPal in the current year and next year. I have been collecting these data for over a year, and now, I have the opportunity to manipulate them in many different ways.The following graph shows the dynamics of the projected EPS growth rate of PayPal in the next year. In other words, each point on the graph shows by how many percent next year’s projected EPS will exceed this year’s projected EPS:As you can see, the situation is not very optimistic. And, only in April, according to average analysts’ forecasts, the EPS was expected to grow by almost 21% YoY in 2020. Now, this figure does not reach 18% YoY.It should be mentioned that such a situation is generally not typical for the market. And, for example, on the contrary, similar showing for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL) (GOOG) have been going up lately:And now, we will do the following. We will calculate the P/E multiple for PayPal and a number of NASDAQ key companies using the projected EPS for next year. Let us adjust the resulting multiple for the projected EPS growth rate. The last operation is very important because companies are always in different points in their lifecycles.And now, let's compare PayPal based on the obtained multiples:As you can see, PayPal is very expensive. Of all the companies in my sample, only Microsoft (MSFT) has a larger multiple. But Microsoft is at least paying dividends, while PayPal is not.Now, let us look at the history of this multiple.It turns out that, over the past year, PayPal’s implied stock price based on the proposed multiple did not basically deviate much from the actual. But since March, the discrepancy between the implied and actual prices has been increasing, and by now, it has reached a seemingly critical ratio. In my opinion, this is a clear sign of overvaluation.Over the last few months, I have already written several articles on the instability of PayPal’s current price. This article is not an exception. But it is not because I am unfriendly to PayPal. On the contrary, I believe in the successful future of PayPal, and in 2016 and 2017, I persistently wrote positive articles about the company. But now, very many aspects indicate that PayPal’s capitalization has left behind its rational level, and probably, its further growth without correction or a period of sideways dynamics is unlikely."
4277238,104809,2019-07-24T17:14:58-04:00,"Understanding how PayPal is benefiting from secular trends in the larger digital payments industry.Examining the various PayPal offerings and services and how it generates revenue from them, which also showcases PayPal's increasingly sophisticated payments ecosystem.Exploring PayPal's value-add to both merchants and consumers which helps explain their popularity and growth despite increasing competition.","Digital payments is a booming industry, and PayPal (PYPL) has been and will continue to be at the center of it. PayPal's CEO Schulman said in Feb. 2019 that the digital payments industry could be a $100 trillion market. Currently, PayPal is an online payments company that processes ~20-30% of all e-commerce transaction volume globally (ex-China). Consumers and Merchants (particularly Small and Medium Businesses - SMBs) both love PayPal for its value-added services.More importantly, PayPal is in the process of evolving from a pure-play ""checkout button"" to a broader commerce solutions platform, expanding into numerous verticals (e.g. in-store payments, B2B, loans to Businesses) organically and through M&A. According to management, their goal is to become the de facto operating system for mobile and digital commerce around the world, serving the entire payments ecosystem.I will be dividing my write up on PayPal into 2 parts. The first is more factual dealing with the trends in the Payments Industry that affect PayPal followed by PayPal's business model and understanding how it generates revenue from its various services. Finally, I will be discussing what I believe are the value-add in using PayPal's services for both merchants and consumers despite the increasing competition in its online payments business and the crowded space of its new offerings. Part II will focus more on the growth drivers of PayPal, how it matches up to its various competitors and a valuation of PayPal.Listed below are some general trends in the digital payments industry that will affect PayPal's business.1. Increasing proliferation of digital payments (merchant and user). Payments that were location bound are now device enabled. In a world of PayPal, Venmo, Stripe, and Square (NYSE:SQ), there are countless ways that individuals and small businesses can accept payments. Not only can anyone accept cards now, but also they can do it from anywhere. All it takes is connectivity and a portable card reader to create the next-generation point of sale. This has resulted in a trend away from cash-based transactions; according to McKinsey, cash-based transactions have fallen from 89% to 77% of the world's transactions.Another reason for the increased use of digital payments is the rise in e-commerce, with e-commerce expected to account for 13.7% of all retail sales in 2019. This has directly benefited digital payment processors and platforms such as PayPal which has consistently increased total payment volume, reaching $578 billion in 2018. But this pales in comparison to China where according to Caixin, mobile payment transactions reached $41.51 trillion in 2018 with Alipay and WeChat Pay controlling more than 90% of the market.2. Increasing importance of Gen Z and their preferences (mobile payment/banking). GenZs gravitate to mobile banking apps. 69% use them daily or weekly vs. just 17% of Baby Boomers. This confirms a massive generation gap in accessing banking services that will continue to widen. Intrigued by digital tools that manage payments, bills, expenses, and personal finance, GenZs want their mobile wallets to think for them and are not satisfied with just traditional bank offerings. The increasing popularity of mobile payment/banking in the US is seen by the increased searches for Apple Pay, Venmo, and Square's Cash App over the years (as seen below).3. Increasing importance of value-added services (as differentiating factor). Users now want services that can do everything and not be limited to just payments or banking. The app will be used more and be monetised more effectively if there are more services which will hence bring in users. This can be seen through Accenture's survey that indicates about 70 percent of Millennials and GenZs are interested in value-added services such as digital payments advisory and expense management services that can give them a better understanding and control of their personal spending. This is a clear signal that payments have moved beyond the transaction. Users are also differentiating financial service apps through rewards. Banks, card companies, and retailers are locked in a battle of wills - and significant investments - as they introduce one-up premium rewards cards that extend rewards value. This unsustainable friction between rewards and interchange fees means two things. First, the traditional rewards model is at or close to peak. Second, it is time for a new rewards playbook. The increasing importance of having more value-added services in one's network has meant that collaboration is bigger and bolder than ever before. This is reflected in PayPal's recent developments which saw the launch of additional value-added services as well as numerous partnerships and acquisitions announced.Source: PayPal4. Higher margins/efficiencies for digital wallets/payments. Digital wallets have the potential to usurp the concept of traditional banks and bank branches due to the high costs of acquisition for traditional banks. The lower costs of acquisition mean that digital wallet companies are then able to be profitable in offering services for the traditionally unbanked.Source: Ark InvestmentDigital wallets for the unbanked. Digital wallets such as PayPal's Venmo and Square's Cash App are becoming increasingly popular among the unbanked. They are able to offer checking-account like banking products to customers with low account balances and shorter life cycles whom traditional banks cannot accept without incurring losses. Ark Investment's research shows that traditional banks which have an average customer acquisition cost (CAC) of around $925 can only be profitable when the initial deposit is over $6,000, thus they are unable to profitably serve the 20 million unbanked Americans.Source: Ark InvestmentPayPal derives its revenue largely from processing customer's transaction in online transactions (C2B) but, in recent years, has expanded its ecosystem through offering more value-added services and has entered the C2C and B2B payments industry. A brief overview of PayPal's services offered and how it derives revenue from these services can be found in the below table.As can be seen, PayPal has an increasingly diversified suite of financial services to offer both merchants/businesses as well as consumers. When compared to other alternative payment services and apps, PayPal's breadth of services in its ecosystem is also impressive. As highlighted in yellow, PayPal which should be considered a payments company also has a numerous lending products.It also appears that PayPal's revenue seems to be derived from transaction fees charged to merchants while consumers generally have to pay for significantly less.PayPal is not the only digital payments processor nor is it the only alternative payment method. It is facing increasing competition in its original business (online C2B payments) and is entering crowded spaces with its recent entry into B2B payments, C2C payments, lending to businesses, remittance, and offline POS services.Hence, it's important to discuss PayPal's value-add to merchants in both its original business as well as its new businesses.PayPal's value-add to merchants:Source: comScoreSource: Business InsiderPayPal has picked up the slack of traditional banks who since the 2008 Financial Crisis have hesitated to loan to small businesses. According to the Funding Circle (P2P lending), ""SMB lending accounts for just 0.7% of the overall balance sheets of U.S. banks."" These loans have been incredibly beneficial to SMBs in growing their businesses. Small businesses tapping PayPal for a working capital loan saw an average 24% increase in growth with 82% of the businesses that experience growth seeing it in the first three months after accessing the loan... on the business loan front, PayPal said borrowers saw an average growth rate of 21% after borrowing the money with 88% of recipients seeing the growth in the first three months after accepting the loans. Furthermore, now that you can receive a PayPal Business debit card from Mastercard (NYSE:MA) to use your PayPal balance, it seems that for SMBs, PayPal's various offerings are comparable to that of traditional banks.PayPal's value-add to consumers:Source: Statista"
4267623,92456,2019-05-31T15:00:16-04:00,"PayPal, like any other company, should be evaluated through the prism of its growth.PayPal’s revenue growth has slowed to a minimum, but at the same time the EV/REVENUE multiple has reached its maximum.The growth rate of PayPal’s EBITDA is close to its historical minimum but the EV/EBITDA multiple is one step away from its historical maximum.","Of all the results in PayPal’s (PYPL) latest financial report, I want to draw your attention only to two which, in my opinion, leaving no alternative, indicate that the company is overvalued in the short term.If asked which value driver has the greatest impact on multiples investors are likely to answer ‘growth’. It is growth that largely determines a company’s relative value displayed by the size of its multiples. And this is more a statistical fact than my personal belief.PayPal is a relatively young company, and there is already a direct relationship between the revenue growth rate and the EV/REVENUE multiple:In Q1, PayPal’s revenue TTM grew by 15.14% y/y, which was the lowest result in the entire history of the company since it became public. But at the same time, the EV/REVENUE multiple is at its historical maximum, which clearly exceeds the balanced level within the bounds of this relationship.It seems nonsensical; PayPal’s revenue growth has slowed to a minimum, but at the same time the EV/REVENUE multiple has reached its maximum. And this is particularly puzzling in view of the fact that the average analysts’ expectations do not indicate a high probability of a considerable acceleration in PayPal’s revenue growth rate over the next five years:Source: seekingalpha.comBy the way, in this connection, it is appropriate to compare PayPal with Facebook (FB), whose growth is also slowing. Facebook's EV/REVENUE multiple is also at a level close to 8x, but at the same time, the company’s revenue TTM growth is twice as high as PayPal’s:Now let’s look at PayPal’s EBITDA TTM in terms of its growth rate:We see a similar situation here; the growth rate of EBITDA TTM is close to its historical minimum and, at the same time, the EV/EBITDA multiple is one step away from its historical maximum.Last month I wrote two articles about PayPal, both with negative outlooks. Today I repeat that thesis: PayPal might be a great company, but a study of these valuation metrics suggest it is overvalued."
4263957,102764,2019-05-14T15:49:27-04:00,PayPal is delivering extraordinary financial performance.The company is implementing a smart strategy for long-term growth in the years ahead.Valuation levels are not excessive at all for such a strong business.,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is producing vigorous revenue growth and expanding profitability levels. Moving forward, the company is planting the seeds for sustained growth over the long term via alliances and acquisitions in different segments with abundant potential. Importantly, valuation levels are still fairly reasonable for such a high-quality business.PayPal is clearly on fire. Both the financial and operational indicators for the business look remarkably strong as of the first quarter of 2019.Revenue reached $4.13 billion, growing by 12% year over year. The completion of the sale of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony (NYSE:SYF) in July 2018 negatively affected revenue growth by 7% during the quarter.Adjusting for 2018 acquisitions, operating income would have grown 16%, and operating margin would have expanded 110 basis points in the quarter. PayPal retained a healthy 20% of revenue as free cash flow during the period.Total Payment Volume grew 25% year over year, reaching $161 billion.Source: PayPal Investors RelationsThe company ended the quarter with 277 active accounts, growing 17% year over year. Payment transactions per active account grew 9%, so the company is both gaining more users and generating more transactions per user over time.Over the past several years, PayPal has built strategic partnerships with big tech players such as Apple (AAPL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Facebook (FB), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) as well as card processors like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Similarly, the company is also building alliances with the big banks, including names such as Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan (JPM), and Bank of America (BAC) among many others.Source: PayPal Investors RelationsBuilding these alliances means that PayPal is making a smaller profit on every transaction on the transactions that go through the company's partners. However, the management is doing the right thing by prioritizing long-term growth opportunities above short-term profit margins.Importantly, even if margins per transaction are declining with these alliances, the company gets to leverage operating costs on a larger revenue base, so overall profit margins for PayPal keep moving in the right direction.PayPal has recently extended its partnership with Facebook to support the payments infrastructure for Instagram shopping, which will allow users on the platform to pay in context using their PayPal account or with other financial instruments. Instagram is an entirely visual platform with plenty of potential in online shopping over the long term.PayPal has also invested $750 million in MercadoLibre (MELI), the leading e-commerce and digital payments company in Latin America. The two companies have plans to enter into a commercial agreement in order to establish initiatives to strengthen their networks, and this alliance with MercadoLibre will accelerate PayPal's growth in Latin America while providing plenty of opportunities to generate expanding cross-border volumes in the future.PayPal's social payments platform, Venmo, looks like a powerful growth driver in the years ahead. Venmo's total payment volume increased 73% year over year to $21 billion last quarter, and management believes the business is on track to generating $100 billion in TVP in 2019.Source: PayPal Investors RelationsIn January, PayPal reported that Venmo had an annualized revenue run rate going into 2019 that exceeded $200 million. The annual revenue run rate coming out of the first quarter of 2019 exceeded $300 million and strong user growth is pointing towards sustained revenue expansion in the coming months.In simple terms, PayPal is doing remarkably well, and the company is well positioned for sustained growth in the years ahead. The main question for investors is whether the valuation is still reasonable or the stock is already too expensive. Looking at the company's cash flow generation capabilities, PayPal does not look excessively priced at all.The discounted cash flow valuation of PayPal stock is based on the following assumptions.Based on these numbers, we can reach a fair value estimate of $129 per share for PayPal, which implies a 20% discount versus current prices.These kinds of estimates should always be taken with a big grain of salt, because forecasting long-term growth rates for any business always carries a large margin of error. But the main point is not forecasting free cash flow generation with a high degree of precision, the idea is assessing if the stock is reasonably priced based on conservative estimates of free cash flow generation.Revenue growth excluding the sale of the receivables portfolio to Synchrony would have been 19% last quarter, and total payment volume increased 25% year over year. In addition to this, profitability is expanding, so free cash flow is growing at a faster rate than revenue.Considering these factors, it's not too hard to envision a scenario in which PayPal could easily surpass the growth expectations embedded in the discounted cash flow analysis. This would mean that the stock would be even more undervalued than what the numbers are currently indicating.Valuation should always be analyzed in its due context. A company with superior financial performance and strong fundamental momentum obviously deserve higher valuation levels, there is not much discussion about this. However, it can sometimes be difficult to incorporate the different quantitative metrics in a single tool.The PowerFactors system is a quantitative algorithm available to members in The Data Driven Investor. This system basically ranks companies in a particular universe according to four quantitative return drivers: financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.PayPal is the top 2% of stocks in the US market, with a PowerFactors ranking of 98.22. The stock also has elevated rankings across the four dimensions considered: quality (94.45), value (76.57), fundamental momentum (85.78), and relative strength (96.36).Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123According to the backtested performance data, companies with the strongest quantitative rankings tend to generate superior performance in the long term.Backtested performance does not guarantee future returns, and quantitative algorithms should always be interpreted with caution. The data shows that a group of companies with strong quantitative metrics tend to outperform the market over the years. However, this does not really tell us much about what kind of performance a particular company such as PayPal will deliver in a specific year such as 2019.That being acknowledged, it's good to know that the numbers are pointing towards further upside potential in PayPal stock over the middle term."
4267255,105096,2019-05-30T10:02:04-04:00,"PayPal has grown strongly since its 2015 spin-off, and management's medium-term outlook envisages a further period of strong growth.However, the stock is more expensive than it seems, with high stock-based compensation costs excluded from non-GAAP figures presented.Growth has been capital-intensive, with large spend on acquisitions and loan receivables; the pending loss of eBay business will be a headwind.We prefer Mastercard as a better investment in the payments space, given PayPal has not been disruptive to existing card companies.At $111.74. PayPal shares are on a 46.1x P/E on non-GAAP EPS (65.3x on GAAP EPS) and 1.7% FCF Yield. Our recommendation is Neutral.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has grown strongly since its 2015 spin-off from eBay (EBAY), with its Total Payment Value (""TPV"") growing at a CAGR of +25.3% and its net revenues growing at a CAGR of +17.8% during 2014-18 (as shown in the charts below). Management's medium-term outlook envisages a further period of strong growth, with revenue CAGR of 17-18%, an ""expanding"" operating margin, and an EPS CAGR of around 20% in the next 3-5 years (see below).However, we believe that PayPal stock is more expensive than many investors think and that incumbent payment provider Mastercard (MA) offers a better risk/reward profile (see my article on Mastercard in April). This is due to a number of reasons, which we will explore below.One of the key reasons that PayPal stock is more expensive than it seems is that both management and many investors focus on non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) figures, which do not include the costs of stock-based compensation.As shown in the example slides below, non-GAAP figures typically form the centrepiece of results and guidance that management present to investors:However, among the non-GAAP adjustments, the largest one by far is the exclusion of stock-based compensation costs, as shown on the left below. In 2018, stock-based compensation costs were $920m, or 27% of the non-GAAP operating income; and they were similarly significant in preceding years.We believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation costs gives a misleading impression of earnings, as stock-based compensation dilutes shareholders' ownership of company earnings and, thus, represents a real cost to them.PayPal's non-GAAP EPS is typically around 30% higher than its GAAP EPS and 40% higher in 2018 (as shown on the right below). For 2018, non-GAAP 2018 EPS of $2.42 implies a P/E of 46.1x at the current share price; but GAAP EPS of $1.71 implies an even higher P/E of 65.3x.Another reason that PayPal stock is more expensive than it seems is that a large part of the earnings is being spent on acquisitions, loan receivables, and minority investments. This means PayPal's growth is quite capital-intensive, and only a minority of the Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") is distributed to shareholders.PayPal's historical net income and shareholder distributions are shown side by side with Mastercard's below, with PayPal comparing unfavourably:The reason PayPal shareholders receive less of its earnings is the company's large spending on acquisitions, card receivables, and minority investments. PayPal's net acquisition spend and loans receivables balance are shown below:PayPal has been an active acquirer, spending $2.1bn net on acquisitions in 2018 alone (primarily, the acquisition of iZettle). It is also funding an aggressive expansion of lending to customers, with its loan receivables balance up $1.2bn year on year in 2018. Loan receivables have historically grown at a fast pace, though the U.S. consumer portfolio was sold in 2017.In addition, PayPal has been making large minority investments, especially in marketplaces. In 2019 year to date, it has invested $500m in Uber's (NYSE:UBER) IPO, and another $750m in MercadoLibre's (NASDAQ:MELI) IPO.The high spend on acquisitions is set to continue. Management's medium-term outlook explicitly assumes $1-3bn of M&A spend each year, and only 40-50% of the FCF will be available for capital return (and some of this will merely offset the dilution from share-based compensation discussed above).PayPal's earnings growth thus needs to be considered in the context of the high capital intensity required to achieve them, as well as the limited extent to which shareholders actually benefit from earnings being distributed.Another reason that PayPal stock is more expensive than it seems is the pending loss of its existing eBay relationship, by far its largest source of revenues, in 2020.As announced in 2018, eBay has decided to ""intermediate"" payments on its platform once its current agreement with PayPal expires. This means that eBay will itself serve as the link between its merchants and shoppers, a role hitherto performed by PayPal. eBay with be partnering with payment processor Adyen (OTCPK:ADYYF). PayPal will be just one of the payment options on eBay, alongside others.eBay is far PayPal's most important partner, worth 11% of its TPV and 17% of its revenues in 2018 (management does not disclose the profit contribution). While eBay's contribution in PayPal's mix has been shrinking (as shown below), it may still be as much as 10% of PayPal's revenues in 2020.While the pending loss of the eBay revenues may not be total and has been included in management's medium-term outlook, it does make achieving the outlook harder.One reason we believe PayPal does not offer the best risk/reward profile in payments is that it has not proved disruptive to existing card companies like Mastercard and Visa (NYSE:V).While PayPal's volume growth materially exceeds that of Visa and Mastercard, Visa and Mastercard have continued to achieve respectable growth rates, and their volumes still dwarf PayPal's:(Note: Visa growth rates in CY17H1 are not shown, as they are not meaningful with the acquisition of Visa Europe in 2016; volume figures are in dollars, so growth appears smaller in 2015 due to the dollar strengthening then.)Nor is PayPal materially undercutting card companies in price. PayPal's transaction take rate (what it charges each transaction) has been above American Express's (AXP) merchant discount rate until recently, as shown below. (American Express is used for comparison because it is an end-to-end platform like PayPal, and because it charges more than other card companies.)And, PayPal's transaction take rate decline is not due to price cuts but is instead largely due to mix, with a falling share of higher-margin eBay and cross-border volumes and a rising share of lower-margin peer-to-peer volumes.Far from being a disruptor, PayPal has been partnering with card companies and banks (including both Visa and Mastercard since 2016), as shown below. Where PayPal has been issuing credit and debit cards, these have been on the Mastercard network. It also pays out about 35% of its revenues to banks and card companies in ""transaction expenses"", mainly to draw customer funds.Another reason we believe PayPal does not offer the best risk/reward profile in payments is because its growth is largely incremental to the industry.PayPal's growth is largely incremental because it often comes from new areas such as marketplaces, small businesses, and peer-to-peer (""P2P"") payments. This is a natural result of where PayPal's competitive strength is - its end-to-end 2-sided platform, which provides more contextual knowledge of the parties involved and allows it to deal more easily with parties which were hitherto too small to be served by card companies and banks.Marketplaces are particularly relevant, given the large number of small merchants involved. PayPal's largest partner has been eBay, and many of its next top 20 partners are also marketplaces, as shown below. In 2018, the top 20 partners after eBay were 15% of PayPal's TPV, having grown 41% year on year, vs. 27% for all other non-eBay partners.Another reason that PayPal stock is more expensive than it seems is the headwind it faces as its transaction take rate declines while its transaction expense rate remains flat, as shown in the left below. This means that, for each incremental new dollar in volume, PayPal has been receiving less revenues but incurring the same transaction expenses. The decline in transaction take rate has been due to mix (as described above).PayPal has kept flat or slightly-rising margins by reducing its other expenses margin, and it guides to an expanding margin over the next 3-5 years. However, a transaction take rate that is falling while the transaction expense rate stays flat is an unfavourable sign of PayPal's business model.At $111.74, PayPal shares are trading on 46.1x P/E relative to its 2018 non-GAAP EPS of $2.42 (but 65.3x on GAAP EPS). Management's FCF figure was $3.15bn for the year, excluding the one-off sale of the U.S. consumer loan receivables (as shown below); subtracting $853m in share-based compensation costs, the ""real"" FCF is $2.30bn, implying a 1.7% yield. We regard both the P/E and the FCF yield as expensive.By comparison, Mastercard shares (at current price of $251.48) are about 15% ""cheaper"", on a 39.1x P/E and a 2.1% FCF yield (on 2018 figures).In terms of medium-term EPS growth, PayPal medium-term outlook is for a CAGR of around 20% while MA is for ""high-teens"" (as shown below).If PayPal were to achieve its 20% EPS CAGR outlook and also to maintain its current valuation multiple, then the 20% EPS CAGR would translate into a 20% p.a. return for investors. However, we are concerned that PayPal's high valuation multiples are more vulnerable to a de-rating.Compared to Mastercard, simplistically, a difference of 5% in growth rates and one of 15% in current valuation multiples means that it would take 3 years of growth for the two companies' valuation multiples to catch up.PayPal has demonstrated strong growth since its 2015 spin-off and will be an integral part of the wider payment ecosystem. However, the stock is more expensive than many investors think, due to high stock-based compensation costs, high capital intensity (in acquisitions, loan receivables and minority investments), and the pending loss of the eBay business in 2020.At $111.74, PayPal is trading on a 46.1x P/E on 2018 non-GAAP EPS (65.3x on GAAP EPS) and a 1.7% FCF yield - which we regard as expensive. The shares would generate an investor return of 20% p.a. if PayPal were to deliver on management outlook and also retain its current rating, but the stock may be vulnerable to a de-rating.Existing payment providers like Mastercard have also shown strong growth, with little disruption from PayPal. Ultimately, we prefer Mastercard for being slightly cheaper and carrying less risk, albeit with lower growth. Our recommendation on PayPal is Neutral."

Some readers of my previous article found it questionable as to whether PayPal can sustain this.In the most recent earnings report for Q1 2019, we can see that growth in net income and earnings per diluted share has grown at a significantly faster pace than that of Q3 2018 - up by a respective 31% and 34% compared to the 15% and 17% growth seen in the prior quarter (on a year-on-year growth basis).However, this comes with a caveat as PayPal's effective tax rate for Q1 2019 stood at 7%, which is quite less than the 18.2% for Q3 2018. Additionally, the year-on-year growth in total payment volume has decreased slightly to 22% from a prior 24%:Source: PayPal Q1 2019 ResultsIn this regard, PayPal is still growing at a fairly consistent rate relative to last October. Total payment volume growth still remains quite high at 22%, but growth in this metric is showing signs of levelling off. It is noted that the company does not report growth in free cash flow for the most recent quarter, but for the purposes of simplification, I will make the assumption that free cash flow growth would be set to continue at approximately 20% given the growth in total payment volume and earnings.However, I admit that using free cash flow as a metric to measure PayPal's growth might not have been fully informed in hindsight.When we look at a breakdown of free cash flow growth, we see that while the rate of growth in free cash flow has accelerated since 2018, this is only due to the fact that free cash flow dipped into negative territory to begin with:Source: ycharts.comIn this regard, let's make the assumption that EPS will grow at 20% over the remaining four years. Given that the recent growth of 31% in EPS was in part due to a lower effective tax rate, I deem 20% to be a more realistic growth figure. Again, a discount rate of 7% is assumed.Earnings per ShareSource: ycharts.comSource: Author's CalculationsDiscounting earnings in lieu of free cash flow yields a target price of $148, which is just under a 35% upside from the current price.The caveat behind this is that PayPal needs to sustain earnings growth at an average of 20% over the next four years. For instance, let us assume that EPS growth was to drop to 10%:Source: Author's CalculationsLooking forward, PayPal is expecting revenue to continue ""growing at 16-17% at current spot rates"", and the Venmo acquisition has continued to be a big success, generating 73% growth in TPV (total payment volume) to $21 billion.The main risk to PayPal at this point is related to macroeconomic considerations. For instance, the International Monetary Fund has recently cautioned that $455 billion in GDP could be wiped off global growth should the effects of Brexit and U.S.-China tariffs prove to be too great of a stress on the economy. In turn, this would have the impact of reducing spending and, hence, total payment volumes processed through PayPal.Looking ahead, I see PayPal continuing to have a strong outlook. However, the company needs to continue producing high earnings growth at the current P/E ratio and a significant slowdown in economic growth could concurrently lead to a slowdown in PayPal's business.Additional disclosure: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

Despite the classic beat and raise, another one in the company's history, shares immediately dipped by as much as 2% in after-hours trading.In my view, however, one would need magnifying glasses to find much weakness in PayPal's results that might properly explain the bearish, post-earnings, knee-jerk reaction.(Image Credit: Merchant Maverick)Revenues of $4.13 billion, representing YOY growth of 12%, fell in line with consensus estimates - pressured noticeably by the disposition of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio. User base growth, an important operating metric for companies in this sector, remained robust.Active accounts grew 17%, in line with last quarter's accelerating rate. In addition, TPV (total payment volume) advanced 25% on an FX-neutral basis, with growth in merchant services accelerating sequentially for the second consecutive quarter. Meanwhile, Venmo continued to post dizzying volume growth rates that surpassed 70% YOY this quarter. See chart below.(Source: Earnings slides)On profitability, op margin of 22.6% expanded 13 bps YOY. Here, I see two opposing forces at play. On the plus side, non-GAAP operating expenses were kept well under control, having increased only 2% (excluding stock-based compensation and other items). On the other hand, transaction margin dipped along with the take rate, which I believe can be attributed to a revenue mix shift towards Venmo. While the incumbent platform's profitability will likely continue to be a hot topic of discussion among analysts and the management team, I believe that Venmo's robust TPV growth justifies margins being treated as a lower priority - for now.Below the op profit line, PayPal's investment in MercadoLibre (MELI) helped to boost EPS by eight cents. Without it, the company's net earnings would have increased 23% YOY, minimally aided by $750 million spent in share repurchases.See simplified P&L below, on a non-GAAP basis.(Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from company reports)Despite the impressive 42% stock price run of the past 12 months, I believe PayPal has been performing well enough to justify shares advancing further from current levels. While some profit-taking cannot be ruled out in the near term, at the core I believe PYPL is a fairly affordable stock that qualifies as a compelling GARP (growth at a reasonable price) play.The stock's next-year P/E has been hovering around 30x, a multiple that is only a few turns richer than those of peers Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Considering this Wednesday's ten-cent increase in full-year EPS guidance, the valuation could look even more attractive once Street estimates are revised.Data by YChartsHelping to support the bullish argument is the fact that PYPL has proven to be a ""storm-resistant growth"" stock for its historical ability to gain market value without being as sensitive to the broad market's dips (think of how well shares weathered the 4Q18 bear attack, for example). For the reasons above, I continue to be a confident PYPL shareholder following the release of the company's quarterly results."
4257964,22717,2019-04-30T09:49:57-04:00,"The secret to PayPal's massive increase in market value growth has been the relationship between the growth of its TPV, the ""Take Rate"" and PayPal's Market Value.The net effect is Free Cash Flow will begin to rise dramatically over the next five years.PYPL's stock price will reach $218 per share in 5 years, based on PYPL's stable Take Rate margin and FCF margins. With more buybacks, it will likely more than double.","PYPL's huge growth in its Total Payment Volume (TPV) or Gross Payment Volume (GPV) and the predictable nature of its Take Rate will lead to a doubling of its market value over the next five years. TPV is the value of payments that PYPL processes, net of reversals, either on its platform or third-party merchants' sites that use PYPL. The chart below shows the close relationship between PYPL's market value and its TPV:Source: HakePYPL has been public for about 3.75 years, since July 2015, when it was spun off from EBAY (EBAY). Since then, its market value has grown at a compound average growth rate (CAGR) of 30%, and the TPV has a CAGR of 25% (Note that the stock price has grown even faster at 34% per annum because of stock buybacks.):Source: HakePayPal's revenue comes from how much it ""takes"" or charges in fees on the TPV, i.e. the Take Rate. PYPL's Take Rate has been fairly high and has declined slowly over the past 6 years, as the TPV has increased. Right now it is between 2.67% (2018) and 2.56% (Q1 2019):Source: HakeActually, PYPL has one of the highest Take Rates in the industry at 2.67% in 2018, even though it has the second highest TPV of the major payment processors in the following group: Square (SQ), Total System Services (TSS), First Data Corp. (FDC), Fiserv (FISV), and Adyen (ADYEN) (note: WorldPay (WP) and Global Payments Inc. (GPN) don't report their dollar processing volumes:Source: HakePYPL's TPV history compared to several of its competitors is shown below:Source: HakePYPL not only has a higher revenue margin on TPV (i.e. its Take Rate), but it also has a higher Free Cash Flow (FCF) margin than its competitors. The industry median is 17% and PYPL's FCF margin is 20.4%. This effectively means its FCF Take Rate is almost double the industry, as can be seen in the following table:Source: HakeWhat this means is that for every $100 billion gain in funds each year that PYPL processes (i.e. TPV), PYPL will earn $2.67 billion more revenue and f$540 million more in FCF. You can see in the table below that in Q1 2019, PYPL gained almost $30 billion in TPV, so it is on track to gain over $120 billion in TPV for 2019:Source: PYPL 10-Q for Q1 2019In fact, PYPL's TPV has gained over $100 billion per year for the past two years and I estimate will process over $150 billion more this year or about $650 billion. You can see this in the following table below. This table also shows that the average Adjusted FCF in 2018 was $788 million per quarter. The Q1 2019 FCF was $809 million, or $21 million higher per quarter than on average in 2018. So in 2019 FCF will likely increase over $226 million. This is lower than the expected $540 million implied and described above by the FCF Take Rate. I believe that on average FCF will increase $250-$400 million each years over the next five years. FCF is expected to be about $226 - $300 million higher in 2019, depending on the growth rate in TPV and the FCF margin:Source: Hake estimates and SEC filings for PYPLIf PYPL's TPV grows at an annual compound of about 26% (the average between its 2018 rate of 25.2% and its Q1 2019 26.3%), which is what the last several years have shown, its TPV will double in five years by the end of 2023.Source: HakeThis means that Revenue in 2023 will reach $30.2 billion, up from $15.5 billion in 2018, and FCF will hit $6 billion, up from $3.1 billion in 2018. These numbers assume that PYPL continues to have a 2.67% Take Rate, and a 20% FCF margin on revenue (the FCF margin is an average of its 2018 rate of 20.4% and the Q1 2019 rate of 10.6%):Source: Hake estimatesWith these estimates, I can forecast the stock price in 5 years. For example, right now PYPL is priced at 7.8x revenue and alternatively, its FCF yield (i.e. FCF/ Market Value) is 2.69%. Using these ratios, the stock price should be at least $211.73 by the end of 2023. This represents a gain of 92% over the next five years.Source: Hake estimatesPYPL bought back shares over 11.4% of its shares over the last 3.75 years since it has been public:Source: Hake and SEC filings from PYPLPYPL used its FCF to buy back over 140 million shares, or 11.4% of its original shares outstanding in July 2015, when it was spun off from EBAY. This is about a 3.1% reduction per annum. I expect the share count will fall significantly over the next five years from 1,084 million shares (which our estimate is based on above), to probably about 80% of that number (or about a 4% reduction per year on average - slightly higher than the past since the FCF will increase as well). PYPL will more than double to $264.67, or 139% higher than today if this happens. It represents a gain of 19% per annum for the stock price over the next five years on a compounded basis:Source: Hake estimatesLet's double-check that estimate of buybacks against reality. In the past several years, PYPL has spent well over half to two-thirds to three-fourths of its FCF on share repurchases:Source: Hake and SEC filings of PYPLSo, let's assume that instead of making $6 billion in FCF each year for 5 years, (see above), the FCF grows sequentially by 10% a year from $3.2 billion (starting with 7% this year) so that by year five the cumulative FCF produced by PYPL is $20.6 billion. By year 5 the FCF would be $5 billion per year, which is lower than assumed in the model above. Let's also assume that the 75% of FCF is used on repurchases and that the average buyback price is at least 50% higher over the 5 years than today's price. That means the average buyback price per share would be $166 per share. The result is that 124 million shares would be bought back, or 11.5% lower than today's count, bringing the count outstanding to 960 million shares. The net result is that the stock price would be $218 per share or 98% above today's price:Source: Hake estimatesPayPal's stock is directly tied or correlated to both the growth in its Total Payment Volume and the Take Rate of both Revenue and Free Cash Flow.I estimate that, based on PayPal's significant growth in the past 6 years, and especially its higher than industry average Take Rate, that both revenue and Free Cash Flow will double in the next 5 years. My estimate is that the stock will easily reach $218 per share by 2023, which double today's price, and represents about a 15% compound rise in its price each year. This stock is worth buying even today, despite its recent rises, since on average the expected return of 14.5% per annum is quite satisfactory."

That review turned out to be so categorical that I decided to check my conclusions by building a DCF model.As I noted in the previous article, I like PayPal's business model. Therefore, when building the DCF model, I used the most positive input parameters, sometimes even super positive...The whole market PayPal is operating in is affected by the network effect, and at my glance, the critical mass of users is not reached yet. The demand for services provided by PayPal increases with every new active account:Against this background, I expect PayPal's revenue growth will continue to accelerate at least until 2021, and the CAGR will amount to 16% in the next 10 years:It is worth noting that my forecast of PayPal's revenue on the horizon of the next year is higher than the most optimistic expectations of the analysts:Here is the WACC calculation:To calculate the WACC, I used a one-year rolling beta coefficient which is at a record high now:I proceed from the assumption that PayPal's beta coefficient will decrease in the long term. Accordingly, this will reduce the WACC.PayPal is developing its ecosystem, embedding its services in the ecosystems of other companies. At my glance, such a business model does not, in principle, imply high profitability. Besides, speaking of a ten-year perspective, it is worth taking into consideration that the inevitable increase in competition in the digital payments market will put its pressure on the profitability of the entire industry. However, in the model, I ignore these arguments, and I assume that the operating margin will remain at the average level of the last five years.Further, I assume that CAPEX will remain at the current average level. This scenario can also be considered a very optimistic one.The model assumes only a gradual increase in the relative size of the tax rate to the average worldwide level of 25%.And here's the model itself:So, the DCF-based target price of PayPal's shares is $75, offering 31% downside.In its essence, a DCF model gives an approximate idea of ​​the long-term rational value of a company because the result is subject to high error. But in this particular case, it should be noted that even on the basis of the extremely optimistic development scenario of PayPal, the model has not shown growth potential. Personally, I see in this a confirmation of the fact that now PayPal is overvalued."
4253987,92456,2019-04-11T13:03:13-04:00,Both the current revenue growth rate and its absolute size describe PayPal’s current capitalization level as overvalued.PayPal cannot be called cheap against the backdrop of the key blue chips of NASDAQ.Current beta of PayPal is at a record high. It's not a good sign.,"I like PayPal (PYPL). The industry leader, which is influenced by the network effect, with a clear business model making the correct acquisitions, is potentially a good investment. But now PayPal's rational capitalization is clearly below the current level.Let's start with a purely technical indicator - the monthly total price return:From January, the monthly total price return of PayPal has not fallen below the mean. Now it exceeds the upper border of the standard deviation and looks very unstable.Going further, over the last four years, PayPal's capitalization has been in a qualitative linear relationship with its absolute revenue TTM:As you can see, this relationship identifies PayPal's current capitalization as overvalued. Moreover, according to analysts' average expectations, in Q2 '19, PayPal's revenue TTM will be around $16 billion, and in my model, this means that the company's rational capitalization will come close to $120 billion, which is still lower than its current value.The long-term relationship between PayPal's absolute EBITDA TTM and capitalization also indicates an overvalued state of the company:Further, over the last five years, PayPal's capitalization has been responding well to the revenue growth rate. As demonstrated by the following chart, the current growth rate of this indicator does not justify the achieved level of PayPal's capitalization:The situation with the EBITDA growth rates is even worse... In the last quarter, PayPal's EBITDA growth rate was the lowest in the last five years. But, in the same time, the EV/EBITDA multiple is at a record high:The result of a comparable valuation also speaks against PayPal. This is what we get analyzing the P/S to growth (forward) multiple:Comparing PayPal through the P/E to growth (forward) multiple, we obtain almost the same result:In both case, the implied price of PayPal is lower than the actual share price.I also want to draw your attention to the Beta Coefficient of PayPal, which is at a record high:I think that such situation reflects a high speculative interest in the company's shares, since it is short-term investors who are inclined to buy shares in a rising market and sell in a falling market, thereby creating increased volatility.So, PayPal is clearly overvalued, and one should expect a correction."
4251987,92586,2019-03-31T13:27:05-04:00,"PayPal has performed strongly since its 2015 spin-off, and I believe there is further upside to be captured.My interest in this name is justified by the quality of the business model and the stock's low correlation with the broad equities market.Because of PayPal's growth prospects coupled with the stock's desirable diversification features, I will add this name to my portfolio.","It has been a while since I looked closer into PayPal (PYPL). The payment systems vendor caught my attention at first in October 2017, after the company delivered an impressive quarter that reflected strong growth momentum and improving margins.Fast forward nearly 18 months and 46% in market value gain, I am ready to add this stock to my Storm Resistance Growth's ""All-Equities SRG"" portfolio.Credit: BBCAn investment in PayPal starts with a conviction that the company is on the right side of growth trends in the payments processing space. Consistent with my arguments on Visa (V), I believe PayPal is also positioned to benefit from a secular shift in payment methods, from cash and checks to plastic and electronic - a process that is well underway in developed countries but still growing, while incipient in many other global markets.The fintech's key operating metrics look highly encouraging, as the graph below suggests. Total payment value, or TPV, growth shows little sign of slowing down, despite the drag caused by a fast-declining eBay Marketplace (NASDAQ:EBAY) business - which I expect to account for less than 10% of TPV as early as next quarter and continue to trend towards irrelevance. Meanwhile, the number of total active accounts has been growing at an accelerating pace, even after adjusting for 2.9 million net adds from acquisitions in 4Q18.Source: Montage using graphs from PayPal's earnings slidesI expect PayPal to use economies of scale to its benefit and improve margins over time, which should bode well for earnings growth. Currently, EPS is forecasted to increase annually at a pace of nearly 20% in the long run (see red line below, implying a reasonable long-term PEG multiple of 1.9x). I believe that this estimate could be surpassed if margins lever up and the crucial Venmo business ($18.8 billion in TPV and growing at a dizzying pace of 80%) is able to drive an improvement in profitability that has yet to materialize.Data by YChartsDriving home the argument that PYPL deserves a spot in my diversified portfolio is what I call the ""SRG factor"", with the acronym standing for ""storm-resistant growth"". I have coined this phrase to describe stocks or portfolios that are able to grow consistently over time while providing some level of downside protection.In the case of PayPal, two points need to be made here. First, two of the company's key drivers of financial performance are (1) the size of the user base and (2) the volume that they transact. As I have presented earlier, both metrics have been growing robustly and at a consistent pace.Because PayPal does not rely on new customers ""walking in the door"" in order to produce sales (it already has access to a sizable potential customer pool, a.k.a. its user base), the company's financial results are likely to be less bumpy and more predictable. As a result, I expect PYPL's price to behave less erratically, after adjusting for the high growth expectations that tend to add more volatility to the stock's performance.See trailing twelve-month revenue, gross profit and EPS trends over the past three years.Data by YChartsSecond, and from a historical perspective, PYPL has been a strong performer in both absolute and relative-to-risk terms since the 2015 spin-off, while being only loosely tied with the behavior of the S&P 500 (SPY). The stock's daily return correlation with the equities index has been only 0.6x, while shares have shown signs of resilience even during times of broad market distress.For example, since the start of the fourth-quarter ""quasi-bear"" of 2018, PYPL has moved up +19% (weathering an ill-received 4Q18 earnings report) and never dipped more than 14 percentage points. In contrast, the S&P 500 has been down -4% over the past six months, after having lost almost 20% of its market value by the Christmas holiday.As a result of the low correlations and strong risk-adjusted returns, PYPL has been a great complement to an all-equities portfolio. A 50-50 investment equally split between the stock and the S&P 500 and rebalanced monthly since July 2015 would have returned nearly +22% per year (vs. the S&P 500's +13.9%), while experiencing a -4.4% daily drop at worst (vs. the S&P 500's -4.2%). The risk-adjusted return of the hypothetical portfolio would have been significantly better than that of the S&P 500, as the difference of 0.36 in Sharpe ratio suggests.See table and chart below:Source: DM Martins Research, using data from Yahoo FinanceBecause of PayPal's growth prospects coupled with the stock's desirable diversification features, I am convinced that the company will be a good addition to my portfolio at current levels."

4238300,24946,2019-02-05T15:19:13-05:00,PayPal Holdings has been an exceptional cash generating machine with a leading global position in the payment industry.The company uses its high level of free cash flow to enhance user engagement and grow by making accretive acquisitions.I will elaborate on the three most important takeaways from the company's recent earnings report.,"PayPal Holdings (PYPL) is one the world's leading digital payment companies. The company operates as a technology platform that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants. The company serves more than 267 million customer accounts, including 21 million merchant accounts.Image taken from Newsroom.MastercardSince its spinoff from its parent company, eBay (EBAY), back in 2015, management has demonstrated flawless execution in terms of new partnerships, user engagement and accretive acquisitions. This wonderful execution by management has greatly benefited its shareholders who have witnessed their shares rise by more than 150 percent since the spinoff, while shares of the parent company, eBay, have greatly underperformed both the overall market and PayPal.Data by YChartsI believe that PayPal today presents the best setup of growth versus value in the global payment sector. Specifically, my high conviction investment thesis in PayPal is based on two success pillars. The first pillar is revenue growth, accompanied by a significant rise in free cash flow. The second pillar is PayPal's underappreciated ability to engage with its user base.Recently, PayPal has announced its fourth quarter and annual results for 2018. In its most recent quarter, PayPal generated net revenues in the amount of $4.22 billion, up 13 percent, compared to the same quarter last year. On the bottom line, earnings were $0.69 per share, up an impressive 26 percent compared to the same quarter last year, driven by revenue growth, operating gains and fewer shares outstanding. For 2018, PayPal has recorded revenues of $15.45 billion, up 18 percent compared to the previous year, and earnings of $2.42 per share, up 28 percent year over year.PayPal wins precisely where it counts. The growth in revenues and earnings has been based on growth in total transaction volumes and the number of active users of the company. For example, total payment volume during the fourth quarter of 2018 reached $164 billion, up an impressive 23 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, while the total number of transactions was 2.9 billion, up 28 percent year over year.The best part of PayPal's recent report is the company's amazing engagement with its customers. This has been demonstrated in three different aspects. The first aspect is the customer net adds. PayPal has been able to add 13.8 million net new active accounts during the past quarter, up 17 percent year over year. When taking into account the 2.9 million accounts from iZettle and Hyperwallet, the company's two recent purchases, we still come up with organic growth of 15 percent, much higher than historic levels.The second aspect of robust engagement by PayPal is the company's immense success with Venmo, its P2P application. Venmo has processed approximately $19 billion of total payment volume in the fourth quarter of 2018, up 80 percent year over year. In 2018, Venmo has processed a whopping $62 billion of total payment volume. Management noted that Venmo is generating $200 million in annualized run rate revenues for PayPal, and that the number of Venmo users who have been monetized hit 29 percent, versus only 24 percent in the previous quarter.You see, Venmo is not just another P2P application. It is a huge success for PayPal and one of the best ways to interact and gain traction with its younger customers. We believe that the willingness of users to use Venmo outside of P2P – ""Pay with Venmo"" is likely to gain traction in the future, which will add another business barrier for PayPal.The third aspect of robust engagement is the stream of successful partnerships that PayPal has been able to bring to the table in the past quarters. In the past few years, PayPal has rolled out dozens of transformational partnerships with the likes of Mastercard (MA), Bank of America (BAC), Facebook (FB) and Baidu (BIDU). Successful partnerships, despite the lower revenue base for PayPal, present a wonderful opportunity for user engagement, especially with PayPal approaching almost one-third share of checkout in the U.S.The bad part of PayPal's recent report was the 1 percent revenue guide down on weakness in its core transaction business, mainly due to weak revenue from eBay, unfavorable foreign exchange rates and weaker than expected cross border volumes. In addition, PayPal has widened the non-GAAP earnings per share guidance from $2.86-$2.88, to $2.84-$2.91, which somewhat increases the future uncertainty of earnings.One of the most carefully watched metrics of PayPal is the company's take rate. The take rate is the percentage of the value of the transaction that PayPal facilitates that it gets to record as revenue. The stronger the user base of the company is, the higher the take rate is likely to be. In this past quarter, PayPal has recorded a take rate of 2.35 percent, bringing the annual take rate to 2.37 percent. This does not compare favorably against the take rates of 2017 and 2016, which stand at 2.5 percent and 2.64 percent, respectively.Now, to PayPal's benefit one may claim that competition has been less fierce two years ago, and that PayPal's business model has greatly evolved since then. Still, there's a strange aftertaste to this explanation. In conclusion, PayPal's ability to maintain a healthy take rate remains to be seen and tested in the next few quarters.There are two main risks in this investment – a business risk and a macro risk. The business risk will materialize if PayPal is unable to successfully increase the number of its active users, or fails to monetize their engagement. The second risk will materialize if a global slowdown sets in, which is likely to lead to softer demand from consumers in general.PayPal is a leading company in the global digital payment sector. It gushes cash flow, grows revenue and earnings at a rapid pace, and engages tremendously well with its user base. Despite the recent guide down in revenue and the lower take rate, PayPal remains my top pick in the payment sector."

It touched a 52-week high of $93.70 in September this year.,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) recently reported third-quarter results that surpassed all market expectations, as it continues to grow rapidly through strategic tie-ups and the launch of newer products.The company's revenues of $3.68 billion grew 14% over the year and were ahead of the Street's forecast of $3.66 billion. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.58 was up 26% y-o-y and $0.04 better than the market's estimate for the quarter.By nature of services, PayPal's transaction revenues grew 17% to $3.34 billion, accounting for nearly 91% of its revenues for the quarter. Other value-added services accounted for the remaining 9% of revenues and fell 11% over the year to $340 million. The decline in the segment was attributed to the sale of its US consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) for $7.6 billion.PayPal's revenues from the United States grew 13% over the year to $1.96 billion, and international revenues grew 15% to $1.72 billion.Among key operating metrics, the company recorded 15% growth in total active accounts. It added 9.1 million net new active accounts during the quarter, taking the total number of active accounts to 254 million, ahead of the market's forecast of 251 million. The total number of payment transactions grew 27% over the year to 2.46 billion, which also was ahead of the Street's estimate of 2.43 billion. PayPal's payment transactions per active user grew 10% to 36.5 million. Total Payment Volume grew 24% to $143 billion in the third quarter, with Venmo accounting for $17 billion of the figure during the quarter. During the quarter, PayPal processed $57 billion in mobile payment volume, recording 45% growth over the year.For the current quarter, the company expects revenues of $4.19-4.27 billion, compared with the market's forecast of $4.22 billion. It forecast Non-GAAP EPS of $0.65-0.67 for the quarter, compared with the Street's estimate of $0.65. PayPal expects to end the year with revenues of $15.42-15.5 billion with an EPS of $2.38-2.40. The Street was looking for revenues of $15.43 billion with an EPS of $2.35 for the year.During the quarter, PayPal continued to expand its market presence through significant strategic tie-ups. Earlier this month, it announced an expansion of its partnership with American Express (NYSE:AXP) that will allow cardholders to use their Membership Rewards points when shopping from PayPal merchants. PayPal has similar agreements with other card providers, including Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA). The agreement also will allow Amex mobile users to transfer funds directly through PayPal or Venmo, and to add their American Express cards to their PayPal wallets. PayPal will allow users to pay their American Express card bills through its app as well.The company is also expanding its presence in the brick-and-mortar world. Recently, it entered into an agreement with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) that will allow PayPal customers to withdraw cash from Walmart stores after paying a withdrawal fee of $3. This will be the first time that PayPal will allow its customers to make such withdrawals. It is counting on Walmart's massive geographic reach to bring this additional value to its customers.PayPal has managed to stay relevant in today's market through the continuous improvement of its mobile offerings, with Venmo being its latest success story. PayPal has two key Venmo offerings - Pay with Venmo and the Venmo debit card. Pay with Venmo allows Venmo users to make online purchases. It saw monthly active users (MAUs) grow 185% from August to September. The Venmo debit card, which was launched in June, also saw significant growth with MAUs growing 320%. Overall, the transaction volume on Venmo's service grew 78% to $16.7 billion and reached an annualized run rate of nearly $70 billion. Last month, PayPal processed more than $1 billion in instant transfer volume on the Venmo platform alone.During the last quarter, PayPal recorded Venmo monetization - the number of users that tried a monetized Venmo product - grow to 24%, compared with 13% in May this year. The rapid adoption is attributed to the launch of the Venmo debit card and the release of Smart Payment Buttons for vendors. Smart Payment Buttons allow merchants to dynamically populate a list of checkout methods for customers based on data that PayPal has on each customer and their location. For instance, if a user has a Venmo account, they will see a Pay with Venmo button, whereas those who don't have a Venmo account won't see it. PayPal believes that the Buttons are delivering a better checkout experience for consumers and driving monetization of its Venmo users.While Venmo may be attracting several users, it's still to turn into a profitable venture for PayPal. PayPal does not collect a percentage on the peer-to-peer payments that are processed through Venmo. PayPal is hoping to make up for this revenue through the release of ancillary services like instant transfers.Venmo's biggest competitors in the space are Square (NYSE:SQ) and Zelle. Analysts believe that the US peer-to-peer mobile payments market will grow from $156.5 billion in 2018 to $244 billion by 2021. According to eMarketer, Zelle will be a clear leader in the segment in the next few years.PayPal is looking to counter the competition through acquisitions. It had earlier announced the $2.2 billion acquisition of Sweden-based iZettle. The acquisition of the mobile payments company will help Venmo grow in the international markets.I would like to know from users which app they like most when it comes to mobile peer-to-peer transfer. Do you prefer Zelle, Square or Venmo, and why?PayPal stock is trading at $85.43 with a market cap of $100.6 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $93.70 in September this year. It has recovered from a 52-week low of $68.61 nearly a year ago."
4234251,21798,2019-01-18T11:11:57-05:00,"PayPal is poised for strong growth over multiple years.Growth of users, payments volume and overall transactions are all drivers.PayPal's blockchain efforts could yield big revenues that are not factored into the current valuation.Some investors think PayPal is overvalued, but it is a classic buy the dip stock with long-term potential.","PayPal (PYPL) seems to be a company that fits Buffett's wonderful company and a fair price concept. I believe we could even see PayPal end up in the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (BRK.B) portfolio at some point.Here are five catalysts that can drive PayPal to many years of market beating returns with the ever so important margin of safety.Mobile payments are projected to overtake cash by the year 2030. There has also been a shift to more cashless payments even without mobile for many years. This is likely to continue as emerging economies throughout the world are likely to seek the convenience of using cashless payments for transactions.PayPal is poised to benefit from this trend as the PayPal and Venmo apps make payment transactions convenient for buyers & sellers. The company achieved mobile growth of 45% in Q3. Mobile now comprises 40% of PayPal's total payment volume.The shift to more cashless and mobile payments are likely to help drive growth for PayPal. There are numerous ways to use PayPal in addition to using it as a payment method to buy and sell on eBay (EBAY). These options will help add to PayPal's overall growth.The ""Skype Send Money"" feature allows PayPal account holders to send money to their Skype contacts. There is a PayPal payment request wizard available as a plugin for Outlook and Outlook Express. The wizard sets up emails to request money from customers with a 'Pay Now' button in the email. PayPal can also be integrated within Facebook (FB) to accept donations from friends for a cause as an example.PayPal announced a partnership with Walmart (WMT) in October 2018. The partnership allows PayPal users to load cash into their PayPal accounts and to make cash withdrawals at all Walmart stores in the United States. This deal also allows PayPal Cash MasterCard customers to use their balance to make purchases in Walmart stores and on Walmart.com.This partnership is likely to help increase revenue for PayPal. PayPal and Walmart will split the $3 per transaction for these services. The companies did not yet decide how they will split the fee. Ninety percent of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart store. So, many PayPal users will be able to conveniently use their cards at Walmart. Therefore, this will help add to the company's future growth as PayPal adds a new source of fees to collect for these services.Look for PayPal to continue to expand their partnerships with other companies. PayPal added over 35 partnerships in a little over two years. This is one of PayPal's strategies that I expect to help drive future growth.Source: PayPal Q3 2018 Earnings Call SlidesPayPal is still attracting new account holders at a strong pace. The company averaged almost 3 million new accounts per month over the past 12 months. Revenue is growing at strong double-digit rates. Revenue increased 14% year-over-year in Q3. Revenue is expected to continue growing at a strong pace of about 17% in 2019 (consensus).Growth is also evident in the 27% increase in transactions that PayPal achieved during Q3. The pace of transactions growth shows that PayPal is gaining popularity as a convenient payment method. Total payment volume increased 24% year-over-year in Q3.The double-digit revenue growth will help drive PayPal's expected earnings growth of 20% for 2019 (consensus). These estimates can be achieved as PayPal has an operating margin of 14.8%, EBITDA margin of over 23%, and an ROE of 13.7%. I expect this growth to be driven by the shift to cashless payments trend as merchants and buyers continue to be attracted to PayPal's convenient payments system.PayPal attracts users because it is an easy way for e-commerce entrepreneurs to accept credit card and direct online payments. The platform is also convenient for buyers to make online purchases in a fast & secure manner.The Millennial generation is attracted to Venmo (one of PayPal's acquisitions), probably for its social aspect. Venmo is a digital wallet that has a social media feed built into the app. It is designed to facilitate payment among friends in a more personal way. Venmo asks for comments on every transaction, which gives the payment platform a more social feel than the PayPal app.Blockchain could be a technology that PayPal uses in the future for bank to bank transactions. PayPal recently employed blockchain technology to reward employees in crypto-tokens. These tokens only have value inside PayPal and the platform - for now.Using tokens or contracts could be the first step towards using blockchain or its cousin DLT (distributed ledger technology) for money transfers. Currently, bank to bank transfers take 1-4 days to clear and international transfers can be expensive (high fees). In these modern times, why aren't wire transfers and other bank to bank transfers nearly instant?The bank to bank transfer system is in need of a ""transfer agent"" that has cash reserves in multiple currencies and has direct connections to most banking institutions. Something similar to the ACATs system that brokerages use to move securities makes sense.Without going into mechanics, PayPal could facilitate a transfer of assets between Bank A, which at the request of a client, wants to send money to Bank B. PayPal can accept some currency and delivery risks for a fee.That is a simplification of course. Read the recent CB Insights article: How Blockchain Could Disrupt Banking for a more detailed understanding.With global banking being a $134 trillion industry, there is a huge market for making bank to bank and other currency transfers faster and more secure. As leaders emerge, they will secure massive profits. That is a major reason why so many crypto dreams have been conjured and now crashed. PayPal appears to have a very good chance to become a leader.Some investors will dismiss PayPal's stock because of the trailing PE ratio of 52 or the forward PE of 31. However, this is a company growing revenue and earnings at above average double-digit rates. It is typical for stocks like this to maintain above average PE ratios.When a company like PayPal is expected to sustain multiple years of above average growth. PayPal's 5-year PEG ratio is a fair 1.8. This is right in-line with the many growth stocks that have growth catalysts ready to emerge. When the PEG ratio is between one and two, it typically indicates a fair valuation for high growth companies.PayPal's PEG is based on the company's 5-year projected earnings growth of about 20% annually. I think this growth rate can be achieved and exceeded as PayPal continues to grow new accounts, transactions, and payments volume as they benefit from the shift to more cashless payments throughout global economies.PayPal's stock is set-up for a breakout from a technical perspective. The stock has been consolidating while the broader market was declining over the past couple of months. PayPal's stock outperformed the S&P 500 (SPY) during the recent correction.There are multiple positive technical indicators. The 50-day moving average just crossed above the 200 day moving average. The relative strength indicator [RSI] is rising. The MACD recently crossed above the signal line, indicating positive upward momentum. Money flow just turned positive indicating that buying momentum has overtaken the sellers.Importantly, we can see that the Chaikin Money Flow, a favorite quantitative indicator at Margin of Safety Investing, troughed and has now convincingly turned up. This is almost always a sign of a rally as money flow into an asset indicates accumulation.When you combine the technical strength with PayPal's fundamental strength, the stock looks likely to increase to new highs. We should not dismiss that technical or quantitative strength often indicate that the market as a whole sees something that individual investors might be missing.For Margin of Safety Investing to own a growth stock, we have to believe that it has the potential to deliver a triple in total return within in 5 years. We also have to be convinced that a double is very likely. We believe that PayPal is likely to double within 5 years and could possibly triple.The fair valuation based on the PEG ratio should allow the stock to grow about in-line with earnings growth over the long-term. This is a company that has multiple years of above average growth in their future in my opinion.The risk to the investment thesis is increasing competition for similar payment systems. Similar payment system competitors include: Adyen, Stripe, Skrill, and Payza. PayPal could lessen the competition and strengthen the company by acquiring one or more of their competitors.PayPal has a strong balance sheet with 4.8x more total cash than debt. So, the company is in a good financial position for new acquisitions. M&A will be something to look for as PayPal continues to strengthen their position in the marketplace. This is something they have done successfully in the past.The stock price is likely to outperform the broader market over the long-term as a result of PayPal's above average growth. PayPal is a stock that has the potential to increase approximately 50% in about 2 years and possibly double within 2 to 4 years. This will be driven by PayPal's strong double-digit revenue and earnings growth.Buy PayPal now and scale into the stock on share price dips. Investors with large enough accounts, can consider buying a small stock position and selling slightly out of the money cash-secured puts a month or two out to continue building a position and lower cost basis.Margin of Safety Investing [MoSI] offers exclusive investing ideas, live chat, webinars, and more.

4226753,47691,2018-12-06T12:14:06-05:00,PayPal offers a case study in setting the conditions to weather market troubles.A strong Q3 indicates a working and profitable business model.A firm foundation allowed PayPal to fend off fraud difficulties with Venmo.,"PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL – Research Report) has a foot in two segments, tech and finance, and unlike many of its peers it has been weathering the recent market downturns well. Yes, the stock fell in early October but quickly recovered after a strong Q3 earnings report, and yes, the stock slipped again earlier in November but again quickly recovered as the company dealt both decisively and effectively with potential fraud issues in its Venmo social payment system. Paypal presents a good example of how a strong business model and quick management action can give a company the firm foundation it needs to hold its own against market difficulties.A Gangbusters QuarterWe’ll start by looking at the Q3 results. The earnings report, released in October for the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, showed unequivocally good news. Revenue grew 14%, hitting $3.68 billion. GAAP EPS came in at 36 cents per share.In terms of customer base, PayPal reported 9.1 million new active accounts, compared to 8.2 million in Q3 of 2017. PayPal ended the quarter with a 15% increase in active accounts, to 254 million.Transaction volume was up, as well. The company reported $143 in total payment volume (TPV), in 2.5 billion transactions. This was a 27% increase in transactions, with payment volume up 24%. On a trailing twelve-month basis, the company reported 36.5 transactions per active account, an increase of 9.5%.Overall, PayPal reported increases in revenue, increases in new accounts, and increases in customer account activity. In the words of company CEO Dan Schulman, “PayPal had another excellent quarter. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow enable us to aggressively invest in innovation and growth, creating sustainable and long-term value for our shareholders.”Surviving a Market DownturnThe earnings report came just in time. In the first 10 days of October, PYPL lost nearly 10% in trading; after the earnings report, share value started climbing, reaching $87 by October 23. That day, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Joseph Foresi (Track Record & Ratings) gave PYPL a ‘Buy’ rating and a $101 price target, saying, “Fundamentally, we believe PayPal can grow at roughly double the market average, supporting its premium to the group. Technically, PYPL may break out to the upside of a sideways channel based on strong fundamentals.”PYPL stock traded in a narrow range for the next three weeks, until the early November market drop and the news release about Venmo’s fraudulent transaction issues. Of the two, the news from Venmo had the most potential to hurt the company. PayPal acquired the social payment system in 2013, as part of an $800 million deal with Braintree. In January of this year, Venmo introduced an instant transaction feature, and that’s where the trouble began.Trouble with Fraudsters?In the first three months of calendar year 2018, after initiating the instant transaction feature, Venmo saw a 40% jump in fraud-related expenses. The loss rate due to fraud, expected to be 0.25%, came in at 0.40%. The company stopped the instant transaction feature, and blacklisted suspicious accounts. It also stopped transactions through the website; website transactions were only 2% of total volume, but accounted for 15% of suspicious transactions and net losses.The company’s quick actions stemmed the damage, and when Venmo reintroduced instant transactions (a service of convenience, charging a fee for customers to withdraw money to their bank account in 10 to 30 minutes rather than 1 to 3 days), the feature worked smoothly. In September, Venmo reported over $1 billion volume in instant transfer transactions, without any anomalous increase in flagged activity.Quick management action and an implemented solution gave PayPal/Venmo a strong position when news of the fraud issues was broken by the Wall Street Journal on November 24. Normally, the timing – a serious issue in the first quarter only reported in November – would rouse suspicions that the company had tried to ‘keep the lid on,’ and keep the story out of the public eye. But having resolved the issue right away, and having safely reintroduced the instant transfer policy before the news broke, Venmo was able to head off negative press.The Analysts Weigh InMarket analysts quickly determined that PayPal had its Venmo issue under control. Writing for Stephens, Brett Huff says, “[T]he fraud issue looks to be under control given that the article indicates fraud rates have been coming down. Even if it were assumed that the continued high levels of fraud outlined in the article of 0.35% continued, the negative financial impact that would occur would be fairly muted.” He gives PayPal an aggressive price target of $108, for a 31% potential upside.Nomura’s Bill Carcache also downplayed the issue, saying that he “believes fears of fraud loss at PayPal's Venmo [are] overblown following Sunday's Wall Street Journal article.” Carcache also pointed out that Venmo reintroduced the instant transfer feature, after adding security updates, and generated $1 billion in volume during September. His price target of $103 suggests a 25% upside to the stock.Buckingham analyst Chris Brendler (Track Record & Ratings), in a note just after the story broke, brought up an interesting question: “While the WSJ story on unexpected fraud losses is a bit unsettling, we think it is more surprising that the information became public. Innovative payments companies are constantly testing and learning new products/features so we're more concerned how/why this story came public.” His price target of $99, a 20% upside from the current share price, shows confidence in PYPL.PayPal Remains a ‘Strong Buy’ OptionAnyone who follows the news regularly will know that leaks happen. In this case, PayPal dealt with the issue skillfully, implementing solutions when the initial problem occurred and not denying the story when the news broke. Having solutions at hand, the company was able to avoid a potential PR disaster.Avoiding that disaster, PYPL has benefited in the stock markets. The share price currently stands at $82, while the average price target of $100 gives a 21% upside potential. The analyst consensus of ‘Strong Buy’ is based on 19 ‘buy’ ratings and 4 ‘holds.’ There are no recent ‘sell’ ratings on PayPal, despite the Wall Street Journal article.Author: Michael Marcus"
4237917,103480,2019-02-04T13:57:24-05:00,"Shares of PayPal skidded after the payments giant posted an in line Q4 alongside disappointing guidance for Q1.One of the major drivers is eBay, which showed meaningful deceleration and dwindled as a percentage of PayPal's total revenues.eBay, however, represents PayPal's past. Look to future growth in services like Venmo, which grew ~80% y/y in 2018, instead.Though Venmo has long been regarded as a service that can't drive revenues, PayPal reported that just under one-third of Venmo's users have engaged in a monetizable experience.","PayPal (PYPL) has been under pressure over the past week as the digital payments leader suffered through an in line Q4 and a soft outlook for Q1. Especially during a time of market turbulence, investors really needed a boost of confidence to justify PayPal's recovery back to all-time highs. Instead, PayPal echoed what many other technology giants are forecasting: slower growth in 2019.Data by YChartsWhile retaining its guidance outlook for the full year FY19, PayPal issued a guidance range of $4.08-$4.13 billion in Q1 - representing 11-13% y/y growth in constant currency terms, and below Wall Street's expectations of $4.16 billion (+14% y/y).Figure 1. PayPal guidanceSource: PayPal Q4 earnings releaseIn my view, however, the long-term thesis for PayPal is still very much intact. The company is undergoing a period of transition: last year, eBay (EBAY) shocked investors in PayPal by announcing that it intended to replace PayPal as its primary payments processor with Adyen by mid-2020, the Dutch payments company that just went public last year and sprung out from a unicorn valuation.As we move closer to the cutoff date, eBay volumes are dwindling, putting pressure on PayPal's near-term results. Its growth in P2P and mobile payments, however, has been stunning - and just on the cusp of monetization. eBay represents the past (and indeed, as we saw in eBay's own earnings last week, eBay's GMV is weak - it could never have been a multi-year source of growth for PayPal anyway); and Venmo and other mobile initiatives are PayPal's future.Continue to stay long on PayPal. The company has delivered mid-teens revenue growth and high 20s EPS growth throughout all of FY18, making its ~30x P/E ratio look reasonable. In fact, on a P/E basis, PayPal is currently trading about five turns lower than where it was last quarter. When we acknowledge PayPal's dominance among e-commerce outlets beyond eBay as well as P2P transactions, we're comfortable investing in PayPal for the long term.Despite the top-line disappointments in both Q4 results and Q1 guidance, PayPal's underlying payments volumes actually contained a wellspring of positive news. See the data below:Figure 2. PayPal TPV trendsSource: PayPal Q4 investor deckAs seen in the chart above, TPV growth in the back half of 2018 has decelerated relative to the earlier quarters. PayPal has listed an eBay slowdown as its primary culprit. A separate chart below shows that eBay's share of total TPV has fallen to just 11% in 2018, about half its share three years ago:Figure 3. eBay TPV trendsSource: PayPal Q4 investor deckThe loss of eBay-driven revenues is certainly a tough pill for investors to swallow, but it's a reality that PayPal has to face eventually. In 2020, this entire revenue stream will be virtually eliminated. But this is not ""new news"": investors have known about the eBay split for several quarters already, and as previously mentioned, eBay's own underlying marketplace performance has been poor, with GMV in the U.S. actually declining -1% in eBay's most recent quarter. In essence, the dip in TPV due to eBay isn't an indicator of unhealthy business conditions for PayPal - it's a reality investors need to face and move on.Fortunately, PayPal has a strong candidate to replace eBay revenues, and that lies in Venmo. Venmo has been the spotlight of PayPal's growth efforts for more than a year, and for the full FY18, Venmo TPV grew 79% y/y to $62 billion.PayPal also provided another interesting data point this quarter: it reported that 29% of Venmo's active users have ""engaged in a monetizable experience."" Many investors in PayPal praise Venmo for its TPV growth, but dismiss it as a serious source of revenues for PayPal because transactions are free. It seems now, however, that many of Venmo's paid features - such as instant transfers - are beginning to take root.Here's some further qualitative commentary from PayPal CEO Dan Schulman on the Q4 earnings call:The key point here: Venmo TPV has already surpassed eBay. Don't be bogged down by the already-expected decline in eBay; focus on the fact that its replacement is still growing at a blazing 80% y/y pace.Another area in which PayPal is excelling: user growth. PayPal's mobile-first approach and large portfolio of popular applications such as Venmo have driven the company to add users at a quickening pace.Figure 4. PayPal active accounts trendsSource: PayPal Q4 investor deckAs seen in the chart above, PayPal has reached a record-topping user base of 267 million active accounts, which is up 17% y/y - representing two points of acceleration over Q3, and the fastest quarter for user growth in FY18. PayPal is also succeeding at winning new merchant accounts, whose fees drive the lion's share of PayPal's revenues.It's worth noting that acquisitions helped to drive a lot of the net new account gains this quarter. PayPal's addition of Hyperwallet and iZettle accounted for 2.9 million of the net new accounts in FY19. We note, however, that even without the contribution of these recently acquired subsidiaries, the remaining 10.9 million ""organic"" net new adds still represents the largest addition in six quarters.Dips in PayPal's stock present a timely opportunity to buy. Thanks to the immense popularity of Venmo, PayPal has virtually locked down the market for P2P payments in the U.S. Recall as well that the penetration of P2P/mobile payments in the U.S. pales in comparison to China, where applications like WeChat Pay and Alipay have become more popular than plastic. Investors should focus on the mobile opportunity that lies ahead for PayPal, and not on the deceleration in revenues from eBay - an admittedly large, but zero-growth partner that has already chosen to dump PayPal several quarters ago."
4215003,69965,2018-10-26T16:09:48-04:00,"PayPal's revenue domestically and internationally has been slowing over the last year, yet investors seem not to notice.When compared to Square in particular, PayPal's transaction and loan losses are worrisome.Though there is always something to worry about, PayPal's long-term growth seems intact between Venmo and new partnerships.","When PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) reported earnings recently, investors reacted with excitement sending the shares up roughly 10%. In the days following, multiple articles have been written extolling the virtues of the company’s strong quarter. One article suggested PayPal “hasn’t lost any of its momentum, delivering another expectation-beating quarter.” Multiple articles echoed the theme of investors excitement over PayPal’s Venmo unit, and the potential to monetize the millions of users of the popular service. Though Venmo’s future seems to hold promise, there are two other key issues for investors to keep an eye on going forward.PayPal competes against multiple companies, helping businesses to get paid, individuals to pay each other, and granting funding to both. One company that seems intent on going head-to-head with PayPal is Square (NYSE: SQ). If we look at the performance of each company, while investors salivate over PayPal’s results, a comparison to Square should give investors pause.The first key takeaway from PayPal’s earnings is the company’s revenue growth has some challenges. While PayPal’s transaction revenue is significantly higher than Square, the gap in growth is significant. Last quarter, PayPal’s transaction revenue increased by 17%, whereas Square’s transaction revenue increased by 30%.In an even more stark comparison, PayPal’s Other Value Added Services division reported a revenue decline of 11% year-over-year. On the other hand, Square’s fastest growing division Subscription and Service Based Revenue jumped by more than 127%.PayPal’s Venmo division reported a 78% increase in transaction volume. On the flip side, Square’s Hardware growth jumped nearly 80%, and the company’s new Bitcoin business produced $37 million in revenue. Whether we compare transaction revenue, other divisions, or new businesses, it seems Square’s growth trumps PayPal at every turn.Though some might write off this difference in performance as simply a difference in size, PayPal’s trend in revenue is a company specific-issue that is not so easily dismissed. Looking at the company’s domestic and international revenue growth rates, the pattern nearly jumps off the page.(Source: PYPL 10-Q)While there may be a turn in revenue growth come the December quarter, in the last four quarters in a row, PayPal’s growth has been on a steady downward track.The second takeaway from PayPal’s earnings is that the company seems to have credit challenges. Most investors know that PayPal sold its consumer credit portfolio to Synchrony for about $7 billion a few months back. The sale was intended to give PayPal funds for mergers, as well as to remove some risk from the company’s balance sheet.On the acquisitions side, PayPal is planning on spending between $1 billion and $3 billion per year. The company certainly didn’t wait long to spend some of the funds from the Synchrony sale. PayPal’s acquisition of iZettle is expected to expand the company’s revenues in Europe. Hyperwallet and its flexible payment options could give PayPal inroads into payroll processing.Clearly spending on mergers is the right move, but investors need to pay attention to PayPal’s transaction and loan losses moving forward. In the most recent quarter, PayPal’s losses in this area amounted to $295 million or 8% of transaction revenues.As point of comparison, Square’s transaction, loan and advance losses amounted to $22 million, and more importantly a mere 2.7% of revenue. Though both companies saw a decrease in losses on a year-over-year basis, clearly PayPal needs to work on bringing its losses down further.A third takeaway from PayPal’s earnings is that the company’s growth in the future seems to hinge on Venmo and partnerships. One might get the idea that I have a negative view of PayPal from the prior two sections, but these issues are relatively short-term in nature. There is little doubt that PayPal needs to address its slowing growth and loss percentage, but the company is already making moves toward this end.Venmo is going head-to-head with Square’s Cash App, and recently the Cash App grew downloads at a faster pace. However, this is a situation where the size of the opportunity, is almost as important as the speed of adoption. With about 10 million users of the Cash App, the recent 128% growth in downloads is impressive. In this same research, much was made of Venmo’s relatively slower growth in downloads at 74% year-over-year.What investors need to keep in mind is that Venmo has nearly 23 million users. If this 74% increase resulted in equal user growth, this would equate to over 17 million new users. The Cash App’s growth of 128%, resulting in an equal increase in users, would mean just under 13 million new users for Square. The bottom line result, is the Cash App may be growing faster, but Venmo has a significant lead, and impressive growth itself.Partnerships are an equally important part of the PayPal long-term growth story. This year alone, PayPal partnered with American Express, which will allow PayPal users to utilize their reward points wherever PayPal is accepted. In addition, PayPal partnered with Walmart (NYSE:WMT), where users will be able to either add or withdraw cash at Walmart stores in the U.S. With thousands of Walmart stores, this agreement gives PayPal users a physical presence where they can access their account that rivals the largest banking institutions.In the end, investors holding PayPal shares need to be wary of slowing revenue growth. The company’s challenges with its transaction and loan losses needs to be addressed as well. However, the company’s Venmo service is a growth engine to watch in the future. PayPal’s growth in size and influence, is allowing the company to strike deals with some of the largest and most respected companies.Shareholders who have held the shares since the beginning of the year, are up just over 16% at present. However, the ride has been challenging for those holding for the long-term. There are always worries to be concerned about, yet PayPal’s growth story seems intact. Investors should expect strong returns from the stock, as the benefit of these new partnerships bears fruit."
4213009,86786,2018-10-21T16:26:55-04:00,"I believe the gap we are seeing is not an area gap and will thus not close.From the earnings call, it seems that PYPL is experiencing another growth phase in which partnerships allowing this payment method to become almost ubiquitous.While the gap in PYPL is considered “fair,"" sentiment hints that PYPL will continue moving upward.","Paypal (PYPL) recently reported earnings and is up 8% as a result. I advised my subscribers to buy calls in my most recent article. While my Exposing Earnings subscribers are selling…… I’m interested in what happens next.After earnings, two things typically happen. For one, we see a gap. We also have new information via an earnings call.Seeking Alpha, this godsend of a website, provides the full earnings call transcript for all earnings. If you didn’t know that, you need to start reading. PYPL’s most recent earnings call transcript is here. (My biggest complaint about Seeking Alpha is that the site defaults to a multiple-page reading of the transcript for no apparent reason; click “single page.”)Post-earnings gaps are usually playable because of over/under-reactions on earnings. I’ve spent years researching gaps and can usually get an idea of which way the stock is headed after a gap. However, post-earnings gaps are exceptions because of that second piece of information (earnings call), which does not come with every gap.I run my gap algorithm after earnings gaps to see if a pattern exists. Unfortunately, PYPL is unwieldy in this regard. Here is how PYPL acts on this particular type of gap after one day:Note the small sample size, making this type of gap even more unwieldy. If we extend the data set to all up gaps, we get a similar trend, but the sample size is still not to my liking:After three days:Looks profitable to go long on up gaps, right? However, when we regress to the specific gap type we saw after earnings, we get the following three-day pattern:So, merely going long after an up gap does not work for this type of gap. In general, however, going long on PYPL’s up gaps is profitable. This implies that bumps in PYPL are underreactions; investors tend to wait for PYPL to rise before buying themselves.I ran my cognitive dissonance algorithm on PYPL and found no cognitive dissonance. It existed one year ago but dissipated about six months ago. This means that PYPL investors have begun to react fairly (market-wise) to news, such as earnings reports, whereas in the past they overreacted to news.If so, then PYPL is fairly priced after this gap and will likely trend sideways and/or upward. In other words, this gap is not an area gap but a breakaway/continuation gap. We can attempt to confirm this by checking the earnings call sentiment, which is correlated to the stock’s movement in the coming quarter.I’ve built code for this analysis exactly. We perform lexical analysis on the earnings call transcript (thank you, Seeking Alpha) to arrive at a sentiment score for the current quarter. My code includes all the recent research regarding earnings call language and future stock price (Google Alerts tell me when to update my code).The sentiment score is a weighting of positive-to-negative statements. You might think the market average is a score of 0.00, but it is actually around 0.30. If PYPL’s sentiment score is better than 0.30, it should (statistically) outperform the market over the next three months.Also important, however, is PYPL’s QoQ and YoY sentiment scores, as this implies progress. I’ve run the algorithm on PYPL’s earnings transcripts and have found the following:Clearly, this is highly bullish sentiment. Let’s grab a few of the statements flagged by my algorithm:Implies growth and increasingly stability.Implies an addition to the consumer toolbox, creating stronger loyalty to the brand and bringing in new customers.Partnerships like these increase the exposure of the smaller brand and can bring in new customer bases.Acquisitions statistically lead to enhanced growth and higher stock prices.Self-explanatory.I believe the gap we are seeing is not an area gap and will thus not close. My gap analysis and the sentiment analysis agree. From the earnings call, it seems that PYPL is experiencing another growth phase in which partnerships allowing this payment method to become almost ubiquitous.While the gap in PYPL is considered “fair” (i.e, not an over/under-reaction) by my analysis, sentiment hints that PYPL will continue moving upward."
4237924,102764,2019-02-04T14:09:58-05:00,"Investors reacted with negativity to the most recent earnings report from PayPal last week, sending the stock down by nearly 6%.Lower-than-expected guidance was the main weak spot in the report.However, the business fundamentals remain as strong as ever.PayPal's stock is offering an attractive potential for revalorization going forward.Overall, the recent decline in the stock looks like a buying opportunity as opposed to a reason to sell the stock.","PayPal (PYPL) reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2018 last week. Revenue during the quarter was in line with expectations, and earnings per share surpassed analysts' forecasts by two cents. However, revenue guidance came in lower than expected, and the stock fell by 6% in after-hours trading on Wednesday.In this context, it makes sense for investors to wonder if this short-term decline in PayPal's stock represents a buying opportunity, or if the stock should be sold before things get worse.For the full-year 2018, PayPal delivered $15.45 billion in revenue, up 18% on a spot basis and FX-neutral basis, or 21% normalizing for the sale of the company's consumer credit receivables. This was a record year for PayPal in terms of revenue growth since the separation from eBay (EBAY).In the fourth quarter, the company generated $4.23 billion of revenue, growing 14% or 21% normalized. Adjusted earnings per share increased by a vigorous 26% year over year, and the company is generating solid cash flows. Free cash flow amounted to 22% of revenue during the quarter, and PayPal returned $3.5 billion to investors through stock buybacks during the year 2018.Source: PayPal Investor RelationsFor the first quarter of 2019, the company is expecting revenue growth of 11-12% at current spot rates and 11-13% on an FX-neutral basis. Revenue guidance for the full-year 2019 is for a 16% to 17% increase versus 2018.This puts the revenue guidance for the full year in the range of $17.85 to $18.1 billion, while Wall Street analysts were on average forecasting $18.04 billion in 2019 revenue by the time of the announcement.We could say that revenue guidance was a little weak at the midpoint versus the consensus numbers, but the big picture still looks quite healthy overall.Source: Seeking AlphaIt's important to note that PayPal tends to be conservative when it comes to guidance, as management likes to underpromise and overdeliver. It would not be much of a surprise to see it reporting revenue figures above its own guidance in 2019, which would make the recent weakness in the stock price completely unjustified.When analyzing a company from a long-term perspective, the operational health of the business can be even more important than the financial metrics. After all, if PayPal is going to continue delivering solid revenues and cash flows, then it needs to keep gaining more customers and producing more value for such customers over time. Fortunately, the operational metrics for PayPal look more than healthy.The company gained 13.8 million net new active accounts last quarter. This is an acceleration versus an increase of 8.7 million in the same quarter during the previous. The number includes 2.9 million net new active accounts added from the acquisitions of Hyperwallet and iZettle.Source: Investor RelationsThe company processed 2.9 billion payment transactions, up 28%. Total payment volume amounted to $164 billion during the quarter, growing by 23% in U.S. dollars and 25% on a currency-neutral basis.Engagement is also moving in the right direction. PayPal registered 36.9 payment transactions per active account on a trailing 12-month basis, up by 9% year over year.Source: Investor RelationsPayPal is gaining new accounts at a record speed, while also generating solid volume growth and increasing activity levels among customers. Looking at these indicators, the business fundamentals remain as strong as ever.The payments revolution is barely getting started, according to data from Mastercard (MA), nearly 85% of all commerce transactions around the world are still being done in cash. Over time, new and more efficient payment methods will continue gaining ground versus paper money, and PayPal is positioned as one of the leading beneficiaries from such a trend.There will be a lot of competition in the payments industry, but PayPal is building alliances with many of the most powerful tech companies and financial institutions around the world. Management is playing it smartly by choosing to collaborate with bigger players as opposed to aggressively competing against them.Source: Investor RelationsThe market opportunity could be massive over the long term, so it makes sense for PayPal to focus its efforts on securing its position in such a market through partnerships with the most important players in the payments sector.Valuation is not unreasonable at all. The table below shows the price to earnings growth, price to free cash flow, and price to sales ratios for PayPal versus Visa (V), Mastercard, and Square (SQ). Looking at these metrics, PayPal is attractively priced in comparison to other successful players in the business.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123The PowerFactors System is a quantitative algorithm available to members in The Data-Driven Investor. This algorithm ranks companies using a combination of four main quantitative factors: Financial quality, valuation, momentum, and relative strength.Backtested performance is quite strong. The chart divides the market into five buckets based on their PowerFactors ranking, and it compares their historical performance versus the SPDR S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY). The higher the PowerFactors ranking, the higher the returns over time.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123PayPal has a really strong PowerFactors ranking of 97.58, with solid metrics across the four dimensions: quality (93.8), value (87.04), fundamental momentum (73.86), and relative strength (86.45). Based on these numbers, the quantitative indicators are pointing towards further upside potential for PayPal's stock going forward.Summing up, PayPal remains a remarkably solid business, with attractive growth opportunities in the long-term and trading at very reasonable valuation levels by industry standards. For these reasons, the recent decline in PayPal stock looks like a buying opportunity for long-term investors."
4212892,103480,2018-10-19T19:27:52-04:00,"PayPal shares jumped 8% after reporting strong Q3 results and bullish guidance, reversing a good portion of its October losses.Shares have been remarkably resilient in the recent tech downturn, showcasing investors' faith in PayPal's ability to continue growing.New monetization initiatives for Venmo are also likely to boost enthusiasm for the stock.PayPal remains the undisputed giant in the U.S. payments market, with TPV in the quarter still rising 25% y/y on a constant currency basis.","Perhaps it comes as a surprise to no one that PayPal (PYPL) came out with strong Q3 earnings. Shares of the online payments company have proven exceptionally resistant to the pessimism found in other tech stocks. I regret not having bought more shares of PayPal in the recent downturn; now, after posting Q3 results, PayPal is up 8%. This post-earnings surge reverses a good portion of PayPal's earlier losses and brings its year-to-date gains to 12%:PYPL data by YChartsTime and again, PayPal has proven that it is among the most consistent of the U.S. technology giants. Total payment volumes (TPV) on the platform have continued a strong growth pace in the mid-to-high 20s, further cementing PayPal's lead in the U.S. payments market. And note also that, relative to other markets like China, the U.S. is still underpenetrated when it comes to online and contactless payments, whereas Chinese consumers have gotten used to app-based payments like WePay to handle a great variety of everyday transactions.There are many reasons to be bullish on PayPal, and every pullback in the stock is an opportunity to buy. On a valuation basis, PayPal doesn't seem too stretched, unlike the majority of its peers in the tech sector (perhaps this is why PayPal suffered a milder decline in the recent downturn). A ~35x earnings multiple and a <6x revenue multiple for a company that is growing earnings and revenue at 24% y/y and 14% y/y, respectively, is still very reasonable.Note also that PayPal announced a $10 billion buyback program this year that can buy back more than 10% of the company's outstanding market cap, at current stock levels. PayPal remains cash-rich - its most recent balance sheet holds $8.15 billion of cash and $3.09 billion of marketable securities, against just $2.00 billion debt - a net cash position of about $9 billion, which could alone fund the entire buyback program. It also gives PayPal the flexibility to pursue accretive acquisitions, as it did with iZettle last quarter.Stay long on PayPal - this company still has plenty of room left to run.A discussion on the bullish case for PayPal these days almost necessarily includes a few points on Venmo, which many don't realize is a subsidiary of PayPal. Venmo, needless to say, has grown far beyond expectations and has expanded its market past the millennials that were its first adopters. Digital P2P payments in the U.S. are still in nascent stages relative to China, in Venmo is PayPal's key to cracking the market.In the third quarter, PayPal announced that Venmo grew total payment volumes by 78% y/y. This growth mirrors that of a startup and has helped PayPal maintain its overall growth rates. Note that, at $17 billion of total TPV in the quarter, Venmo is a sizable standalone service but is still only a small portion of PayPal, which processed $143 billion in TPV overall in Q3.Perhaps the most important aspect of Venmo from a shareholder perspective, however, is that PayPal is keen on starting to monetize the app. The company's first idea in tackling monetization is offering instant deposits at a small charge, but future monetization ideas are already in the works. The company has also recently rolled out Venmo payment options for Uber and Uber Eats, which have seen success, according to CEO Dan Schulman's remarks on this quarter's earnings call:Venmo is a defining acquisition for PayPal, similar to how Instagram is fueling much of Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) MAU/DAU growth. Momentum for Venmo appears to be at a strong inflection point, giving us confidence in PayPal's near-term growth trajectory.Here's a look at PayPal's full results for the third quarter:Figure 1. PayPal 3Q18 resultsSource: PayPal investor relationsRevenues grew 14% y/y to $3.68 billion in the quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations of $3.66 billion (+13% y/y) by one point. Supporting this revenue growth was a 25% y/y jump in total payment volumes (TPV), a metric that investors watch as closely as revenue growth:Figure 2. PayPal transaction metricsSource: PayPal investor relationsActive accounts, meanwhile, grew 15% y/y (a large number of which can be attributed to Venmo), while the total number of transactions rose 27% y/y. User engagement is also up across the board, with the transactions per user rising 9% y/y.What I found most encouraging in the transaction metrics, however, was the 10bps increase in transaction margin to 54.9%. This seems like a nominal improvement, but last quarter, transaction margins had dipped 30bps - so it's a relief to see that the drop in transaction margins in Q2 was not symptomatic of a larger trend.In this quarter's earnings release, PayPal's CFO also gave some bullish commentary on FY19 (a quarter ahead of when most companies do so). PayPal is expecting constant currency revenue growth of 17% y/y next year, 1.5 points of which will be contributed by recent acquisitions. In addition, PayPal is expecting EPS growth of 23% y/y, a continuation of this quarter's strong EPS trends.Bottom-line performance this quarter was equally strong. PayPal's ""take rate"" on transactions declined 17bps year over year due in part to the growth of free transactions on Venmo, but the company also noted that it gained 130bps of efficiencies on transaction expenses. Overall, this helped PayPal drive 142 bps of operating margin expansion to 21%:Figure 3. PayPal operating marginsSource: PayPal investor relationsPayPal also grew its net income by 15% y/y in the quarter - but, unlike many companies in the S&P 500, a good portion of this growth came from actual operating improvements, not tax reform. PayPal's income tax expense of $97 million actually represented 18.2% of pre-tax income, 250bps higher than 15.7% in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma EPS of $0.58 also grew 24% y/y and beat Wall Street expectations of $0.54 with 7% upside.There is plenty of fuel for bulls after PayPal's most recent quarter. Transaction volumes are holding at an elevated pace, and further monetization opportunities for Venmo provide a credible path to revenue acceleration in the coming year (which PayPal has already forecasted to, with its CFO's expectations of 19% revenue growth next year). Scale is also helping PayPal to gradually slim down its transaction costs, allowing it to produce great EPS growth.Perhaps most salient of all, PayPal has also proven its stock to be a port in the storm in times of volatility for other tech stocks. Gone is the fear that clouded PayPal when eBay (EBAY) announced it was replacing PayPal with Adyen: investors have come to believe in PayPal's long-term viability regardless, even absent its oldest partner. New relationships with American Express (AXP) and Walmart (WMT) will also be accretive to TPV growth. Stay long on PayPal - it's always a safe bet in a choppy market."
4213883,65113,2018-10-24T12:49:40-04:00,"PayPal (PYPL) has shown impressive growth in Venmo payment volume and overall earnings performance.Based on a projected 20% growth in free cash flow per year, a target price of $129 would mean significant upside from the current price of $84.With one out of every four actions taken by users on the Venmo app being monetized, I see overall payment volumes growing from here.","Back in August, I made the argument that PayPal (PYPL) could see more upside than I had originally anticipated.Specifically, I argued that while I was originally hesitant on PayPal’s prospects due to slow growth in free cash flow, the rise in earnings and net income by nearly 30% from 2017 was quite encouraging. Moreover, free cash flow had also been artificially lower as a result of the U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017.However, recent earnings performance has been very encouraging for this company. For instance, earnings per diluted share are up by 26% to $0.58. While free cash flow did decrease slightly by 8% to $772 million, revenue and earnings growth still continued to remain robust:Source: PayPal Third Quarter 2018 ResultsWith this said, we have seen that the stock price has not seen any upside since August, descending to a level of $84.78 at the time of writing:Source: investing.comSo, what’s happening on the price front? Is this simply profit-taking on the part of investors? If it is, it is hard to see how this would necessarily be related to PayPal’s earnings performance specifically. As one example, while Venmo did struggle initially to add to the company’s bottom line, total payment volumes did grow by 78% to $17 billion.It seems more likely that PayPal has been gripped by the market contagion that has fueled a sell-off of U.S. equities more generally, based on concerns of overvaluation. For instance, we see that since last month, PayPal is down by 3.90% while the S&P 500 is down by 4.34%:Source: investing.comIn this regard, I see a clear disconnect between price action and PayPal’s fundamentals, and would take this as an indication that this stock could be a buy at the current level.When I analyzed PayPal’s free cash flow previously, I estimated that the company could have a five-year target price of $129, which would mark a 52% upside from the current price of $84.78.Source: Author's CalculationsSpecifically, I anticipate that this is the point at which investors will start to see significant growth from Venmo in terms of its contribution to overall payment volume.Currently, it is reported that one out of every four actions taken by users on the Venmo app can be monetized, with payment volume on the Venmo app itself growing by almost 80 percent for the second quarter in a row. Should this trend continue, then I see it as very plausible that payment volume for Venmo will grow to a significantly larger proportion of PayPal’s overall payment volume.Taking this into account, I see no rational explanation for the sell-off, other than market contagion is leading U.S. equities lower, and PayPal has simply been a casualty of this trend. My view is that PayPal is trading at an attractive price given its growth performance, and I would rate the stock a buy at this point."
4213057,102764,2018-10-22T05:19:30-04:00,"PayPal stock is up by 26% in the past year on the back of impressive financial performance by the company.The most recent earnings report shows that the business keeps firing on all cylinders.The stock is priced for growth, but PayPal is not overvalued when considering the company's long-term potential.The stock still has a lot to offer in the years ahead.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) delivered both sales and earnings numbers above Wall Street expectations in the third quarter of 2018. Total revenue amounted to $3.68 billion during the period, which represents a year-over-year increase of 14%.The completion of the sale of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in July 2018 negatively affected revenue growth by approximately 7% during the quarter. This means that adjusted revenue growth was actually 21% versus the same quarter in the prior year.Total payment volume was $143 billion, an increase of 24% in U.S. dollars and a 25% growth rate on a currency-neutral basis. U.S. payment volume growth was 27%, and international payment volume growth was 22% on a currency-neutral basis.PayPal ended the quarter with 254 million active customer accounts, adding 9.1 million net new customer accounts during the period. This represents an acceleration in growth in comparison to prior quarters and even a new record for the company.Source: PayPalEngagement levels are also moving in the right direction. Payment transactions per active account increased 9.5% to 36.5, versus 33.3 in the third quarter last year. Overall transactions grew 27% to 2.5 billion during the period.Source: PayPal When investing in a growth stock such as PayPal, one of the main risks to consider is that growth tends to naturally slow down as the business gains size over time. However, that's hardly the case when it comes to PayPal. it is adding new users at a record speed, and engagement levels are also at record highs, which is clearly indicating that the company is still in a rapid growth phase.Another important risk factor to watch is that high-growth companies many times need to reinvest most of their capital to sustain growth, but PayPal is delivering both vigorous revenue growth and expanding profitability levels.Operating income increased 22% year over year last quarter, with operating margin expanding by 142 basis points and reaching 21.4% of revenue on an adjusted basis. Adjusted earnings per share grew 26% year over year.The company has a net cash position. PayPal ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $10.5 billion and short-term borrowings of $2 billion. Adjusted free cash flow during the quarter reached $772, representing a free cash flow margin of 21% of revenue.Abundant free cash flow generation allows PayPal to reinvest in the business and make acquisitions, while at the same time rewarding investors with cash generous distributions through stock buybacks.Management announced in May of this year that it's planning to return approximately 40-50% of free cash flow to shareholders over the next five years. In the most recent quarter, the company returned $600 million, and year to date it has returned nearly $3 billion to investors.Current valuation levels for PayPal are incorporating vigorous growth expectations, and the company needs to actually deliver in accordance with such expectations in order for the stock to generate attractive returns going forward. However, PayPal stock is not overvalued at all by industry standards.The table below shows forward P/E, Price-to-Earnings Growth, and Price-to-Sales for PayPal versus Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Visa (NYSE:V), Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), and Square (NYSE:SQ). PayPal is valued in line with other stocks in the payments sector.Importantly, PayPal still has enormous room for growth. According to management, approximately 85% of all commerce transactions around the world are still made in cash, and the total addressable market for the company over the long term is worth nearly $100 trillion.Image Source: PayPalManagement is playing its cards well in order to capitalize on such a gargantuan growth opportunity. Trust and brand recognition are key strategic advantages in the industry, and PayPal has a game-changing advantage in that area.According to data from an IPSOS study, having PayPal on a business’s site increases a consumer’s willingness to buy among both PayPal and non-PayPal users. The study found that consumers are 54% more willing to buy when a business accepts PayPal, especially in unfamiliar situations.The network effect creates a self-sustaining virtuous cycle of growth and increased competitive strength for PayPal. Customers want to have the payments methods that are accepted by lots of merchants, and merchants need to accept the payment methods that can bring more customers to the stores. Because of this, customers and merchants attract each other to a leading platform such as PayPal.Venmo looks like a particularly promising growth engine for PayPal in the years ahead. Total payment volume grew by an impressive 78% last quarter, reaching $16.7 billion, and with an annualized run rate now approaching $70 billion.PayPal is still in the early stages of Venmo monetization, but the business seems to be reaching a tipping point. Nearly 24% of Venmo users have now participated in a monetizable action; this is up from 17% one quarter ago and 13% in May of this yearSource: PayPalPayPal was recommended to subscribers in subscribers to my research service, The Data Driven Investor, in July 2017 at a price of $37.24, and the stock is also a position in my personal portfolio. Even after gaining 127% since then, I believe it still makes sense to hold on to the stock, because the long-term growth story in PayPal looks stronger than ever and the most recent earnings report shows that the business keeps firing on all cylinders.But the valuation is still quite demanding, so it makes sense to be cautious when building a position in PayPal stock. A smart approach would be starting with a partial position and increasing the size of such a position if there is any pullback down the road. One thing looks quite clear, PayPal is a high-quality growth business. As long as the fundamentals remain solid, any short-term dips in the stock should be buying opportunities for investors over the long term."
4212875,73185,2018-10-19T18:10:21-04:00,"PYPL stock jumped big in response to strong third quarter numbers.Those numbers reaffirmed the long-term bull thesis on PYPL stock, and underscored that secular trends remain favorable.So long as these secular trends remain favorable, PYPL stock will remain in an uptrend.Thus, for the foreseeable future, big dips in PYPL stock should be viewed as buying opportunities.","Global digital payments leader PayPal (PYPL) reported robust third quarter numbers after the bell on Thursday, October 18, which sparked a sizable rally in PYPL stock. More importantly, the numbers reaffirmed the company's secular growth narrative, and illustrated that PYPL stock remains a long-term winner wherein big dips are buying opportunities. As such, we think PYPL stock remains a good investment, and believe in the ""buy the dip"" motto when it comes to PYPL stock. PayPal's third quarter numbers were strong, and essentially eradicated recent market fears which had been baked into the stock price. Long story short, there's no worrisome slowdown taking place anywhere in PayPal's business, and current secular trends remain favorable. Constant currency revenue growth (adjusted for the sale of a credit receivables portfolio) was 21%, which is line with the 20%-plus growth rates PayPal has reported over the past several quarters. Total payment volume rose 25%, which also is consistent with the 25%-30% volume growth reported over the past several quarters (albeit at the low end). Merchant services volume rose 28%, which is somewhat slower than the 30% and up growth rates reported over the past several quarters, but not much slower. Active accounts rose 15%, slightly above the long-term average and in-line with the past three quarters. Payments per active account rose 9%, consistent with high-single digit growth rates reported over the past few quarters. Venmo remained red hot. Operating margins rose slightly, continuing a multi-quarter trend of gradual and steady margin improvement. Overall, the quarter was very good for PayPal. Growth is slowing somewhat in some areas, but not by that much and certainly not by enough to sound off any alarms (law of large numbers is simply kicking in at a gradual rate). At the end of the day, this is still a 20%-plus revenue growth company with 25%-plus payment volume growth, mid-teens account growth, high single-digit customer engagement growth, an explosive mobile segment, and healthy margin expansion. Because PYPL stock had sold off sharply into the report, affirmation that recent secular trends in digital payments have not broken sparked a rally in PYPL stock. That's why you are seeing PYPL stock jump in response to strong Q3 numbers.This rally is likely far from over. PYPL is a pure play on the digital payments revolution, a movement wherein cash payment volume is decreasing and digital payment volume is increasing. This trend is happening globally for multiple reasons, mostly due to the rapid rise in e-commerce. That e-commerce growth is expected to remain robust into the foreseeable future as it spreads beyond retail and into all of commerce. As such, global digital payment volume is expected to grow at nearly 15% per year over the next five years.Thus, so long as PYPL retains its market share in the digital payments world, this company guarantees itself a ~15% revenue growth rate over the next five years. There's actually reason to believe that PYPL grows its market share during that stretch, given the red-hot popularity of Venmo (transaction volume growth has remained resilient just below 80%). Thus, over the long term, we think that at a minimum, PYPL retains its current market share of the digital payments world and grows revenues at 15% per rate over the next five years. Assuming operating margins continue on their gradual and steady upward path, we think 15% growth plus slight margin expansion will power EPS to $4.50 in five years. That isn't too far off from the $3.50 mark analysts are looking for in three years, so we think $4.50 EPS in five years is a largely reasonable and consensus view. Larger payment peers Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) have historically traded around 25x forward earnings and have recently been awarded multiples in excess of 30x. Applying the average 25x multiple to $4.50, we arrive at four-year forward price target for PYPL stock of $112.50. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a year-end price target of roughly $85. That's exactly where PYPL stock trades today. Thus, while we don't think PYPL stock is that undervalued, we also think it is reasonably valued given conservative growth and valuation assumptions. Because big growth stocks have a tendency to trade above fair value for long periods of time, we do not doubt PYPL stock's ability to rally from here and head back toward $90. Indeed, history shows that big dips in the stock are usually followed by even bigger and longer rallies. History should repeat itself so long as valuation remains reasonable (which it does) and fundamentals remain strong (which they do). Overall, we think strong third quarter numbers affirmed PayPal's secular growth trends and further affirmed that PYPL is a ""buy the dip"" stock. The long-term uptrend in this stock will remain intact for the foreseeable future, so big dips like the one we just had should continue to be viewed as buying opportunities."
4212834,22148,2018-10-19T15:29:38-04:00,PayPal rallied following strong Q3 results.The stock recently traded down at $75.The stock trades in a wide multiple range suggesting investors look to buy the next dip toward 25/x forward EPS estimates.,"The recent dip provided the opportunity that potential PayPal Holdings (PYPL) investors have wanted for a while. Following Q3 results, the stock is back up into the $80s. The payments company still has significant growth levers in the digital payments world, making the stock a buy at the right price.Image Source: PayPal websiteDue to selling consumer credit receivables to Synchrony Financial (SYF), the revenue story is difficult to analyze. The company reports that actual growth was around 21% when adding back a seven percentage point hit from the receivables sale.With the growth opportunities in mobile and P2P payments, PayPal is going to consistently trade at lofty valuations. One of the best investment stories is when customer engagement growth doesn't require a company to constantly acquire new customers. PayPal is still seeing solid annual engagement growth of nearly 10% with customers only using the payments service about 3x a month. Every consumer makes far more than three payments a month.Source: PayPal FQ3'19 presentationFurther data from a commissioned third-party study by Ipsos show that consumers are more willing to make a purchase on a site that offers PayPal. Less familiar brands see a giant uplift of over 50% due to offering PayPal. Probably as amazing is the value of the PayPal brand when non-PayPal users see value when PayPal is available at checkout. Source: Ipsos studyThe study again highlights how PayPal has a huge brand advantage in the mobile and digital payments world. These numbers add up to further growth in both customers and far more engagement from existing ones. The brand is too powerful to expect any slowdown allowing investors to pay more aggressive prices for the stock.As with any stock, paying the right price matters. The stock recently dipped to $75 and my previous article argued for investors to wait for such a move. Following this 8% surge after Q3 earnings, the stock is in no-man's land now.Over the last year, PayPal has consistently offered opportunities to own the stock on dips toward 25x forward EPS estimates. One clearly doesn't want to purchase shares when the price reaches 32x forward estimates.At estimates of $2.80 per share for 2017, the price range is about $70 on the low end and $90 on the upper end. The price scale quickly rises when one starts looking at 2020 EPS estimates as 2018 closes.A similar 25% EPS growth in 2020 places the target at $3.50 per share. A 25x P/E ratio will have the low-end price target at $87.50 next year when the market shifts to 2020 numbers. My preference, though, is to buy weakness so either wait for the next dip or be willing to allow PayPal to rally from here without you.The key investor takeaway is that recent history suggests that the market will offer another opportunity to buy PayPal at more reasonable prices. The strong EPS growth won't leave much opportunity to pause, and possibly on buying weakness. Ultimately, investors are likely to do well owning the stock at $84. The question is really how well when buying on dips provides immediate rewards at reduced risks in comparison to chasing rallies.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

4212191,69965,2018-10-17T13:43:25-04:00,"PayPal is getting $6.9 billion for its receivables, and recent acquisitions give investors a hint about the future.The company has multiple growth engines, and they seem to be firing on all cylinders.PayPal plans to return 40% to 50% of its cash flow to investors. This should provide a tailwind for earnings for years to come.","With 244 million active accounts and billion in sales, some might worry that PayPal’s (NASDAQ:PYPL) fast growth days are over. Other investors might look at the fact that the stock has nearly doubled over the last two years and think they’ve already missed their big opportunity. The good news is there are at least three reasons to believe PayPal’s growth will continue. For those on the sidelines, waiting for an opportunity to jump in, now could be the opportunity you’ve been waiting on.PayPal took a critical step to expand its business by selling its U.S. consumer receivables to Synchrony (NYSE:SYF) for $6.9 billion. The company plans on using the funds to integrate vertically and move into new markets. PayPal isn’t looking at these funds as a one-shot M&A option either. The company’s CFO John Rainey said, “we are targeting $1 billion to $3 billion of M&A per year (over the next five years).”Two of PayPal’s strategic acquisitions give investors a sense how of the company plans to expand in the future. The company’s acquisition of iZettle for $2.2 billion is a clear indication that PayPal wants to get serious about its European business. In the last quarter, the company’s European revenue represented just 10% of the total. iZettle expects to generate about $165 million in revenue this year, and over the last three years, revenue has been climbing at a compound annual rate of 60%.iZettle offers point-of-sale offerings, analytics, invoicing, and business funding. Prior to this acquisition, PayPal Europe grew by just over 20% annually in the last quarter. With faster combined growth in Europe, and a toehold in Mexico and Latin America, iZettle should improve PayPal’s revenue growth over the short and long term.A second acquisition PayPal has on the docket is the company’s buyout of Hyperwallet. Though this deal is for significantly less than iZettle, it could have bigger implications. Hyperwallet, in its own words, allows “your organization to pay the planet through a single integration.” The company’s ambition seems to be to handle payment processing for companies of all sizes. Whether a business wants to transfer money to a bank, prepaid card, a debit card, or create a paper check, Hyperwallet can take care of it. The company’s scale allows it to take care of payments for the likes of Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), HomeAway, Scentsy, and Rodan & Fields. With the backing of PayPal, Hyperwallet could be the beginning of payroll competition.If PayPal can leverage its existing capabilities and integrate Hyperwallet to push into the payroll marketplace, this would open a new world of opportunity for the company. According to recent research, the global payroll industry is expected to grow to over $40 billion by 2026. Even if PayPal could capture just 5% of this opportunity, this would add $2 billion in annual revenue.Between iZettle, Hyperwallet, and future acquisitions, PayPal has many opportunities to expand its presence and grow revenue and earnings. John Rainey CFO said that PayPal is targeting between $1 billion and $3 billion in M&A per year. Investors should watch earnings and listen to the company’s conference call to see if they can pick up hints on where PayPal expands next.To the uninformed, PayPal may seem like a one-trick pony. The company grew out of a need to connect buyers and sellers on eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and blossomed from there. With over 240 million active users, it would make sense that transaction growth would track user growth. What is surprising is PayPal’s newer users seem more interested in the platform than its more seasoned users. PayPal’s CEO Dan Schulman called out this phenomenon in the company’s earnings call. He said, “our net new actives are more engaged than our previous cohorts.” His words aren’t just empty promises either, as active accounts grew by 15%, yet payment transactions jumped by 28% year-over-year.A second segment of growth for PayPal is coming from its mobile customers. To say that PayPal resonates on mobile is a vast understatement. There are customers who think of PayPal as a critical payment method, like Visa (NYSE:V) or Mastercard (NYSE:MA). According to the company, “52% of mobile customers said they made more online purchases because PayPal was offered.” This clearly shows that PayPal benefits the company offering the payment option, and of course, this drives more revenue to PayPal’s bottom line as well.”While spending more is an impressive reason for businesses to offer PayPal, what is more telling is whether a customer will avoid making a purchase because their preferred payment method isn’t offered. PayPal’s CEO noted that “one-third of all PayPal mobile customers surveyed said they will abandon a purchase if PayPal is not offered as a checkout option.”Another significant growth driver for PayPal is the company’s Venmo unit. Venmo is synonymous with money transfers among the millennial population. The unit’s popularity also gives investors something to watch when it comes to growth in the future. In a study conducted of over 2,000 millennials, 44% said they use Venmo most often to transfer funds, 19% said they use another method, and 35% said they don’t use a mobile payment app.When PayPal reports earnings, investors need to keep an eye on these key factors affecting the company’s growth. Any slowdown in user growth, mobile acceptance, or Venmo growth would represent a significant challenge to PayPal’s future.The third thing investors should watch for in PayPal’s next earnings report is any indication of a change of plans for share repurchases. In the company’s last conference call, Rainey said that the company plans to complete share repurchases equivalent to “40% to 50% of our free cash flow.”His comments weren’t a short-term goal either, as he was discussing a three to five-year plan for the company. With roughly $3 billion in net cash, and about $1 billion in core free cash flow in the last six months, PayPal can clearly afford significant buybacks.If we use the last six months as a guide, PayPal could have afforded between $800 million and $1 billion in annual share repurchases. With about 1.2 billion in diluted shares, and the stock at about $80, this level of share repurchases would equate to about 1% of the outstanding stock. However, what this calculation misses is PayPal’s potential growth in cash flow over time.Analysts are calling for better than 20% EPS growth over the next five years from PayPal. In the current quarter, PayPal turned 29% EPS growth into nearly 19% operating cash flow growth. Keeping these same ratios, it seems likely that PayPal could grow its cash flow by more than 10% annually. The bottom line is PayPal’s cash flow growth and commitment to repurchases should provide a tailwind for the stock for the next several years at least.PayPal is a fast-growing company that has actionable plans about how to continue its growth. Investors can keep an eye on PayPal’s core user growth and the transactions that come from these users. In addition, making sure that the company’s complimentary acquisitions seem to make sense is key. Outside of this, investors should keep track of the company’s commitment to share repurchases.PayPal stock sells for a forward P/E of about 28, and with over 20% EPS growth seems like a fair value. The company seems to be firing on all cylinders. Long-term investors shouldn’t sit back and wait. This may be the best opportunity you’ll see in a while."
4212141,20715,2018-10-17T10:27:26-04:00,PayPal will release earnings after the close on Thursday.The company has experienced strong earnings and sales growth in recent years.The stock's overbought/oversold indicators are the lowest they have been in over two years.,"PayPal (PYPL) will release earnings after the closing bell on Thursday and the online payment solutions provider is looking to keep the momentum going with its earnings and sales growth.Over the last three years, PayPal has seen its earnings grow at a rate of 22% per year. In the last quarterly report, the company showed earnings growth of 26% and analysts expect the company to grow earnings by 23% for 2018 as a whole.Sales have been growing at a similar pace with the 3-year growth rate at 19% per year and growth of 23% in the last quarterly report. Analysts expect sales growth of 13.1% for the third quarter and 17.8% growth for 2018.Those growth numbers in earnings and sales have helped PayPal garner really high ratings from Investor’s Business Daily’s EPS rating system and SMR rating system. The company scores a 92 in the EPS rating and it gets an A rating in the SMR category.In addition to the solid growth, PayPal sports a profit margin of 23.3% and an operating margin of 14.8%. The return on equity comes in at 15.1%.PayPal has seen its net income from continuing operations quadruple in the last four years and the company doesn’t have any long-term debt.This all adds up to a very fundamentally sound company and that is reflected in how much the stock has gone up in the last three years.PayPal went public in July 2015 and it languished below the $40 mark for the first six months of trading. In early 2016, the stock hit a low of $30.52 and then it started a rally that saw the stock gain around 33% over the next year. In early 2017, the stock pulled back to its 52-week moving average and then rallied sharply over the next 10 months - the stock nearly doubled during this period.The selling that hit the tech sector over the last few weeks caused PayPal to drop over 20% from its high to its low. It also took the stock below its 52-week moving average for the first time since mid-2016. It was at this same time that the overbought/oversold indicators hit their lowest levels since the company went public.The 10-week RSI and the weekly stochastic readings are both hitting their lowest levels since that Jun ’16 low and that could be a great sign. The stock was trading around $35 a share in June ’16 and it hasn’t been anywhere near that level since.Ideally, I like to buy stocks with strong fundamentals, a solid upward trend in the stock price, and overall pessimism in the form of low analysts’ ratings, a high short interest ratio, and a high put/call ratio. From a contrarian perspective, that is the ideal set up for a bullish trade.For PayPal, I would say the sentiment matches the stock’s performance. Analysts are bullish, but not overly bullish. The short interest ratio is low, but not extremely low. And the put/call ratio is in the average range.There are 44 analysts that rate the stock and 32 have it rated as a “buy” while the other 12 have it rated as a “hold.” This means that 73% of analysts have the stock rated as a buy. Given the gains in the stock and the strong earnings and sales growth, that is what I would have expected from the analysts.The short interest ratio is 2.03 and that is a little on the low side. The ratio has fallen in the last month, but that is due to the average daily trading volume jumping while the number of shares sold short hasn’t changed very much.The table shows how the short interest ratio has gone up since the last earnings report, but not by much - from 1.83 to 2.03. The number of shares sold short has gone up by 3.67 million shares while the daily trading volume has increased by approximately a million shares.The put/call ratio is at 0.80 and that is a tad higher than I would have expected given how well the company and stock have performed. There are 233,652 puts open and 291,710 calls open. The put/call ratio was also at 0.80 when the company announced earnings in July. The number of puts and calls open are both higher than they were in July, but the ratio is the same.Analysts expect PayPal to earn $0.54 per share on revenue of $3.66 billion. The EPS estimate has ticked down from $0.55 from 30 days ago.The company has beaten its consensus estimate in each of the last four earnings reports. In the last report, the beat was only by 2.6% and in the three previous reports the company beat by 5%-6%. Despite beating estimates, the stock hasn’t always reacted in a positive manner.In July, the stock moved lower after earnings, but the stock was in overbought territory based on the weekly oscillators. In April, the stock moved higher the day after earnings, but then slipped over the next few days. It is worth noting that the weekly oscillators were below the 50 level when the earnings were announced and the stock did rally from the end of April through the beginning of September and the stock gained over 33% from the low to the high.The two key metrics that investors and analysts will be watching when PayPal releases earnings are active customer accounts and total payment volume. These two measurements are the backbone of PayPal’s business and they have spurred the recent growth. Zacks is predicting 15.1% growth in active customer accounts and 27.2% growth in total payment volume.Obviously, there is a lot to like about PayPal. The fundamentals are among the best of all publicly traded companies and the sentiment is in line with what you would expect. The technical picture shows that the stock is as close to oversold as it has been in over two years.I am bullish on PayPal and I think last week’s selling pressure is presenting a great buying opportunity. If you are more risk-averse, you might want to wait until after the earnings report to buy. Even if the stock gaps higher, I think there will be plenty of upside in the coming months. If you are willing to take a little more risk, I think you can buy ahead of the report. Just be aware of how the stock has reacted in the past and don’t jump out of the trade if the stock drops a few percentage points."
4202469,65113,2018-08-28T07:53:44-04:00,"PayPal Holdings (PYPL) may have been seeing pressure on free cash flow, but this does not necessarily reflect business performance.
        Earnings growth for Q2 2018 was quite strong, up by nearly 30%.
        There may be more upside in this stock than I anticipated.","Last month, I made the argument that PayPal (PYPL) could see growth moderate significantly after having seen a massive rise in price since 2016.My reasons for stating this was primarily due to a significant drop in free cash flow per share. Assuming a growth rate of 15% in annual free cash flow over the next five years, I calculated that PayPal would potentially have a 25% upside in price left to a level of $108.Since then, the stock price hasn’t moved by a great deal, up to a high of $92 before settling to $90.10 at the time of writing:Source: investing.comThat said, some readers of my last article thought that my estimate was too conservative. As an example, it is speculated that true FCF growth could be closer to 20%, and that the growth in earnings will eventually lead to a rebound in free cash flow growth:Source: Previous ArticleIn my previous free cash flow analysis, I made the following assumptions:When free cash flow growth is assumed at 20% per year rather than 15%, this still means a nearly 50% upside from a price of $87 with a target price of $129:Source: Author’s CalculationsMoreover, when we analyse Q2 2018 results, earnings and net income performance continued to be quite impressive. Earnings per diluted share was up by 29% compared to the same period last year, with net income up by 28%.Source: PayPal Second Quarter 2018 ResultsMoreover, while free cash flow did see a significant fall, this was indeed affected by held for sale accounting, without which free cash flow would have come in at $737 million. Moreover, the decline in free cash flow also reflects the impact of a $125 million tax payment relating to the U.S. Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017.In this regard, putting aside the tax impact, free cash flow would have potentially come in at $862 million, which would represent a 15% upside from that of last year.That said, with earnings and net income up by nearly 30%, it is quite possible that free cash flow could stand to rise further. Additionally, when we look at the rate of growth in earnings relative to total expenses, we see that the former metric has been outpacing the latter on both a short and long-term basis:1-year growthSource: ycharts.com5-year growthSource: ycharts.comIn this regard, while free cash flow has been seeing a temporary decline, it is erroneous to look at this metric solely in isolation. Earnings and total payment volume have continued to grow at strong levels, and this will likely lift free cash flow in turn going forward.To conclude, it may well be the case that further upside in free cash flow exists than I previously anticipated, and a target price of $129 seems quite realistic.Disclaimer: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

4194652,20521,2018-08-03T16:41:19-04:00,"PayPal's cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $6.3 billion as of June 30, 2018.The company reportedly is ready to invest $3 billion per year on acquisitions to add specific capabilities.PayPal seems to be taking the acquisition route to compete.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) recently reported a strong quarter that topped estimates but its revenue outlook missed estimates.For the second quarter, PayPal reported revenue of $3.86 billion, up 23%. GAAP EPS was up 29% to $0.44 and non-GAAP EPS increased 28% to $0.58. Analysts were expecting earnings of $0.57 on revenue of $3.81 billion.During the quarter, 7.7 million active accounts were added, with net new active accounts up 18% to reach 244 million. It recorded 2.3 billion payment transactions, up 28% and $139 billion in total payment volume, up 29%. person-to-person (P2P) volume grew 50% to more than $33 billion and represented approximately 24% of TPV in the quarter. Venmo, the company's social payments platform, processed more than $14 billion of TPV, growing 78% over the same period last year.Driven by strong mobile engagement on its platform, PayPal processed approximately $54 billion in mobile payment volume, up 49%. In the quarter, mobile payment volume represented 39% of overall TPV.For the third quarter, PayPal expects revenue to grow 12%-13% to $3.62-$3.67 billion. GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $0.31-$0.34 and non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $0.53-$0.55. Analysts were expecting revenue guidance of $3.71 billion.For the full year, PayPal raised its revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance. It expects revenue to grow 17%-19% to $15.3-$15.5 billion. GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected in the range of $1.44 - $1.51 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $2.32 - $2.35.During the quarter, PayPal announced four strategic acquisitions.In May 2018, PayPal announced the acquisition of Swedish mobile payments company iZettle for approximately $2.2 billion in cash, roughly double the expected valuation through a planned IPO. While PayPal is used by major retailers around the world, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), iZettle is focused more on small-to-medium-sized firms. With the acquisition of iZettle, PayPal plans to expand its in-store presence.Also in May 2018, PayPal announced and closed the acquisition of AI-powered prediction platform Jetlore for approximately $16 million in cash. PayPal acquired Jetlore to accelerate PayPal Marketing Solutions.In June 2018, PayPal announced the acquisition of payout platform Hyperwallet for approximately $400 million in cash. With the acquisition of Hyperwallet, PayPal plans to enhance its payout capabilities, improving its ability to provide an integrated suite of payment solutions to e-commerce platforms and marketplaces around the world.In June 2018, PayPal also announced the acquisition of adaptive fraud prevention solution Simility for approximately $120 million in cash. PayPal acquired Simility to enhance its ability to deliver fraud prevention and risk management solutions to merchants globally.In July 2018, PayPal also announced the closing of the sale of its consumer credit receivables transaction with Synchrony for $7.6 billion. It also entered into an expanded agreement to collaborate with Synchrony Bank to expand PayPal's consumer credit offerings.PayPal's cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $6.3 billion as of June 30, 2018. During the quarter, the company repurchased 6.1 million shares of common stock, returning approximately $500 million to stockholders. Its board of directors also authorized a new stock repurchase program, under which the company may repurchase up to $10 billion in outstanding common stock, double its previous stock repurchase program, of which $2.7 billion is still available.PayPal seems to be plush with cash. It reportedly is ready to invest $3 billion per year on acquisitions to add specific capabilities. The online payment space is getting quite crowded with competing platforms from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba-backed Ant Financial, Square (NYSE:SQ), Skrill, Payza, and Stripe (STRIP). PayPal seems to be taking the acquisition route to compete with them. What is next on its radar? In particular, what's on the radar for India and Africa where online payments are projected to grow tremendously? The Indian online payment market is expected to increase five-fold to $1 trillion by 2023 while the Africa and Middle East market is expected to reach $78.3 billion by 2022.Paypal's stock is trading at $82.39 with a market cap of $102.04 billion. Its 52-week range is $92.35-$57.58."
4195662,104618,2018-08-07T08:33:58-04:00,"PayPal is a dominant payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide.The business has been growing rapidly due to their position in the secularly growing e-commerce market.Third Point, the well-respected activist investment firm, recently invested in the company believing the shares are significantly undervalued.We investigate each pillar of Third Point’s thesis and provide our view on PayPal's opportunities and obstacles.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) was built in the early days by a group of Silicon Valley icons - Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, Elon Musk, and Reid Hoffman, among others (collectively referred to as the “PayPal Mafia”). After being part of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for over a decade, PayPal was spun off in mid-2015 after pressure from well-known activist investor Carl Icahn.Since 2014, the year just prior to the spin-off, revenue has increased from roughly $8 billion to $11.4 billion in 2017 as active customer accounts have increased from 162 million to 227 million and payment transactions per active account have increased from 24.5 to 33.6.Like many spin-offs, PayPal is a unique company without a clear pure play, public competitor. This has caused some confusion in the marketplace for analyzing PayPal’s competitive position, unit economics, and ultimately their valuation.In the second quarter of 2018, Dan Loeb’s activist investment firm Third Point invested in PayPal. Third Point is known for doing deep research and shaking up large corporations, but their investment in PayPal looks to be a little different. They believe the CEO, Dan Schulman, is excellent and aren’t advocating for any changes. Instead, their thesis is predicated on four main pillars:We investigate each pillar of Third Point’s thesis - some that we agree with (Incremental Revenue Opportunities and Dominant Competitive Position) and others where we have concerns (Untapped Pricing Power and Significant Margin Expansion Potential).PayPal’s dominant position is predicated on the network effect created by their 244 million active registered accounts and 19.5 million merchants. Merchants want to sign-up to accept PayPal because they can then easily accept payments from nearly a quarter of a billion active PayPal accounts - which convert at nearly twice the rate of credit and debit cards. On the other hand, individuals continue to create PayPal accounts because more and more merchants accept PayPal, which is a much better user experience, as it allows consumers to seamlessly check out at online merchants, as well as increasingly offline merchants, all while protecting consumer payment data.Simply put, PayPal has solved the “chicken or the egg” puzzle that all networks have to overcome and continues to grow and grow as the network feeds on itself and becomes larger and larger.Third Point believes that PayPal has significant pricing power as they move away from a broader, “one-size-fits-all” approach for merchant pricing to a dynamic pricing model that reflects the value-add of a growing suite of products. For example, PayPal has a standardized 2.9% plus $0.30 pricing structure for their merchants with little differentiation from merchant to merchant regardless of size or other needs. However, now PayPal is segmenting their customer base, seeing where they can add more value, and then increasing pricing in those areas and actually reducing pricing in areas where they are priced too high.One way to measure pricing power and any potential trends is by looking at their “Take Rate” which is the net revenue divided by Total Payment Volume (TPV) and the “Transaction Take Rate” which is the transaction revenue divided by TPV. These ratios effectively measure how much PayPal gets paid on average for processing a payment.As you can see, the take rate has declined over time which means either their like-for-like pricing is deteriorating or the take rate on incremental TPV is lower than the historical take rate. Management has indicated that the latter explanation is the main reason for the take rate decline. Person to Person (P2P) payments, which includes their popular platform Venmo, has grown rapidly, generating incremental TPV, but generates very little revenue. Therefore, the overall take rate has declined.For PYPL to demonstrate pricing power, investors will need to see an improvement in the transaction take rate. This could be represented by a slowdown in the decline, a stabilization, or an outright improvement. As you can see below, to date, there has not been any clear trend indicating an improvement.So far, we have shown that PayPal has not historically demonstrated pricing power. However, could it be that PayPal is the lowest cost provider and thus has a pricing umbrella over it so it can raise prices?We do not believe this to be the case. All the major online payment gateways (PayPal, Stripe, Authorize.net, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Payments) charge the same transaction fee of 2.9% + $0.30. While there are nuances for different costs around fraud protection, recurring billing, international cards, chargebacks, and other customizations, there is not an obvious area where PayPal’s pricing structure is drastically lower than direct competitors. As a result, any increase in prices above competitor rates could lead to merchant attrition or merchants favoring other payment gateways over PayPal.PayPal’s plan to segment customers and find ways to add more value to improve pricing doesn’t sound like pricing power in the purest sense. Instead, it appears that they will have to invest in development, service, and support in order to justify any pricing increases. Thus, the flow-through of any pricing benefit to the bottom line will be more limited.Third Point believes the incremental revenue opportunity beyond the online payments growth will come from three key areas:Venmo MonetizationVenmo is a rapidly growing (TPV up 78% in Q2 2018) P2P payments platform owned by PayPal’s Braintree division. Historically, Venmo has not been a significant contributor to revenue. However, PayPal is trying to monetize the platform through fee-based services including instant transfers, co-marketing with other financial services providers, Venmo-branded debit card, and paying with Venmo at merchants. The monetization efforts are showing traction with 17% of Venmo users engaging in a monetization experience since the launch. We can make some rough estimates to get a sense of the impact of monetizing Venmo.The above estimate has a number of flaws, namely that they cannot monetize Venmo’s current TPV at anything close to that number. However, the key to monetizing Venmo isn’t necessarily monetizing the current TPV, although that is possible and they have efforts in place to do so, but monetizing the incremental TPV growth. In other words, the largest opportunity is for each incremental dollar of TPV that gets processed through Venmo to have a higher probability of being monetized than the previous dollar. If they are able to execute, then Venmo could eventually produce hundreds of millions or even over a billion dollars in revenue for PayPal.Dynamic PricingWe discussed this point above when we talked about pricing power. We have no doubt that PayPal can create additional features, such as reporting, compliance, cross-border transactions, etc., and upsell them. However, the opportunity - and ultimate impact to the bottom line - is difficult to quantify.Offline PaymentsPayPal, along with others, has been trying to crack the offline payments opportunity for a number of years but has yet to gain much traction. In order to gain a strong position in the offline market, in May 2018, PayPal announced the acquisition of iZettle, the “Square of Europe,” for over $2 billion. This immediately makes PayPal a player in the offline market ($21 trillion in global addressable spend according to Third Point). Whether they can cross-sell iZettle to their existing merchant customer base is another question.Overall, we think PayPal has a number of opportunities to grow and leverage their brands outside of the secular growth of e-commerce.Third Point believes that PayPal has a massive opportunity to improve their margins. They point out that PayPal’s 25% operating margin on net revenues (after transaction costs) is 20% – 40% lower than large-cap payments peers (Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Worldpay (NYSE:WP), etc.). They cite opportunities to reduce expenses in IT, customer service, and credit servicing and collections.We are more skeptical of PayPal’s margin improvement opportunity. Simply put, we believe PayPal’s business model requires significant investments in development, IT, and customer support and operations - while transaction costs cap the ultimate upside potential. To demonstrate this, let’s look at PayPal’s cost structure and how margins have trended over the last handful of years, a time during which revenue and TPV have grown significantly.As you can see in the table below, PayPal has done a nice job managing costs within their control (“In Control Costs”). Customer support and operations, sales and marketing, product development, and general and administrative costs have all been leveraged (gone down as a percent of revenue) as revenue has grown. These costs have decreased from over 42% of revenue in 2013 to roughly 35% of revenue in 2017.The main reason PayPal hasn’t shown significant margin expansion is because their transaction expenses have grown faster than revenue, going from ~27% of revenue in 2013 to nearly 34% of revenue in 2017. Transaction expenses are costs PayPal incurs to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions in order to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet (you can read more about transaction expenses in the 10-K here). The reason these costs have increased is twofold.Unfortunately, there is not a whole lot PayPal can do about this dynamic after signing agreements with the credit card companies ensuring that PayPal presents credit cards as a clear and equal funding option.As a result, we are skeptical that PayPal can significantly increase their margins without a drastic shift in the take rate or funding mix which doesn't seem likely. Thus, we don’t think it is prudent to compare PayPal’s margin structure to Visa or Mastercard. They simply execute different business models.PayPal is a great business solving real customer needs that has a long runway for growth driven by secular tailwinds, unpenetrated markets, and under-monetized assets. However, we do not think this business has significant untapped pricing power or massive margin expansion potential. As a result, like Carl Icahn who was a key driver for the spin-off and has since completely sold out, we do not think there is the massive mispricing in PayPal’s shares as some other market participants believe."
4194403,100036,2018-08-03T12:26:25-04:00,"With cash becoming a less popular option in today’s society, PayPal is poised to profit well into the foreseeable future.PayPal is putting its cash to work through both acquisitions and share buybacks which will continue to produce meaningful growth.Guidance for the full year 2018 has been increased twice, once after Q1 earnings and now again after Q2.With share buybacks and accelerating earnings, today’s P/E ratios are not the best valuation indicators.","After PayPal Holdings (PYPL) beat Q2 earnings estimates by a penny, raising its full year guidance, and authorizing a $10 billion stock buyback program, shares were down almost 4% in after hour trading on July 25th. Now, almost a week later and down nearly 10% from its 52-week high, PayPal Holdings may not sound like it’s a bargain at first; but if one takes a closer look at future growth potential and strong historical results, they may see the long-term value in buying shares today.Some highlights from the second quarter include: revenue increasing 23% to $3.86 billion on a FXN basis, EPS increasing 29% to $0.44, and the repurchase of over 6 million shares of common stock. Producing these numbers was remarkable growth in payment processing tallying $139 billion in total payments volume (TPV) which was the result of 2.3 billion transactions processed during the quarter. TPV and transactions processed increased by 29% and 28% respectively when compared to Q2 of the prior year, showing that the company is still growing at a respectable pace.Breaking down the growth by segment, mobile payments grew 49%, person to person increased 50%, and Venmo volumes grew 78%. Topping things off for the quarter, management upped full year EPS guidance to land somewhere between $2.32 and $2.35, meaning you can buy PYPL stock today for about 35.5x full year 2018 earnings. While that valuation does not imply a bargain by any stretch of the imagination, investors would be foolish to conduct their analysis on that sole metric and ignore the prevailing trends of payment processing which fall directly into PayPal’s wheelhouse.Venmo’s growth is just beginning and PayPal knows it too. With estimates pegging P2P payments topping out at $120 billion this year and doubling over the next three and Venmo only processing 11.6% of that volume, there remains ample opportunity for growth. While there are some who are wary that Zelle is superior given that it has more volume than Venmo, as in its latest quarter the company reported 100 million transactions totaling $28 billion in payments processed for its Q2.This is double the volume of Venmo’s $14 billion. Though Venmo had less volume in terms of dollars moved, PYPL had total P2P payments of over $50 billion in Q2 when counting PayPal and Xoom, representing a 50% increase year over year.While Venmo alone may not have as much volume as Zelle, when PYPL puts all its chips down, it handily beats out Zelle in terms of P2P payment volume. Additionally and equally important, PYPL has not begun to fully monetize Venmo, which has potential to become a significant factor in the company's earnings growth. Lastly, I do not think that mobile payment processing is a zero sum game and there can be multiple winners in the peer to peer space (P2P), one of which I'm confident will be PYPL’s stable of platforms.SourceWhen it comes to e-commerce, PYPL is a go-to choice for consumers as it allows the most pain-free way to complete your purchases at online merchants. A shining example of PYPL's simplicity is One Touch, in which consumers can forego the hassle of passwords, usernames, credit card numbers, and addresses. All users must do is activate One Touch, check out through PayPal, and click ""Buy.""Not only are customers able to avoid the pain of pulling out their wallet to find their credit card and type in the numbers, but they also gain the added protection PYPL offers them by utilizing them for processing the transaction. PYPL added 600,000 merchants to its system, which now totals 19.5 million.PayPal has been putting its money to work, making four acquisitions during Q2 including a fraud prevention specialist, a predictive artificial intelligence, and payment processing. This is an important part of PYPL’s growth strategy as it will allow the company to offer its customers unique solutions to serve their specific needs and with this ability, offer products flexible in features and pricing.This also fuels growth through more obvious means such as expanding their market footprint, as is the case with the purchase of iZettle, a Swedish mobile point-of-sale processor that has been commonly dubbed as the “Square of Europe.” PYPL sets aside $3 billion a year for acquisitions, as they view them as an important part of expanding their offerings as well as improving current ones.The company also announced an approved a $10 billion buyback, roughly 10% of the company’s market cap. Management is showing investors the love and returning value to them, and is likely to be funded from the $7 billion sale of its consumer credit portfolio to Synchrony (SYF). This reduced share count will of course help boost EPS as well, which will help with the long-term EPS growth.PYPL has performed admirably, trouncing the S&P’s returns over the past 5 years (146% vs. 36.15%) and has been a long-term investment in my portfolio with the intention of holding it forever (barring any black swan events). I of course check in with earnings and news, and this has been one of my most comfortable investments, which I am confident in adding to my position on dips such as these. Though many of the standard valuation measures today do not paint this stock as a bargain – investors should think for the long term and where this company will be in 5 years from now.SourceIf the company can stay on track and continues to post double-digit growth rates, today’s share prices are priced quite reasonably. Analysts are forecasting annual earnings growth of 23.7% through 2019 and a long term, five-year growth rate of 17.59%. I am confident that this is an achievable and sustainable growth rate for PYPL, which again, would make today’s share prices a BUY.While this may be one of my most comfortable investments, all investments have risks. I do keep an eye on PYPL’s competitors in the payment space, like Zelle, as mentioned above. Square (SQ) is another competitor I keep tabs on as well. Right now, a significant portion of PYPL’s future growth hinges on Venmo and it's important that Venmo continues to grow, when at the same time, PYPL must unlock Venmo’s value by monetizing the app.If they cannot, the earnings growth rate will be slowed and my thesis would have a setback. Secondly, I want to make sure that PYPL follows through and executes on its plans to offer more full-fledged and customized solutions to customers in the future. Lastly, as PYPL puts its cash to work and pursues acquisitions, they must be appropriate and a good fit for the company’s long-term goals. If the company does not sustain its impressive growth rate over the next several years, the share price will likely be driven downward significantly as the Street has placed high expectations on the company.PYPL is by no means cheap when applying traditional valuation metrics, but I feel that PYPL is a quality player in its market and the premium is warranted when looking through a long-term lens. PYPL should be able to sustain long-term growth rates in the double digits, as it continues to grow its offerings to meet the needs of consumers who are moving away from traditional cash payments. As we all know, with more time comes more risk, but I think PYPL’s upside far outweighs its downside and investors who can be patient and hold for several years or more will be handsomely rewarded."
4204387,102764,2018-09-05T23:26:13-04:00,"PayPal's stock is on fire lately, fueled by booming revenue growth and expanding profitability.On the other hand, valuation levels are getting extended.In this context, investors may be wondering if it’s already too late to buy PayPal's stock.Statistical research has proven that quantitative factors such as financial quality, valuation, momentum and relative strength are powerful return drivers for stocks.Based on these indicators, PayPal still offers attractive potential for returns going forward.","PayPal (PYPL) is delivering outstanding financial performance and the stock has gained nearly 50% in the past year alone. However, even the best companies can turn out being mediocre investments if the valuation is excessively high, and valuation ratios for PayPal are getting extended as the stock trades near record levels.In this context, it makes sense to wonder if PayPal's stock still offers attractive upside potential going forward or if the best is already in the past for investors in the company.In order to try to answer this question, the following paragraphs will be looking at PayPal's stock based on quantitative factors. Statistical research has proven that variables such as financial quality, valuation, momentum, and relative strength can be powerful return drivers for stocks over the long term. Let's find out what the numbers are saying about PayPal's stock and its potential returns on a forward-looking basis.The digital payments industry is growing at full speed, and PayPal is one of the main beneficiaries of such growth. The company competes against big players both in the tech industry and in financial services, but management is joining forces with many of the top players on both sides of the competitive landscape.Over the past several years PayPal has built partnerships with Apple (AAPL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Facebook (FB), and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), as well as card processors like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA). Similarly, the company is also building alliances with the big banks, including names such as Wells Fargo (WFC), JPMorgan (JPM), and Bank of America (BAC).Source: PayPalBuilding these alliances means that PayPal is making a smaller profit per transaction on the transactions that go through the company’s partners. However, when the market opportunity is big enough, prioritizing long-term growth above short-term margin is the right thing to do.Speaking of which, management estimates that the total market opportunity for PayPal is worth around $110 trillion over the long term, so the company certainly has a lot of room for growth if it plays its cards well over the years ahead.Source: PayPalThe business is clearly firing on all cylinders as of the second quarter of 2018. Total revenue during the period jumped 22.9%, reaching $3.86 billion and surpassing expectations by $50 million during the quarter. Total payment volume grew 27%, reaching $139 billion. PayPal ended the quarter with 244 million active accounts, growing by 15% year over year.Customer engagement is increasing, which bodes well in terms of measuring user satisfaction and the company's ability to generate value for customers. PayPal processed a record 35.7 transactions per active account last quarter, an increase of 9% year over year.The company is delivering vigorous growth rates across its most important growth engines. Merchant services grew 30.1%, cross-border trade increased 23%, and person-to-person payment volume rose 50% to more than $33 billion.Mobile is a crucial growth driver in the industry, and the company doesn't leave much to be desired in that area. PayPal processed $54 billion in mobile payment volume in the second quarter of 2018, which represents a 49% growth rate year over year and 39% the company's total payment volume.Source: PayPalProfitability metrics are also showing encouraging trends, operating margin increased from 13.7% of revenue in the second quarter of 2017 to 14.8% in the second quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP operating margin stands at an impressive 21.3% of sales, and non-GAAP earnings per share increased by 28% year over year.PayPal's stock is trading at a valuation premium versus the broad market, but this is to be expected since companies in the payments industry generally carry above-average valuations due to the industry’s attractive characteristics and profitable business model. In comparison to other companies in the sector, PayPal looks reasonably valued.The table below shows forward P/E, Price to Earnings Growth, Price to Sales, Price to Book Value, and projected sales growth for PayPal versus Mastercard, Visa, Automatic Data Processing (ADP), and Square (SQ).When considering growth expectations and valuation levels together, PayPal is priced in line with the sector. In fact, the company is the cheapest stock in the group in terms of price to sales and price to book value.Looking at the fundamentals in isolation doesn't tell the whole story behind a stock, since the fundamentals in comparison to expectations can have a huge impact on stock prices. In other words, when the company is delivering better-than-expected earnings and expectations about future earnings are increasing, this can be a powerful upside fuel for the stock.PayPal has a solid and consistent track record when it comes to delivering both sales and earnings above expectations.Source: PayPalThe chart below shows the evolution of the stock price in comparison to earnings expectations for both the current year and the next fiscal year. Unsurprisingly, price and expected earnings tend to move in the same direction over time.PYPL data by YChartsMoney has an opportunity cost; when you buy a stock with mediocre returns that capital is not available for investing in companies with superior potential. Besides, winners tend to keep on winning in the stock market, so you want to invest in stocks that are not only doing well but also doing better than other alternatives.The payments industry is on fire lately, as expressed by a 35% rise in the PureFunds ISE Mobile Payments ETF (IPAY) in the past year, far surpassing the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) over the period.PayPal is materially outperforming both the sector-specific ETF and the broad market, with an explosive increase of over 50% in the same period. Since strength begets strength in the stock market, this bodes well for investors in PayPal going forward.PYPL data by YChartsThe PowerFactors system is a quantitative investing system available to members in my research service, ""The Data Driven Investor."" This system basically ranks companies in a particular universe according to the factors analyzed in this article for PayPal: quality, valuation, financial momentum, and relative strength.The chart below divides the investable universe into 5 buckets based on their PowerFactors ranking, and it compares their historical performance versus the SPDR S&P 500. There is a clear and direct relationship between PowerFactors rankings and historical performance, this is to be expected when the quantitative system is robust and consistent. Also, companies with elevated quantitative rankings have substantially outperformed the market over the long term.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123PayPal's stock has a PowerFactors ranking of 90.36, the stock has a relatively low ranking of 53.9 when it comes to valuation, but it gets all scores above 80 in terms of financial quality, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.Past performance does not guarantee future returns, of course. A quantitative system is always based on past data and current expectations about future performance. If PayPal fails to deliver in accordance with expectations, then the stock will most likely deliver disappointing returns going forward, especially since PayPal's stock is priced for aggressive growth.PayPal was recommended to subscribers in The Data Driven Investor in July of 2017 at a price of $37.24, and the stock is also a position in my personal portfolio. Even after gaining over 140% since then, I believe it still makes sense to hold on to the stock, because the long-term growth story in PayPal looks stronger than ever.But valuation is still a relevant risk to consider. When building new positions in the stock, maybe it makes sense to start with a partial position and increase the size of such a position if there is any pullback down the road. One thing looks quite clear, PayPal is a high-quality growth business. As long as the fundamentals remain solid, any short-term dips in the stock should be a buying opportunity for investors over the long term."
4192761,98236,2018-07-31T19:28:32-04:00,"PayPal reported the results for its fiscal Q2 late last week.The results were a beat, and management tried to convey the strength of the business.There are a number of puts and takes that must be considered in analyzing this quarter for this company.In all, it appears that growth is actual re-accelerating at PayPal and may continue to do so for some time.PayPal's valuation, relative to its growth rate, is actually an outlier, but an outlier in the right direction.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares have dropped about 10% since the company released its Q2 earnings late last week. The shares dropped initially because revenue guidance, which was raised for the second time in the last two quarters, was apparently not raised enough to satisfy investors. PayPal indicated that the headwind from FX in the back half of this year will be around 1% of expected revenue. Much of the share price drop, however, was a function of the rout in tech stocks last Friday-Monday. As it happens, PayPal shares have experienced one of the more moderate performances in the enterprise IT space since the start of the year with a gain of just 15%. Their 12-month performance, with a gain of 44%, is quite a bit stronger on a relative basis.The relatively modest performance of the shares this year is primarily a function of the ending of PayPal’s partnership with eBay (EBAY), which will no longer use PayPal as its main payment venue starting in 2020. The impact of the end of the relationship has had more of an impact on perception than on the company’s operating performance outlook.The CEO and the CFO, in the course of the recent conference call, suggested that investors misunderstood company guidance which was supposed to depict a strengthening business outlook. Digging beneath the headline presentation suggests that there is validity to the assessment. The shares, while not exactly merchandise to be found in a bargain basement, are valued as they are because of some significant misunderstandings with regards to the “real” growth rate of the company. In that regard, the shares - although certainly not the specific business - present some analogs to the share price history of Twilio (TWLO), in the wake of that company’s business separation from Uber. I think PayPal shares are more than worth the effort to understand what is really going on with the company’s operational outlook.And that brings us to the investment thesis for these shares. PayPal remains the leading company in the e-payment space, and it has taken steps both through acquisition and through internal development to enhance its positioning in the market. The e-payment space continues to grow in double digits, and PayPal continues to grow its share within that space. It has enhanced its position through a series of well-regarded mergers whose benefits will become apparent in the 2019-2020 period. The company has made a practice of issuing cautious guidance, gradually increasing its outlook, but never quite as rapidly as investors hope to see. But that practice has left the shares at a reasonable valuation. The combination of a high-growth category, the leading vendor in the space, continued improvements in the company’s competitive position, coupled with strong expense management and margin growth in addition to a relatively reasonable valuation are the heart of the investment thesis for this company.PayPal has been a model of consistency in reporting quarters that have beaten consensus expectations, and the company has usually provided upside guidance to boot. Last quarter was no exception in that regard. Overall revenues grew by 23% as reported, while non-GAAP EPS grew by 28% to $.58. These numbers compared to the company’s prior forecast which was for growth of 20-21% with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.54-0.56.At the end of Q1, the company had forecast that its revenues would reach about $15.3 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $2.31-2.34. The company raised its full-year EPS estimate by $.01, less than the amount of the beat in this past quarter. The company raised its revenue guidance by less than 2% for the back half of the year. It was this guidance that led to the disappointment of some and a concomitant share price pullback. This pattern of conservative guidance and negative share price performance in the wake of the earnings release has been routine for this company for many quarters at this point. Investors should probably presume that the company will exceed its targets, both for this current quarter and for the year.It should be noted that the company’s forecast growth rate, which is in the range of 12-13% based on the First Call consensus projections for the next couple of quarters, will be impacted by the sale of its consumer receivables to Synchrony Financial (SYF). This transaction closed earlier in July and will reduce PayPal’s growth rate by about 700 basis points over the next 4 quarters.PayPal’s organic growth remains at around 20% or slightly higher. There may be some upward bias to reported growth when PayPal completes the acquisition of iZettle, which will add a bit more than 1% to the company’s revenues in Q4, an amount factored into the company’s forecast. PayPal’s other recently announced acquisitions will have a negligible impact on revenues although they will dilute reported EPS - one reason why the company’s forecast for EPS was not increased for Q3 and for the balance of the year. The recent acquisitions, which include iZettle, Jetlore, Hyperwallet, and Simility are forecast to dilute EPS by $0.08-0.10 on a non-GAAP basis for all of 2019. They will probably all close by the end of Q3 and will dilute full year non-GAAP EPS by something like $.02/share, primarily in Q4.Generally, one of the key components in analyzing any company in the payments space is its take-rate. To an extent, however, the value of that metric in analyzing PayPal is waning with the hyper-growth of its P2P payment segment - which of course doesn’t have a take rate. In Q2, the take rate declined, as reported, by 19 basis points from the results of Q2 2017. Of that decline, more than 70% was a function of the rapid growth of P2P volume, and the balance of the decline was a function of higher hedging costs when compared to that expense the prior year. While it is basically impossible for this writer to really know just how price competition is evolving in the payment space, overall, at this point, it doesn’t seem to have impacted the company’s take-rate or its ability to improve overall operating margins.I think it is important to note that at this point, reported numbers for PayPal’s growth are being hobbled to a certain extent by the gradual diminution of the contribution from eBay. At one time, eBay represented more than 30% of PayPal’s revenues. In 2016, that percentage had dropped to 22%. The company hasn’t explicitly reported the precise revenue contribution from eBay thus far in 2018. It has reported that last quarter, eBay volumes represented less than 12% of total of total volume and grew by 6% year on year. PayPal’s non-eBay growth in payment volume was 29%. Based on that relationship, PayPal’s growth rate, excluding eBay, is probably 200-300 bps higher than the levels it reports.It can be easy to forget sometimes that PayPal is the leading company within the fintech space. It clearly has many competitors. There are many alternatives to what it does, in whole or in part, but it dominates its categories, at least to the extent that Salesforce (CRM) dominates the customer relations software space. Over the years, PayPal has assembled what seems like a bewildering array of solutions that range far beyond the ability to pay for things with a PayPal account or a PayPal card. It is the breath of the PayPal payment offering, its platform, and the synergies that customers can derive from the use of multiple PayPal offerings that is one of the strongest competitive moats for this company.Some of the company’s statistics are striking. The company grew its new active user count to 244 million, up by 18% year on year, and it grew engagement, i.e. the number of transactions per its users, by 9%. There are many reasons for this level of success. The company has made it worthwhile for many financial institutions to allow users to link bank issued card to PayPal wallets and to open a PayPal account from their online channels.I may personally find this difficult to believe, but PayPal presented a metric from ComScore that claimed 52% of mobile survey respondents maintained they made more online purchases because PayPal was offered and one-third of PayPal mobile customers claimed they would abandon a purchase if PayPal were not offered as a checkout option.Some of the value add that PayPal provides to its merchants is obvious even though it may not resonate all that much with readers on this site. The company has added a personalized checkout experience by creating Smart Payment Buttons. I confess that those buttons will not be a service I expect to use anytime soon, although they will allow users to spend their money more quickly.And the company has been offering its One Touch service which allows users to fund their purchases by providing an automated procedure to populate required account information. Basically, the service allows users to complete their purchases more rapidly by storing their user name, password and billing info. Apparently, insuring that consumers can access their line of credit without friction and can spend their funds more rapidly is a big deal, and 55% of PayPal users surveyed said that they spent more because of this particular offering. Overall, one of the main growth drivers for this company has been the use of One Touch within the Mobile payment application, and Mobile payment volume growth was no less than 49% last quarter, with Mobile checkout now at 39% of total payment volume. Mobile with One Touch is a seductively easy way to pay for things and most readers will have seen users flash their phones during a check-out process avoiding anything so troublesome as finding their wallets. Sometimes investors look at the payment space as one that will commoditize. From time to time, in reading what constitutes major features within the space, I am tempted to think that way myself. But the fact is that I am not the target for all of this payment convenience - and the ability PayPal has to become a preferred payment platform rests on its ability to make its own trends within its targeted markets. I think when investors look at the valuation for this name, and its potential forward growth rate, the statistic about mobile payment growth, really the future of payments for millennials, if not already the present, is one on which they might focus profitably.Another significant growth driver has been Venmo, which is now starting to produce revenue rather than just engagement. Every time I have the occasion to write about this company, I continue to shake my head at the level of volume that Venmo is processing and its growth rate, especially now that so many other banks offer what is apparently a similar service. Last quarter, payment volume was $14 billion, up 78% year over year, and it is apparent that the Venmo service is creating a significant level of network effect for PayPal with its value proposition - or so the conference call script said.I have to confess that though I got a Venmo account at one point, it never tempted me to send money to anyone, or to make extra expenditures, or to take out a loan - but in that regard, I realize that it would be wrong for me to presume to represent myself as a typical user of Venmo. The fact is, that for whatever reason, Venmo continues to have great appeal as a payment paradigm amongst millennials and that their attachment to the paradigm is apparently starting to lead to monetization. While I have no real way of trying to extrapolate a revenue trend from Venmo, it is another factor in the PayPal growth story that probably remains under-appreciated.Last year, PayPal bought a company called Swift Financial, which is a funding source for smaller businesses. While PayPal has offered some form of working capital to its business users, the acquisition of Swift, designed to compete in part with the offering of Square, was designed to jump-start that business. These days, when a user logs into their PayPal account, they are often greeted with a commercial offering a Working Capital loan. It is clear, based both on this acquisition, and some of the other transactions described below, that this is a focus business for PayPal. While it is currently trivial as a revenue stream, the opportunities are quite substantial. Just this morning, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), which offers a capital service to its merchants, announced that it grew advances by 84%, although the amount in dollars is still rather small. Given the scale of PYPL, I expect that its capital program can easily reach critical mass. During the course of the conference call, the CFO suggested that some of the proceeds from the $7 billion sale of receivables to Synchrony will be used to further increase the volume of consumer and merchant credit offerings.In the last quarter, PayPal has gone on its own buying spree, although it certainly doesn’t need to use a PayPal credit card to fund its acquisitions. Of the 4 acquisitions that were announced last quarter, iZettle is likely to be the most consequential, and indeed, in time, depending on execution, it is not unlikely to that it could add several billion dollars of annual revenue. iZettle is a Swedish company. Essentially, iZettle offers solutions that pretty much match those offered by Square (SQ), but with a concentration in Europe and Latin America where Square has no real presence at this point (except recently in the UK). iZettle is just 8 years old at this point. iZettle is a relatively small company, with a revenue projection of $165 million this year, but its opportunity is substantial, given that Square is likely to reach a $2 billion annual revenue run rate sometime over the next 12 months.In addition to iZettle, PayPal is spending $400 million to buy a company called Hyperwallet. Hyperwallet, as its name might suggest, is a company that allows its customers to make payouts globally in local currency. The company simplifies the outbound payment process and includes integrated tools that help with tax reporting. Its offering includes prepaid cards, global bank deposits, cash pickups and check delivery services. One might anticipate that adding Hyperwallet’s services, to PayPal’s scale and platform ought to result in substantial revenue synergies.PayPal also announced an agreement to buy a company called Simility. Simility is basically a start-up (it is only 4 years old and has fewer than 50 employees). The company has developed a machine learning technology that can provide analysts with insights and data visualization to mitigate fraud exposure. Presumably, PayPal will be able to achieve some significant level of user acceptance of this technology within its merchant base.PayPal also scooped up something called Jetlore, which describes itself as ”born in AI with a stronghold in retail. The final puzzle piece of CRM.” It is basically a predictive analytics platform which supposedly optimizes content. I assume that this will be another offering of PayPal to its merchants.Finally, PayPal made a $125 million investment in a business called Pine Labs. Pine Labs offers a smart, cloud-based POS device in India, but like Square, it also offers users customer analytics, transaction dashboards and loan services. Pine Labs has already acquired some relatively large users in India, including Nike (NYSE:NKE), McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and KFC. Potentially, with a strong relationship with PayPal, it could become a significant factor in Indian e-payments and help PayPal secure global engagement with the largest sellers, looking for a payment platform with a strong Indian presence.I would be surprised if all of these acquisitions work as anticipated. But I do think that in considering what PayPal’s growth rate might be on some kind of a steady state basis, the impact of these newly acquired technologies will be noticeable, perhaps by 2020. Overall, in this latest conference call, the CEO suggested that the addressable market for the various e-payments solutions offered by PayPal was $100 trillion. I assume that is supposed to be the total market opportunity as defined by payments. At the moment, PayPal’s payment volume is just reaching $600 billion. So, to the extent that market research statistics are credible, PayPal’s runway is enormous, and the acquisitions it has announced will allow it to better address its potential.Are there risks to investing in PayPal? Of course, there are. The most obvious risk relates to the company’s need to continue to innovate. What is going to be the next One Touch? Since I never thought One Touch would prove to be as fantastic as it has proven to be as a growth driver, I will, so to speak, withdraw to a neutral corner and avoid making any more comments about how PayPal facilitates consumer spending.But PayPal has some of the best talent in the space - I have remarked in the past about the ability of Bill Ready, but the company has a team of innovators who really are the best and the brightest in this space and a well-oiled, well-disciplined process of controlling its direction.With its multiplicity of new ventures that I outlined above, in addition to the recently acquired Swift and Tio, as well as a venture stake in a business called PPRO Group, the company’s payment portfolio has become quite diverse and presents risks in term of span of control.I have read that some investors were unhappy that the company is choosing a capital return strategy that will send $10 billion back to shareholders by way of buybacks and will perhaps restrict the level of acquisitions the company can make. The fact is that there are just a limited number of iZettle’s that can be bought, and they cost a fortune to buy and inevitably result in immediate dilution. I would rather see this company execute well with the portfolio it has assembled than continue the cadence of acquisitions seen last quarter.The two biggest risks to investors are those of commoditization/pricing and saturation. I do not intend to expand this article to book length, despite what some readers may think. That said, every time take rates dip, investors are concerned that the space is commoditizing and that PayPal’s business model will be threatened. I have tried to review in this article just some of the features that PayPal offers its customers/users that appear to be unique, and which are the building blocks of the company’s competitive moat. It seems to me, that for the most part, PayPal’s competitors, while trying to imitate features (the Zelle initiative, which is the answer of banks to the success of Venmo is an example), usually come up a bit short. But the risk is out there and needs to be considered.Finally, there is the issue of saturation-well at some point. One often reads the statistic that 85% of payments are still made without using technology. I am not totally sure of the definitions used to compile such a statistic. There are transactions such as buying a house or a car, which do not seem amenable to the solutions offered by PayPal. I have no way of discerning the real level of penetration that e-payments has made in terms of what is a realistic addressable market. That is a concern to be sure, but not one that has immediate investment relevance.As I am writing this, lots of tech valuations have been compressing. Some will say that this is a long over-due re-rating. I have written to the subscribers of my service that based on operational performance and the outlook for operational performance, that is not the case. But rotation and divergence are not things that are readily forecastable - at least not by this writer. I will just try to offer the valuation metrics I see and draw conclusions not based on the psychology of the last few days.I am going to add about $7 billion to PayPal’s cash balance in this analysis. The transaction selling its consumer receivables to Synchrony has closed, and PayPal has received the funds. The revenue estimates have been adjusted for the sale, and thus it makes sense to adjust the cash balance and the enterprise value as well. I won’t try to make any adjustment for the massive share buyback authorized by the board although presumably, outstanding shares will drop. Presumably, much of the cost of the buyback will be funded by the cash from the Synchrony transaction.At this point, PayPal’s outstanding share count is 1.2 billion, and its market cap, as of this writing, is around $98 billion. Its current enterprise value comes to about $87 billion. The 12-month forward revenue estimate for this company is around $17 billion, and that leaves the EV/S at a very reasonable 5.1X.The company’s latest forecast for EPS combined with the First Call analyst consensus for 2019, yields a 12-month forward EPS estimate of about $2.60. I think earnings will turn out better than the current forecast, given past history and the cadence of earnings revisions. In any event, using the current consensus estimates, the forward P/E of 32X, is also quite moderate, especially given this company’s growth opportunity.PayPal’s reported operating cash flow is not comparable to the operating cash flow of most other IT vendors as it includes net new loans held for sale. Usually, these loans are excluded from looking at cash flow from operations. PayPal’s stock based compensation expense is relatively small, and other factors impacting cash flow are mainly related to the balance sheet and to transaction losses or gains. Operating cash flow ought to track closely to non-GAAP earnings. Overall, operating cash flow is running at about 19% of revenues and should thus reach around $3.2 billion over the coming 12 months. At that level of operating cash flow, the free cash flow yield will be of 3.7%, a reasonable although not an incredible number.Should readers buy PayPal shares at this point. I think the valuation, both absolutely and on a relative basis is very attractive. I have suggested earlier in this article that excluding the impact of eBay from the analysis makes lots of sense. While it is not really possible to do so without some specific input from the company, my estimate is that the EV/S ratio would rise from its current level to about 5.7X. On the other hand, the organic growth forecast for the company would reach the 23-25% range. I am not too sure if there would be any substantial impact on operating margins. But I know that I think the relationship of 23% growth and an EV/S of 5.7X is one that seems quite favorable for investors and is significantly less than peer companies.I do wish the company paid a dividend which it can well afford, given that it is generating $3.2 billion/year of free cash flow. Sadly, at least for me, it does not. But it will certainly be a name I watch for inclusion in my portfolio when my portfolio has room for additional names."
4202146,101543,2018-08-26T18:05:49-04:00,"PayPal has a dominant payment ecosystem within the digital space.
        The business has a feedback loop within its network creating a virtuous circle.
        The valuation is reasonable when thinking in terms over the next decade as the platform continues to grow.","Time arbitrage and the proper mental framework have led me to PayPal (PYPL). I say this because PayPal currently looks expense from standard valuation metrics, but shouldn't be, when looking out 5 years coupled with calculating true cash earnings. In addition, e-commerce continues to grow at prolific rates, where PayPal services truly live. The backdrop of the investment theses is the continuation of online and mobile consumption. One simple way to follow how much value Paypal is accruing every quarter is just by reviewing their Total Payment Volume (TPV). Exhibit 1: Current TPVSource: 2nd Quarter 2018 Earnings SlidesYes, 10% of the payment volume does include Venmo, which has very little monetization strategies, but management is working on this. In addition, the service does add float. Moats are talked about a lot in the investing world, maybe sometimes to much. A moat is basically a structural advantage a company has over a competitor through cost leadership, networks effects, etc. PayPal has created a wonderful network effect through consumers and merchants. It has overcome the chicken and the egg problem. With now 244 million active accounts on its platform the network effect keeps burying its roots into the digital landscape making it even stronger. This metric has been growing over a 10% clip each quarter providing more reason for merchants to use PayPal as a checkout option. It's a virtuous circle making PayPal more attractive today than a year ago, and it will be the same next year, and the year after that. Exhibit 1: The Virtuous CircleSource: Author's WorkAlong with this Virtuous Circle comes a nice tailwind over the next half decade. Statista predicts e-commerce retail sales to almost double in 5 years. PayPal lives in the e-commerce world outside of Amazon. It has partnerships with some of the best known brands in the world. I've view PayPal as a royalty on e-commerce and mobile spending that should play out nicely for the long-term investor. We can see signs of this just by reviewing one metric - payment transaction per active account. This metric has continued to increase showing the usage of PayPal's payment and money transfer solutions are becoming a habit for its users. As an investor, I want exposure to this stream of transaction fees. In addition, some developing countries are at the cusp for continued economic growth and PayPal will continue to try and capture their share of this growth through direct services or by partnerships. It's a big world out there, and I think PayPal is still on the early innings of providing payment solutions for merchants and consumers worldwide.I estimate PayPal sells for 34x earnings net of cash while adding back estimated costs for growth strategies. On a forward 2019 basis it would be 28x earnings. It might seem to be a high valuation, but there are caveats to this old logic. Management estimates earnings per share growth of 20% and revenue growth of 17% over the next 3-5 years. With such compounding metrics, it can be difficult to estimate what's a fair price. I see PayPal's valuation within the reasonable range as the forward basis is 28x earnings. I much prefer to buy a company that does the compounding for its shareholders. To put the valuation another way, PayPal is attractive as the ecosystem is growing in two ways. Active accounts and transactions per active account. What gets me excited most is the real possibility of 500 million active accounts on the platform in the next 5 years, layered with a growing per account usage. This would create powerful network effects making the virtuous circle to continue to go faster past any 3-5 years projections.The company offers all attractive qualities from strong returns on invested capital (close to 20%), long runway, and an ecosystem that will continue to get stronger as the company grows. Yes, it would be nice to get PayPal at a cheaper price, and that could be a possibility, but viewing the investment in terms of the next decade should be advantageous - even contrarian looking in such a short-term thinking environment like Wall Street. The moat will continue to only get stronger with its feedback loop as shown above.

4193685,104662,2018-08-02T11:38:05-04:00,PayPal's stock has suffered a sell-off since the Q2 earnings release.But recent acquisitions and the growth of fintech provide a bullish future for PayPal.I highlight how PayPal is executing their vision and why PayPal is a long-term buy and hold stock.,"PayPal’s (PYPL) innovation is based on a simple model: Buy fast-growing, disruptive fintech companies, and combine them together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. And it’s working. Despite an earnings “miss,” the earnings call (transcript here) cemented the fact that PayPal is going to be a fintech force for the long term.In a quarter that saw once impenetrable stocks like Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) disappoint investors, and possibly start a tech sell-off, any bad, or even not great news, has caused shares to drop for most tech companies. This environment has caused PayPal to see its shares drop about 10% from July 25, despite an earnings beat.This PayPal sell-off looks like investors prefer short-term revenue and profit, in exchange for long-term business model growth. But before we explore this, we first need to understand their bearish concerns.PayPal beat earnings expectations and revenue expectations, with a $0.58 EPS vs. $0.57 EPS forecast, and revenue beat the forecast by $50 million for the quarter. This led PayPal to see a 23% percent revenue growth year-over-year. But the disappointment came with PayPal’s Q3 guidance, where they expect revenue to be between $3.62 billion and $3.67 billion, vs. a $3.71 billion estimate. This miss has led to the PayPal sell-off.However, investors need to understand the whole picture, not just the financials. Where is PayPal heading? “Our strategic decision to become an open platform committed to partnerships has increased the value that PayPal can offer our customers, both consumers and merchants,” PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said in the press release. PayPal is positioned to fully take advantage of the global fintech adoption growth, and I believe PayPal is giving a clear vision for how they plan to do this, and investors should be excited.Before diving into PayPal’s value offerings, it’s crucial to understand the growing fintech industry. Outside of China, which saw fintech rise due to structural need, the rest of the world is still in the process of embracing the core features of fintech. It's currently estimated that the average adoption rate for most fintech offerings is at 33%, firmly in the early majority stage of the innovation curve theory (for investors looking for the full fintech adoption report, it can be found here).Source: Lumen LearningIn fact, it can be argued we are at the tipping point of the innovation model, with nearly $30 billion in investments going toward fintech in 2017. PayPal also is an investor in this area, where they have committed to spend $3 billion annually on acquisitions.Innovation takes two forms: Creating it yourself, and buying it. Fintech is wide, and encompasses anything that involves money. PayPal’s innovation strategy is to save money on trying to develop new product offerings that may or may not take off, and focus on waiting to see what's working, then acquiring these companies and creating value by adding it to the PayPal operating system.In the last quarter, PayPal made four big acquisitions. With their innovation model of acquiring companies then adding them to their ecosystem, PayPal provides a nice graphic explaining the value addition of each purchase.Source: PayPal Investor RelationsiZettle serves as PayPal’s point of sale offering to consumers. This acquisition expands PayPal outside of the digital space, allowing PayPal’s operating system to expand to small businesses that rely on physical purchases. iZettle also will act as an introductory point for the PayPal ecosystem. Small businesses will start using the point of sale offering. Then as they grow, these businesses will expand into other features PayPal offers.Simility and Jetlore are acquisitions that PayPal likely saw as offering an improvement to their current services in the same area, and aren’t as exciting as the others. But, perhaps more than iZettle, investors should be very excited about the Hyperwallet acquisition. Hyperwallet provides a platform that allows a centralized solution for businesses to dispense payments across the globe. This allows companies to pay their vendors, contractors, and merchants in various countries and currencies, and accommodate different methods to suit individual use cases.But why this is so important for PayPal is that it moves the PayPal operating system to effectively become a one-stop shop for the entire commerce needs for companies. Companies can use PayPal to receive money from consumers, send money throughout the organization, pay vendors, merchants, or contractors, all while offering a single platform for the company to easily monitor the whole payments ecosystem.Three years ago, PayPal laid out their vision. They want to provide an operating system for commerce. After these recent acquisitions, investors are finally seeing the foundation for what this platform will look like in the future. PayPal’s wait and see approach toward innovation, though which may lead to expensive purchases, allows PayPal to determine what works, and what can be added to the operating system.PayPal told investors their plan, and they are executing it. All of these acquisitions follow this blueprint, and even though it may hurt in the short term (having to expand by acquisitions, and paying for costs associated with it), I believe PayPal has proven that they have a vision and they are executing it. And with the current state of the fintech industry, PayPal is in an excellent position for their plan to succeed.These three factors lead me to believe PayPal is a buy for the long term, and the post-earnings drop is a gift for investors to enter a position. Although there’s currently high volatility in tech, I see PayPal as a long-term buy and hold stock, with excellent potential to continue to outpace the market.Disclaimer: The above references an opinion and is for information purposes only.

4191864,103480,2018-07-30T08:18:40-04:00,"PayPal, the leading online P2P provider in the U.S., has stumbled after posting Q2 results that marginally beat analyst expectations.Earnings also showed strong growth, up 29% y/y.Weak third-quarter guidance is the largest cause behind the stock decline, though PayPal has explained that a strengthening dollar was the primary cause behind the outlook, not a business slowdown.A series of accretive acquisitions and a new $10 billion buyback program are additional reasons to get behind PayPal.","The Q2 earnings season so far has been extremely unkind to some previously high-flying favorites - including Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Twitter (TWTR), and now PayPal (PYPL). The first three of these companies faced serious issues on the user/subscriber growth side that contributed to their monumental stock declines - PayPal, however, showed nothing but ""business as usual"" in its strong total payment volumes (TPV) and active user counts. Rather than view PayPal's Q2 earnings reaction as a stumbling block, I'd rather view PayPal's decline as an opportunity to buy a perennially expensive name at a slight discount.That's not to say, of course, that PayPal is now cheap. Shares are up 45% over the past twelve months, and the company's 16% YTD rise far eclipses the performance of the S&P 500. Yet outside of this quarter, PayPal's ability to post strong ""beat-and-raises"" is unparalleled by other companies in the consumer technology sector, and its ~30% earnings growth still justifies its >30x P/E ratio.PYPL data by YChartsBlame the strengthening dollar for the company's weak guidance. Investors don't have a problem with this quarter's strong results, but are turning a wary eye to the company's outlook for just 12-13% y/y revenue growth in Q3, a ten-point deceleration from this quarter's 23% y/y revenue growth. John Rainey, PayPal's CFO, noted the following on the company's Q2 earnings call:So what we can gather from this information - as well as the disclosure that the sale of credit receivables to Synchrony Financial impacted full-year revenue growth by approximately 3.5 percentage points - is that PayPal's underlying business is fine, but momentarily rocked by external factors. When looking at PayPal from the perspective of a long-term investment, I'm less concerned about near-term currency fluctuations that are having revenue headwind impacts in the next one or two quarters. Investors should be more placated by the fact that PayPal has a wide moat in the U.S. payments market, especially with the leading P2P platform in Venmo. Venmo's TPV (total payment volumes) of $14 billion in Q2 grew 78% y/y, now about half of PayPal's total P2P volumes of $33 billion (+50% y/y).PayPal's guidance has also noted that it expects pro forma earnings per share to grow 500bps ahead of revenue growth. Even if revenue growth does clock in at the mid-teens, a ~20% EPS growth rate still implies vast margin expansion.More reasons to be bullish on PayPal: the company is committed to growing even through M&A, and spent nearly $3 billion on acquisitions in the second quarter, with $2.2 billion alone spent on iZettle, a payments unicorn that is focused on small business and will help PayPal compete more completely against the likes of Square (SQ). But the company isn't dumping all of its cash hoard ($6.3 billion as of the end of Q2) on M&A; it has also announced a new $10 billion buyback program that can add additional fuel to the company's EPS growth. With PayPal's current market cap at just over $100 billion, this buyback can retire about 10% of PayPal's outstanding float and contribute significantly to EPS.Take the near-term stumble as an opportunity to build up a PayPal position. Shares typically don't feel pressured for very long, and the long-term bullish story remains very much intact.Here's a look at PayPal's Q2 results:Figure 1. PayPal Q2 resultsSource: PayPal investor relationsWe'll acknowledge that while PayPal still beat expectations this quarter, it did so with a much thinner margin relative to prior quarters. Total revenues grew 23.0% y/y to $3.86 billion in Q2, beating Wall Street's expectations of $3.81 billion (+21.4% y/y) by just 160bps. For some context: this represents 80bps of deceleration to PayPal's revenue growth of 23.8% in Q1, where it beat Wall Street expectations by 340bps (about twice as much as in this quarter).The strengthening dollar has taken a toll on PayPal's growth, but the underlying payments volumes seem to still be strong. The below chart shows an excellent snapshot of those stats:Figure 2. PayPal payments metricsSource: PayPal investor relationsTotal payment volumes grew 29% y/y to $139.4 billion in the quarter, which represents a small amount of deceleration from Q1 on a nominal basis, but the constant-currency growth rate remained level at 27% y/y.Also notable is the fact that PayPal continued the same 15% y/y pace of growth in its active accounts, while the number of payments stepped up to 28% y/y growth. In my view, these metrics illustrate that PayPal's perceived deceleration and expected headwinds in Q3 are over exaggerated fears - from the Q2 data, all we can see is continued strength.The only metric that is partially worrying is the fact that transaction margin dropped 30bps from the year-ago quarter to 56.0%. Due to the fact that PayPal shells out a good portion of its transaction fees to facilitate transfers, keeping the richness of this margin is of utmost importance. Thankfully for PayPal, it managed to still drive operating income growth through operating expense control.GAAP operating income of $572 million represents a GAAP operating margin of 14.8%, growing 33% y/y versus 2Q17's operating income of $430 million and 110bps better than an operating margin of 13.7% in that quarter. Notable expense categories in which PayPal kept a tight lid are product development, which grew just 9% y/y, and sales and marketing, which grew just 10% y/y.Pro forma EPS of $0.58 beat Wall Street expectations of $0.57 by just a penny; as with revenues, this is a much smaller beat than in prior quarters. But with the CFO's commentary that notes EPS is expected to grow at a rate of 500bps ahead of revenue growth, along with 50bps of operating margin expansion, I'm not worried about PayPal's ability to continue growing its bottom line.With the meteoric rise of PayPal stock so far this year, a minor pullback was probably very healthy for the stock. Looking longer term, PayPal faces very little competition domestically for its core P2P and money transfer businesses; in small business transaction processing, the company's mega-deal for iZettle gives it another tooth in the fight against Square. PayPal's rich valuation multiple doesn't look too unreasonable when we balance it against the company's >20% revenue growth (until we see growth actually taper off to the mid-teens, the Q3 guidance for 12-13% y/y revenue growth is difficult to believe) and 20-30% EPS growth. An upgraded $10 billion buyback program (coming off the heels of an existing $5 billion buyback program) and a pledge to return 50% of free cash flows to shareholders is yet another indicator that the company is on solid footing. Remain long and buy the dip."
4191204,73185,2018-07-27T13:15:52-04:00,"PYPL stock failed to rally on really good second quarter numbers.Weakness is nothing more than a speed-bump.Long-term, PYPL stock is set to rise significantly thanks to digital payments growth.","Digital payments processor PayPal (PYPL) recently reported a robust double-beat-and-raise quarter with a $10 billion buyback, and yet, PYPL stock failed to rally on the strong report. Instead, PYPL stock dropped.We view this as a minor speed-bump in an otherwise powerful, secular growth stock that will only head higher in the long-term. PYPL stock was up 50% over the past year heading into the print, and valuation levels had reached near all-time highs. In that context, a post-earnings pullback is necessary and healthy. But, the secular growth narrative supporting PYPL stock remains as strong as ever, and the financials remain equally as strong. Consequently, the long-term trajectory for PYPL stock remains upward and outward. We set a long-term price target on PYPL stock of $135.PYPL data by YChartsPayPal's second quarter numbers were very good. Constant currency revenues rose 22% year-over-year, a mark that is in-line with previous quarters (revenue growth has run around the 20-25% range for several years now, a testament to this company's financial consistency). Total payment volume was up 27%, also a mark that is in-line with previous quarters (total payment volume has risen in the 25-30% range for several years now, another testament to this company's financial consistency). Accounts rose 15%, in-line with historical standards. Payment transactions per account rose 9%, continuing their steady growth trend of 8-10% growth.Overall, the quarter was more of the same from PayPal. It comprised 20%-plus revenue growth, nearly 30% payment volume growth, mid-teens account growth, and high single-digit payment transactions per account growth. Also, operating margins rose slightly year-over-year, also on-trend with previous quarters.The stock didn't rally because the run-up was quite big, the technicals put the stock in over-bought territory, and the valuation was near all-time highs. Going into the report, PYPL stock was up more than 55% over the past year. Moreover, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) was in overbought territory (above 70), and the forward earnings multiple was near 40, a level not seen since late 2017. Thus, the numbers had to be really good in order to justify a post-earnings pop. Instead, they were just more of the same, and that simply wasn't good enough to make investors buy up an already overbought stock.PYPL data by YChartsPYPL data by YChartsPYPL data by YChartsLong-term, though, this mini sell-off is inconsequential. PYPL is a pure play on the digital payments revolution, a movement wherein cash payment volume is decreasing and digital payment volume is increasing. This trend is happening globally for multiple reasons, mostly due to the rapid rise in e-commerce. E-commerce growth is expected to remain robust into the foreseeable, and as such, global digital payment volume is expected to grow at nearly 15% per year over the next five years.Thus, so long as PYPL retains its market share in the digital payments world, this company guarantees itself a ~15% revenue growth rate over the next five years. There is actually reason to believe that PYPL grows its market share during that stretch, given the red-hot popularity of Venmo (transaction volume +78% last quarter). Thus, over the long term, we think that at a minimum, PYPL retains its current market share of the digital payments world.That implies ~15% revenue growth over the next five years. During that stretch, we expect operating margin improvements to continue alongside healthy revenue growth, and realistically see margins trending towards 25%, versus a run-rate in the low-20's today. Under those modeling assumptions, we think that PYPL can net roughly $4.50 in earnings per share in 5 years.At that point in time, PYPL should remain a big growth company with a big multiple. More mature payment processors like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) presently trade around 30x forward earnings. Thus, in 5 years, PYPL stock will reasonably warrant a 30x multiple, which implies a long-term price target for this stock of $135.V PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsOverall, we feel PYPL stock's inability to rally on strong quarterly numbers is simply a natural and healthy speed-bump in an otherwise very strong secular growth narrative. The digital payments revolution will continue to power strong earnings for PYPL, and strong earnings will lead to PYPL stock heading significantly higher over the next 4-5 years."

It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to the SA PRO archive. Click here to find out more »PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a strong company with a dominant share of the digital payments industry. For years they have relied on the growth of their flagship PayPal.com platform; however, that story was slightly altered when they acquired Venmo in 2013 for $800m. Venmo is a mobile application designed to make it easier to send money to friends and pay for goods/services. Since the acquisition, Venmo has grown rapidly and is currently the leading standalone app for P2P transaction processing. Even though Venmo doesn't currently generate any meaningful revenue, the transaction volumes are growing at an exponential rate. As PayPal begins to monetize the platform through merchant services, I expect a sustained period of margin expansion for the business as well as increased top-line growth.The digital payments industry is growing rapidly, analysts at Morgan Stanley upgraded the industry to ""attractive"" (compared to ""in line"" and ""cautious"") on Thursday (July 19, 2018). They cited several reasons for the upgrade, including resilient consumer spending, share gains for electronic payment methods, network effect and pricing power. The digital wallet segment that Venmo operates in is especially attractive, mobile POS payments are expected to grow at a CAGR of 31.6% over the next 5 years. I expect Venmo to remain a market leader in the P2P payment space and take strong advantage of the expected industry growth.In 2017, four years after the initial acquisition, Venmo processed $35 billion in total payment volume (TPV), which represented 8% of the company's TPV between all of its services. Venmo still represents a rather small subset of PayPal's total TPV, but, it is also the fastest growing segment. In Q1 of 2018, Venmo processed 12.3 billion in payment volume, up 80% QOQ, and acquired more active users than any previous quarter. Currently, Venmo is being used largely for peer-to-peer payments, however, PayPal has ambitious plans to expand Venmo to merchant services over the next several years.The most recent development in Venmo's plan to grow their merchant services platform is the newly announced partnership with Uber. In the next several weeks Uber users will be able to pay for their ride with Venmo. The partnership is long awaited and will grant Venmo a high degree of exposure to Uber's 75 million riders. Beyond the riders, I expect the 3 million current Uber drivers to become very familiar with the app as they start accepting payments through it. Once the riders and drivers start using the app to pay for Uber rides it will become a more regular part of their lives, and lead to increased engagement per user.Alongside Uber, Venmo has their ""pay with Venmo"" service integrated on GrubHub, Seamless, Williams-Sonoma, and 2 million other merchants.Another recent unveiling by Venmo is a unique debit card linked to each user's Venmo account. The card draws money out of the user's Venmo balance or (if necessary) out of the linked bank account. This is Venmo's first significant step toward monetizing their platform as they intend to charge merchants a small fee to accept the card. What makes the Venmo card different from the average debit card is the feature within the app to split purchases. For example, if you use the card to buy movie tickets for a group of friends you can directly split the cost within the app. I believe the debit card is especially important to Venmo because it will encourage users to treat their Venmo balance as a bank account. Rather than withdrawing the balance to their bank (where Venmo loses money) they'll keep their balance within the app and incur no direct costs to Venmo.Square Cash, created by Square (NYSE:SQ), a competing P2P payment app, released a similar debit card earlier last year. Square reported that partially as a result of their debit card 33% of transactions through the app were monetized in the most recent quarter. Venmo has a lot of catching up to do with only 11% of the transactions monetized. I believe the new debit card is exactly what Venmo needs to start producing meaningful revenue and eventually profit from their Venmo platform.The basis for PayPal's strategy relies on the all-important transaction expense rate that determines profitability in the digital payments industry. PayPal's transaction expense rate has increased over the past three years from .93% in 2015 to .95% in 2016 and most recently .98% in 2017. This steady increase is as the result of allowing users to not automatically spend their PayPal balance and instead use a linked card or bank account. PayPal recently signed deals with credit card processing companies in 2017 to reduce the transaction fees and offer more options to users. This should hold off further increases in transaction expense rate over the next few years but is only a temporary solution.Venmo presents a long-term solution for this growing concern of transaction expense rate. Venmo's secret to success is the frequency that it's users interact with the platform. The average Venmo user sends 4-5 transactions a week while the average PayPal user only sends a transaction once every 11 days. The increase in transaction frequency on Venmo means users are more likely to leave money in their Venmo balance. All transactions on this balance are expense free to PayPal as opposed to a transaction from a card or bank account.PayPal is currently subsidizing their peer-to-peer transaction expenses and this has taken a noticeable effect on PayPal's take rate (percentage of TPV taken as revenue). Take rate has fallen from 2.88% in 2015 to 2.68% in 2016 and down further to 2.53% in 2017. At some point, take rate is expected to stabilize as PayPal starts to produce increased revenue from Venmo as a result of their move to merchant services. The overall shift from their traditional PayPal platform to Venmo over the next several years will be accompanied by decreases in transaction expense rate that will also drive their take rate higher. Coupled with significant expected increases in transaction volumes over the next few years we will surely notice a positive effect on PayPal's bottom line.The P2P payment processing space is crowded and I expect competitors to continue entering the market space as Venmo experiences further success. A popular rival is Square Cash, a payment app similar in functionality to Venmo. The key advantage that Venmo has over Square Cash is the social aspect of the app. The default screen upon opening the Venmo app is a feed of friends transactions and their unique captions. While the social aspect of the app does help differentiate it from Square the overall functionality of the two services are generally the same and hurts Venmo's economic moat. I believe that through PayPal's aggressive focus on partnerships, as previously discussed, will supply Venmo with the momentum it needs to remain ahead of Square Cash. Another noteworthy and rapidly growing competitor is Zelle. From the chart above it is apparent that Zelle's rapid growth allowed it to quickly overtake Venmo in users on the platform. The growth is largely a result of a large number of financial institutions who partnered on the venture including Chase, Citi, Bank of America and so on.The key difference in the platforms user activity is what makes all the difference for Venmo. The average transaction size for a non-bank system, i.e. Venmo, is around $135 and often used to split bills, send money to friends and pay for a variety of other small, everyday expenses. In comparison, the average transaction size for a bank system - i.e. Zelle, is much larger at $1359 and is typically for bank account transfers. I expect both Zelle and PayPal to find success in their unique segment of the transaction processing market. Overall, Zelle definitely presents an important concern for Venmo's growth and it will be important to keep track of.PayPal closed at a new all-time high price of $89.24 today (7/23/2018), up 49% over the past 52 weeks compared to the S&P 500's 13.53%. PayPal owes it's success over the past year to strong growth in revenue and transaction volumes, as well as the ongoing acquisition spree. Overall, investor sentiment around PayPal has been very positive over the past year and it is necessary to be cautious about the market valuation as a result.*trailing ratio based on last twelve months (price to sales, price to book, price to earnings)Based on the comparable analysis, PayPal is valued attractively in regards to their sales and book. However, their earnings are lacking with a P/E ratio of 55.7.PYPL PE Ratio (ttm) data by YChartsBased on the above chart of PayPal's PE over the past twelve months you'll see that PayPal is valued relatively higher compared to the start of the year. This upward growth in P/E means that investors are very positive about the future of the company and are willing to pay high premiums on earnings. Potential investors should be careful about entering a position at the current valuation level. In order to maintain the high valuation, PayPal must continue to grow rapidly in accordance with analyst expectations. As a result, there is a lower margin of safety for under performance and investors should take this into account before considering an investment.PayPal is well positioned to take advantage of the expected growth in the P2P payment processing industry. The Venmo platform presents many opportunities to both increase top line revenue growth and expand margins on those transactions. As merchant services becomes more integrated into use cases (such as Uber) Venmo will achieve higher levels of adoption and increased profitability.Potential investors should keep a close eye on competitors in the space (Square and Zelle). An especially important metric to keep track of is the average transaction size on Zelle. Currently, the average transaction size is the key indicator that separates the two platforms. If people start using Zelle in the same way they use Venmo now, for small everyday transactions, Venmo's market share and growth could be hurt.Despite the lack of economic moat and relatively high valuation, I am recommending PayPal as a buy. The upsides of their large market share in a rapidly growing industry far outweigh the investment risks that I have noted. PayPal management has been very successful thus far in the development of the Venmo platform and future merchant partnerships will be the narrative of accelerated growth."
4191187,22148,2018-07-27T11:50:03-04:00,PayPal reported another solid quarter with 23% revenue growth.The company has multiple long-term trends in social and mobile payments that will drive strong growth.The recent stock rally is due almost entirely to multiple expansion to aggressive levels.Third Point price target of $125 is an exit target.,"The PayPal Holdings (PYPL) business remains on fire. The payments platform continues to expand the use of the service, but the stock has already rallied substantially in the last year. The easy time to own PayPal existed last year, but the stock is no longer a bargain. Image Source: PayPal Q2'18 presentation PayPal offers a payments platform used by a young and more mobile customer base. The company continues to drive payments engagement via new customers and more transactions per customer.In the last quarter, payments per active account continued the YoY growth pace of nearly 10%. The company doesn't even need to add new active accounts in order to drive an impressive growth rate in the business. Customers only average about 3 payments via PayPal over a year providing tons of expansion potential. Source: PayPal Q2'18 presentation A big part of the growth comes from a payments platform built for mobile engagement. Person-to-Person (P2P) volumes via Venmo grew 50% to more than $33 billion. This social payments growth drove a big part of the mobile payments that grew 49% to $54 billion. Source: PayPal Q2'18 presentationSo again, PayPal is positioned for the long term shift in the payments market to social and mobile. The addition of 7.7 million accounts in the quarter was additional icing on the cake for a platform poised to further capture payments volumes.The long-term prospects of the company have a lot for investors to find attractive. The $10 billion share buyback provides support for the stock on any future market selloff. For this reason, investors have downside risk protection. The part to not like about PayPal is the sudden froth in the stock. PayPal traded down around $70 at the start of May and recently topped $90. As well, the stock traded down at $48 when my most recent article over a year ago was bullish on the prospects. The payments platform is growing revenues at a solid 22% FX-neutral rate. An impressive rate, but the stock now trades at close to 40x forward EPS estimates. PYPL data by YChartsBack last April, PayPal traded at a more reasonable 23x forward EPS estimates. The vast amount of the stock gains in the last year have come due to multiple expansion. Even more concerning is the frothy call by Third Point looking for an ~50% gain in the stock at the time of penning their Q2 investor letter. The investment firm has a $125 target that is still good for a nearly 40% gain from these levels. The problem here is that PayPal is already aggressively priced for sky high assumptions about future growth. Third Point is looking for margin growth to the levels of other payment peers like Visa (V) that just isn't possible. PYPL Operating Margin (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsWhile Visa operates a payments network, PayPal actually offers a platform where money is stored and utilized requiring a more costly infrastructure including a large customers service workforce. The company may be able to reduce customer service headcount via automation, but the costs will always far outpace those of Visa. The key investor takeaway is that holding onto PayPal makes sense considering the growth drivers. Chasing the stock though makes absolutely no sense. The call by Third Point is the type that typically traps small investors into positions as the large investment firms are exiting while presenting an ultra bullish case."
4189318,67855,2018-07-24T08:00:10-04:00,"Payment volume growth is critical to future earnings growth. I expect 25%+ growth.
        Even though Venmo is largely unmonetized, its volume could represent significant earnings upside if PayPal can achieve similar take rates as its core business.
        This is why Venmo's volume growth trend must remain strong even if it doesn't contribute much to today's revenue.
        I believe that iZettle could become a worthy opponent to Square as merchants could gain access to PayPal in addition to your traditional payment networks.
        The stock could see a pop if the management clarifies its plans for iZettle.","PayPal (PYPL) is set to report earnings on Wednesday. The stock is hovering around all-time highs along with the rest of the market, but I don’t think there is any need for concern here.The stock looks expensive with its 38x P/E ratio; however, I believe that the company has significant opportunities to grow its earnings as long as they deliver the following on the earnings report.Source: Paypal.comVolume growth is critical to growing earnings for any payment company. As there is very little incremental cost associated with processing an additional dollar, a significant portion of revenue derived from payment volume growth will flow directly to the bottom line.PayPal has historically posted annual payment volume growth in the mid-to-high 20s range. In fact, the company has not had a quarter where payment volume growth dipped below 25%. We saw some slight sequential deceleration in growth in Q1, declining from 29% in Q4 2017 to 27%. As the company continues to get bigger, one should expect the growth to decelerate, but given the tremendous secular growth of digital payments, I still expect the company to post numbers that are in line with historical growth rates.While growing 25%+ on Q2 2017 $106 billion of payment volume may seem difficult for PayPal, the payment giant Visa (V) actually grew volume by $258 billion last quarter. This absurdly high dollar volume growth illustrates that there is still much market share out there for PayPal to take. Note that theoretically, every transaction processed through Visa could be processed through the PayPal platform.Venmo grew 80% last quarter to become over 9% of the company’s total payment volume. Even though the service is largely unmonetized, its growth is still of tremendous importance to investors as it will drive significant earnings growth in the future when monetization efforts are in full swing.Venmo started as primarily a peer-to-peer payment system, which carries lower margins. However, PayPal is already starting to experiment on the merchant side through Pay with Venmo, as merchants are more than willing to pay a couple of points to drive additional demand. If Venmo can achieve PayPal’s current transaction take rate of around 2.4%, Venmo’s rapidly growing $48 billion annual volume could generate $1.15 billion in revenue, most of which could fall directly to the bottom line if payment networks can be bypassed. This potential earnings power is very significant when compared to the $2.1 billion operating income generated in 2017.While there is no telling when year on year growth will decelerate significantly, I will still be very disappointed if volume on Venmo grows by less than 60%.The iZettle acquisition was announced in May, but the management has yet to make any meaningful commentary. I believe that iZettle is another leg to the story that remains unappreciated. With the backing of PayPal, iZettle should be able to grow at a much faster pace than Square (SQ), its direct competitor that is currently worth $29 billion. When faced with a choice of accepting all the major payment networks, or all the major payment networks plus PayPal, iZettle becomes an easy choice for any merchant.The management has not made any clear plans for iZettle, but should they provide more details about iZettle’s potential growth, we could see a meaningful pop in the stock. Considering that Square is valued at $29 billion today despite having processed only $65 billion in payments in 2017 (14% of Paypal’s volume), I believe that clearly introducing iZettle as another provider of an on-premise all-in-one payment solution will give investors more confidence about PayPal’s growth prospects.I believe that PayPal’s best days are still ahead of itself. As long as its volume growth remains strong, meaningful earnings growth will follow. Venmo is growing rapidly while carrying significant monetization potential, thus its sustained high growth rate will be welcomed by investor as well.In addition to PayPal’s core payment platforms, we could see another catalyst for upside if the management provides more clarity surrounding the iZettle acquisition as its potential growth is unclear to investors right now. With Paypal’s backing, iZettle could end up growing much faster than Square.All in all, I am bullish about PayPal’s future, and I believe that this earnings report will demonstrate positive signs about the business’ potential growth."
4189415,65113,2018-07-24T08:50:53-04:00,"PayPal (PYPL) has seen a meteoric rise in price over the past two years.
        However, is growth set to significantly moderate from here?
        Let's examine the company's free cash flow growth prospects to find out.","Back in July 2016, I made the argument that PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) was significantly undervalued despite having seen its IPO just one year earlier.My reason for arguing this is that while price remained at pre-IPO levels, free cash flow continued to increase.Since then – it’s fair to say I regret not putting my money where my mouth was as the stock has more than doubled in price since then:Source: investing.comIn hindsight, PayPal’s big rise has not come as a surprise. Even with the company having only been public for three years, PayPal has practically become a household name in online payments.I argued at the time that PayPal has the potential to become the “Wal-Mart” of its industry, with the ability to process large transaction volumes at a lower cost than its competitors.Taking this into account, will we see PayPal continue to rise from here?What is noticeable is that we have seen a big spike in price to free cash flow, along with a significant drop in free cash flow per share.Source: ycharts.comTherefore, PayPal has technically seen free cash flow per share drop by nearly 60%, even though we have concurrently seen EPS growth of 121% over the same period.Source: ycharts.comHowever, this does not tell the whole story. In terms of 2018 growth, free cash flow was negatively affected by the impact of “held for sale” accounting, or value that is realised by the sale of assets rather than business use. Excluding for such items, free cash flow per share would have been $733 million, which marks a 21% growth in free cash flow from last year.Taking this into account, I would now like to value PayPal’s estimated free cash flow growth over the next five years. Given that free cash flow growth significantly outpaced price prior to PayPal’s sharp rise, I deem FCF a particularly important metric in explaining growth for this company.We have seen growth of 20% in FCF from last year, but I am going to assume a yearly growth of 15% as a conservative estimate. Given we have seen yearly growth of over 30% in Total Payment Volume and earnings per diluted share, I deem 15% to be achievable.Here are my assumptions:Source: Author’s CalculationsAssuming a 15% yearly growth rate in free cash flow, we have an upside of nearly 25% from the current price to $108, or a nearly 5% annual rate of return.If we adjust assumed free cash flow growth up to 20%, we see that we now have a near 10% annual rate of return with a $129 target price.Source: Author’s CalculationsIn this regard, it is fair to say that growth is moderating by quite a big margin for this company. PayPal is a great company which I believe would still make a good addition to one’s portfolio, but it is unlikely that we are going to be seeing the type of growth rates that we did in the past.Moreover, when looking at the 2018 revenue and earnings guidance, the company states that it expects revenue to grow “16 - 18% at current spot rates and 15 - 16% on an FX-neutral basis”, which would put the company in line to grow closer to my 15% FCF target per year.PayPal is a great company, but growth appears to be moderating. At a 15% growth rate of FCF per year, the company would need to be trading at the $70-75 range to yield an annual return above 10% according to my FCF analysis. This stock can still provide quite decent returns to an investor, but we would need to see either a lower price or a faster rate of FCF growth for this to happen.Disclaimer: This article is written on an ""as is"" basis and without warranty.

Management is effectively growing both its merchant partners, as well as its customers. This is leading to increasing transaction volume. Although demand for its service is strong, management is similarly converting sales into strong earnings growth. Its share price is breaking out to new highs after a period of consolidation on strong investor momentum. I am buying stock in this name as its operational expansion is driving investor optimism higher.PYPL is attractively valued at current levels due to its continued acquisition of both customers and merchants, signaling strong demand for its services, while management is similarly efficiently converting sales into profits.The company is a technology platform that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. Its payment solutions include PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant products. The company's platform allows consumers to shop by sending payments, withdraw funds to their bank accounts, and hold balances in their PayPal accounts in various currencies.Over the most recent quarter, PYPL saw strong results, generating $3.69 billion of revenue in Q1, growing at 24% on a spot basis, according to its earnings call. Customer growth and engagement were also impressive, adding 8.1 million net new active users, up 35% year-over-year, bringing its total active accounts to 237 million. This strong performance was largely driven by continued growth of core PayPal and Venmo users, as well as its Customer Choice initiative.Its Choice initiative is producing strong customer activations, as well as a year-over-year reduction in its overall churn rate. Management expanded the global roll out of Choice by launching in China and nine additional countries across Southeast Asia, while also further expanding into Europe by launching in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, according to its earnings callFollowing the addition of a record 29 million net new actives in 2017, PYPL is seeing continued strength in its customer acquisition, expecting that net new actives for 2018 will be in line with the record additions experienced last year. As its consumer base expands, the growth of merchants signing up to its platform is also accelerating. Its merchant base now totals 19 million accounts, according to its earnings call. This powerful network effect along with continued improvements to its technology platform is driving increasing engagement.PYPL ended the most recent quarter with 34.7 transactions per active account, up by 8%. Its efforts to redefine its ecosystem with landmark partnerships, the introduction of new products and services, as well as continued expansion of its global footprint led to strong transaction volume growth. PayPal processed $132 billion in TPV in the most recent quarter, up 32% on a spot basis, according to management. On an FX-neutral basis its merchant services TPV grew at five times the rate of its eBay (EBAY) market places' TPV. This signals that PYPL is benefiting from the explosion of mobile and the digitization of commerce, as well as all forms of currency.PYPL is also transforming from simply a payments button to an open digital payments platform. This is redefining its relationship with its partners, retailers and consumers in a much more expansive manner, according to management. They continue to grow their relationships with technology platforms and companies across the globe as well as with card networks and issuing banks. Through these partnerships, PYPL is able to increase its addressable market as well as accelerate the introduction of innovative payment experiences.For example, its relationship with Visa (V) continues to strengthen around the world as they collaborate on multiple initiatives, including tokenization and the increasing use of their services like Visa OCT for instant cash out. JP Morgan Chase (JPM) also added PYPL as a new category for its freedom rewards members, allowing them to earn up to 5% cash back when making PayPal purchases funded by their Chase freedom card. Collectively, the ability to partner with a number of major institutions expands PYPL's footprint, and allows it to find new areas of growth.P2P has also increasingly become a powerful driver of customer acquisition and engagement on its platform. The company continues to see record levels of customer acquisition through P2P and Venmo as they continue to innovate, as well as differentiate the services they offer. Venmo continues to gain increasing traction as the preferred way for millennials to manage and move their money. Venmo acquired more net new actives in Q1 than in any previous quarter and processed 12.3 billion in payment volume, up over 80% versus last year, according to its earnings call. Venmo is now on a run rate to generate over $50 billion in TPV in 2018. Management is making strong progress in monetizing Venmo. Pay with Venmo has deployed more than 2 million merchants across the US with major brands such as Grubhub (GRUB), Seamless, and Williams-Sonoma (WSM), installing dedicated pay with Venmo button.Below is a chart of the company's revenue and earnings per share since 2015. The trends of both top- and bottom-line growth are very positive as demand for its services continues to expand. Its revenue has nearly doubled in the last three years, with its income on a per share basis similarly climbing higher. The positive trend of both metrics signals that management is effectively running its growth strategy.PYPL's share price is breaking out to new record levels on strong fundamental support. After nearly doubling in 2017, its share price has traded sideways for the last six months. Continued fundamental expansion however, led to a breakout higher above $80 for the stock. Considering this stock's momentum characteristics, as well as its innovative offerings, investors could continue to bid its share price higher up to $100.PYPL at the end of the day is a cyclical company, tied to the economic fortunes of its consumers. Should a recession ensue in coming years, the stock could pull back lower, but this is largely out of management's control. What is in its control is its continued strategic partnerships, as well as its efforts to bring on more customers. Management is effectively navigating both, while also turning a profit for shareholders along the way. I am buying shares of this name as its strengthening fundamentals fuel investor optimism."

The aim is simple, to increase PayPal’s presence in physical outlets. iZettle’s card readers allow anyone to receive card payments, while its point of sale system manages payment processing, sales tracking, and product management. That’s right, instead of just trying to beat traditional card-payment processors in online platforms, PayPal will make the competition more relevant by playing both the online and in-store payment processing market, and it gets better along with the integration of sales and product management tools that’s essential for the small and medium businesses. According to PayPal’s COO Bill Ready, PayPal has 20 million merchants in the small business segment, and iZettle has 500,000. ""This phenomenon of in-store payments via mobile for small businesses, it's a global phenomenon and there have been many players in the space,"" Ready told CNBC. After its record $2.2 billion acquisition, PayPal says it’s ready to invest another $3 billion in one year for further acquisitions (source: Reuters). I find PayPal to be extremely well positioned to take advantage of the revolutionized payment processing industry that will evolve through next few years. Buy PayPal for superior return potential over a 3-5-year investment horizon. Buy it before it gets expensive.Source: CGI Global Payments ResearchNow, when we talk about a surge in merchant base, you can immediately see top-line upsides. But that’s just the basics (even though extremely important). When PayPal enters the in-store payment processing market, it will have revolutionized its business model, taking over a greater portion of the transaction processing market where payments are more secured, hassle-free, and centralized. Centralized here refers to the fact that as a PayPal customer, that’s all you would need to make all types of your payments anywhere. Literally anywhere. In the coming years, both virtual and physical points-of-sale will include account-to-account transfers, enabling more secured, hassle-free and real-time transfers possible. And, PayPal will be in a position to have it every way by offering merchants comprehensive coverage of payment processing technologies under one umbrella, making the firm a one-stop solutions provider. The researchers in CGI’s global payments research paper pointed to the fact that it is highly likely that both virtual and physical points-of-sale will include account-to-account transfers, just as many now offer PayPal with debit cards’ feasibility of becoming the means for initiating account-to-account transfers rather than the current use of card-clearing infrastructures. If we consider all these dimensions that technology will facilitate and combine with PayPal’s strategic position, it is evident that PayPal has the potential to grow to a larger enterprise.Source: DatanyzeiZettle was planning to go public this year and was financial times reported that it could be valued at $1.1 billion. ""We do not believe this was the acquisition shareholders were anticipating [and] the price paid appears expensive."" Thomas McCrohan, an analyst at Mizuho Securities said (source: Business Insider). Is the 100% premium worth it? That’s 20 times what iZettle made last year in sales. iZettle’s most important competitor is Square (NYSE:SQ), so now it’s a competitor to PayPal. Square is currently trading at a P/S multiple of 11x, which does make iZettle acquisition look expensive. But analysts are looking at the deal from a quantitative orientation, missing the fact that iZettle allows PayPal to scale its business at a whole new level, whereas competitors like Square who are trading at a lower multiple, which does not have a business model that connects its own cards to its own interface, more simply, the value addition in its competitor does not provide the vertical integration advantage that PayPal has acquired through iZettle. On the other hand, you do have to pay above average premium for a firm that you want to buy if its preparing to go public. There’s no cheap way to do when the potential value from the combination is high. PayPal president Dan Schulman said:The table below and PayPal’s acquisition of iZettle together can only mean one thing. Now, PayPal can provide POS software, card reader, in-store sales, and in now lot better position to actually lower its price points for automated payments, and actually fast develop multi-channel sales. Talking about just online sales (which may constitute other segments from a broad conceptual view but specific as in being a completely integrated with ecommerce platform), PayPal already rules it. Source: Fitsmallbusiness Let’s take a look at PayPal’s potential from a broad perspective. CGI’s research has named four technologies that will dominate payments in 2022. The list includes APIs, real time payments, mobile technologies, biometrics. The paper reasonably supported these technologies. For example, APIs becoming the dominant technology was supported by it being a part of a wider open banking agenda where regulation is driving banks to open up their account services to FinTechs to enable access to customer data and payment processing. PayPal and Stripe both are equipped with powerful APIs and real-time transactions. But now, PayPal is at a position where more integration makes sense and becoming its core strategy. From online transaction processing to in-store processing, more operational control tools and integration forward in a value chain together put PayPal in a much better position where it can scale its another segment, which is aligned with the four dominant technologies, mobile. We can expect that PayPal’s value chain will enable it to offer comprehensive solutions in the payment processing industry and will allow it tap the most anticipated dominant technologies to deliver superior value to its shareholders. PayPal's existing huge market share in the online payment processing industry and less volatility in margins while rapid sales growth and market expansion positions it with asymmetric risk-reward opportunities.Source: data from SEC Filings, processed by the author Note that the degree of homogeneity in competition among the peers and so the comparison might not be apples to apples on a whole. The peers include Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), Capital One (COF), Square (SQ), Synchrony (SYF), and American Express (AXP). Nonetheless, it does give us some insight into payment processing. PayPal has posted stable EBIT margins while three firms had declining EBIT margins, Mastercard and Visa saw growth. You can easily notice the substantial difference in EBIT margin between PayPal and firms like Mastercard, Visa, Capital One, and others. The noticeable difference in EBIT margin in these firms may indicate that margins are more profitable among the traditional card processors like Visa, Mastercard, Amex, and their ability to spread operating costs on larger volume due to long established relationships and user base. On the other hand, PayPal’s debt to asset ranged in between 52% and 61%, while Visa and Mastercard recently shot up. PayPal’s new competitor Square has 80%+ debt to assets consistently, along with Capital One and Synchrony.Source: data from SEC Filings, processed by the authorSince average is higher than median, in the following table, let’s take them as the higher and lower range, respectively.Source: data from SEC Filings, processed by the authorP/S and P/B multiples indicate that PayPal is optimally priced in the market, having both the multiples in between the valuation range. On the other hand, P/E looks that it might be overpriced. But since PayPal is the target company here, we should ask more questions. Why people are paying more? What’s the story? Well, the story is its disruption in the online payment processing market which you already know, and I don’t think the market has quite factored in the acquisition of iZettle and its plan to invest another $3 billion in one year. I don’t see any reason to find its above-range P/E to qualitatively put PayPal in an overvalued situation. PayPal is rather attractively priced at $89. The acquisition of iZettle looks like a great move to me; addition of 500,000 merchants, entry into in-store payment processing and sales management market and a strengthening competitive position. Combining it with its intention to invest $3 billion for acquisitions, PayPal looks to be in a supreme situation. Buy PayPal before it becomes expensive."

It’s worth analyzing a few aspects discussed at the conference.After the spin-off from eBay in 2015, PayPal’s business continued to post solid top-line with flattish margins. Revenue grew at a 20.13% CAGR between 2015 and 2017 and is expected by Wall Street to continue to expand at a mid-teens yearly CAGR in the next 5 years:Source: sentieo.comTo be precise, analysts are forecasting a 16.7% CAGR for revenue in the next 5 years. At the last investor day, PayPal raised its earnings guidance, revenue and capital allocation views, for the next 3 to 5 years. In particular, the management raised the revenue growth target for the next 3 to 5 years to 17% - 18% from 16% - 17%, so potentially 30 – 130bps above the market’s expectations.The company raised its guidance by 100bps despite the 350bps negative impact of the sale of the U.S. consumer credit receivables business and a 100bps impact of the eBay transition.Moreover, the company updated the margin guidance and now expects operating margin to expand each year compared with more conservative expectations of flat-to-growing margins shared previously. The combination of solid revenue growth and margin expansion is also reflected in the expectations of a 20% CAGR for EPS, not much above Wall Street’s forecast of a 19% CAGR.The management talked about margin expansion and where the profitability improvements are coming from, citing a few examples:One of the biggest benefits of having Braintree and PayPal under the same roof is that the two businesses can easily reinforce each other. Braintree and PayPal have propelled each other. PayPal's brought the consumer side, Braintree is bringing the merchant side. This topic has been discussed during the conference, with PayPal’s COO Amit Jhawar pointing out the benefits of the 2-sided network and how each platform was bringing business to the other one.A very interesting question at the conference was the one about Adyen, one of Braintree’s main competitors, which has justed IPOed with an absurd first day that saw shares up 90% for a total valuation of €7.1 billion ($8.3 billion) for the company. William Blair’s analyst Robert Paul Napoli asked the management about Braintree’s growth rate and how their business model differed from Adyen’s business model. The management’s answer was not very detailed, but told us something interesting:Adyen’s growth rates (99% revenue growth in 2017) are a great positive sign for PayPal, if it’s true that Braintree is actually comparable to Adyen in terms of revenue momentum. Nonetheless, at RBC Capital markets conference, the management stated that Braintree's revenue is growing by around 54% per year, so not actually comparable with Adyen's 99% increase. Adyen is growing faster and seems to be more linked with the big businesses in the United States. Its customers include well-known companies such as Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX), Spotify (SPOT), L’Oreal (OTCPK:LRLCF), Burberry (OTCPK:BURBY), Microsoft (MSFT), Sephora, Symantec or WeWork, according to the company’s website. Nonetheless, Braintree doesn’t lack well-known customers though. Uber (UBER), Pinterest, Airbnb, Yelp (YELP), Dropbox (DBX), Wish.com, GrubHub (GRUB), StubHub are all current customers according to Braintree’s website. There is one thing worth mentioning though. Both companies mention Uber as a customer, which sounds a bit strange.With or without Adyen’s exact growth rates, Braintree is surely an attractive growth driver for PayPal and I have a very optimistic view about its future prospects. Although I am not as positive as Carlyle’s Rubenstein, who said payment processors will dominate the world, it’s easy to understand the benefits for merchants of the implementation of these payment processing systems. Having PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Venmo, card processing and local payment methods in a single integration is surely very efficient and convenient, and failing to integrate a payment system used by more than 200 million customers is probably not a good idea, and it will be even worse when those customers will be 300 million or 400 million. On the other side, integrating a platform like Braintree simplifies technical integration, reconciliation, dispute management, customer service, and so on.The loss of the eBay (EBAY) business to Adyen (in three years) is not seen as a completely bad phenomenon, and the reasons make enough sense. First, the close partnership with eBay did limit PayPal’s potential partnerships with competing platforms, and the new relationship certainly opens up some interesting opportunities to partner with players that were seen as competitors by eBay. In terms of potential growth, the management highlighted that PayPal’s top 20 marketplaces other than eBay are roughly the same size as eBay, yet they're growing at a rate in excess of 40% year-on-year, compared with eBay’s single-digit growth rates. Considering the much lower growth rate, losing eBay shouldn’t have much more than one-time effect. eBay is currently estimated to account for roughly 13% of PayPal’s business, a percentage that will decline significantly in the next three years thanks to the fast expansion of the other marketplaces, and the additional growth of Braintree and Venmo. And let’s remember that PayPal will only lose part of the business, as PayPal will remain a checkout option for eBay’s customers at least until 2023, and potentially for many years later.I understand the concerns about losing the eBay business, especially if the loss of the “seller’s hand” will be followed by a loss of the “buyer’s end” of the business. With the exclusion of this potential one-time loss, PayPal’s business is in good shape. Total payment volumes and payment transactions continue to grow both in the core PayPal/Braintree divisions and in non-core segments like Venmo and the newly acquired iZettle.PayPal has been quite successful so far in transforming its business from a simple payment option to a digital payment platform, creating a virtuous cycle between PayPal and Braintree and expanding to other platforms through acquisitions. I remain positive on PYPL for a few important reasons:There is not much room for big surprises given the almost non-existent gap between analysts’ estimates and management guidance, so I don’t have a very strong bullish view like before, but PayPal should be able to maintain solid growth rates for the foreseeable future. The solid growth prospects, the excellent financials, the decent moat and the reasonable valuation at 1.8 PEG make it a good long-term pick."

That was the result of an increase in its operating margin of 22.5 percent in the reporting period.Earnings per share in the quarter was $0.57, up 29 percent. Average earnings per share growth over the last three quarters is 30 percent. During that same period growth in transactions has been 25 percent on average.Cash equivalents and investments finished the quarter at $7.8 billion.Customer growth continues to be robust, with the company adding another 8.1 million new actives in the first quarter, bringing the total number of active accounts to 237 million. The number of merchant accounts is now at about 19 million.Average transaction per active account in the reporting period was 34.7, up 8 percent.PayPal processed 132 billion in TPV, a gain of ""32% on a spot basis and up 27% on a currency neutral basis.""With this ongoing momentum and global growth strategy, the company is focusing on providing comprehensive solutions for almost every contingency that may arise for its customers in order to lower churn as it grows. That is what it has targeted in its recent acquisitions.It is attempting to build a defensible moat that can ensure long-term, consistent growth.PayPal has been on a buying spree over the last year, acquiring companies strategic to its long-term growth and customer retention. As mentioned earlier, they are Swift Financial, iZettle, Jetlore, Hyperwallet, and Simility.Among the areas of the company they bolster are artificial intelligence, customization, mobile point-of-sale, total payment volume, multi-currency payment distribution capabilities, international expansion, and providing improved fraud prevention and risk management.As a whole, they provide a lot more stickiness for the company which will make PayPal's ecosystem very compelling for users, which should continue to improve its churn rate while continuing to grow.JetloreWhile I like all of the acquisitions made by PayPal mentioned in this article, one that sticks out for me is Jetlore. The AI capabilities of the company allow retailers using the service to provide customized offerings to their customers, which when they are personalized in that way, get them embedded in the company's ecosystem, which makes them difficult to dislodge by competitors.Assuming it continues to execute and improve on its AI, this will probably be the strongest part of the competitive moat it is building. Personalization means an emotional connection and buy-in, which should provide PayPal with a higher customer baseline from quarter to quarter.When I say higher customer baseline, I mean from a decrease in churn, not only from the obvious increase in new customers. In other words, it appears PayPal has positioned itself to not only better retain existing customers but to keep a higher percentage of new customers going forward.If it plays out this way, and it's highly probable it will, it means the company will be able to extract more growth from existing customers via higher retention rates.Bear in mind by higher retention rates, it starts with it empowering its merchant accounts to do that with their customers, which in turn locks in the merchants to PayPal.SimilityThe latest company acquired by PayPal is Simility, which is an AI company focusing on fraud detection and prevention. PayPal will pay $120 million for Simility in an all-cash deal.PayPal COO and EVP Bill Ready said this about the deal:An example of how the AI works is, in the case of an attempted account takeover (ATO), Simility ""looks at various session, device, and behavioral biometrics and builds a profile for what constitutes 'normal' user login behavior; if an anomaly is spotted, it can act to prevent the action.""Comparable to Jetlore, Simility empowers customers to customize the service, as what constitutes normal behavior across different business sectors and segments could differ significantly.This shouldn't be underestimated in value by investors. It is probably the most important long-term competitive advantages the company has as it now stands. Mass customization, as mentioned earlier, is an ecosystem lock-in feature; it makes it hard for a company to make a decision to change to another service provider, which again, reduces churn and can be used as a marketing tool to attract merchants.Customization capabilities is a big win/win for all participants. PayPal helps its merchant base build their own moats, and in return, it strengthens its own competitive advantage.HyperwalletPayPal also recently acquired Hyperwallet in an all-cash deal of $400 million, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter.Enhancing Global Payout Capabilities with Hyperwallet AcquisitionHyperwallet should improve the performance of the company in online marketplaces and e-commerce, according to Bill Ready on the company blog, adding that ""marketplace sales accounted for more than 50% of global online retail sales in 2017..."" He said that ""[B]y acquiring Hyperwallet, we will strengthen our ability to provide an integrated end-to-end solution to help e-commerce platforms and marketplaces - however large or small - leverage world-class payout capabilities in over 200 markets.""As a result of the acquisition, the company will be able to provide payment distribution capabilities for currencies on a localized basis, ""with numerous disbursement options, including prepaid card, bank account, debit card, cash pickup, check, and PayPal.""The primary significance of this deal as it aligns with PayPal's global initiative is it allows the company to access thousands of merchants via the networks Hyperwallet already has in place. Over time, that should significantly increase the purchase volume of PayPal.Another important factor is as the deal with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) winds down, even though its importance to PayPal's performance has been shrinking, Hyperwallet offers a potential revenue stream that should more than offset the decline in revenue in the years ahead.iZettleWith the acquisition of iZettle for $2.2 billion, PayPal received about 500,000 new merchant clients located in South America and Europe. It serves the mobile point-of-sales segment. This will increase the performance of its merchant services.This coincides with the aggressive move into international markets as well as buying immediate mobile POS growth. Combined with Hyperwallet, it provides a much stronger value proposition for merchants around the world.Another part of PayPal's global strategy involves targeting Mexico, Brazil, China, and India, which the company says are ""underpenetrated"" by the firm. Chief Financial Officer John Rainey said ""...we have a roughly 1% penetration rate,"" according to the Wall Street Journal. He also noted the number of digital users in those countries is about 1.5 billion.To save costs in gaining penetration in those markets, the company is employing a strategy of forming local partnerships. I think it will also save a lot of time.Rainey cited the partnership it made with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) in 2017 as an example of what the company has in mind in those markets. Those using Baidu Wallet can buy products on the Internet outside of China by choosing among the 17 million merchants in its network. By any measure, this is an opportunity for significant growth with this partnerships.Along with its other global initiatives, PayPal has the potential to surprise to the upside over the next few years.There's a lot to like when looking at the acquisitions PayPal is making, as they not only provide meaningful growth opportunities around the world but potentially further lock-in its existing customer base into its ecosystem.The combination of being able to customize more elements of some of its services, along with international growth, means it should be able to improve revenue earnings as it lowers churn.Rainey has also said the company still has plans to spend from $1 billion to $3 billion annually on acquisitions, which if it is as successful as I believe it has been in analyzing the needs of customers as measured against its ecosystem, identifying the companies that can fill in those gaps and being willing to pull the trigger in alignment with its business model, PayPal should enjoy consistent long-term growth going forward.With a much more active user base, it means PayPal is doing the right things to get people engaged in its products and services. With its latest acquisitions, it is positioned well to leverage its assets to get better results from its marketing efforts."
4179113,39141,2018-06-04T01:36:29-04:00,"PayPal Holdings posted another strong quarter, including over 30% EPS growth.PayPal generates substantial excess cash flow, which it is currently using to acquire smaller processors, such as iZettle.Despite a recent spike in shares, PayPal Holdings remains a buy on its long-term future.","Back on February 8th I recommended PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) on a dip. I've been a fan of PayPal (PYPL) for a couple reasons, but mostly because it is right in the center of a major secular growth story of our generation: The growth of e-commerce. PayPal has created a payment platform which enables e-commerce; one that will be very difficult to replicate or replace.At the same time, PayPal has been steadily improving the monetization of its platform, by reducing the cost to gain marginal business and leveraging its growing economies of scale. Growth is generally becoming less capital intensive, and that means PayPal generates growing excess cash flow. This article takes a look at PayPal's latest quarter, its most recent acquisition and finally a look at valuation and cash flow. Strong quarter PayPal had a strong first quarter 2018. Earnings per share increased 33% year on year, and revenue roared higher by 24%, or 22% on a constant-currency basis. PayPal added 8.1 million accounts, and transactions rose 25% to 2.2 billion over the quarter. Transactions per active account rose another 8% year-on-year to 34.7, and total payment volume increased 27% in constant currency, to $132 billion. In other words, PayPal is not only gaining users, but its users are using PayPal more and more.To take a more granular look, PayPal's growth was driven by person-to-person transactions, where volume grew 50%. Venmo, which is PayPal's social payments platform acquired from the Braintree transaction in 2013, processed over $40 billion over the last twelve months, which represents 80% growth. Venmo, in many ways, is growing in a way reminiscient of how PayPal was growing volume in the mid 2000s. There's a good reason for that.Venmo is an important area of strength for PayPal, specifically because of its ""social"" payment strength, which is popular among the millennial demographic because Venmo allows for bill-splitting and instant transfers by smartphones and social media, in a seamless fashion. Over the last quarter, Venmo began partnerships with Williams Sonoma, Siemens and GrubHub to install special buttons for Venmo on its websites, which will charge 25 cents per Venmo transaction. This, I believe, will help with monetization.Normalized free cash flow was $733 million (excluding proceeds from PayPal Credit, which was sold off last year), from $1.4 billion of operating cash flow and some $700 million in capital expenditure. Operating margins held steady at 14.5%. iZettle acquisitionMuch of PayPal's cash flow goes to making strategic acquisitions, typically of smaller, innovative payment processors. This is what PayPal did with Braintree, the operator of Venmo, back in 2013. More recently, last quarter PayPal acquired iZettle for $2.2 billion.iZettle is a leading small business commerce platform in Europe and Latin America. iZettle is mostly an in-store platform, which makes it complementary to PayPal's extensive online network. PayPal thereby gains access to in-store capabilities in Brazil, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Spain. iZettle expects to generate $165 million in gross revenues in 2018, with $6 billion USD in total payment volume. Most exciting of all, iZettle has grown its revenues at a compounded rate of 60% from 2015 to 2017. iZettle expects to be profitable on its own by 2020. This acquisition really helps to make the PayPal platform into an ""omni channel"" platform. PayPal's long-term goal, it seems, is to acquire smaller, innovative processors in complementary fields, in order to ""widen the (protective) moat"" of its core business. Think of how Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) acquired DoubleClick, YouTube and Motorola Mobility in order increase the competitive viability and monetization around its dominant search and app ecosystem. I believe PayPal Holdings is following a similar strategy for its dominant payment platform system, and I believe this strategy will pay off handsomely. Fully valuedCourtesy of Marketwatch.PayPal Holdings isn't cheap, that is certain. Shares trade at approximately 40 times trailing earnings, which, assuming a conservative 20% EPS growth for the long run, makes PayPal Holdings is ""fully valued."" (With EPS about twice as much as EPS growth.) Of course, it is possible that PayPal Holdings will grow EPS faster than 20%, as it did in this quarter, but it is hard to say whether that momentum will continue. In the case of PayPal Holdings, I look at it this way: PayPal is more than just a secular growth name, it is part of a generational movement. John Legere, the CEO of T-Mobile USA, explained it very succintly when he said ""all content is moving to the internet, and all of the internet is going mobile."" That applies to transactional commerce just as much as it does telecommunications, and PayPal is right in the center of that movement. Right now PayPal Holdings has a market cap of just under $100 billion, where as some of the major credit card platforms have market caps above $250 billion. While the two aren't in exactly the same business, I expect PayPal to grow in relevance as transactions move inexorably to the mobile internet. I also expect PayPal Holding to at some point start paying a dividend. Given the company's recent history of acquisitions, it seems that management prefers to spend its excess cash acquiring smaller financial technology companies, but I also believe that at some point management will start paying shareholders, much like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MC) have elected to do.For this reason, I continue to recommend PayPal Holdings as a long-term buy. It's really not about immediate spikes or troughs right now, but instead the long-term prospects of where PayPal will be in five to ten years. However, if someone wants to wait for another dip, it is certainly understandable. I continue to try and buy PayPal Holdings on a dip. Either way, PayPal is a 'buy.'"
4190264,67855,2018-07-26T00:47:45-04:00,"Total payment volume grew 27%, 1% higher than Q2 2017.Venmo grew 78%, only a slight deceleration in growth from Q1's 80%.As expected, revenue growth lagged total volume growth as Venmo is still largely unmonetized.$10 billion repurchase program shows that the management understands that smart capital allocation will increase shareholder value over the long run.Q3 revenue guidance showed significant deceleration in revenue growth, but looked fine if we adjust for the sale of the credit portfolio.","PayPal (PYPL) printed decent headline numbers for Q2 2018, with both revenue and EPS coming in slightly above analyst expectations.Revenue and earnings are great, but they themselves don’t tell the whole story, investors must keep in mind of the big picture. In my earnings preview I noted several things that investors should look for to ensure that PayPal can justify its decently expensive valuation. Let’s see how the company performed.Source: paypal.comTotal payment volume continued its rapid growth, coming in at 27% year over year adjusted for FX. Venmo demonstrated continued momentum, growing its volume by 78% year over year to $14 billion. I had expected PayPal to deliver 25%+ volume growth in aggregate and at least 50% for Venmo. I am pleased that the company hit both of my targets.The total volume growth of 27% was meaningfully higher than the total FX-Neutral revenue growth of 22%. The reason for this difference is due to the fact that Venmo remains largely unmonetized; this creates a drag on revenue growth when compared to aggregate volume growth.As noted by the management on several conference calls, over 80% of every incremental dollar of revenue falls to the bottom line. The company reiterated its strong operating leverage this quarter on its presentation:Source: paypal.comOverall, the high volume growth signals to me that PayPal is still compounding its influence at a significant rate, which bodes well for earnings in the future as exponential revenue growth will likely continue. Even though this quarter’s volume growth is only 1% higher than that of Q2 2017, the dollar amount of the year-over-year growth was a whopping 50% higher at $31.6 billion compared to $20.2 billion in Q2 2017. Combine this with the aforementioned high operating leverage, I see a long runway for future earnings growth.PayPal announced an additional $10 billion stock repurchase program on top of the previous $5 billion program. This is a sizable authorization when compared to the company’s $100 billion market cap. Even if investors won’t be too excited about a 10% jump in EPS in the near term, they should understand that buying back stock of a rapidly growing company that produces a ton of excess cash (as PayPal does as demonstrated by $737 million of FCF this quarter) will yield significant returns for shareholders in the long run.Too often we see tech companies hoard billions of dollars on the balance sheet. Excess cash is the cardinal sin of capital allocation and most businesses are better without it. By repurchasing shares today, shareholders will enjoy a much larger share of future earnings. One tech company that comes to mind that employs a decent capital allocation strategy is Visa (V), which actually carries $8.5 billion of net debt.In the above chart we can see that Visa’s share count decreased by roughly a quarter over the past 10 years while EPS has risen 715% percent. Had no shares been bought back, the EPS increase would have been 511%; still impressive, but it significantly lags Visa’s earnings growth under a disciplined buyback program.Evidently, if PayPal is able to just replicate Visa’s success in 10 years, even though its smaller scale should mean comparatively higher growth rates as is the case today, a share repurchased today will meaningfully increase shareholder value over time.Some of the after-hour weakness could be attributed to a weaker-than-expected Q3 revenue guidance, which came in at $3.62-3.67 billion vs. the expected $3.71 billion. The revenue guidance translates to a 12-13% growth over Q3 2017’s $3.239 billion, significantly below this quarter’s year-over-year growth of 22%. However, this decline can almost be entirely explained by the sale of the credit portfolio to Synchrony, which negatively impacted growth by 7%. Adjusting for this one-time item, Q3’s normalized growth is 19-21%, which is still below Q2’s pace of growth.I am not concerned about this slight slowdown in revenue growth, however. As I mentioned earlier, revenue growth will continue to lag behind payment volume growth as the largely unmonetized Venmo continues its above-average growth. For example, volume at Venmo grew 78% this quarter versus PayPal’s total volume growth of 27%. As Venmo becomes an increasingly larger proportion of total volume, revenue growth will lag until Venmo is fully monetized. While full monetization is not in the cards for Q3, it is just a matter of time. This is why I believe that the cadence of payment volume growth, which is showing no signs of slowing down, is the most important indicator of PayPal’s future value.I am encouraged by PayPal’s strong volume growth, especially Venmo. The management also demonstrated a smart capital allocation strategy by introducing a $10 billion buyback program, which I believe will create significant shareholder value over the long run.While shares are presently showing some weakness, possibly as the result of a slight miss in Q3 revenue guidance, I believe that the company’s fundamentals remain strong and I expect earnings to significantly increase in the future as Venmo becomes fully monetized."
4179606,102762,2018-06-05T21:59:20-04:00,"PayPal has acquired two companies, iZettle and Jetlore, in less than a month.iZettle allows PayPal to expand its services to small, offline merchants and capture a bigger share of the European market.Jetlore should expand PayPal's value proposition beyond online checkout.The acquisitions should help the company improve its competitive edge as the rivalry in the market increases.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock has jumped about 60% over last year, driven by increasing popularity of digital payments. While the revenue has also grown double digits over the period, it has recently become clear that the company needs to find new ways of improving its value proposition in order to stay competitive in the future. For instance, this was evident from the fact that in Q1 2018, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) outperformed PayPal in terms of revenue growth for the first time in years - sales increased 31% and 24% year over year, respectively.Now, PayPal seems to find the way to improve its competitive edge, as the company has been on an acquisition spree over last month. In the middle of May, PayPal acquired Swedish start-up iZettle, and later in the month, it announced its plans to buy Jetlore, an AI-powered prediction platform.I believe the acquisitions create for PayPal avenues for growth, as they will help the company expand its operations in many ways, opening up new businesses in terms of operations, size, and geography. This should also make the company's offerings more valuable, therefore providing the necessary boost to its performance. As a result, the upward trend in the stock price is likely to continue in the near future, despite the significant level of competition in the payments market.(Source: PayPal website)In the middle of May, PayPal revealed it would acquire a digital payments start-up from Sweden iZettle. The start-up is considered to be the ""Square (NYSE:SQ) of Europe,"" as it provides small merchants with similar solutions for in-store card payments.The deal amounted to $2.2 billion and became the largest acquisition in PayPal's history. The reported premium paid by the company is enormous - iZettle is expected to bring about $160 million in revenue in 2018, which means the price-to-sales ratio in this deal reached almost 20 on the basis of the current numbers. In comparison, PYPL itself has a P/S multiple of about 7. However, the acquisition makes total sense from a strategic point of view.For instance, iZettle will help PayPal expand its physical presence to small- and medium-sized businesses. This opens a huge market for PayPal, as in-store card payments had been barely covered by the company before the deal.It is estimated the total retail point-of-sale terminals market will reach about $25 billion by 2023, with mobile terminals being the fastest-growing segment, with about 17% CAGR through 2024. Therefore, iZettle will allow PayPal to capture a huge market in all the sub-segments, such as hardware, software, and services for mobile POS. Stifel analyst Scott Devitt estimates that PayPal currently ""controls less than 1% of the market with an estimated 2018 payment volume of $581 billion,"" which means there is a huge room to grow for the company.Furthermore, the acquisition will be beneficial for PayPal in terms of geographical presence. This is because iZettle's main geographic markets are such European countries as Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, and others where PayPal does not have a physical presence at all. Therefore, the deal will allow the corporation to become a global player and offer its payment processing services to merchants with global presence, making the solutions more attractive.Moreover, PayPal will likely bring iZettle to the markets where the start-up is not present yet, like the US. Hence, iZettle reportedly has operations in only 12 countries in Europe and Latin America, while PayPal operates in 200 countries. As a result, the deal between two players will create a significant synergy, and PayPal will be able to compete with such rivals as Square in the US market. Notably, Grand View Research expects the US retail POS terminals market will reach more than $7 billion by 2024, which creates an impressive opportunity for the PayPal-iZettle relationship.(Source: Grand View Research)(Source: PayPal website)The latest of PayPal's M&A deals is the acquisition of Jetlore, and AI-powered platform that uses technology to improve sales, customer loyalty, and customer lifetime value. Unfortunately, the deal sum has not been disclosed. Jetlore will become a part of PayPal's Marketing Solutions, a set of products and services aimed at providing clients who use PayPal's payment processing with different marketing tools.Jetlore solutions are aimed at increasing sales efficiency through AI tools and data analysis. For instance, the company's Predictive Layouts solution ""learns customer preferences from their interactions over time,"" dynamically adapting content and placing it where users are more likely to see it. It is claimed that the tool can help generate up to 70% more revenue per email or pageview, reducing customer churn by 12%. Another Jetlore product, Predictive Ranking, uses special AI engine to provide tailor-made product lists and search results to individual consumers.Harshal Deo, vice president of commerce solutions at PayPal, said in a statement:As a result, the deal can open for PayPal another promising source of revenue and improve the company's value proposition. The corporation will be able to cross-sell its payment and marketing solutions, which together look like a powerful combination. Therefore, the acquisition of Jetlore will inevitably improve PayPal's strategic position, making the stock more attractive in the long term.PayPal's moves seem to be the answer to the intensified competition on the payments market.Such players such as Square are very likely to take on PayPal in the e-commerce and offline payments markets, as the demand for omnichannel solutions can rise in the near future. Moreover, Square will inevitably start expanding to international markets at some point - as of now, it is available in only four countries outside the US. For instance, last year Square expanded into the U.K., where 99% of businesses are categorized as small businesses and ""many don't yet take card payments."" Therefore, PayPal's expansion to the US and Europe with offline presence using iZettle technology looks like a logical reaction to Square's actions.Other players in the market include card technology corporations like Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard, which are also growing at high rates as card adoption increases in both digital and physical points of sales. Notably, MA and PYPL stocks have shown very similar behavior over the last year.PYPL data by YChartsOverall, PayPal's future looks bright in light of the recent acquisitions, which will enhance the company's strategic position.PYPL stock has increased rapidly over last years, outperforming the broader market and many individual stocks from the industry. Currently, the company looks rather expensive with a forward P/E of more than 36, which is higher than that of Visa or Mastercard. A more detailed valuation would require a separate analysis.However, PYPL is still a much safer stock than SQ, while PayPal's recent acquisitions can basically open the same target markets for the corporation.PYPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsMy analyses of Mastercard and other tech companies can be found on my profile page.

4179269,101421,2018-06-04T13:41:46-04:00,PayPal has acquired machine learning technology startup Jetlore for an undisclosed amount.Jetlore has developed prediction technologies for retail industry customers.The deal is part of an ongoing PayPal approach to acquire the technologies necessary to keep up with the intensifying competitive environment.,"PayPal (PYPL) announced it has acquired Jetlore for an undisclosed amount.Jetlore has developed as an artificial intelligence-powered retail predictive platform.PYPL continues to acquire the technologies it needs to compete in a fast-changing payments environment.The Silicon Valley-based company was founded in 2011 to empower retailers and large Business-to-Consumer (B2C) brands to create relevant and cohesive experiences for every customer touchpoint.Management is headed by CEO and Co-Founder Eldar Sadikov, who was previously a Researcher at Microsoft and a Research Engineer at Google.Below is an overview video of the company’s product flow:(Source: Jetlore)The primary offerings of Jetlore’s Prediction Platform include:Investors have invested $10.6 million in the company during the course of 4 investment rounds and include JME Venture Capital, Stanford-StartX Fund, and Fenox Venture Capital, among others.Market & CompetitionAccording to a market research report by McKinsey Global Institute, AI techniques are estimated to have the potential of creating between $3.5T and $5.8T in value annually across nine business functions in 19 industries.Within the subset of retailing, the main driver for expected growth is the desire of retailers to provide personalized experiences to their customers at scale as well as enhancing their analytical data in order to continuously optimize their operations. (Source: Forbes)Competitive vendors that provide Artificial Intelligence-powered predictive services include:(Source: Owler)Acquisition Terms and RationalePayPal didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so the transaction appears to have been for a non-material amount.In its most recent 10-Q filing, PayPal had over $6.3 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments, so the firm had ample resources to close what is likely a sub-$100 million transaction.PYPL acquired Jetlore to bolster its Marketing Solutions for its merchant customers.As PayPal stated in the deal announcement,With the acquisition, PayPal is also getting Jetlore’s senior management team, Eldar Sadikov, Montse Medina and Sergey Andreev, to help the firm create AI-driven personalization technologies for its merchants.PayPal management sees the addition of these technologies as further cementing its payment processing relationship with merchants through value-added capabilities that help merchants become more efficient at generating additional sales. This promises to create a virtuous cycle, growing PayPal’s transaction volume and deepening its relationships with merchants.Jetlore’s capabilities are primarily with the retail channel, but I imagine PayPal is looking to expand these nascent AI (machine learning) capabilities into other verticals, so the acquisition potentially has wider applicability as management seeks to maximize the technology’s value to its entire processing network.PYPL’s stock price has risen since the announcement as the chart below indicates, although I’m skeptical that the acquisition has materially affected the price dynamics:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)This deal is likely one of a continuing series for PayPal as it responds to increased industry competition and a rapidly changing technology environment as a result of machine learning, continued mobile adoption by users and the rise of competing forms of payment such as cryptocurrencies.PayPal needs to continue to make bold moves as I don’t expect its internal innovation capacity to provide it with the necessary speed to market that acquisitions of startups can provide."
4175877,47521,2018-05-21T12:22:20-04:00,PayPal buys iZettle for 20 times revenue in order to accelerate its international presence in physical stores.The importance of offering a one-stop shop or omnichannel for its customers.What the long-term outlook as a result of the deal is for PayPal.,"Source: MuycomputerproA trend has been emerging recently in the pure-play Internet space, as companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and now PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), are looking to physical businesses as growth markets of the future.What the main issue is, is there are only a limited number of related businesses companies in the tech space can enter in order to significantly boost revenue and earnings within the parameters of the expertise and market these companies compete in.In the case of Amazon, it was obvious the company wanted to compete in the food market, as it lends itself to the retail business it is in, and represents a huge growth opportunity. The challenge was the way it operated its retail e-commerce business didn't work with fresh produce in particular, which limited the growth prospects of the company, which is why it acquired Whole Foods.I think PayPal has similar aspirations with iZettle, although it doesn't reflect a market the size of the U.S. grocery market, even with the international potential it reflects.The questions that need to be answered are how much will this add to the top and bottom lines of PayPal, and how long it'll take to add value to the company.PayPal paid a hefty $2.2 billion for iZettle, a little over 20 times 2017 revenue. Before the offer, it was preparing to go public, and it had been seeking a value of $1.1 billion for the IPO.The company isn't profitable yet, and the transaction will be dilutive for full-year 2018 at about $0.01 EPS on a non-GAAP basis, which means that could be the best-case scenario. I conclude that because non-GAAP usually is more favorable to management than GAAP is.With a customer base of approximately 500,000, it means PayPal is paying on average about $4,400 per customer.For 2018, revenue from iZettle should come in at about $165 million on $6 billion in volume. The company says it will ""reach EBITDA profitability by 2020 on a standalone basis."" From 2015 to 2017, its CAGR was at 60 percent. With the added investment of PayPal, that isn't likely to slow down.Based upon the existing numbers, it could take several years before PayPal to pay for its investment in iZettle. I think it could reduce that period of time if it successfully markets its one-stop shop business in new markets.Another element will be whether or not PayPal will be able to upsell some of iZettle's customers and increase the amount of revenue and earnings per each business it serves.The most obvious benefit to PayPal's acquisition of iZettle is it becoming an omnichannel, or one-stop shop for its customer base.As iZettle stands at this time, PayPal will gain an immediate in-store presence in another 11 markets, including Brazil, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and Sweden. With only Brazil and Mexico being in the top 10 in population in the world, it represents a lot of upside potential for PayPal if it manages to successfully leverage the new benefit of being a one-stop shop in its coming marketing campaigns.With consumers now wanting a variety of ways to pay for goods and services, small businesses want whatever options are available to meet that demand. Now whether on desktop, smart phones or in-store, PayPal will be able to supply a payment option at each point of sale (POS).Not only should this generate meaningful revenue over time, but also it should be able to do so at a solid profit, as the company scales it around the world.What I think the market may be underestimating at this time is the added potential of cross-selling and up-selling new products or services to customers.As its customer base grows, it provides opportunities for new offerings and revenue from its customers. One already in place that could be offered to PayPal's customers is the loan business iZettle has in place. Point of sales is a great way to gather data in order to customize loans to small businesses.Because those that own the gateways in payments will be able to generate consistent, long-term fees; this is a battleground with a lot of competitors in it. With the acquisition of iZettle, PayPal has improved its competitive position and could build a moat that is defendable and difficult to compete against.It of course has to successfully execute on its plans for iZettle, but it now has the pieces in play to grow market share on all important payment touch points in the retail market.A 2018 report by Zion Market Research found that the size of the market by 2022 will be about $98.27 billion. Starting from 2017, that represents a CAGR of 13.5 percent during that five-year period.That only deals with the point of sales, not the potential for ancillary sales once the payment system is scaled across other markets. In the short term, revenue should increase on the loan side of that specific business of iZettle. Concerning cross-selling and up-selling, it's impossible to know at what level PayPal will be able to successfully market its other products, but it definitely has the potential to grow significantly. This is why I see the company maybe surprising to the upside and receiving the return on its investment quicker than the numbers at this time suggest.Among the other markets iZettle already operates in, PayPal said it sees ""near-term in-store expansion opportunities into other existing PayPal markets, and acceleration of omnichannel commerce solutions in Australia, U.K. and U.S.""If it is able to execute in the important Australia, U.K. and U.S. markets in the near term, it could do even better than I think it's going to do with the ancillary sales coming from the embedded small business customer base that comes with iZettle.PayPal did pay a stiff premium for iZettle, raising a number of eyebrows in the financial world, but I think that while it does come with risk, the upside potential is worth the price.With the online tech market in a number of areas maturing, it's getting difficult to generate the type of growth that came in the past, which is why companies like PayPal and Amazon are looking to physical businesses for new revenue streams that can move the revenue and earnings needles.There is no doubt the acquisition of iZettle provides PayPal with a stronger product line and marketing position, which it can now aggressively offer to small business owners.I believe once the deal closes, PayPal is going to be aggressive in its attempt to enter new markets, scale the in-store business, and cross-sell and up-sell existing products, while develop new ones to further leverage the benefit of the deal.From everything I've read concerning the acquisition, it appears this is the big play by PayPal for future growth. It has a lot riding on the outcome of the new business, and I think it's going to provide all the capital and resources needed to give it the best chance at success.Although it does have numerous competitors across a variety of markets, I think this is PayPal's to win or lose. For it to be considered a company that can deliver value and growth, it'll have to show the market and shareholders it can execute and make the deal work.If it fails with iZettle, I think it's going to go through a difficult period where it struggles to find catalysts that convince investors it still has opportunities to grow in the market it competes in.My final thought is I believe it has a much better chance of making it happen than failing because of its past record and experience, along with growth potential coming from the retail payment market."
4166576,103480,2018-04-26T17:38:16-04:00,"PayPal continues its hot earnings streak, beating Wall Street's top-line expectations in Q1 by $100 million (320bps over consensus).EPS also grew 33% y/y, exceeding expectations.Emerging opportunities for growth, including PayPal's foray into traditional banking products, are a core driver of the bullish thesis.In addition, PayPal has extended its agreement with eBay through 2023.","Over the past several months, PayPal (PYPL) has been a controversial stock. Earnings results and the company's outlook for 2018 have been good, but one sore piece of news stuck out: eBay's (EBAY) decision to replace PayPal with startup Adyen. eBay accounts for a little more than 10% of total transaction volumes for PayPal.This week, however, we got two major signals from the company that the coast is clear. First, eBay and PayPal announced an extension of their agreement through 2023, delaying the end date of their agreement by three whole years. At this point, the previously-announced termination of the eBay partnership is essentially meaningless to investors - nobody can predict the fate of commercial agreements five years out anyway, and stocks aren't valued for potential roadblocks half a decade down the road.Second, PayPal reported Q1 earnings, and just like every quarter, since the beginning of 2016, PayPal managed to beat expectations in a big way. The stock is up in sympathy, but there's still plenty of opportunity to catch the beginnings of a relief rally in a fan-favorite stock that has been sliding since January:PYPL data by YChartsSo, where does PayPal go from here? Its earnings are solid, its relationship with eBay looks somewhat repaired - now what?Growth drivers for the company are not in short supply. Earlier in the month, PayPal announced it was rolling out a type of banking account, with basic debit card/ATM and check depositing features. PayPal has agreements with small, unnamed regional banks that provide it with the banking infrastructure (essentially providing a ""white label"" service for PayPal) to get around FDIC regulation. The company's COO has also specifically stressed that this is not a banking account for regular people (aka, PayPal is not really competing with the big banks) - rather, this is a bank account for underbanked communities and those with financial records too spotty to open a bank account.It's unclear how much of a revenue driver this initiative can be for PayPal, but along with the company's credit card portfolio and PayPal Credit (lending) arms, the company has built up an entirely new line of business to supplement its core payment processing revenues.On the flagship business side, PayPal hasn't yet run into the wall, either. Mobile payments continue to see rapid growth at PayPal. Along with Q1 earnings, PayPal reported that it processed $49 billion in mobile payments during the quarter, up 52% y/y. Recall also that PayPal owns Venmo, the app that's become almost synonymous with mobile P2P payments. PayPal reported that Venmo processed $12.3 billion in transactions during the quarter (which is impressive when you consider that the majority of Venmo transactions are small sums between friends), up 80% y/y.Even though PayPal's mobile payments growth is impressive, its penetration into mobile payments in the U.S. is far less than what the likes of Alipay have achieved in China, where paying with your phone has become the primary payment method. PayPal is well-positioned to capture this opportunity as the U.S. begins to shift more toward mobile payments as well.Here's a look at PayPal's first quarter results, which drove shares up approximately 3%:Figure 1. PayPal Q1 resultsSource: PayPal investor relationsRevenues grew 23.8% y/y to $3.69 billion, exceeding Wall Street's expectations for $3.59 billion (+20.6% y/y) by 320bps. On a constant currency basis, PayPal's 27% y/y revenue growth is even more impressive. Note that, on a constant currency basis, PayPal's revenue growth would have been 22% y/y.The growth in revenues, of course, was driven by strong growth in payment volumes processed, of which we've already mentioned that mobile payments were especially robust. Total payment volumes grew 32% y/y (27% y/y on a constant currency basis) to $132.4 billion. If you look at the chart below, what's especially interesting is the fact that PayPal's Q1 volumes are essentially equal to the holiday-heavy fourth quarter, which generally drives a huge boost to P2P payments:Source: PayPal investor relationsThe company also added 8.1 million net new active accounts, representing 35% y/y active account growth. The company ended the quarter with a staggering 237 million total accounts on the platform.On the profit side, PayPal's operating margin remained flat at 14.5%. A drop in the company's effective tax rate (from 12.3% to 6.8%), however, allowed for a meaningful earnings jump. GAAP net income in the quarter was $511 million, up 33% y/y. Pro forma EPS of $0.57 also grew 29% y/y and beat analyst expectations for $0.54.The one metric that looks odd on PayPal's earnings release is the deeply negative free cash flow. PayPal previously had been an FCF-printing machine - what gives? The company explained that the temporary downswing is due to a new accounting treatment for its held-for-sale (HFS) receivables. Barring that, FCF would have been $733 million, up 22% y/y:Source: PayPal investor relationsWith strong earnings under its belt and the eBay cloud mostly shifted to the rear-view mirror, PayPal has plenty of rebound potential ahead of it. Looking at the company's valuation, multiples of 33x forward P/E and 5.4x forward revenues don't look especially cheap - but when you consider the fact that PayPal posted 33% earnings growth this quarter, a 33x P/E is about right - getting us to a PEG ratio of 1.0x.PYPL EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsIn any case, the story at PayPal is often stronger than the numbers themselves. Look to opportunities in banking products and capturing more share in mobile payments as drivers for the next leg of PayPal's growth. Digital payments will inevitably become a larger and larger part of the commercial ecosystem, and as the largest payments company in the U.S., PayPal is the best positioned to capitalize on that trend.Stay long on this fantastic name, and use this opportunity to buy PayPal at a slight discount to its all-time highs."
4176760,67855,2018-05-24T03:35:53-04:00,"PayPal has grown consistently in the past, but the narrative is taking a hit.Venmo and iZettle are two hyper growth segments that could unlock additional growth for Paypal.Venmo has already achieved sizable volume. I expect the management to provide more details on their long-term plans for the platform.iZettle is small, but if things go the way I expect, iZettle's growth will directly translate into profits for Paypal, unlike Venmo, which is still largely unmonetized.As long as PayPal can convince investors of the enormous potential of Venmo and iZettle, I don't see this expensive stock getting repriced downward.","PayPal (PYPL) stumbled early this year when its relationship with eBay (EBAY) was confirmed to be coming to an end. Couple of weeks ago the stock got hit again with the revelation that Amazon (AMZN) is heavily promoting Amazon Pay.These are scary headlines, but PayPal has always been in a competitive space. As evidenced by the bountiful competition from deep-pocketed tech giants (Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon) and more nimble “startups” (Adyen, Square (SQ)), payment processing and payment aggregation are not hard businesses to get into. Still, the company has grown impressively year after year.As a first mover in the digital payment space, PayPal may have the scale to keep its leading position. However, as investors are paying up for growth (the stock is trading at 34x 2018 EPS), any perception that PayPal is about to lose its growth momentum will negatively impact the share price today. We know that core PayPal is a steady grower, but the company may want to use the upcoming investor day as the opportunity to talk up the long-term potential of its two hyper growth segments.Venmo is not driving Paypl’s revenue growth as it has yet to be heavily monetized. In fact, it has been a drag on overall take rate since its payment volume is factored into the company’s total payment volume. While Venmo isn’t contributing revenue, it is growing its potential for revenue very quickly. Venom’s volume increased 97% year over year to $35 billion in 2017. Volume growth moderated in the first quarter to 80%, but this should be expected given its size.Analysts have repeatedly questioned the management on its plans for Venmo. We don’t have a firm answer on the timeline or the potential financial impact because the management doesn’t want to “rushing this out”, but we can guess how it’s probably going to work operationally. The company had been selectively rolling out Pay with Venmo, meaning that businesses will pay a fee to PayPal to accept Venmo; in that sense Venmo becomes a more “hip” PayPal for millennials.There are a lot of P2P payments on the platform, so I don’t think we can just apply the normal transaction take rate of ~2.4% to Venmo’s volume to estimate the revenue potential. But even if we apply half of that, we are still looking at $42 million of revenue that will drop almost straight down to the bottom line as the company is incurring Venmo’s costs already. Considering that payment volume is growing at 80%, we can expect that $42 million of potential income to increase significantly as well.I believe that my rough estimate is pretty conservative, as Venmo could find additional ways to monetize its user base beyond just payment processing. Keep in mind that Venmo is a standalone app, so I can easily see a scenario where Venmo serves as a platform for direct product listing and take a cut for any direct purchases, not unlike eBay.Overall, I believe that PayPal could see some upward pressure if investors get additional information from the management regarding the timeline and the potential of Venmo’s monetization.iZettle is PayPal’s most recent acquisition. I see it as a copy of Square (SQ). iZettle was able to get a foothold in Europe, and now with PayPal’s backing, one would assume that iZettle will be pushed to the U.S. PayPal didn’t give much financial details other than that there will be a 1 penny negative impact to 2018’s EPS. Such a small impact should have been expected because iZettle is still very small (2018 estimated TPV is just $6 billion).Giving PayPal a physical presence through iZettle will unlock a tremendous amount of volume as PayPal can become a “physical” card that consumers can use in stores, where PayPal is basically non-existent. More volume through PayPal means more revenue, and more revenue means more profit.iZettle’s revenue CAGR from 2015 to 2017 was just 60%, but should PayPal aggressively market iZettle in the U.S., I believe that we can expect well over 100% growth over the next 2 years. Using 2018’s estimate TPV of $6 billion, 100% growth for two years implies $24 billion by 2020, which isn’t crazy. Venmo, a more isolated product without direct transfer between PayPal and Venmo, was growing at 200% when it was disclosed that the service processed $2.1 billion of volume in Q3 2015.I don’t think the management will give much financial details around iZettle on Thursday as it is way too early to announce firm guidance. However, I believe that the management will likely provide some strategic guidance. I believe that the stock will react accordingly based on how aggressive PayPal wants to market iZettle. If iZettle is expected to grow on its own like Venmo, then I do not expect much of a reaction; however, if the management does indeed plan to aggressively promote the product, then I believe we may see a pop in the stock. Remember that if iZettle taps into PayPal’s account base, iZettle’s growth will directly translate into profit, unlike Venmo.After multiple bad press that sent the stock sideways in 2018, I believe that the management will likely reveal long-term plan for its two hyper growth segments. Both Venmo and iZettle have enormous revenue and profit potential that can be unlocked. Venmo in particular has already accumulated sizable user base and volume that are just waiting to be monetized. iZettle is also interesting as even though it is small, there is a natural synergy between the balances available on core PayPal and iZettle’s in store payment solutions.As long as the management can convince investors about the long-term potential of these two platforms, I see no reason for the stock to pullback."

        PayPal's growing pile of cash, and healthy cash flow, provides management with ways to drive value ranging from M&A to dividends.
        Amazon's planned entry into the payment space is an uphill battle, as PayPal continues to hold the competitive advantage among merchants.
        Valuation is more than justifiable when pricing in growth prospects and industry-superior metrics.","PayPal (PYPL) may perhaps be one of the most overlooked stocks on the market, given the impressive expansion efforts which stand to drive growth across the board for years to come. Their strong free cash flows, and sizable cash balance, provides management with an array of options to drive value for shareholders, ranging from M&A activity to share buybacks and dividends.Source: WSJWhen coupling this competitive advantage in the payment space, to their recent entry into developing geographic regions, the future couldn't look better. Of course, critics will point out that Amazon's (AMZN) entry into the payment space poses a threat PayPal's well being.Fortunately, these claims are far-fetched, with PayPal holding a leg up over the e-commerce giant. The company's current valuation, which is more than justifiable, seals the deal for us as we initiate a bullish stance on PayPal.Source: MorningstarQ1 revenue came in at ~$3.7 billion, up nearly 24% y/y (22% currency neutral); revenue drivers included strong mobile engagement, which includes the rising popularity of social payment app Venmo. The app processed over $12 billion in transactions in Q1, up 80% y/y; in the LTM, payments totaled over $40 billion. As PayPal rolls out a dedicated Venmo button for merchants, upside remains significant in this segment alone.Source: MorningstarMargins in Q1 contracted slightly by ~269 bps q/q. However, compared to the prior year, margins expanded by ~96 bps y/y. Margins are expected to remain at these levels, as the company maintains operating expenses under control.In the long run, margins may see further expansion driven by strong pricing abilities in terms of fees. This could be key, especially with merchants who serve customers heavily through PayPal, and have developed an almost dependency. The strong pricing could be used to help drive bottom line growth, or offset any rising costs in the grand scheme of things.Venmo and pricing could certainly add to PayPal's top line, however, the bread and butter of the company's growth prospects lie in their international expansion, which is looking brighter than ever. PayPal's CFO John Rainey noted the untapped potential across the globe, by stating that:Source: TradingEconomicsIndia is just one country where PayPal is making a splash - along with other corporate giants such as Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN). The country's current population is ~1.3 billion, with approximately 400 million people utilizing mobile phones. CFO John Rainey further underlined PayPal's objective in their move into developing countries:With India's population expected to continue growing at a prolific rate, PayPal is positioning itself to reap the benefits later down the road.What should happen when the company faces competitive issues as they expand globally? PayPal holds an edge with their cash, and could easily grow their market share through M&A; PayPal's cash balance grew at ~80% y/y. The company is not to be reckoned with, which is great news for shareholders and investors.Source: MorningstarOne recent example of PayPal's deployment of capital is their acquisition of iZettle for $2.2 billion - an all-cash deal which is expected to close in 3Q18. This would allow PayPal to extend its reach into areas where they're not so popular offline, and widen their footstep across the pond in the U.K.:Despite strategic moves such as the iZettle deal, investors appeared to have gotten spooked by Amazon's movement into the payment space; many claim the e-commerce poses a serious threat to PayPal's bull case. However, a good argument made by Jim Cramer last night (5/16) on Mad Money calmed fears, with Cramer noting how many of the companies which Amazon appears to be crushing would be reluctant to use them for merchant services. PayPal has already gained the trust of businesses across the industry, and continues to see growth in their merchant accounts.PayPal currently trades at ~33x forward earnings, which is fairly reasonable considering the upside potential that sits ahead.Source: YahooFinance, S&P Capital IQCompared to competitors, the company is on the high end of the valuation range, but at the same time is experience growth beyond that of its peers. Factoring out capital structure, the company's ~32x EBITDA multiple is quite high - but again, we believe the premium is justifiable given the outreach and ongoing expansion of the payment processing company.Although the company is not trading at a bargain, the valuation is appropriate in our eyes. We would not be concerned entering a position at these levels, believing that the upside that lies ahead is being undervalued by the market at the time.PayPal continues to deliver strong results, and the future outlook remains bright. PayPal has yet to turn on the money switch for mobile platforms such as Venmo, leaving plenty of untapped potential in this area lone. In addition, the dependency that many merchants may have developed for PayPal is a big plus, giving management flexibility when it comes to driving revenue and margin expansion, or just offsetting increasing costs.The expansion into developing countries such as India is a key driver going forward, and given the immense population (which continues to grow at breakneck speed), PayPal stands to reap the benefits of connecting individuals with financial services. The upside in India - along with other geographic regions which have yet to be breached - may be underrated by the market.Looking at the company's cash situation, it continues to sit on top of a healthy pile of cash and generate strong free cash flow simultaneously. This allows PayPal to conduct deals such as their recent iZettle acquisition, which will strengthen the company's standing in various regions. With investors heavily scrutinizing the company's bottom line, balance sheet aspects like this may be overlooked.On valuation, the company trades on the higher end of its peer group. A premium is easily justifiable when factoring in the company's global outreach, merchant dependency, and growth opportunities that lie ahead. PayPal will continue to impress investors time and time again, and although the naysayers may try to pick apart the bull case, the truth is the company is turning up solid results. When combined with management's vision for democratizing the movement of money, PayPal will continue to drive shareholder returns for years to come."

Given the high baseline figure, this is a strong growth forecast, so it’s not surprising that PayPal is paying a significant price for iZettle’s POS technology and market position.Major competitive vendors that provide POS systems in one form or another include:PayPal disclosed the acquisition price as $2.2 billion but didn’t disclose terms or file an 8-K.Management did disclose a change in financial guidance, stating that ‘the transaction is expected to be approximately $0.01 dilutive to PayPal’s previously communicated full year 2018 non-GAAP EPS.’When a company refers to ‘non-GAAP’ in the financial guidance concerning an acquisition’s financial effect, it’s usually to make the announcement look better. GAAP results are typically less favorable to management trying to sell the ‘benefits’ of the deal to shareholders.As the deal’s effect on PayPal’s balance sheet, the firm had $6.3 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments and $7 billion in total liabilities (less funds payable) as of March 31, 2018 (10-Q Filing).So, it would appear PYPL has ample resources to close the deal without undue financial hardship.iZettle’s topline revenue run rate is approximately $165 million in 2018 and $6 billion in total payment volume transacted through its platform. Its CAGR has been 60% from 2015 to 2017 and it now has over 500,000 merchants; this represents extremely strong revenue growth and iZettle plans to ‘reach EBITDA profitability by 2020 on a standalone basis.’PayPal is acquiring iZettle for a number of stated reasons.As PayPal stated in the deal announcement:PayPal’s stock has risen 2.24% on the first trading day after the announcement as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)Investors seem to like PayPal’s strategic move here, if only to better position itself against direct competitor Square (SQ).Due to its ‘legacy incumbent’ status, PayPal has strong name recognition among online merchants but has been in need of a more significant offline presence.The iZettle deal provides a meaningful jumpstart to PayPal’s offline weakness and there appears to be minimal overlap.With a purchase price of $2.2 billion, PayPal looks to be valuing iZettle’s 500,000 merchants at an average price of $4,400 each. This is a steep price to pay since it will likely take several years to make that back in fees from typical small business merchants.However, viewed as a strategic acquisition in conjunction with PayPal’s scale of online offerings, the deal will provide both firms’ customer bases with new offerings and tools as PayPal seeks to remain relevant to merchants and consumers.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4162374,101431,2018-04-11T12:00:41-04:00,PayPal shares have recently declined due to a combination of company-specific factors and macroeconomic weakness.Fears are likely overblown.PayPal's business is solid and will deliver many years of growth.,"PayPal (PYPL) shares are still trading 10-11% below the top reached in January due to a combination of rising macroeconomic risks and the recent announcement that PayPal will not be eBay's primary payments provider starting from 2020.I don't think a 10-11% correction can be justified by the eBay (EBAY) news. First of all, let's consider that eBay currently accounted for just 13% of PayPal's total payment volume. Moreover, the non-eBay business has been growing revenue at 23% on average each quarter since the separation from eBay, while the business related to the eBay platform has grown at just 4%, less than one-fifth of the growth rate in the non-eBay business. It's clear that neither the core of PayPal's business nor its main sources of growth are affected by the recent changes. Besides a purely mathematical perspective, let's remember that many customers will still continue to use PayPal on eBay and that the current agreement will remain effective until July 2020.In this context, it's reasonable to assume that the market's reaction has been exaggerated if the eBay factor was the only factor driving the decline. Anyway, a look at the macroeconomic environment and the recent tensions between the United States and China suggest there is probably something else affecting PYPL's price. I think the underlying macroeconomic conditions (which also include interest rates on the rise) have played the major role in the recent correction. The risks on that side would be more difficult to quantify and mainly depend on whether the current trade war between the United States and China escalates beyond the measures recently implemented by both parties.This can impact PayPal's business because the payment industry is obviously dependent on the overall state of the economy and commerce, which can be negatively impacted by a trade war, but the specific decline in total trade between the United States and China can impact PayPal's growth prospects per se. The management has always been pretty positive about the PayPal's potential growth in China, mentioning estimates that suggest that in the next 3 to 4 years, China alone will account for 40% of all the cross-border trade with the United States. This trend, which was considered as a great opportunity to gain exposure through partnerships with local players, may not be as favorable as expected if the current tensions escalate. Let's not forget that PayPal entered a strategic partnership with Baidu (BIDU) almost one year ago, in order to tap cross-border Chinese merchants and was looking for additional partnerships to increase its exposure to China and cross-border trade even further. It's clear that the recent developments on the geopolitical and macroeconomic side make investors less positive about PayPal's potential in China.While these developments (eBay partnership and trade war with China) shouldn't be completely ignored, their impact on PayPal's business is still very modest. On one side, we have seen that eBay has not been a growth driver for PayPal since the spin-off. On the other side, the Chinese growth option is not a necessary ingredient of the bullish thesis on PayPal. While we don't know how much the cross-border trade between China and the United States accounts for PayPal's revenue, I don't see a reduction in trade necessarily as a negative factor for PayPal. If import tariffs don't lead to a complete loss of cross-border transactions but rather to a shift to cross-border trade with other areas (such as Europe, Japan, and Brazil) where PayPal's growth may be easier (since it's rarely used by Chinese companies), we could even foresee a positive scenario for PayPal.Based on these assumptions, I think the effect of the factors mentioned above on PayPal's business will be moderate at worst and marginal at best unless a trade war escalates and generates strong macroeconomic headwinds.Analyzing the underlying trends in the business suggests PayPal has bright growth prospects, with or without the impact of lower transactions on eBay or lower cross-border trade.PayPal's core business is in a very solid uptrend confirmed once again last quarter, when the company reported the highest QoQ growth rate in active customers (+4.1% over Q3) since the separation from eBay, even surpassing the previous record of a 3.8% QoQ growth reported in the previous quarter.Source: Author's elaboration based on data from filings and sentieo.comThe strong increase in active customers drove a 25.8% increase in revenue and the fourth consecutive EPS and revenue beat. The engagement continued to increase as well, with transactions per active account rising to 33.6 against 32.8 in Q3. I think the outstanding growth rate in active accounts despite the larger scale and the solid increase in engagement shows the strength of PayPal's network effect quite clearly.And the positive trend in the top line is not the only positive trend worth mentioning. EBIT margin is near the all-time highs, the quality of earnings is good and outstanding shares have been in a moderate decline in the past three years. PayPal's core business continues its solid uptrend driven by the strong network effect of its differentiated payment system and the secular growth of eCommerce. Besides that, there are some important sources of growth optionality for PayPal's business, such as Venmo, a P2P payment platform controlled by PayPal that includes social media features. The division is not profitable yet despite the huge growth in quarterly payment volume from just $143 million to over $10 billion in a little more than four years.The chart below shows how Venmo is growing in terms of payment volume:Source: Author's Elaboration based on data from filings and sentieo.comVenmo is expected to turn profitable soon, but we usually don't get many details about the timing and pace of Venmo's profit growth. A few quarters ago, the management gave us some lukewarm indications, mentioning a moderate monetization of Venmo going into next year and the expectations of a further expansion in the following years:Source: Q3 earnings callMore recently, the management has stated that monetizing Venmo is not a priority if it comes at the expense of engagement and that customers' growth is the key goal now:Source: KBW Cards, Payments and Financial Technology SymposiumI would have liked more clarity from the management, but the main message seems to be that we can expect Venmo to turn profitable in 2018, but we shouldn't see bottom-line growth in the division as the key priority at the moment. In any case, the fast growth and increasing popularity of Venmo surely offer further growth optionality to the bottom-line beyond the core PayPal and Braintree businesses.The management expects the positive trend in customers growth to continue at a similar pace in absolute term, with roughly 30 million customers expected to be added in 2018.For the full-year 2018, revenue is expected to be $15 billion to $15.25 billion, which translates into a currency-neutral growth of 14% to 16%, which becomes 17% to 19.5% once we take into account the 3.5% impact of the sale of the credit portfolio. The management also expects a moderate margin expansion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.24 to $2.30. Based on these numbers, the stock would be currently trading at 33.8x 2018 EPS and at a PEG of 1.74. I consider these multiples totally reasonable in this market and for a company with PayPal's growth prospects and durable moat. They may look a bit pricey in comparison to a stock like Visa (V), which is trading at 27.5x 2018 EPS and at a PEG a bit above 1, but we have to take into account Visa's slower top-line growth and PayPal's prospects of margin expansion and bottom-line growth optionality offered by Venmo.Once we take into account the company's strong free-cash-flow generation, the rock-solid balance sheet, the potential to monetize Venmo, and the secular tailwinds such as e-commerce growth, I think we can easily justify PayPal's current valuation and build a bullish case on the stock. Unless the recent geopolitical tensions escalate further and trigger some global economic weakness, I think the recent decline in the stock will end up being a good buy-on-the-dip opportunity."
4146554,92456,2018-02-14T10:45:04-05:00,"It is impossible to predict when exactly the financial bubble will burst.
        But it is possible to spot the very fact of formation of such a bubble.
        Let's check whether there are signs of a bubble forming in the stock market of Amazon or PayPal.","Saxo Bank has recently published its outlook ""HOW TO SPOT A BUBBLE"", which describes the methodology of identifying bubbles in the financial markets.In my opinion, the approach is really interesting because it is simple and logical. And in order to practice it, let's apply it to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL).Let me explain briefly the essence of the method on the example of Bitcoin because hardly anyone now doubts that it was a classic bubble. Setting aside the theoretical reflections on the nature of the processes in the world, according to Saxo Bank ""... a bubble may be characterized by super-exponential behavior where the growth rate continually increases..."".Let me show you what it means, putting it into practice.Here are Bitcoin prices on the log-plot. The logarithmic y-scale is a prerequisite for this methodology.And now pay attention to this: since the beginning of 2013 to mid-2014, Bitcoin price was growing along the exponential trend that always looks like a straight line on a log graph yellow curve). From 2015 to January 2018, Bitcoin price grew at the super-exponential rate that looks like an exponential curve on the log graph (red curve). This period falls under the definition of ""bubble formation"".The ending period of bubble formation is also visible on the chart of annual growth rates of Bitcoin price:I’d like to note that this approach does not allow to define the moment when the bubble will burst, but allows to understand that we are dealing with the bubble.Now let's look at daily prices of Amazon on a regular graph:It really looks like a bubble.Let’s now look at these same prices on the log graph, adding an exponential growth trend to it:We see quite a steady growth along the exponential trend (once again - it always has the form of a straight line on the log graph). Now, look at the annual rates of change of Amazon share price. Starting from 2010, nothing even remotely resembles Bitcoin growth rate of the year 2017.So, from the point of view of this methodology, there is no reason to argue that the bubble is forming here. Amazon grows harmoniously within the framework of its long-term growth rate. Now let's look at PayPal shares on the log graph, adding the trend line:Here the situation is different, and the trend line is not straight. Now let’s look at the YOY growth of the day prices of PayPal shares:Something extraordinary was witnessed here over the last month because the 100% YOY growth of day prices is huge even for Amazon.Since we are already talking about PayPal, I suggest to take a look at the graph of one-year rolling Beta coefficient:As you can see, the Beta of PayPal has been demonstrating a steady tendency for growth since the beginning of 2017 and is now above the upper border of the standard deviation. The growth of Beta usually indicates an increased speculative interest in shares - it normally occurs and when a bubble is forming.Of course, PayPal is still a relatively young company that has a great potential. And I’m not trying to say that PayPal is a bubble just like Bitcoin. No! But bubbles can have different sizes and formation periods. And speaking of PayPal, I believe that we are dealing with a local, so to speak, small bubble, because since 2017 the growth rate of PayPal moved from the exponential category to the super-exponential one, and the methodology proposed by Saxo Bank identifies it very clearly. Moreover, the 100% YOY growth rate of day prices demonstrated by PayPal shares will not last forever.Relatively recently I created the DCF model for PayPal which also identified the overvalued state of PayPal shares.Saxo Bank has offered an interesting tool, and I personally, will adopt it.Amazon is not a bubble. However, the growth of PayPal has deviated from the exponential trend in the short term, and this can be regarded as the local bubble that will snuff out sooner or later, lowering the stock price to the level of the normal growth trend, which in my estimation is now around $60."
4144424,39141,2018-02-08T05:08:22-05:00,"PayPal Holdings posted an excellent quarter, but investors got spooked on news of the eventual end of an intermediary partnership with eBay.Shares are down double digits from their peak.Paypal Holdings has a very long-lived runway of growth and should be bought on any weakness.","Over the last few articles I've written, I've said that it's best to be skeptical of stocks, particularly because bonds have become more and more reasonable over the last couple of weeks. There are some long term trends, however, that are worth buying on any weakness. The generational ascent of e-commerce is one of those long-term trends, and PayPal Holdings (PYPL) is at the center of that trend.PayPal, through both PayPal itself and its recently acquired Venmo platform, is the undisputed #1 platform for business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer electronic payments. Over the last half decade, e-commerce has gone mobile, and PayPal Holdings has taken the pole position in this race by acquiring Venmo, a flexible mobile payment app very popular with younger millennials. In addition, PayPal Holdings has virtually no debt and last year generated about $3 billion in free cash flow, with no other obligations. That's a great position to be in. PayPal is a premier secular-growth investment that should be bought on any weakness. I am writing this article because there has been a good deal of weakness from PayPal Holdings lately.eBay related weaknessCourtesy of Google Finance.PayPal has been beaten down since the end of last month. Shares are down 11% from their highs. Part of this is due to the broader market drop over the past few days, but another factor is that eBay (EBAY) is going to drop PayPal as its partner for processing transactions. This certainly does make for a big headline. After all, PayPal got its start as the platform for eBay transactions. However, eBay has been a rapidly declining share of PayPal Holdings' overall business; going from 19% of volumes two years ago to just 13% today. Terms of agreement with eBay are still in place until 2020, and by then I suspect eBay will take up a much smaller slice of payment volume for PayPal. To be sure, PayPal will still be accepted by eBay for both sellers and buyers. From 2020 on, however, PayPal will not be the intermediary on transactions they weren't originally a part of. I strongly suspect that many eBay customers will just keep using PayPal anyway. I'm not sure how much of an effect eBay's dropping of PayPal as the exclusive processor will have on PayPal in the end, but I do know that eBay is a diminishing part of PayPal's business anyway. I also think abandoning PayPal Holdings over this is a very short-sighted move.Growth and acquisitionsPayPal is a high-growth company, there's just no getting around that. On the full year, revenue grew a very nice 21%, with earnings per share rising a terrific 27%. Payment volumes increased too, at 27% year-on-year. Active accounts increased 15% year-on year, with 29.4 million net adds in 2017. Payment transactions per active account grew 8% in 2017. In other words, PayPal is not only adding many new active users, but its user base is becoming more active as well. Mobile payments were far more impressive. Mobile payments grew by 53% in 2017, to a total of $48 billion. Of that, Venmo transaction volume grew 97% year-on-year. In 2018 PayPal expects revenue growth of between 15% and 17%, with 'non-GAAP' EPS growth of between 18% and 21%, and with capital expenditure being only 5% of revenue. Don't expect PayPal Holdings to rest on its laurels. I expect management to continue making prudent acquisitions to both expand PayPal's reach and widen the 'moat.' Courtesy of PayPal Holdings Investor Relations.PayPal holdings has continued to expand its partnerships and make its services available to consumers wherever they go to shop, whether online or with mobile payments. In November of last year, PayPal Holdings inked an agreement with Synchrony Financial (SYF) to handle its consumer finance business, part of a strategy to offload consumer debt to a financial company, and remain a strict payment processor. ValuationUnsurprisingly, PayPal Holdings is expensive. Such levels of growth rarely come cheap, after all. As of right now PayPal Holdings trades at almost 40 times trailing earnings. Even with this pullback you'll be paying up for PayPal, but I strongly believe that it is worth is. PayPal has a terrific growth trajectory. The rise of e-commerce is a generational thing, and so PayPal's growth will continue for many years regardless of whether it has an exclusivity agreement with eBay. I'd love to own PayPal at 30 times trailing earnings, but I don't believe that is going to happen. I also believe that PayPal could eventually have to pay a dividend at some point in the future, especially given the amount of free cash flow it is generating. ConclusionPayPal Holdings is a buy, and is one of the premier growth names out there right now. E-commerce is taking more and more of a central role in consumer spending, and mobile e-commerce is growing parabolically much the same way 'traditional' e-commerce grew over the last decade. For this reason, I believe it should be bought on any meaningful weakness, such as what we saw early this week."
4142878,103480,2018-02-03T10:01:14-05:00,"PayPal reported a huge Q4 that beat analyst top-line expectations by $120 million (a three-point beat to estimates).The stock tanked on news that eBay is replacing PayPal with Adyen as its primary payment processor. eBay, however, represents a slow-growing revenue stream that was declining in importance anyway.PayPal's guidance for FY18 was in line with analyst expectations despite including the impact of the eBay breakup. This suggests strong growth in PayPal's core business.As digital payments in the U.S. catch up to popularity in China, well-known platforms like PayPal are poised to see a major growth spurt.","PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), the largest P2P payment processor in the U.S., has been one of my favorite growth stocks for a considerable amount of time. Over the past year, as shown in the chart below, PayPal has seen tremendous outperformance relative to the S&P 500, and not without good reason - the company's earnings have been rock solid and its business narrative is more relevant than ever, as more and more consumers shift the majority of their services online.PYPL data by YChartsYet, PayPal stumbled this past week despite strong earnings and revenue beats and a fairly robust outlook into 2018: and that's purely on the news that eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is switching to the Netherlands-based unicorn Adyen as its primary payments provider.Actually, stumbled is an understatement: PayPal has fallen more than 15% from its peak, so it's in plain correction territory (though this wasn't helped by the fact that the Dow fell in the most painful session since June 2016 on February 2). But despite PayPal's outperformance in the past year, I don't believe the stock has overstretched its valuation - after all, it's still in the ~20% top-line growth bucket and it has steady and growing earnings to support its valuation. I don't view PayPal's correction as a business in distress, but rather an opportunity to buy into an iconic brand that is increasingly becoming part of our financial fabric.Now, investors' reaction to the eBay news is understandable: they don't like uncertainty; they don't like change. eBay's fate has been tied to PayPal for so long that most people still don't realize they are now separate entities. As a refresher, eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion (today, even after PayPal's substantial decline, it's worth nearly $100 billion - about twice of eBay's own market cap). That acquisition was probably the smartest thing eBay has done in the past two decades - the company's GMV has screeched down to single-digit growth while many buyers and sellers flock to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), while PayPal's business has grown like a weed. Pushing for change in a stagnating company, activist Carl Icahn pushed for a spinoff that was completed in 2015, and the standalone stock has been a wild success ever since.So why give up such a good thing? eBay and PayPal have ended a long, decades-long relationship, but investors mustn't buy into the hype and react so absurdly. On PayPal's earnings call, the company revealed that eBay only accounted for 13% of fourth-quarter transaction processing volumes (and that number is probably less in a non-holiday quarter where e-commerce activity is a lower proportion of PayPal's total TPV), down from 16% last year and 19% in the year before that. Clearly, eBay's importance to PayPal was on the wane, and for two good reasons: first, because PayPal's own business has expanded to many more e-tailers as well as non e-commerce outlets; and second, because eBay itself has become a bit stale.eBay's GMV in its Q4 release was up only 9% y/y (7% absent favorable currency conditions), and the number of active buyers grew only 5% y/y (when a Silicon Valley company remains at single-digit growth rates for an extended period of time, it's a huge red flag). As also disclosed on PayPal's call, eBay-related revenues grew only 7% in the full year, while non-eBay revenues grew 24% - combining into a total FY17 revenue y/y growth rate of 21%. From one point of view, you could even say eBay was dragging PayPal behind.The other reason not to worry: the eBay-PayPal relationship will be an extended breakup. eBay expects Adyen to be its primary payment processor in 2021, and PayPal can continue providing its services through 2023 (frankly, I'm doubtful eBay will even exist in 2023 - if it does, it will probably be at a much reduced size). With the eBay revenue mix dropping by three points per year for the past two years, a continuation of that decline (a point of view articulated by PayPal management on the call) would have probably reduced eBay naturally to a negligible amount by 2023 anyway.And a side note: anything can happen in 3-5 years' time. Companies can rarely see one or two quarters in the future; much less agree on a major business decision that will fully close five years in the future.Much ado has been made of the fact that for one of the first times in history, China has become more advanced in the deployment of one particular technology than the U.S., and that's in the realm of mobile payments. Recent articles suggest that Chinese mobile pay volume reached $5 trillion in 2016, and one can only guess how much that volume grew in 2017. Some articles suggest the y/y growth rate is in the order of 23%.The U.S. is not yet there. Though credit cards and cash have become rather antiquated in China, Americans are still attached to carrying wallets and plunking down plastic for their purchases. Mobile payments services have been slower in getting off the ground in the U.S., but they are quickly becoming an integral part of our financial fabric.The most successful and well-known one, of course, is Venmo - and few know that Venmo is actually a subsidiary of PayPal. Venmo transaction volumes grew 87% y/y in Q4 to $10.4 million, according to PayPal, and total P2P transactions grew 50% y/y to $27 billion (the typical Venmo transaction, of course, has a significantly lower dollar average).The bottom line: PayPal still has a lot of ground to cover in the U.S. as it comes to mobile payments and P2P transactions, and it's at the forefront of the market. These secular tailwinds will pay dividends to PayPal's core business for a long time. eBay is the past; a business centered on mobile payments is the future.Narrative aside, PayPal's numbers also speak for themselves. Here's a look at the company's fourth-quarter earnings:Figure 1. PayPal Q4 resultsSource: PayPal investor relationsTotal revenues grew 26% y/y on a constant currency basis to $3.74 billion, actually an acceleration over the full year's constant currency growth rate of 21% y/y. Analysts were expecting $3.62 billion in revenues, or 3% lower than what PayPal actually achieved.The growth, of course, was driven by a boost in the underlying payment volumes. TPV grew to a staggering $131.4 billion in the quarter (up 29% y/y on a constant currency basis). We note that there's still a large opportunity to be had here when we compare that figure to the Chinese $5 trillion in payments (at an estimated 20-25% growth rate, give or take a few points).Another reason to like PayPal is that it's not just growing the top-line, it's boosting its efficiencies and growing the bottom line at an even faster rate. Operating margin in the quarter rose 22.5% - a substantial improvement over 15.4% in the prior Q4.Earnings, too, saw a massive improvement. GAAP net income figures aren't useful for PayPal (or really, any other company) this quarter as the Trump tax bill came with one-time accounting charges that distorted companies' earnings pictures. Thus, we'll rely on PayPal's pro forma net income of $670 million, up 31% y/y and translating to EPS of $0.55, which beat out analyst expectations by 2c.Another important point to make is that PayPal's guidance hit analysts' indicated range despite already considering the impact of the eBay breakup (which, presumably, analysts knew nothing about). This implies that PayPal is forecasting stronger growth in its core (non-eBay) business that analysts weren't expecting. PayPal is projecting revenue of $15.0-$15.25 billion (15-17% y/y growth) in FY18, in line with analyst projections of $15.16 billion. Note that this represents a very reasonably <6x EV/FTM revenue multiple, as well as a ~33x forward P/E multiple based on its pro forma EPS guidance of $2.24-$2.30. In the context of ~30% earnings growth and massive operating margin expansions, PayPal is a relative bargain.PYPL EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsPayPal's stock seems to be on sale as investors over-estimated the impact of eBay's business, which was already declining in importance even before eBay announced the split. Luckily for investors who are able to see past the near-term headline risk and look instead to PayPal's immense growth opportunities in its core businesses, the stock is currently on sale."
4143187,104109,2018-02-05T13:06:30-05:00,"PayPal's stock price has more than doubled since the IPO.We identify and assess the drivers of the price appreciation: strategic decisions, strong business performance and a shift in investors' narrative.We comment on Q4 2017 results and earnings conference call, including the likely impact of eBay's transition to in-house payments intermediation.We dissect the hypotheses backed in the current stock price and conclude that although there may be still some room for further appreciation, the easy money has been made.","PayPal (PYPL) has been in our market-beating portfolio since August 2015, a few months after the separation from eBay (EBAY).Two and a half years later, the stock is up some 140%. With Q4 2017 earnings just behind us, it is the right time to revisit the original long thesis in the light of substantial business developments and a spectacular stock price appreciation.In August 2015, a few months after the separation from eBay, PayPal's common stock was trading in the low $30s. The business was very profitable, had a cash-rich balance sheet, and mid-term guidance was calling for mid to high teens annual growth for the foreseeable future.Besides, in 2013, while still an eBay division, PayPal had acquired some assets of extraordinary franchise potential, namely Venmo and Braintree, for a meager $800 million.After due diligence, we concluded that the stock offered great potential at a large margin of safety to intrinsic value. And we bought aggressively.With the benefit of hindsight, the IPO price seems like a bargain. But why was the stock so modestly priced at the time? Or maybe rather, why is the business so richly priced today? Has the value of the underlying business really increased some 140% in 29 months?We start by making two observations:(1) Even though in 2015 we were much more optimistic than the market about PayPal's prospects, actual business performance has exceeded our expectations.In a later section, we will estimate intrinsic value following Q4 2017 results to throw some light on whether the stock price appreciation can be explained based on financial outperformance alone.(2) Investors' narrative has undergone significant shifts within the span of these two and a half years.After the IPO, investors' focus was on the over-reliance on the legacy eBay business and on impending competition from payment products by better capitalized competitors such as Apple Pay (AAPL), Google Wallet/Android Pay - today unified into Google Pay (GOOG/GOOGL), and Samsung Pay (OTC:SSNLF).After a few beat and raise quarters, fears subdued, giving way to a climate of optimism. And the stock price responded in kind.Then in 2016, CEO Dan Schulman shocked the markets when he announced a bold bet on customer choice. PayPal balance would no longer be enforced as the preferred payment method. Instead, customers would be given the choice to select one of their credit cards, debit cards or bank accounts as preferred payment method. Agreements with Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Facebook (FB) and other industry giants promptly followed.The direct financial impact was an ugly one: higher transaction costs, as PayPal would be sharing payment processing fees with banks and credit card platforms. The promised benefits, namely stable long-term pricing agreements with the credit card companies on terms allegedly beneficial to PayPal, and above all, better customer acquisition and engagement, and lower support costs, as a result of a more flexible service, were much more ethereal. And so the stock price backed that skepticism.But to the credit of Dan Schulman and his management team, PayPal's performance accelerated across the board in the following quarters thanks to the embrace of choice. Companies previously seen as threats were now strategic partners. And PayPal was no longer a narrow payments button, but a dominant payments platform. Once again, fear succumbed to enthusiasm, and the stock price doubled in 2017.Then came Q4 2017 earnings conference calls from PayPal and eBay last week. The latter announced that it would start to intermediate payments on its marketplace platform, with Dutch payments processor Adyen becoming its primary provider behind the scenes, replacing PayPal. If PayPal's Q3 2017 Q&A session was a party, Q4 was an interrogation, with 90%+ of analyst questions delving into eBay, and PayPal management on the defensive.Our opinion in the matter: just as the move to customer choice, despite initial lukewarm reception, eventually played to PayPal's advantage, so will the move to partner choice. In letting a marketplace go, PayPal opens dozens of doors to much more promising venues.More generally, Q4 was a strong quarter and 2018 guidance is solid, calling for almost 20% growth and revenues and earnings, when adjusted for the transaction with Synchrony Financial (SYF).In 2015, we believed that FCF (free cash flow) net of SBC (stock-based compensation) was the most appropriate metric to value PayPal, and we still believe it today.The chart below shows PayPal TTM (twelve trailing months) revenue and adjusted FCF margin for the last 7 quarters. Adjusted FCF margin is the fraction of FCF net of SBC to revenues.For Q4 2017, FCF has been adjusted to account for the impact of held for sale accounting related to the sale of U.S. consumer credit receivables to Synchrony Financial.PayPal TTM revenue (million USD) and adjusted FCF margin(source: Investment Works)2017 revenues came in at $13,055 million.Revenue has grown at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 19% from Q2 2016 to Q4 2017. For full year 2018, the company is guiding to 14-16% growth on an FX-neutral basis, which includes an expected impact related to the sale of U.S. consumer credit receivables to Synchrony Financial of ~3.5 percentage points. But the sale should have a positive impact on cash flow generation, with increased FCF margin more than offsetting reduced reported revenue (this is before accounting for the one-time cash inflow of at least $6.4 billion when the transaction closes). Had PayPal decided to retain the U.S. consumer credit receivables, PayPal would have guided to 18.5% growth at the midpoint (15+3.5%) on a FX-neutral basis, or 19.5% growth without Forex adjustment.As shown in the chart, TTM FCF has fluctuated between a minimum of 17.6% and a maximum of 18.8%, ending 2017 at 18.7%. Adjusted NOPAT margin (net operating profit after tax, using a 21% tax rate) has been consistently lower, in the 15% ballpark, even though our adjusted NOPAT figures capitalize S&M and product development expenses in an attempt to estimate the margins the company could sustain with zero growth. The difference between adjusted FCF and adjusted NOPAT is due, first, to the accounting for transaction and loan losses in earnings and, to a lesser degree, to a systematic mismatch between D&A (depreciation and amortization) and capex. However, FCF margin has remained fairly stable, which suggests that it is sustainable and that the company was conservative in its reserves for transaction and loan losses.Finally, we note that although PayPal's take-rate has decreased every single quarter since the IPO, the company has so far managed to retain its high margins through operating leverage.With a discount rate of 6% (selected in light of the low level of interest rates and the recurrent and relatively safe nature of PayPal's CF), the value of 2017 FCF comes in at $39.2 billion ($2.35 billion / 0.06). We can see this number as the Earnings Power Value (EPV), or the value of a constant stream of FCF.The company has some $7.7 billion in excess cash and cash equivalents, which brings the value of equity, assuming no future growth, to $46.9 billion.In using a 6% discount rate, we have applied a 16.7 multiplier to 2017 adjusted FCF. We believe PayPal deserves a much higher multiple of current distributable CFs, given its sustainable competitive advantages (as the dominant digital payments platform) and immense growth potential (the continuing shift from cash to digital payments is all but certain, and the cash payments TAM is enormous). But how much larger?The book value of equity in Q4 2017 balance sheet was $16 billion. $7.7 billion of those assets are cash and cash equivalents that played no role in the generation of cash flows. But we believe that they are approximately offset by the investments required by a new entrant to reproduce PayPal's payment platform, brand reputation and number users and merchants, which we estimate somewhat above 3x annual S&M and product development expenses of some $2 billion a year. So both things considered, we estimate the real value of PayPal's productive net assets at about $16 billion.The fact that EPV ($39.2 billion) handily exceeds net asset value ($16 billion) confirms our observation that PayPal has powerful competitive advantages (companies without competitive moats cannot sustain EPV above net asset value).Correspondingly, PayPal's ROC (return on capital) comes in at 14.7% ($2.35 billion/$16 billion), well above the assumed 6% cost of capital. This again speaks to powerful competitive advantages.Nb.: If any of these financial concepts is unknown to you, or you want to learn more about the underlying logic, we recommend you pay a visit to the Investment Works Academy.We are not big fans of discounted cash flow analysis, for it places the same weight on metrics that are known today with relative certainty (such as balance sheet on current earnings items) as on uncertain forecasts of the far future.Nevertheless, given that PayPal is growing at rates much larger than its current cost of capital, there is no way around it. (Constant growth models require growth rates below cost of capital, for a company able to sustain growth equal or larger than its cost of capital would be worth the entire universe).Rather than coming up with a concrete estimation of intrinsic value, which would be very uncertain given the uncertain nature of forecasts of the future, we reverse-engineer the current markcap of $94.1 billion (1,228 million diluted shares at $76.6/share).Intrinsic value matches current stock price under the following assumptions:Are the assumptions backed in PayPal stock price of mid $70s realistic?In our opinion, they are not out of touch with reality. In fact, they leave some room for future price appreciation once the effects of the eBay breakup are digested. The annual growth rate of 15.2% and the 20x FCF multiple may prove too conservative. And as said, there is enough TAM for many decades of growth.But the assumptions don't leave much room for a margin of safety either. A faster than expected interest rates ramp, for instance, could render the 6% discount rate and even the 20 multiple, too optimisticAnd the narrative could turn even nastier as Apple, Google and Samsung Pay make inroads in mobile payments. While the potential effect of competition from these three giants is presently out of the conversation, we suspect that there will come a day when a PayPal earnings conference call Q&A session will be all about the switch of iPhone and Mac users from PayPal to Apple Pay for their mobile and online payments. After all, the integration of PayPal platform into an Apple product will never be as seamless as that of Apple Pay. And there is nothing that PayPal can do about that. So reader beware.This is not a relinquishment to the long investment thesis. It is just an attempt to moderate expectations.To sum up: the easy money has been made.PayPal is not expensive relative to the broad US stock market. But the US stock market is expensive by historical standards.Our recommendation is for long investors to maintain their position.Investors without stakes in the company may consider initiating a long position, but we believe there are more compelling opportunities in the market.If you have enjoyed the read, click on Follow at the right of our logo. We will update our thesis after the Q1 earnings conference call in May. In the meantime, we will keep publishing research on potential stock picks and other positions in our portfolio."
4154223,104298,2018-03-07T14:52:18-05:00,PayPal is already a dominant player in digital transactions.The recent patent filing shows that the company is toying with entering the cryptocurrency space.Entering the cryptocurrency space won't be a financial burden on PayPal; the company is financially secure and growing at a rapid pace.The risk-reward metric is highly favorable.,"Global payment giant PayPal Holdings (PYPL) recently filed a patent with the US Patent and Trademark Office for an ""expedited virtual currency transaction system"", which has managed to raise a few eyebrows among tech and crypto enthusiasts. Though the company hasn't yet disclosed what service or product it will be launching in regard to the patent filing, the filing somewhat reveals PayPal's intentions. If nothing else, it points towards the payment giant's increased focus towards cryptocurrencies and the R&D it is conducting in that space.Regardless of whether one is a proponent or critic of cryptocurrencies, PayPal's formal entry into this space will definitely make things exciting and can also provide the next leg of growth for the payment giant after the e-commerce led growth starts to dwindle. Before we take a look at the patent and discuss its implication, let's first talk about PayPal and its growth till now, which has come from the company's core operations and acquisitions. PayPal was spun off from eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) in July 2015. Since then, the former's stock has generated a return of over 120%. However, most of those gains came in the year 2017. Yes, the secular bull run in equities helped, but that cannot take away the stellar financial performance of the company in the past few quarters.PYPL EPS Diluted (Quarterly) data by YChartsOne look at the above chart is enough to understand why PayPal's stock had such a huge rally last year. The rally in equities drove the stock higher and also lead to P/E expansion, but that can not take away from the fact that financially PayPal performed exceedingly well during the same period. In the fourth quarter alone, the company's revenue and EPS grew by 26% and 57% y-o-y, respectively.A lot of this growth can be attributed to the company's core operations and the fact that apart from adding 15% new active accounts in the fiscal year, it also saw a jump of 8% in payment transactions per active account during the same time (Source: Q4 Results). However, that is only one-half of PayPal's success recipe, the other is acquisitions. It is not a secret that PayPal has been extremely active in acquiring and investing in FinTech companies. Source: PayPal Media ResourcesThe above picture shows PayPal's milestones since 2013. Notice the number of acquisitions, rebranding efforts and new launches by the company. Among them is the acquisition of BrainTree and its subsidiary Venmo. Now, anybody who tracks PayPal knows how much of a prized possession Venmo has become for the company. The app that was initially launched as a peer-to-peer payment service has grown into a full-fledged mobile payment platform accepted by more than two million merchants in the U.S. ( revealed by PayPal in its latest quarterly results). In Fiscal 2017, the volume of payments processed by Venmo jumped by a whopping 97% to approximately $35 billion and all this growth came from only the U.S. as PayPal is yet to launch Venmo outside the country (Source: Q4 Results). A jump in all the growth metrics that PayPal has shown in the past few quarters leads to two important conclusions:As mentioned at the beginning of the article, the recent patent filed by PayPal is about a system that will expedite virtual currency transactions. Here is the abstract from the filing:Without getting into technical details, and thereby confuse the uninitiated, I would like to keep things simple and explain what system intends to do. However, in order to do so, one must at least understand the difficulty faced while transacting in cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin etc.) that the system is trying to solve.Those who have ever transacted in Bitcoins know that it usually takes 10 minutes to complete a transaction. This delay is caused by the blockchain, the technology that drives Bitcoin, getting updated. Bitcoin is based on a decentralized ledger system (blockchains), so for the transaction to be completed, it will have to be updated across all the nodes in the Bitcoin infrastructure and this usually takes 10 minutes. In his recent article on CNBC, Julian Hosp, co-founder and president of TenX, mentioned this delay faced during transactions as the number one reason that is negatively affecting the growth of Bitcoin's user base. Hosp wrote:In his article, Mr. Hosp mentions Lightning Network, created by Blockstream, as one of the solutions. The patent filed by PayPal is also about a system that will solve this delay in transaction problem, albeit differently.PayPal's system is about creating subsidiary wallets from a primary wallet of a user that will have their own private subsidiary keys. When one user wants to receive a payment from another user, the former is given a subset of the latter's private subsidiary keys which will be equal to the amount of cryptocurrency being asked by the former.As one can see, the patent filed by PayPal has tremendous potential. Not only will it decrease the time it takes to complete a transaction, but will also ensure that numerous transactions can take place at the same time. This will help not only those who are currently using or transacting in Bitcoin, but will also help in the growth of merchants accepting payment in Bitcoins.A few analysts here on Seeking Alpha (article1, article 2) have previously argued that cryptocurrencies can pose a threat to PayPal. However, I don't see it as a threat, rather a new driver of growth. And, looking at PayPal's interest in the space it seems the company agrees with me. PayPal was among the first payment services company to establish a relationship with players in the cryptocurrency space. In 2014, the company partnered with three Bitcoin payment processors - BitPay, Coinbase, and GoCoin. This partnership allowed merchants using PayPal Payments Hub to accept payments in Bitcoin from these three companies. Apart from partnerships, the company also think that usage of cryptocurrencies for payments will continue to grow. This became evident in an interview given by PayPal's CFO, John Rainey, to Wall Street Journal recently. In that interview, when asked about whether he sees cryptocurrency becoming a popular payment mechanism, Mr. Rainey said that there is “a very high likelihood” of it. However, he also mentioned that it is unlikely to happen soon. According to him:Ever since cryptocurrencies started capturing public's imagination, early adopters have been crying hoarse about its benefits over fiat currencies. However, that has still kept most people away from using or transacting in them. The reason behind it boils down to just one thing - trust. Despite being touted as currencies that are outside any governmental or regulatory control, immune from manipulation or rapid devaluation, there are several factors that prevent people from using them and all of those factors point towards just one thing - a lack of trust. These factors may differ - hack attacks, shady practices by crypto exchanges, unsafe wallets etc., but they can all be eliminated by making the whole ecosystem more trustable and secure. That's where PayPal comes in. In the last few months, we have seen the entry of reputed players in the cryptocurrency space. Whether it is Square Inc (NYSE:SQ) through its Cash app, or Robinhood (which allowed cryptocurrency trading for the first batch of users in 5 states recently), established names are helping in making cryptocurrencies more legitimate. However, none of them command the trust that PayPal commands or is as big as PayPal is.Think about the number of people who are interested in cryptocurrencies, but are still sitting on the sidelines just because they don't trust the various players running the cryptocurrency ecosystem currently or because they hate the time it takes to complete a cryptocurrency transaction. All those people will be willing to join the bandwagon if PayPal enters the space.As we have discussed earlier in the article, PayPal is growing at a rapid pace, its expenses are minimal and cash flow is humongous. The company is already doing great in digital payments, is a leader in person-to-person and mobile payments, has the trust of millions of users and merchants. These moats will not only come in handy but will strengthen PayPal's position in cryptocurrency exchange and transactions as a dominant player.From an expense point also, entering the space is not prohibitive. This can be gauged by the number of new entrants in the space, most of whom don't have the financial heft anywhere close to PayPal. Moreover, if there are expenses in R&D, it will only be minimal as PayPal already has a lot of existing infrastructure from its core operations which can be used for this business. While the risk is minimal for PayPal, the gains can be immense. According to Coinmarketcap, the present market cap of the top 100 cryptocurrencies in circulation is nearly $446 billion, significantly less than what it was in mid-December last year. Nevertheless, let's for a moment just stick with the $446 billion figure. Bitcoin with a market cap of $185.6 billion, alone accounts for over 41% of the whole cryptocurrency market and the value of all the Bitcoins traded in the last 24-hours amounts to $6.58 billion. Now, I am not an analyst who will provide projection or estimates that will make you buy my story. I will leave the calculations to you guys. Feed in any market share, fee, commissions and come out with a number. Even if the number is low, just ask yourself this question -What's PayPal got to lose?"
4142791,47521,2018-02-02T16:58:56-05:00,Terms of OA still in place through 2020.eBay already was becoming less of a factor to PayPal's performance.eBay will become a much smaller part of the business by the end of the OA.Over the long term this will benefit PayPal.,"source: techcrunchHeadlines have been heavily focused on the news that eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was going to drop PayPal (PYPL) as its primary partner for processing payments, turning instead to Dutch-based Adyen.One of the items listed as significantly detrimental to PayPal is that eBay accounts for 13 percent of total process volume (TPV) of PayPal in the fourth quarter, implying it would be a meaningful negative catalyst going forward. What isn't mentioned by most news outlets is that the revenue generated by that 13 percent accounted for a little under 10 percent of PayPal's sales in the quarter, or about $370 million, based upon revenue of $3.74 billion in the quarter.The share price of PayPal plummeted 11 percent on the news, which also was triggered by lower guidance than the market was looking for.In this article we'll look at why this really isn't a surprise for those following PayPal, and why the company is unlikely to be impacted meaningfully over the long term.PayPal and eBay have a five-year operating agreement in place that governs the spin-off. At this time it's only halfway through the five-year period, which will end in July 2020.The company pointed out that there will be no changes in the terms through the end of the agreement period, which was ""meant to assure both the thoughtful and a smooth transition for both companies post-separation.""On eBay's part, it said the reason for the change was to provide lower costs to sellers, as well as additional options for buyers.By 2021, eBay expects the majority of its global marketplace customers to have access to and be using the new system.According to PayPal spokeswoman Amanda Miller, as quoted by CNN, the company will ""continue to provide a comprehensive payments solution to eBay through July 2020."" The two companies also agreed that PayPal will be an option offered to customers of eBay through July 2023.For some time eBay has represented a declining percent of processing volume and revenue. As mentioned earlier, in the last quarter it was approximately 13 percent of TPV, down about 900 basis points over the last couple of years.  Last year in the same reporting period eBay accounted for 16 percent of TPV, and the year before that about 19 percent.The company noted that based upon that ongoing downward trajectory, by the end of its operating agreement, eBay would account for somewhere around 4 percent of its TPV. The point is this was going to happen whether or not eBay went with Adyen.Even if eBay accounts for a little more than that, PayPal will without a doubt make more acquisitions that will reduce the percent of processing volume represented by eBay, which means 4 percent is a reasonable figure to base our models on, and it could be even less than that, depending on the size of the acquisitions PayPal makes, as well as the types of deals it makes with many of the companies it's working to build partnerships with.PayPal also pointed out the terms of the existing operating agreement limits its ability to work with large companies operating in that market place. This will release a lot of potential after the agreement expires.I agree with company management that this is a very manageable situation, and one it has been preparing for some time. I think many of those who sold on the headlines will regret it in the years ahead. Most of those following PayPal weren't surprised by what happened, and most likely view it as an opportunity to buy the dip.One way to look at the eBay announcement was the one we already covered, which it was a declining part of the overall business of PayPal. And with growth in its existing business and acquisitions, this will continue to decline.The other way to view it is in regard to recent business deals that will increase the amount of business done outside of eBay by more than the current 87 percent, as well as the deals currently being negotiated that will add to the top and bottom lines of the company.PayPal noted that in the current quarter it entered into an international agreement with The Walt Disney Company, Dillards and QVC in North America, while adding ePrice in Italy, Dell in the UK, and BookMyShow and MakeMyTrip in India.With QVC customers now having PayPal as an option, it could be a meaningful processing and revenue source if it takes hold, as QVC is number three in mobile commerce in the U.S., playing well into the mobile strategy of PayPal, as well as the third-largest in e-commerce in North America, according to Internet Retailer.BookMyShow is the largest ticketing platform for online entertainment in India, and MakeMyTrip is the largest online travel company there.PayPal has been operating for some time in India for international buyers. These plays also will move it toward working with major Indian merchants at the domestic level.India is especially compelling because its leadership is pushing toward building a robust digital economy. This plays into PayPal's strengths.Less visible but with a lot of potential is the company ""working closely with over 20 of the largest credit card issuers in the world."" The company said most of them have initiated campaigns ""to encourage and in many cases incent customers to engage with PayPal.""Some of the companies mentioned in its earnings report are Citi, FIS, Bank of America, Facebook Messenger, AliExpress and Baidu. PayPal is either working on entering into, launching or expanding existing agreements, as in the case of Facebook Messenger, with these and other companies.The declining amount of payments processed for eBay by PayPal, potential acquisitions, and winning new business means moving away from PayPal as its main process will have very limited impact on PayPal.If this announcement had been made a year or two ago, it would have had a more dramatic impact on PayPal. But with the company decentralizing and growing its customer base, eBay has been rapidly shrinking as a percentage of its revenue and TPV.The argument could be made that it would be better for PayPal to retain its volumes with eBay while growing its customer base. That wasn't going to happen because eBay and PayPal know each one will do better with the direction both are taking.PayPal is facing a lot of competition in the payment processing space and needed to be shoved out of the eBay nest to learn to fly on its own. On the part of eBay, it needed to be able to look at a variety of payment processors in order to secure the lower costs for its business.In this case, both of the companies are winners, and over the long term this is going to be a positive even for PayPal. It'll push it to accelerate the pace of its negotiations, and possibly acquisitions.When the smoke clears PayPal will be considered a much stronger company than it is today because of the eventual break with eBay. Again, PayPal will be a payment option on eBay through July 2023, and I would think, even though by that time eBay will be a very little piece of PayPal's business, it will still allow PayPal as an option. That will depend on the payment processing market at that time and what type of demand is coming from eBay users."
4163219,24491,2018-04-16T09:59:29-04:00,"PayPal is a fantastic entity that generates considerable free cash flow and has a pristine balance sheet, with a sizable net cash position.We think Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies represent more of an opportunity than a threat to entrenched digital payments providers like PayPal.The loss of PayPal's deal with eBay beginning in 2023 was quite the blow, but PayPal can replace this business in a matter on months at its current growth rate.We're not reading too much into Amazon's entrance into the digital payments space, as we believe the industry is large enough for a great many players.The risks at PayPal have increased during the past few months, but we value shares at the high end of our fair value range in the mid-$80s.","By The Valuentum TeamWe've been fans of PayPal (PYPL), even since the company was a part of eBay (EBAY) several years ago, and we thank Carl Ichan for being the driving factor behind the split of these two fantastic companies. Though many believe eBay is tech dinosaur from the dot-com era, we still think it has life, but we couldn't be more excited about the prospects at PayPal. The number of people still paying with cash or check is considerable, for example, and while there is still a long runway of growth at the credit card payment processors, Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), PayPal's growth story may even be better, though it does come with some incremental risks - not the least of which is the lost contract agreement with eBay. In any case, PayPal has a lot going for it, and the company may be worth considering as a long-term idea targeting the proliferation of e-commerce and digital payment technologies.Bitcoin (COIN) has taken almost everybody by storm, and the blockchain technology backing it is quite interesting. Though we have no reason to disagree with the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency bulls (optimists), we think the conversation rate of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into USD, or their value, is still quite debatable. A discussion behind what a fair price for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is beyond the scope of this article, but what is important to mention, in our view, is that the presence and widespread ""notoriety"" of Bitcoin may be all the evidence needed to suggest online digital payments are here to stay, whether they are conducted in dollars, another currency, or even cryptocurrency.In this light, we don't view Bitcoin as a risk to digital payment technology companies, but rather another source of growth for them. Though merchants and businesses may be concerned with the tremendous volatility of Bitcoin and may wait for the cryptocurrency to exhibit more reasonable trading ranges (store of value), surveys have indicated that as many as 60% of merchants may be interested in accepting Bitcoin as another option for United States dollars. That's a pretty high number, in our view. It's possible that merchants, too, may have been caught up in the meteoric rise of cryptocurrency assets, but this may just be phase 1 of broader acceptance of the technology. Awareness is required before trust can be built, and a large percentage of the world is now aware of the potential for blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies.Square (SQ) may have been an early-mover to accept cryptocurrency technology, but we think other digital payment technology companies, including PayPal, may start to view cryptocurrency as an extension of their business models, if they haven't already. Many may not recall that PayPal started to incorporate Bitcoin into its applications in 2015, well before the latest buzz in the cryptocurrency that captivated much of the marketplace. Perhaps going full-steam ahead in cryptocurrency doesn't make much sense right now, as PayPal has mentioned that the volatility of Bitcoin's price, for example, may completely wipe out a merchant's margin on a sale. Typically, companies like to eliminate currency risk from their operations. The acceptance of merchants and businesses of Bitcoin at this point may only increase the risk to their operations, given considerable volatility in the store-of-the-value of proceeds from any transaction.Though Square is taking a more public route to Bitcoin acceptance, in our view (or at least it gets more press), PayPal is not sitting idly by either. The point that we're trying to make is not so much with respect to the potential proliferation of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, for example, but rather that digital payment technology is becoming more and more mainstream, just given the buzz surrounding cryptoassets. Whereas decades ago, consumers were even skeptical of credit cards, nowadays many are growing more and more comfortable with digital assets - even those have been lost or stolen in the past or have been associated with illegal activity, fairly presented or not - despite tremendous volatility. Widespread acceptance of digital currencies will only drive further acceptance of existing payment technologies, in our view. Long-term, we see more opportunities than threats with Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at PayPal.Image Source: 2017 10-K, page 29For the new generation, it seems as though digital payments technology is the way of the world. Whether one is buying things through Amazon (AMZN), swiping his or her credit card on a merchant's Square reader, or sending or receiving money through PayPal, everything already seems digital, but it's not. Where the Internet has already vastly changed people's everyday lives, within financial services, however, the potential has not yet been completely realized. PayPal would agree that the ""traditional financial order remains firmly in place,"" and ""the way most people move and manage their money hasn't changed much since credit cards appeared on the scene 50 years ago (source: 2017 10-K, ""Message From Our President and CEO).""As with the credit-card network providers, Visa and MasterCard, PayPal benefits from a powerful network effect -- as more and more consumers use PayPal, more and more merchants accept the platform and so on. The company already has tremendous scale, and it would take a major disruption to alter consumer behavior that is rather well-established. At the end of 2017, for example, PayPal had 227 million active customer accounts, including 18 million active merchant accounts. PayPal is handling a tremendous amount of payment volume already, and its brand name still has room for greater acceptance, something that may only take time.The company's business model is relatively easy to understand. PayPal generates a fee for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services, and its business model is driven by volume, so a long runway of adoption will be key to further revenue increases. As shown in the image above, PayPal has roughly doubled revenue since 2013, and the separation from eBay may have played a large role in this, as the company now is run by a management team solely focused on growing the organization, rather than growing both it and eBay. Operating income and net income at PayPal have doubled over this time period, too, and we see little to slow down both the top-line and profit gains at this emerging payments giant.Image Source: 2017 Proxy Statement, page 32PayPal is a veritable cash-flow-generating powerhouse. During the past three fiscal years, the company has generated more than $2.5 billion in operating cash flow, with the measure eclipsing the $3.1 billion mark in fiscal 2016. Free cash flow, as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital expenditures, has also been robust coming in north of $1.8 billion in each of the past three years, with the mark reaching nearly $2.5 billion in fiscal 2016. PayPal benefits from a capital-light business model, and the scale that it continues to build allows it to spread costs over a larger and larger customer base. We'd expect this dynamic not only to help drive operating margins higher in time, but we think this will also provide considerable support to future free cash flows. Capital expenditures have fallen to ~$670 million in fiscal 2017 from ~$720 million in fiscal 2015, revealing more conservative spending.Image Source: 2017 10-K, page 42We couldn't be bigger fans of PayPal's balance-sheet health. The company holds cash and cash equivalents (including investments) of ~$7.5 billion at the end of 2017 and just $1 billion in notes payable on the books, translating into a considerable net cash position. Net cash is not only a key driver behind the intrinsic value of any organization, but it provides tremendous flexibility with respect to strategic acquisitions or a capital-return program, including buybacks (the company bought back 4 million shares during 2017 and has ~$5 billion remaining on its share buyback program). We think the executive team is comfortable building a net cash position, and we hope the company will exercise caution in putting that source of intrinsic value to use, whether with buybacks or in other endeavors (at the right price). Though we may like to see greater pursuit of cryptocurrency applications at PayPal, we think perhaps the best approach may be a wait-and-see one, given the tremendous volatility of cryptocurrency assets at the moment. In the meantime, PayPal is building up its patent portfolio related to cryptocurrency assets.Though we like PayPal's long-term growth ""story,"" its solid free cash flow generation and fantastic balance-sheet health, the company is not without its share of risks. The biggest one is technology-oriented, but we may have seen the next evolution in payments technology with the advent of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, and their adoption may be a direct or indirect positive related to the proliferation of digital payments technology. Said differently, Bitcoin and other cryptoassets may be more of an opportunity than a threat, at least for the foreseeable future, as it relates to cutting-edge providers such as PayPal and Square.The regulatory environment is a big risk to the profit stream at PayPal in the event of excessive payment fee regulation, which could weigh on the stock in anticipation of potential margin pressures. PayPal has already faced a number of data breaches, and while the company is doing all that it can to protect consumer data, even what-appears-to-be honest missteps, as in the case of Facebook's (FB) Cambridge Analytica fiasco, can cause liabilities. As the company's business continues to evolve, PayPal may also grow more and more exposed to the credit risk of its merchants and customers. The biggest risk to PayPal, however, may be related to its relationship with eBay, which appears to be going away in coming years. eBay announced February 1, 2018, for example, that most of its payments will go through Adyen in 2021, though eBay will remain a payment option through July 2023, according to Bloomberg.PayPal's exposure to eBay is rather large, estimated at roughly $24.4 billion of total payments volume during the important holiday selling season, the fourth-quarter of 2017. Total payment volume processed at PayPal during the fourth quarter totaled $131 billion, so we estimate the impact of the loss of the continuation the eBay contract as a net detraction to payments volume to the tune of nearly 19%. Though we expect PayPal to outgrow its loss with eBay in time and we hope that the company's will surprise to the upside with a new eBay deal in 2023, it's still a big blow to PayPal at this time, and one that we wish the company would have been able to avoid. Offering some price concessions to eBay may make sense if they come to the table again, as losing nearly 19% of total payments volume is no ""small potatoes."" In any case, it's just a missed opportunity. PayPal needs to go back to the table and work something out.The breakdown in the relationship between eBay and PayPal was surprising, and PayPal will have to work hard to replace that payment volume in coming years, but given current growth rates in total payment volume (up nearly 30% on an FX-neutral basis during the fourth quarter of 2017), the entire eBay deal may be the equivalent of just a few months of growth at PayPal. In early April, Amazon noted that it may be interested in getting into the payments business, and according to the Wall Street Journal, utilizing Alexa for voice-activation payments features. There's a market for these sorts of trendy luxuries, but we maintain the bigger-picture view that there are still 2 billion people on the globe that lack the most basic banking applications. We think the biggest source of growth will rest on general adoption of basic digital features, not necessarily ones that have all the bells and whistles. In any case, the digital payments marketplace is large enough for a great many players, including Amazon and now more-formidable foe Adyen that appears to have stolen eBay's business away from PayPal.Image Source: ValuentumPayPal has a number of competitive advantages and it is locked in to the secular growth related to online payments and e-commerce adoption and technology. We think Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may pose more of an opportunity than a threat at this time, and while we are a bit concerned about the loss of business with eBay in 2023, PayPal is growing fast enough where it may replace that entire business in a matter of months, on the basis of current year-over-year growth rates in total payments volume. We're viewing the relationship with eBay as one that is nice-to-have rather than a must-have at this point, and we hope the two companies will be able to work something out to at least provide PayPal as another checkout option beyond 2023.Cybersecurity threats, excessive government regulation and PayPal's ongoing foray into business lines dependent on the creditworthiness of customers further increase its risk profile, as does the entrance of Amazon into payment services and ongoing technological developments by rivals. However, we think the digital payments business is big enough for a great many players, and any competitive impact may only slow PayPal's pace of growth, not eliminate it. Despite the growing uncertainty related to the company's prospects, we still like it. We peg our fair value for shares in the low-$70s, slightly lower than where it is currently trading, but the upside of our fair value range implies a value closer to the mid-$80s.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

4143889,102764,2018-02-07T05:20:17-05:00,"PayPal stock is down by over 15% in the past few days, mostly due to the fact that eBay has dropped PayPal as its main payments processor.
        The impact from losing eBay is relevant, but not a game changer for PayPal at this stage.
        PayPal is still remarkably solid from a broad perspective.
        The company has an attractive business model and a lot of room for growth.
        Chances are that the current pullback in PayPal stock will turn out to be a buying opportunity for investors.","eBay (EBAY) has recently announced that it will be changing PayPal (PYPL) for Adyen as its primary payments provider. This is understandably generating concerns among investors in PayPal, and shares of the digital payments provider are down by nearly 15% over the past few days. Is the separation from eBay a reason to sell PayPal or a buying opportunity?eBay purchased PayPal in 2002, and both companies were separated via a spin-off in July of 2015. Due to this close historical relationship, PayPal and eBay are closely related in investor's minds. However, a deeper look at recent numbers indicates that losing eBay is important, but not a game changer for PayPal at this stage.According to management statements during PayPal's most recent earnings conference call, volume associated with eBay represented 13% of the total payment volume during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 16% for the fourth quarter of 2016, and 19% two years ago.This means that eBay accounts for a sizeable share of total volume for PayPal, but that share is consistently declining in the past several years. Besides, it's not just about the percentage of payment volume coming from eBay, but what kind of impact it has on PayPal's revenue growth rates is even more important.Total revenue for PayPal was above $13 billion in 2017, growing by 21% on a currency neutral basis. Revenue related to eBay market places grew 7%, while PayPal's merchants' service revenue grew by a much larger 24%.In a nutshell, PayPal's merchants service revenue is growing at more than three times the rate of growth the company is getting from eBay. Measured in terms of contribution to revenue growth, eBay is not really a big growth engine for PayPal. Besides, the current agreement between PayPal and eBay will remain in place until July of 2020. By that date, chances are that eBay will account for an even smaller share of PayPal's total buisness and growth opportunities.Losing eBay will have a noticeable impact on revenue for PayPal, but it won't derail the company from it's long term growth trajectory. Looking at PayPal's financial performance and growth opportunities, the company still has a lot to offer over the years ahead, with or without eBay.PayPal produced $3.74 billion in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017, an annual increase of 26% on a constant currency basis. Operating profit margin expanded substantially, to 22.5% from 15.4% in the same quarter last year. Vigorous revenue growth in combination with expanding profit margins allowed PayPal to deliver a big increase of 30% in earnings per share during the quarter.The key customer metrics are all moving in the right direction, and growth rates are even accelerating. PayPal ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with 227 million active customer accounts, growing by an impressive 61% versus the fourth quarter in 2016. The company gained 8.7 million new accounts during the quarter, a new historical record.Image source: PayPalImportantly, engagement metrics are also improving, which bodes well in terms of measuring user satisfaction and the company's ability to generate value for customers. The number of payment transactions per active account reached 33.6 last quarter, marking a new record for PayPal and increasing 8%.International transactions are growing at full speed, with cross border trade increasing 20% during the quarter, the fastest growth rate in 10 quarters.Mobile is a crucial growth driver in the industry, and the company doesn't leave much to be desired in that area. PayPal processed $48 billion in mobile payment volume in the fourth quarter of 2017, that represents a 63% growth rate year-over-year and 36% the company's total payment volume. PayPal ended the quarter with over 80 million accounts in One Touch, up from 40 million a year ago. Venmo is also growing at full speed, with total payment volume during the quarter reaching 10.4 billion and growing 86% year-over-year.Looking into the future, it's important to note that approximately 85% of all commerce transactions around the world are still made in cash, and management estimates that the total addressable market for PayPal over the long term is worth nearly $100 trillion. In a nutshell, PayPal still has enormous potential for expansion over the years ahead.Image source: PayPal.Considering the risks, companies in the payments industry are always exposed to legal and regulatory uncertainty. Besides, the competitive landscape is quite dynamic, so investors need to closely monitor how different players in the payments sector interact with each other on order to make sure that PayPal remains well positioned to capitalize on its growth opportunities.The stock is also priced at a forward price to earnings ratio of 32 times earnings expectations for 2018 and 27 times earnings forecasts for 2019. PayPal is an exceptional growth story, so it can easily justify above-average valuation levels. Nevertheless, current valuation makes the stock vulnerable to the downside in case there is any disappointment down the road.In conclusion, the PayPal growth story remains intact in spite of the rupture with eBay. PayPal is delivering explosive growth and expanding profitability, and the company has abundant room for expansion in the years ahead. The lower the stock price goes, the bigger the opportunity for investors in PayPal."
4141013,90215,2018-01-29T15:04:58-05:00,"PayPal's acquisition of Square would make a lot of sense strategically.Square's share price appreciation means that it's an expensive target.PayPal can make the deal work by issuing equity and raising debt, but it will be EPS dilutive in all scenarios.A deal is likely to irk some investors and is therefore unlikely to happen at current valuations.","Fintech was one of the most impressive growth stories of 2017. Card payment incumbents Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) saw returns of ~40%. PayPal (PYPL) gained ~83% thanks to its double-digit growth in key areas, Venmo hype and a strengthening balance sheet. PayPal’s smaller competitor Square (SQ) saw the most explosive share price growth, gaining 151% in 2017. I think it’s fair to say that investors have finally bought into CEO Jack Dorsey’s vision and execution of digitizing offline retail (by very rough estimates, offline retail still represents 90-95% of worldwide commerce) and recognized tremendous growth that this opportunity could bring.PYPL data by YChartsSquare has been touted as a potential target for PayPal for some time now. There are some clear strategic motives for PayPal to pursue this acquisition, which we will look at below, but has Square become too expensive an acquisition for PayPal given that the company’s market cap has more than doubled over 12 months? This is exactly what this article will discuss, with a simple merger model presented below to answer some key questions about the acquisition, if it were to happen in the coming weeks.Strategic ConsiderationsBefore examining how Square might fit into PayPal financially, let’s examine how the companies compare strategically. The key takeaway is that aside from several overlaps (e.g. Square payment terminals and PayPal Here) the two companies seek to address different markets. PayPal seeks to address ecommerce merchants of all sizes – from simple internet start-up shops to large multinational corporations such as Uber, Netflix and Ryanair where payment via PayPal is possible. The core focus and the main source of profitability for PayPal, however, are medium- to large enterprises. Square, on the other hand, seeks to address small- to medium-sized businesses. In its 2017 Investor Day presentation, the company estimates that in the United States there are 21M such businesses which would approximately bring $3TN in TPV, which in turn should yield about $26BN in revenues. As of Q1’17, SQ achieved a penetration rate of less than 3% within this addressable market. This potential $3TN US TPV is more than seven times PayPal’s global TPV currently. Lastly, small and medium sized businesses are for the most part price takers and do not have the opportunity to negotiate lower take rates in return for volume and visibility as large companies can with PayPal. I admit that SMEs can also take their business to Stripe, iZettle, AdYen or another competitor, but the point prevails that SMEs are a more profitable segment of the digital payments market. If we take the crudest (and illustrative at best) estimate of take-rate possible (Revenue/TPV) for both companies during trailing 12 months, PayPal achieves a take-rate of 2.9%, while Square boasts 3.5%. In fact, Nomura’s recent equity research piece argues that Square’s take-rate/yield should remain stable as payment volume grows. This is, of course, a highly speculative point and I would still expect take rate deterioration for Square but I believe that the main point remains: achieving even a 25% penetration in the small- to medium-business space could increase PayPal’s scale exponentially as well as boost profitability.(Approximate TTM TPV, based on PYPL and SQ 10-Q filings)The acquisition would also significantly strengthen PayPal’s strategic position in the point of sale (POS) market, where PayPal Here competes with Square’s swipe readers and terminals. Currently, the U.S. pricing for the two services is almost identical: Square charges 2.75% for swipe/dip/tap transactions (PayPal Here charges 2.70%) and 3.15% + $0.15 per keyed-in transaction for both Square and PayPal Here. Consolidation of the two products (probably under the stronger Square brand) can bring about some synergies and provide another way for PayPal to promote Venmo.(Source: Square Investor Day 2017 Presentation)Similar arguments can be made for Square’s ecommerce and business management tools which can be consolidated into PayPal’s. Some areas such as Caviar are more tenuous and may have to be sold.PayPal will also be able to scale Square internationally. Currently, Square is only available in the major Anglophonic nations plus Japan. PayPal has a strong presence in EMEA and a more modest one in APAC. PayPal has a European banking license with a banking structure in Luxembourg. This is a valuable asset with which PayPal can launch Square at scale in all EU countries and offer an extended range of services. With the global economy growing at a steady clip, diversification into Europe and Asia appears to be a logical next step.Speaking financially, an acquisition of Square helps PayPal kill two birds with one stone – it will eliminate an emerging strong competitor and it bring further growth to the company in areas where PayPal would like to be more present. It’s true that PayPal has healthy growth upwards of 20%, but Square is growing north of 30% and is much more focused on the SME space as discussed above. This comprehensive presence across large and small businesses would help to achieve Dan Schulman’s fuzzy vision of having customers use PayPal at least once a day.Merger ModelLet’s talk numbers. How big of a premium will Square’s board want for them to recommend the deal to their shareholders? Which premium will keep activist investors such as Elliott Management at bay? Can PayPal afford Square + premium given SQ’s steep share price growth? If so, how can it finance such a merger? What synergies can be expected from this merger? Well, the truth is that I don’t know. But by analysing various scenarios and building some sensitivity tables we will be able to see what premium PayPal can afford to pay, how much equity it can issue and how much debt it can raise. We will see EPS accretion/dilution for each scenario and determine the level of synergies needed for the deal to be at least EPS neutral. Given how expensive Square is using traditional multiples, we can reasonably say that the rationale for acquiring the target will have to be more of a strategic one rather than a financial.I’m conscious of the fact that I’m writing this article just a couple of weeks before we will have FY2017 numbers available. PayPal could well have some material update on how tax cuts affect the company’s balance sheet but this analysis uses the Q3 balance sheet figures which are the latest available. Think of it as a conservative scenario, since tax cuts may well improve the picture there. For income statement items, I’m using mean analyst projections taken from Thomson Reuters Eikon, which again, should be quite accurate for FY2017 and reasonable estimates for profitability going forward.PayPal has about $4.9B of cash and short-term investments and no debt. Its market cap is $102.6B and its Enterprise Value is $97.7B. Square is currently worth $18.5B (and an EV of $18B). PayPal trades at 2018 EV/EBITDA of ~24x, while SQ trades at ~72x. Square is indeed expensive by any traditional metric.For the base case I will assume a 25% share price premium with a 50% stock consideration. I will also assume zero synergies. This base case is a stab in the air regarding financing and valuation, but since we are running sensitivity tables it doesn’t matter how accurate it is once it’s in the general ballpark. In all scenarios, I’m making an assumption that PayPal can pay $3B in cash from its balance sheet. This will leave PayPal’s cash and short term investment balance at almost $2B, which I think is a reasonable amount to continue its existing operations. I’m also assuming 1.5% of advisory fees on top of the acquisition enterprise value of the target.In the base case, Square’s equity purchase price is $23.2B. Adding $341M of advisory fees on top we have a total use of funds of $23.6B. $3B will be paid from existing cash. With a 50% stock consideration, PayPal equity issuance will raise another $11.6B, and finally $9B of debt will be raised to cover the rest. At current income statement projections from analysts, the combined entity will be 12% dilutive to EPS in 2018 and 6% dilutive in 2019. The pro-forma entity will also have a Net Debt/EBITDA of 2.3x and EBIT/Interest Expense of 6.7x. Current PayPal shareholders will have 89.8% ownership in the combined entity. You will need $330M of synergies in 2018 for the deal to break even and $230M in 2019.(Source: own model)Many will find my base case assumptions unrealistic, so it’s more useful to look at sensitivity tables based on these parameters.(Source: own model)Looking at the EPS Accretion/Dilution Analysis we can see that assuming zero synergies, all variations of stock consideration and premium paid will give an EPS-dilutive deal in 2018 and 2019. However, dilution is less the more equity PayPal issues to finance the acquisition. This makes sense, considering PayPal’s stock has also appreciated 83% in 2017 and a further 16% YTD in 2018. This makes PayPal stock a powerful means of payment for the company and if there is a good time to finance deals using equity, then this year would be it for PYPL. Interestingly, even a 40% share price premium will deteriorate EPS by less than 20% this year.This brings us to the next important question: how much of net synergies will the deal have to generate to make up for this dilution?(Source: own model)My model indicates that anywhere between $200-460M in 2018 and $160-300M in 2019. This is almost certainly an unachievable task in 2018, provided that are synergies typically not realized in the year of the acquisition. Comparing this with Square’s projected EBIT of $207M in 2018 and $356M in 2019, PayPal would certainly be hard pressed to find these cost savings and cross selling opportunities. We can clearly see that PayPal will not be able to use synergies alone as a justification for this acquisition.Finally, let’s have a top-level look at credit analysis, since PayPal will probably have to issue debt to bring this deal over the line. Here, there are certain limitations to PayPal’s debt capacity despite their current debt-free balance sheet.(Source: own model)PayPal will probably not have an investment grade if its Net Debt/EBITDA is higher than 4x, so I’ve used this as a cut-off point for leverage. Similarly, credit rating agencies will be reluctant the rate PYPL higher than BB+ if their EBIT/Net Interest Expense are lower than 7x. In this model, this restricts PayPal to finance more than half of the acquisition using equity. The base case of 25% premium and 50% stock is below the waterline for the EBIT/Net Interest expense requirement. It’s not a good idea for a tech company to lever up this much at the top of the cycle, so this reinforces the point that PYPL must issue equity to finance the deal.ConclusionThere are some obvious strategic reasons for PayPal to buy Square, as I’ve outlined above. Unfortunately, the company should have been acquired one year ago, when its valuation was a lot more reasonable. At current levels, the only realistic way for PayPal to finance the acquisition is by issuing the bulk of the ticket price in equity and levering up to fund the remainder and live with significant EPS dilution. Despite being in my opinion a great fit for PayPal, there is admittedly limited scope for synergies in this deal when compared to the target’s EBIT and how much would be needed to make the deal EPS accretive. I believe that this deal still makes a lot of sense for PYPL, but it is a much more risky move now than it would have been one year ago. PayPal’s executives will face many difficult conversations with the board and investors about the strategic direction of the company should they pursue this acquisition. There are other takeover targets for PayPal on both sides of the ocean and Square may not be the best fit. But one thing is likely: competing with Square could turn out a lot costlier for PayPal in a few years time."
4136932,52592,2018-01-11T12:37:04-05:00,"PayPal's forthcoming earnings should give investors another look at the company's execution in the digital transaction space.Venmo, the company's popular P2P app, is growing at a near triple digit pace.With cryptocurrency craze at an all-time high, PayPal offers exposure to the trend of offline to online transaction growth.","PayPal (PYPL), the digital payments company, delivered strong 2017 results throughout the year, consistently raising guidance while the stock rose from $40/share to roughly $80/share today. It experienced solid customer growth as the world trends of digital payments strengthened, and we would like to look at what to expect for PayPal when it reports Q4 results at the end of the month.In the last earnings report, PayPal reported net revenue growth of 21.4% coming in at $3.24bn. Transaction margin was 54.8%, even as the transaction expense rate was up quarter over quarter. It added 8.2mn accounts, up 88%, with 218mn active customer accounts and 1.9bn transactions. Management considered the quarter as ""one of its strongest quarters since becoming an independent company... as the world rapidly accelerates to digital payments, [PayPal has a] tremendous opportunity...""PayPal also continued to hit on all cylinders when it came to payment volume: total payment volume grew 30.5% from Q3 2016, with mobile volume growth up 54% sequentially. Venmo, PayPal's P2P app that is popular among the younger generation, grew 93% YoY, down slightly from Q2's 103% growth. Growth in net new active Venmo accounts was also the strongest ever.Interestingly, PayPal once again increased guidance during the report for all of 2017 to come in at $12.92-12.98bn in revenue, with non-GAAP EPS to be $1.87. After each report in calendar 2017, in fact, PayPal increased guidance, indicating either surprisingly good results each time or the tendency of management to lowball estimates. In any event, we expect PayPal to come in at the top end of its revenue range, given Q416's exceptional results and the increased guidance we received after the last report.The Estimize community is also bullish on PayPal's earnings prospects. The crowd-sourced earnings estimate platform pools followers' estimates and often comes very close to matching actual results.First, let's begin with revenue projections. The Estimize consensus is for $3.64bn in revenue, ahead of the Wall St. consensus of 3.62bn in revenue and, of course, ahead of the median of PayPal's guidance of $3.57-3. 63bn.As is often the case, the Estimize community's collective revenue estimates are nearly always more bullish than Wall Street analysts. Interestingly, since Q4'15, the Estimize revenue estimates have come in closer to the actual results than Wall St. analyst consensus.As for EPS, Wall St. expects $0.52 and PayPal guided for $0.50-0.52; Estimize consensus is calling for $0.53, again ahead of both benchmarks.Estimize contributors have had a slightly tougher time outperforming Wall St. on EPS estimates, as these numbers indicate. Given the tight range of the company's guidance and Wall St. consensus, we consider $0.52 EPS likely a safe bet barring some unforeseen expenses. This indicates roughly 30% growth YoY, something investors should find reassuring - this would be an increase of the growth rate we saw in Q4'16 of only 17% growth.PayPal has seen bullish momentum for the better part of the last 12 months. In February 2017, PayPal's stock chart indicated a ""bullish crossover"" - a bullish signal that demonstrates positive momentum. The 50-day simple moving average moved above the 100-day SMA in a bullish crossover, when the stock was roughly $40/share. It has nearly doubled ever since, and the SMAs continue to indicate positive momentum for the stock.We have no reason to doubt PayPal's stock performance will continue given a solid forthcoming earnings report. The bullish momentum remains intact, and we encourage investors to stay vigilant of these trend lines as they add to or begin their positions.In some ways, cryptocurrency and PayPal have shared goals. In essence, they both seek to make payment processing fast, easy, and low cost. They both seek to eliminate barriers to transactions. PayPal's CEO Dan Schulman offered mixed praise for the blockchain technology, and some words investors should take note of:On blockchain more generally, however (and a place where PayPal could begin to experiment), Schulman offered that the blockchain technology is a ""real breakthrough"" even as blockchain isn't being viewed as a competitor for the company.PayPal's former COO recently commented:Importantly, cryptocurrencies seek to allow transactions from anywhere in the world, whereas processors like PayPal are still not available in many countries. How PayPal embraces and/or competes with the transformational aspects of cryptocurrency certainly bear importance for the company. The company is a leader in the digital currency space, as the longer term trends from offline to online payments bode well for PayPal generally. The stock also has the ability to benefit from positive coverage on digital currencies as it can be viewed as a ""safer"" bet to participate in the space. Cryptocurrencies must also be viewed as a potential risk, as customers could opt for crypto's transaction systems rather than reach for PayPal's products. We hope analysts confront PayPal management with questions about how they are addressing the crypto phenomenon, how it is a competitor, if at all, and what PayPal intends to do to capitalize on the increased interest. If, as CEO Schulman suggested, the blockchain is a technology that will enable PayPal to innovate on top of it, the company can definitely capitalize. We expect this report to have the most information to date on the craze.PayPal seems poised for another stellar quarter, a guidance raise, and to benefit from the wider adoption of services like Venmo and digital transactions generally. The positive momentum since February 2017 indicates the stock has more room to run, and we believe a strong earnings report and 2018 guidance will reinforce this idea. Finally, as cryptocurrencies have become the talk of the town, we see PayPal as a solid contender in the space to compete for the growing share of digital transactions."
4135412,22227,2018-01-04T16:35:27-05:00,Digital Payment stocks like PayPal increasingly popular with Millennials.Parts of Europe have almost completely removed cash from circulation.Marijuana stocks would be hard hit with the move to digital payments.,"When I lived as a student in West Berlin during the 1960’s, I had a nice little side business.I organized weekend walking tours through the Berlin Wall at Checkpoint Charlie to visit East Berlin for American students too afraid to go alone.To pay for it, I smuggled US dollars my customers paid me in my boots, which I used to buy Ostmarks in the East at a 75% discount to the official price. I then covered lunch and all my other bills, booking a nice profit onthe day.That would be much more difficult to pull off today, as governments around the world have launched a war on cash that will not end until its ultimate demise.The truth is, governments hate cash.This became clearly apparent when the government of India withdrew circulation of its two largest banknotes. Some 50% of Indian GDP is thought to take place in the underground economy in cash only.The move caused a financial panic, as consumers sold gold (GLD) and other hard assets to meet bills because they were unable to settle accounts with the large denomination notes they had hoarded.As we move towards an all-electronic economy, the few remaining purposes where cash is essential are largely illegal.Waitresses, babysitters, and bookies don’t report income to the IRS. Nor do drug dealers.This is a big deal because eight states legalized marijuana in the last election.Since banks are still banned from handling pot proceeds, this booming business has to take place entirely in cash. Tales about of dealers making their runs with shopping bags full of $100 bills are rampant.The IRS estimates that $460 billion in tax revenue is lost every year through unreported income, which is largely earned in cash.Some half of the entire US paper money supply is held by foreigners, where it is used to evade taxes, bribe foreign officials, and finance terrorism.The US government’s war on cash is not a new thing. In 1929, it cut the size of US banknotes by one third to save money on the cost of high-grade paper.In 1970 the US Treasury banned the circulation of the $10,000, $5,000, $1,000, and $500 bills to halt mafia money laundering. Since then, the IRS has been the biggest beneficiary of the move.Large denominations US bills are now solely the domain of collectors.The US government would love to get out of the cash business, as it is so expensive to run. It spends about $737.4 million a year just to print American $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 notes.Paper dollar bills, which are actually made of 75% cotton and 25% linen, are completely worn out and have to be returned in only 18 months.Coins are even a bigger loser. It costs more than two cents to make a penny.Since the advent of color printers, counterfeiting has exploded. North Korea runs almost its entire economy on fake $100 bills, which are said to be the best in the world.Today, some 80% of the entire $1.34 trillion M1 notes and coins in circulation in America are in the form of $100 dollar bills. That works out to $4,200 per person. Where has all that money gone?The US is now considering eliminating even this convenient denomination. While $1 million in $100’s can fit into a tote bag, that quantity of $10 bills would weigh 220 pounds, a quantity much more difficult to sneak around.An all-electronic economy would certainly pose some privacy problems, as it would leave a massive paper trail on everything you do.When you get audited by the IRS, the first thing they do it obtain your past three years of bank and credit card records detailing your every transaction.State authorities will pursue phone records to establish your physical presence to verify residency. So how long did you really spend in tax-free Florida last year?It would also pare back illegal immigration, as this is another industry that runs entirely on cash. Once here, undocumented workers are often paid in cash in restaurants and on construction sites. There is Truly No Place to HideOther countries are already well ahead in the war of cash. In Belgium, some 93% of all financial transactions take place electronically.Sweden has also been pushing hard on this front, taking the M1 moneysupply there down by 27% over the past two years.Many small businesses there now post signs saying they don’t accept cash. The goal is to move to an all-electronic economy.The preferences of Millennials are also moving us towards the cashless economy.This trend manifests itself with online payment systems like Paypal (PYPL) whose stock has been the recipient of torrid strength and will clearly outperform as digital payment systems become more mainstream.Have you every been in line at Starbucks and noticed that the kid in front of you just paid $2 for a cup of coffee with his credit card? Or maybe he swiped his Apple Pay account on his iPhone?Whatever the means, it is clear that hard cash is about to become a dinosaur."

Such a rise represents rather slim pickings in terms of a return from an investment in the $89bn market-cap firm; however, there is an argument to be made that PayPal's share price growth is not over yet.Outperforming EPS Estimates. PayPal EPS + Forecasts Q4 '16 - Q1 '18. Source: WSJPayPal is in excellent financial health. The company's most recent October earnings call showed that Q3 revenues of $3.24bn were up 22%, whilst EPS climbed 31% year over year. The firm's free cash flow was extremely healthy, and up 36%, and payment volumes topped $114bn (+29%). Active account gain stood at 8.2m monthly active users (MAU), an increase of 88% year over year, and 3% overall. The number of transactions each individual user performed also jumped, by 9% year over year, to 32.8 transactions.Overall, the California-based company has seen total payment volume rise steadily quarter by quarter over the past two years. Promisingly this figure is backed strongly by mobile growth (+54%), and peer to peer growth (+21%), inclusive of the rising Venmo platform, and Venmo itself saw the volume of transactions made on the platform climb by 93% to a total of $9.4bn in Q3.Climbing Payment Volumes '16-'17. Source: Seeking Alpha/PayPal Comparing each quarter on a year-over-year basis, PayPal's operating income has risen steadily. Q3, for instance, saw 32% growth in the firm's non-GAAP operating income. PayPal's asset base of $7bn demonstrates the company's prudence and fitness, and its engagement in targeted M&A activity shows that the firm is not content to rest on its laurels, with TIO Networks and Swift Financial the most recent acquisitions.Forward guidance for the full year 2017 is positive, with growth expected to average 20%, and EPS to come in at $1.88 (+63%). Bolstering the positive angle further, revenue guidance has been raised by $105m. Furthermore, PayPal's outlook for 2018 targets revenue and transaction growth again in the 20% range.Solid Financials - PayPal Annual Net Income – 5 Years. Source: WSJThe outlook is bullish. PayPal has little to no debt, and its five-year EPS figures have increased by a yearly average of 43.5%, although admittedly, this figure is massaged by the significant recovery from an EPS fall to $0.34 three years ago, to $1.00 two years ago. The payments firm has posted an earnings surprise in three of the past four quarters, with the average level of surprise being 6.11%. Profit margins are consistent over the past three years at an average of just over 10%, and the fact that revenue growth continues to outpace earnings growth suggests that a long-term earnings rise remains on the cards. With such strong financial data, the firm's 55.94 P/E Ratio [TTM] might seem cheap in the long run.Still Climbing. PayPal Quarterly Net Income. Source: WSJPayPal Performance Outstrips Broader Internet Software Market. Source: Yahoo A large number of analysts, given recent price targets, seem to think that PayPal is set to go through a period of consolidation in share price terms, but there is a counter-argument. Such an argument is built upon several considerations that appear to stand PayPal in good stead.Firstly, the digital payment space is growing rapidly at a CAGR of 33.4% and is predicted to rise above $3tn in value by 2022. In this space, PayPal has two significant advantages. One is its currently strong market position, whilst the second is the fact that the company's long e-commerce history, for instance, its early adoption by Amazon (AMZN), means that PayPal has a large body of long-term users who are comfortable with the platform, happy to continue using it, and in no real hurry to change their habits.Given the rule of preferential attachment that governs all networks, whereby areas of already strong connection will receive more new connections than areas of weak connection, PayPal's status as an incumbent will certainly attract new users as the market grows.PayPal's Customer-base Continues to Follow an Upward Trajectory. Source: Seeking Alpha/PayPal Secondly, to borrow video game parlance, the millennial demographic is slowly levelling up in terms of its wealth and assets. Their investments are beginning to yield a harvest, and thus the millennial market is becoming more powerful. This is, of course, boosted by their rising access to inherited funds. Furthermore, alongside their technological know-how, what is often said to characterise millennial consumers and investors is simplicity and caution in their financial dealings.PayPal, already reputable and established, yet also efficient and tech-driven, fits the bill as a service suited to this millennial market. Streamlined services with a high-level of mobile access and the ability to access all your accounts in one digital wallet is very much what the millennial market wants.Stephens Analyst Brett Huff highlights the appeal of PayPal. Source: Barron's Thirdly, PayPal is pursuing a growth strategy in emerging markets, which, in terms of the online payments market, are expected to grow strongly. One example of this is the growth predicted by BNY Mellon in remittances sent from the “Global West” to the “Global South.” Such remittances alone are likely to grow at a rate of 8.6% per year. An example of PayPal's expansion into emerging markets can be found in India, where the firm has launched its own domestic operation in order to capture the booming merchant market.To these ends, PayPal has also partnered with both the Indian government and state-owned banks. Should the firm succeed, trade body GSMA and the Boston Consulting Group suggest that PayPal stands a strong chance of profiting from an Indian digital payments market expected to reach $500bn in value over the next few years, with non-cash payments anticipated to make up 40% of total consumer payments.Sign them Up! - PayPal's 2-Year Partnership Splurge. Source: Seeking Alpha/PayPal What is also worth considering, as well as the company's great financials and its climbing profits, is PayPal's rapid acquisition of partnerships. Moreover, M&A rumours persist about an imminent European purchase, and the Venmo platform seemingly goes from strength to strength.Regarding partnerships, since 2016, PayPal has signed a veritable litany of new partnerships with companies including Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD), Visa (V), Facebook (FB), MasterCard (MA), Citi (C), Discover (DFS), Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC). These partnerships vastly increase PayPal's ability to offer its customers a real digital wallet and boost the firm's exposure.Of M&A rumours, alongside suggestions of European expansion, Square (NYSE:SQ) the well-regarded mobile payments, services, and aggregation firm is also mooted to be in PayPal's M&A line of fire.Wallet Growth Suggests Opportunity. Global Mobile Wallet Market Revenue Growth '16-'22. Source: Zion Research. Of Venmo, with mobile accounts now making up over a third of PayPal's total volume (+54% year over year), the peer to peer service that allows individuals to wire money directly to each other through their mobile phone instantaneously is showing remarkable growth. In the last 12 months, over $30bn has moved on to the platform, up 106% year over year. In addition to this, in the most recent quarter, the value of transactions made on the platform climbed by 93% to $9bn.Ultimately, although Venmo has yet to be revenue positive for PayPal, this is likely to change after October's launch of Pay with Venmo. At this point in time, more than 2 million merchants have already signed on with the service. This means that whilst Venmo is a free peer-to-peer service for PayPal customers, merchants will provide the platform, and PayPal, with revenue.PayPal Long on the Up - 5-Year Share Price. Source: BloombergThe more people that use your service, the more money you make. This is simple logic and a principle that PayPal appears to be bearing in mind given their surging user numbers. The company is in rude health, and plenty of growth opportunities are actively being pursued. Given all of this, it is fair to suggest that predictions of just 2% share price growth for PayPal are somewhat conservative. A long position may well stand to yield far greater returns."
4132450,92456,2017-12-18T07:00:50-05:00,"In the next two years, PayPal's revenue growth rate is not likely to fall below 20%.Despite this prediction, the DCF-modeling does not justify the current share price.The reason is the Beta coefficient, which is too high.","My DCF-modeling indicates that PayPal’s shares (NASDAQ:PYPL) are overvalued due to increased risk of volatility reflected by the Beta coefficient.On May 16, when PayPal’s share price exceeded $50, I published a DCF valuation of the company with a favorable forecast. Today, PayPal’s shares are trading at $74 (+85% since the beginning of the year) and I think it's time to update this DCF model.The last two quarters confirmed the acceleration of the company's growth.Firstly, it is confirmed by the dynamics of active customer accounts. Before Q2, the trend pointed towards 239 million active PayPal accounts by the end of 2018. However, considering the past two quarters, the trend now points towards 250 million active accounts by the end of 2018.Secondly, total payment volume also indicated acceleration, increasing by the record 30.5% YOY in the last quarter.The whole market PayPal is operating in is affected by the network effect, and yet, the critical mass of users is not reached. The demand for services provided by PayPal increases with every new active account. Against this background, I expect PayPal’s revenue growth will continue to accelerate at least until 2018, and the CAGR will amount to 18.25% in the next 10 years.It is worth noting that my forecast of PayPal's revenue in the horizon of the next year is generally consistent with the average expectations of the analysts:It is quite simple to calculate PayPal’s WACC because the company has no debt. However, there’s some ambiguity with the Beta coefficient. If we calculate PayPal’s Beta coefficient throughout its entire history on the stock exchange, it will amount to 0.767.But, consider this factor in dynamics, we see that it has now reached its historic highs at the level of 1,4:A high Beta coefficient indicates a stock’s high volatility. This usually occurs in cases when an increased, short-term speculative interest is manifested towards a company. I’ve done further calculations with Beta equaling 1.4, but at the end, I’ll show you how the result would change with other indicators. So, here is my WACC calculationBuilding the DCF model I used the following assumptions:Here's the model itself:As you can see the result is not satisfactory: the reduction potential is 38%.The result of the DCF-valuation is sensitive to the WACC, which in turn is sensitive to the Beta coefficient. The following table shows how the Beta coefficient affects the result of the DCF-valuation:As you can see, when I use the Beta coefficient of May 2017 in my DCF model, the fair share price almost exactly matches the current share price on the stock exchange. PayPal’s share price reflects the excellent results of the company. At the same time, the risk of volatility of PayPal’s shares is now higher than ever, and because of this risk, the DCF-valuation indicates the negative change potential in the company’s share price. It means that the purchase of PayPal’s shares at the current price is a very risky short-term investment."
4134493,103281,2017-12-29T17:19:09-05:00,"Recent drop a sign of profit taking, nothing more.Balance sheet improving.Growth areas are still underestimated by market.","This December saw the first 10% drop in PayPal's (NASDAQ: PYPL) stock in the last year or so. But is this a dip to be bought or are there more serious issues threatening the company's growth?A cyclical exit from tech companies, the company's stock price climbing too high too fast and even Bitcoin's potential to take over the world have been mentioned as reasons. Can these factors stop the company and cause a real correction or is it just some profit taking by investors who rely on P/E (which is indeed high) and are quite happy with an 80% jump in the last year?The short answer is no.There are simply no signs of slowing growth, quite the opposite. The latest management moves and the overall environment are not only favorable but actually improving for the company and its future guidance seems conservative to me. Here's why.Last month saw the company solve one of the issues that had caused concern among investors - its PayPal Credit unit. That unit has so far been a source of growth and is part of the larger puzzle that PayPal aims to become - a payment company that can not only handle every type of transaction that you'd want but also a one-stop shop for anything money related.But there was a caveat: PayPal Credit is susceptible to downturns in the economy and any unreasonable exposure could turn into something between a nuisance and a disaster. The board was well aware of this and engineered a deal with Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF) worth $6.8 billion, with the latter acquiring the U.S. receivables portfolio together with a profit-sharing agreement. Not as sexy as monetizing Venmo (we'll get to them in a minute) or riding the huge mobile payments wave, but it's a great old-fashioned corporate deal that ticks the boxes on what needed to be done. It not only limits risk but also frees up capital (to the tune of $1 billion annually) that can serve other purposes.One of these other purposes is partnerships and expanding the network of merchants and companies that utilize PayPal. Two of the most recent ones also are targeting what I think is the most important metric - transactions per account (which stand at 32.3 per year as of Q2 in 2017).The millennial investment app Acorns now allows users to use PayPal to transfer money both ways, as well as monitoring their portfolio and tracking their investments through PayPal. A partnership with a European ""deposit marketplace"" called Raisin also was announced and although both will not have an immediate effect on the bottom line, they are aimed at getting more of the bread and butter transactions that the company will rely on - set-and-forget payments or transactions completed with several taps in a single app.Talking of single apps and ease of use, PayPal's One Touch has allowed the company to tap in the shift to mobile payments that we see across society. As of November 8th, six million merchants utilize it (around a third of the total) and 70 of the total 218 million active accounts have registered with it.Mobile payment volume was $40 billion in Q3, over 50% growth on a yearly basis with mobile payments making just over one-third of the total payment volume. The course is set and the means to take more of the projected share are in place.Source: StatistaAbout Venmo. I don't think it's the game changer that many in the PayPal investment community think it is. It's growing for sure but for me it is yet unproven and is the one point where Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Pay (OTC:SSNLF) and potentially Square (NYSE: SQ) can actually land a punch. $9.4 billion in transaction volume last quarter and making it available in around two million U.S. retailers are signs of a growing business, but whether it will be used for retail purchases by its user base remains to be seen. I could be surprised on the upside in the coming 3-6 quarters. But as long as the company isn't revealing the number of its users I won't be holding my breath and including this in the factors that can contribute to sustained growth.Another partnership announced recently requires far more attention than it's getting. Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) announced recently that they will offer PayPal as an option to its users and this could be the gateway for the payment provider to establish a beachhead in a market that's already focused on mobile payments.Right now it seems like nothing more than said beachhead, as Baidu has a very small percentage of mobile transaction volume compared to its competition. But if PayPal is truly a superior product and if it allows Chinese consumers to buy imports more easily (which they have been doing - $60 billion in e-commerce payments for 2016) it should carve out a solid enough niche to create a steady and sizeable income stream within several years.Not that all these developments are unnoticed by investors, or are unaccounted for in the company's projections. But it looks as if they're being understated due to caution and trying not to overreach. Conclusion: A 21% increase in earnings and 20% for revenue is a solid enough forecast but I think we'll see that these will be lower than what we actually get. User growth has been in the mid-teens and will probably remain thereabouts. But it is merchant growth where I think the network effect will surpass expectations in 2018 and directly impact the bottom line and the stock price. With these in mind I am placing my target for next year at $96.Source: TradingviewRisks do remain - a fumble of the Venmo play could hamper the company's whole mobile payments concept and a security breach is always a possibility in today's environment. But at this point in time there are no indicators that there is a confirmed threat to the optimism surrounding the company or its sector."
4127813,91195,2017-11-27T10:25:11-05:00,"PayPal's buyer protection was subject to a German court order.The court decided that German sellers can sue buyers, despite PayPal's buyer protection.Probably, this won't affect business in Germany.","On the 22nd November, PayPal's stock (PYPL) was 1.03% down after a German court order against the company. As always, the big question is: What does the court ruling mean for the firm's business? Subject of the court order was PayPal's buyer protection, which enables customers to reclaim the money for a product which differs from the description or which never arrived. A seller filed a suit after a customer used the purchase protection and reclaimed the money for a smartphone which allegedly never arrived. According to the purchase agreement, the package was uninsured. After the seller couldn't give evidence for the delivery, PayPal transferred the money back to the customer. Now, the court order enables sellers to take legal action against buyers, despite PayPal's buyer protection. With regard to the case mentioned above, this means that the customer is not entitled to get the money back (as he is liable for the uninsured delivery, as agreed in the purchase agreement). I would say: Almost nothing. Let me explain why.First of all, the court order only applies for Germany. 35,3% of PayPal's net revenues come from other countries than the United States and UK. Thereof, Germany is only a small fraction.For sellers, the court order is good news, since it provides legal protection against scammers. The ruling may even encourage traditionally rather cautious German businesses to enable payments via PayPal. Most of the customers won't be affected by PayPal's court order, as buyer protection cases are quite rare. Even if a buyer protection case arises, PayPal usually helps to mediate and to find a solution.For the seldom case that a seller is really upset with the outcome of the buyer protection, he still has to file a suit which is rather unlikely due to high expenses. I personally use PayPal as a seller (for an ecommerce business) and as a buyer - and I am completely convinced of the company's services. As a buyer, it is way easier than other payment providers. I also appreciate the buyer protection - even after the court order. Also for 34% of German citizens, PayPal is the most popular ecommerce payment provider. For my own ecommerce shop, I offer bank transfer, Stripe and PayPal as payment methods. The integration of PayPal noticeably increased our revenues. Our numbers also correspond to the survey mentioned above: around 30% of our payments are processed via PayPal. Summing it up, the court order may change some sentences in PayPal's terms and conditions for Germany, but I don't expect serious effects on the company's business."
4128591,102603,2017-11-29T16:54:21-05:00,"PayPal is officially shedding the consumer lending business, striking a deal with Synchrony.It’s now going ""all in"" on the digital payments landscape.This includes capitalizing on its digital wallet advantage and bringing PayPal to the retail scene.","PayPal (PYPL) is playing in the big leagues now. The company, despite appearing ‘expensive’ has plenty of growth opportunities to support its rich valuation. This comes as it continues to grow its digital wallet presence (hopefully taking share from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay), and PayPal is now taking on the physical retail scene with Venmo. Despite the soaring stock price, up 99% in 2017, there’s still room for the stock to run.PayPal is a $95 billion market cap company and is larger than the likes of American Express (AXP) and Capital One (COF). As mentioned, it trades at a handsome premium to those peers, at 34 times next year’s earnings.While many think of Square (SQ) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) Wallet as major PayPal peers, PayPal is competing more with the likes of major banks. But PayPal is already doing digital and mobile banking better than conventional banks.PayPal has made it easy to transfer money online. The major banks have an answer - they’ve launched Zelle, but it hasn’t proved to be a major PayPal threat. Zelle allows users of major banks like Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC) to transfer money instantly regardless of whether they’re banking with different institutions. Part of the allure of Zelle, versus PayPal, is that the transfer is instant. But PayPal is working on instant transfers by strengthening its partnership with Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), hoping to make instant transfers available in the near term. First, forget the eBay (EBAY) worry. PayPal is relying less and less on eBay, now accounting for less than 15% of its total payment volume. The partnership with eBay will end in 2020, and by then, it’ll be an even smaller part of the business. This comes as PayPal is growing its presence with major retailers.PayPal adds a way for retailers to set themselves apart. PayPal needs to position itself as a service provider and not a competitor to credit cards. PayPal can break into the digital wallet market in a big way, offering a one-stop shop for conventionally paying for anything (physically or in stores) and transferring money. This includes positioning PayPal as a premier service for paying bills and buying groceries.PayPal is making moves with ""moving money."" With its other payment service, Venmo, PayPal is taking the peer-to-peer scheme by storm. PayPal has positioned itself as one of the leaders in the fast-growing mobile money market. Mobile now accounts for about a third of PayPal’s total volume. And it’s growing faster than any other part of PayPal’s business.The volume in PayPal’s mobile business grew 50% year over year last quarter. Venmo could be an underrated boost for PayPal’s earnings and really help set the company up for breaching that physical store barrier. Using Venmo in-store will allow shoppers the ability to skip lines and help facilitate the use of digital wallets and not use cards or cash. The idea is that PayPal could be the underrated winner in digital wallets, and do for digital wallets what Apple Pay promised to do.But one of the big risks that PayPal is taking today is that it’s betting on retail. It’s betting that it can excite shoppers by allowing them to use Venmo. But it’s also convincing online shoppers to spend more, creating value for retailers as it lowers abandoned cart rates and makes paying seamless with One Touch. As part of its commitment toward digital payments, PayPal has worked out a deal with the private label credit card issuer, Synchrony Financial (SYF), to rid itself of its consumer lending business (a $6 billion loan portfolio). This will free up resources and rid itself of a business that accounts for less than 10% of revenue. It’ll also bring in some cash for PayPal to use on buybacks. As well, an underrated opportunity for PayPal is its Braintree business, which gives it an underrated and powerful network for merchants. Braintree allows merchants the ability to take control of their own payment process.On the surface, PayPal appears a bit expensive. But it’s growing faster than any of the other major digital and mobile payment players. Trading at nearly $80 a share, its EV/EBITDA multiple is at 35x, the highest since it spun-off from eBay in 2015. But it has no debt, over 5% of its market cap covered by cash on the balance sheet, and it’s expected to grow earnings by nearly 20% annually for the next half-decade. This comes as mobile and digital transactions will likely double by 2020, and PayPal could be a big benefactor.With that, PayPal’s 30x EV-to-free cash flow isn’t all that ""rich."" MasterCard trades at 37x and Visa at 32x. PayPal can also grow earnings a bit more than expected as operating margins improve on the back of lower ACH processing costs. PayPal saw total payment volume up 30% last quarter, the best since its spinoff. Penetration is on the rise as well, with PayPal accepted at 75 of the top 100 U.S. retailers.The biggest risk for PayPal is the rising competition in payment processing. Or, there’s the potential that growth in payment volume doesn’t live up to expectations. But the reward still outweighs the risks at PayPal.In the end, PayPal is working well on creating a frictionless payment system. And the fact that PayPal already has a leg up given its infrastructure and user base helps justify its premium valuation. Its valuation becomes less of a concern when you take into account its earnings growth and strong balance sheet, plus there’s the recent cash infusion from the Synchrony transaction. And despite the worries about competition, PayPal remains the leader in the digital wallet race.Unlike the major competitors, PayPal allows users to both send and receive money (pay or be paid). Investors should keep an eye on payment volume and make sure a new competitor doesn’t start materially taking market share. Other than that, PayPal’s growth should be on autopilot as we continue to see a shift to online payments.Author's note: To get these types of articles and Instablogs on attractive biotech and pharma stocks as soon as they are published, just click here for my profile.

4133861,103511,2017-12-26T05:28:57-05:00,"Digital transactions volume is expected to continue to increase dramatically over the next few years, with the big question being who will capture the growth.While cryptocurrency has been long touted as a replacement to PayPal, recent events have shown such predictions may have been too soon.Bitcoin's recent price history has shown it faces extreme volatility, increasing transaction costs, and transaction delays, all of which weaken its prospects as a mainstream payment service.PayPal has shown continuing strong growth and guidance on all metrics, from volume to users to earnings.Despite the company's recent run and rich valuation, significant future growth prospects means the stock price may still have room to go higher.","Despite cryptocurrency's boom these past two years, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has continued to show strong growth in transactions volume, partnerships, and profit, indicating an ability to grow alongside cryptocurrencies as online payments sector continues to boom exponentially. Furthermore, while cryptocurrency is a big challenge to PayPal on many fronts, the company still retains a strong moat as users and institutions look for a relatively secure and non-volatile online payments system.Even with PayPal's meteoric rise the past year, I believe there still is room for growth. Its recent performance and guidance show it is well placed to continue to capture growth as digital transactions volume, and in particular mobile transactions volume, are expected to increase dramatically in the upcoming few years. I recently saw several charts that were particularly fascinating and compared various transactions metrics for various cryptocurrencies as compared to payment services such as PayPal, Visa (NYSE:V), and others.This is all amid continuing gloom and doom that PayPal's time finally is ending as cryptocurrency fulfills PayPal's original goal of becoming a nimble and versatile online funds mechanism free from centralized control. While undoubtedly cryptocurrency transactions volume is now comparable and even well above many traditional legacy payment services, we are rapidly seeing that the nature of cryptocurrency's network-based processing has now resulted in steadily rising transaction costs.Here we have begun to see some of the limits of how cryptocurrency can challenge payment services such as PayPal, while still certainly providing them competition. The increased transactions fee is only one factor in cryptocurrency that is beginning to unravel and show the limits of its proposed challenge to PayPal, Visa, MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and other online payment services.The recent volatility in Bitcoin has shown that it can be very unstable as a mechanism for online payments and transactions. While many businesses with multinational interaction necessarily face currency risk, and hedge to do so, the volatility Bitcoin has seen over not only this past year but even this past week makes hedging through derivative contracts an extraordinary task.(Figure: Bitcoin Price 2017, Source: Bitcoin.com)As shown, Bitcoin's price volatility within the past week has been an extraordinary almost 40% price range from high in just December 2017 and over 90% YTD.(Figure: Bitcoin Price December 2017, Source: Bitcoin.com)This is not to even speak of retail customers, the bulk of whom would be unable to withstand the immense volatility as a stable online funds wallet and transactions mechanism.Looking at this from the lens of traditional currency risk management and trading, it indicates that cryptocurrency is simply too volatile to be a mainstream stable store of value at the moment for both the public and businesses.We would laugh if someone were to invest in a currency ravaged by hyper-inflation as a potential mainstream currency, such as the Venezuelan bolivar the past few years.The Venezuelan bolivar has also had a price volatility range of almost 90% the past year, yet you will see few people pouring demand into it.Volatility and transaction fees aside, we've also begun to see several other problems emerge in cryptocurrency as of late given the recent volatility:All of this has put into serious question cryptocurrency's big selling point of being an instant and free-flowing transaction and faster than other payment mechanisms.While cryptocurrency may eventually stabilize due to a combination of market forces and regulatory intervention, it seems for the moment cryptocurrency has been unable to challenge PayPal in terms of being a real online payments mechanism for both the commercial and retail financial services sector.So to recap, the three big reasons Bitcoin's recent swings have weakened its case against payment service providers like PayPal are:However, what about PayPal itself? What are the prospects for the company's continued growth amid cryptocurrencies' increasingly unstable footing?PayPal itself has been on a roar the past year, about doubling in price and now sits at an extraordinary almost $90 billion market capitalization, nearly double that of its original parent eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which sits still at around $40 billion.PYPL data by YChartsThis has been amid very strong metrics on nearly every front, ranging from steadily increasing transactions volume, active customers, new accounts, transactions per customer, and other key analytics that show a thriving and rapidly growing business base.(Source: PayPal Q3 Earnings)(Source: PayPal Q3 Earnings)All of this has led to steadily increasing earnings per share (including accelerating YOY growth rates) and free cash flow, showing PayPal is performing strong on all cylinders.(Source: PayPal Q3 Earnings)(Source: PayPal Q3 Earnings)Amid strong guidance for the upcoming year, the big question is whether the company's strong growth the past year as well as expected future growth justify the massive growth it has seen this past year in valuation.After all, PayPal now sits at a relatively rich P/E of 57, which is significantly higher than it has been at the past few years and is now well above that of other payment service providers.PYPL PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsLet's look at what PayPal's past P/E ratios might mean for its stock price given its current TTM EPS of $1.28 per share:Clearly, the increased P/E can only be justified if the company's expected future growth has been dramatically upgraded.PayPal's guidance for Q4 2017 is optimistic, but not dramatically so.(Source: PayPal Q3 Earnings)Its 2018 guidance on the other hand, does show signs of continuing strong growth, which is very positive given the already large size of PayPal's business.(Source: PayPal Q3 Earnings)If PayPal is really able to achieve 20% growth in 2018, it shows that the current rich P/E may be justified, as the online payments market is expected to continue to grow rapidly over the next few years, with an over 40% increase in overall digital transactions volume and a 400% growth in mobile payments by 2022.(Figure: Digital Payments - Transactions Volume Growth, Source: Statista)(Figure: Average Transaction Volume Per User Growth, Source: Statista)(Source: Statista)I believe PayPal's rich P/E may be justified by the company showing that it is well placed to continue capturing this massive growth, particularly in regard to mobile payments.While cryptocurrency is here to stay and its future place in the online financial services world still has a lot of uncertainty, particularly in regard to what shape regulation will morph it into, nonetheless PayPal has shown it is also surviving and growing too.With cryptocurrency's recently volatility and transactions problems showing the limits of how it can replace PayPal, the company has also demonstrated positive growth and guidance that means it's likely to continue to capture growth as the digital transactions market grows over the next few years."

Some call them FANG, others such as myself FANGAM, but it's fair to say that Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and, to a lesser extent, Netflix (NFLX) have been and continue to be extremely disruptive in just about every part of the economy. As you can imagine, the financial sector is one of the most lucrative sectors and has been a clear target of FANGAM. However, up until now, they have had modest success. Part of the reason is that they've stayed away from more regulated industries such as banking and insurance but it is also an extremely competitive sector mostly dominated by high profile banks.Paypal (PYPL) is one player that has managed to do extremely well in part because it was there very early. Key acquisitions, such as Venmo and Braintree, have helped Paypal dominate online payments.credit: Why Stripe can emerge as the Market Leader in Payment Gateways?Paypal has also been dominant in P2P transfers and most of its competition had come from Venmo. However, Venmo was acquired by Paypal as part of the Braintree acquisition in 2013.The Assault Is About To Enter A New PhaseWhile Apple's ""Apple Pay"" and Google's ""Android Pay"" have seen some success in offline transactions, it does feel like things are about to become much more tricky for Paypal. First off, on Tuesday, Apple launched a beta version of Apple Pay Cash (How Tos on MacRumors which, if it is setup using a debit or Apple Pay Cash card, has no charge. On the same day, Facebook's Messenger launched P2P payments for France and the UK. It's easy to imagine that Google is not far behind. How serious is this threat? It's very serious for these reasons:-Apple, Google and Facebook have the ability and scale to offer this around the world quickly if things go well-They see P2P payments as a feature and do not need to make money out of it-Customers spend the vast majority of their time on mobile devices using services from Apple, Google and Facebook making it much more convenient to send money directly through that application. If a friend tells you about an item they purchased through Messenger, why not press a button and pay them instead of going to a separate application such as Paypal, especially when Paypal is more expensive.-Amazon, which has hundreds of millions of customers, has been testing P2P payments as well and has also been expanding its offering as a payment platform between consumers and businesses through Amazon Pay.The challenges in succeeding against the big tech platforms are very difficult to move past. Competition from these tech players will clearly mean less market share but also pressure on margins. There is one company that has been able to do well across these platforms.Following The Netflix Path?Very few companies have succeeded where Netflix has. It built a business that directly competes with the likes of Amazon, Apple, and Google but has succeeded in getting tens of millions of the consumers of those platforms to sign up as members. I think it's interesting to see how Netflix was able to survive the attacks by the likes of Apple's iTunes, Google's Play store, and Amazon's media offerings despite being at a heavy disadvantage by not owning the platform. How have they done it?-Being Everywhere: One key part of Netflix's strategy early on was being everywhere. They struck deals to be on DVD players and smart tv's, and hey also accepted the less favorable conditions (paying a cut to Apple for example) in the different app stores-Moving Fast: Netflix has moved incredibly fast in striking deals for content, producing its own content, marketing it, and executing better than those big players could ever do. You can now see that those players are now working on copying Netflix's strategy for international expansion, original content, etc. The increased speed by Netflix has been key in holding its spot. Once Netflix got to a certain size, it became difficult, perhaps even impossible, to kick it out of those platforms.-Remain Focused: As much as some players looked to Netflix to expand its services, it has remained incredibly focused on its strategy and staying away from things like news and sports for example.What Those Strategies Look Like For Paypal-Being Everywhere: Paypal has a critical advantage as it has a global presence, has integrations with much of the banking system, and has a very trendy P2P service (Venmo).-Execution is Accelerating: Paypal clearly knows what's coming and it has been increasing its speed by striking deals:Remain Focused: Paypal must also focus on retaining its existing partnerships. Ebay and Etsy, for example, do seem to represent an important part of Paypal's business and now that Ebay no longer owns Paypal, you could imagine them offering and even promoting alternative payment options.credit similarwebThat has led to what Paypal needs to focus on: increasing its number of users and the usage velocity:So far, the strategy does seem to be working and it is translating into accelerating growth in PYPL's top line which is exactly what the company needs to focus on right now.The online payments default is not set (unlike in China for example where Alipay stands alone) and Paypal does have a shot at being a very important player in the online payments space. Execution has been impressive in recent months and the company will need much more of it but it is leaving me cautiously optimistic."
4118082,21798,2017-10-30T11:47:12-04:00,"PayPal’s strong growth is expected to continue.PayPal continues to grow accounts, transactions, and payment volume.Investors will bid the stock up for this strong growth.","PayPal’s (PYPL) strong Q3 2017 results demonstrate that the company continues to sustain double-digit revenue and earnings growth. PayPal is achieving this though growth in the number of accounts, transactions, and payment volume. The stock is set to perform well in 2018 as earnings are expected to increase about 21% (consensus) as the company continues its growth. I think the stock will continue to perform well in 2018 based more on positive momentum with valuation being less of a factor. Paypal is growing the business in every category that counts. In Q3, net new active customers increased 88%, transactions increased 26%, and payment volume rose 30%. This strong double-digit growth is driving the stock to outperform the S&P 500. source: bigcharts.comPaypal’s stock was tracking the S&P 500 since trading as an independent stock from mid-2015. However, the stock began outperforming the S&P 500 in May 2017. The breakout in the stock occurred as investors realized that the company could sustain double-digit revenue and earnings growth. The continuation of this rate of growth is expected to continue in 2018. When I look ahead to 2018, I expect PayPal is to achieve its expected top and bottom line growth. The use of mobile payments is on the rise. Statista projects the global mobile payment market to grow at about 19% in 2018.source: statista.comPayPal has a convenient and secure solution for online payments that includes currency conversions from country to country. PayPal is an especially useful tool for online sellers as the service allows them to accept payments from their customers. It is also convenient for online buyers as they can safely make purchases with their PayPal accounts without worrying about sharing their bank or credit card information directly with numerous merchants. PayPal is likely to continue to benefit from the growth of internet users. Internet user growth is projected to increase 5.3% in 2018. The percent of the world’s population that are online is expected to increase from 49% to 51.1% next year. PayPal is set to benefit greatly from this growth as the countries of the world become more connected through ecommerce.Sites such as Alibaba (BABA) and AliExpress have many sellers in China that accept PayPal as payment. Buyers can make purchases from the United States and other countries using PayPal, which handles the payment transactions and currency conversions. I think it is the convenience, ease of use, and the sense of security for buyers and sellers that is allowing PayPal to grow at a strong pace. With internet users growing globally, PayPal will also continue to grow. The addition of Venmo through the Braintree acquisition is accelerating PayPal’s growth. Venmo is popular with the largest living generation, the Millennials. Venmo customers now have access to pay with the App at over 2 million PayPal merchants in the United States. PayPal continues to work to get more large merchants to use Venmo. These efforts are paying off as Venmo’s payments volume increased 93% to 9.4 billion in Q3 2017. So, 2018 looks bright for Venmo’s growth as PayPal continues to add large merchants for this service. Next year looks particularly bright for Venmo since it is expected to have a larger impact in 2018. PayPal is now charging some merchants that use Venmo. The service was initially offered for free to obtain large quantities of users. As PayPal gets more merchants to pay for using Venmo, the company is poised for more revenue growth going forward.  I think many investors miss the opportunity to buy a high growth momentum stock because they are turned off by what they perceive as an overvaluation. PayPal’s trailing PE of 58 and forward PE of 31.5 is above the S&P 500’s (NYSEARCA:SPY) trailing and forward PE ratios of 22 and 19.6 respectively. That will cause some investors to dismiss PayPal as an investment. However, it is PayPal’s strong above average double-digit revenue and earnings growth that justifies this valuation. For a high growth company like PayPal, the PEG ratio is a better valuation measure. If we look one year ahead, PayPal’s PEG of 1.5 (based on the forward PE of 31/expected EPS growth of 21) shows an attractive valuation for a high growth stock. PayPal’s peers in the payment’s space, Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA), are trading at similar levels with one-year PEG ratios of 1.4 (23/16) and 1.5 (28/19) respectively. Visa and MasterCard also have above average PE ratios along with above average earnings growth. Visa and MasterCard’s stocks have outperformed the S&P 500 over multiple years even with their above average PE ratios. The stocks were driven to outperform by their above average earnings growth. Therefore, I expect PayPal’s stock to outperform the S&P 500 at least through 2018 as the stock will be driven by its above average earnings growth.With the large Equifax (EFX) security breach in the news recently and with others in the recent past, I think consumers will want to limit the amount of companies/merchants that have their bank or credit card information. The use of PayPal allows consumers to share their payment info with one company while they shop with multiple merchants. I will point out one large risk for PayPal is the possibility that they will be hacked. If that happens, it could cause a significant slowdown in the growth of users and payments volume. That would also have a significant negative effect on the stock. My projections will assume that this doesn’t happen. Paypal’s expected revenue growth of 20% and earnings growth of 21% for 2018 will drive the stock to outperform the S&P 500, which is expected to grow earnings at half of PayPal’s growth rate. I expect PayPal’s stock to increase about 20% next year, approximately in-line with revenue and earnings growth. This gives the stock a price target of $85."
4115997,98236,2017-10-24T17:17:00-04:00,"PayPal reported its Q3 earnings, and it forecast Q4 results last week.The top-line results were another significant upside. The earnings were a beat, but not a large one.The company is benefiting hugely from its mobile payment strategy, which is driving revenue upsides and helping the company gain market share in the payments space.The company's shares have reflected its success, having appreciated by 73% year to date.The company's margin improvement is less than meets the eye and is strongly influenced by ballooning stock based comp expenditures.","Disruption is one of the more over-worked terms in the investment vocabulary. All companies in tech aspire to be disruptors - few businesses actually fulfill that goal. I think it is fair to say that PayPal (PYPL) is one of the leading disruptors in the payment space and continues to reap the rewards of that positioning. Its last quarter, as will be reviewed in this article, continues to support that thesis.Should readers buy the shares at these levels? I last wrote about PayPal in April when the shares were $43. A 63% run in six months has made it far more difficult to enter the shares with some expectation of positive short-term alpha. While the company has put together several successive quarters of significant over-performance and is likely to continue to do so, it is not likely to grow revenues at rates materially above 20% for any extended period. I do not believe management is willing to push that envelope, and I'm not too sure how much faster the company could expand payment volume growth than it is already doing. There are some writers on this site who are more optimistic about the shares. I understand their perspective but simply cannot bring myself to share it.Much of this article will probably seem to readers as a discussion of all that is going right for PayPal and the reasons to own the shares. I think the company has great opportunities, and it is a leader in one of the best markets in the enterprise IT space. I have made that point in prior articles, and things have gotten better more quickly than I had expected. But valuation is a key component of stock selection, and so is expense management-measured on a GAAP basis. Those factors just do not quite add up for me in terms of evaluating PayPal at the end of October 2017.As mention, in reviewing the numbers PayPal most recently reported, I confess that the company is actually doing better than I thought it could. The market share gains are coming more quickly and at greater magnitude. The success of mobile payments is almost unbelievable. But then I'm an old curmudgeon who hasn't entered that part of the digital age. I suppose if I still take subways in a year or two that will have to change - from putting a dime in a slot to using an iPhone to pay the fare in a lifetime.I do not currently hold the shares, not because anything bad has happened or is likely to happen but simply because of relative valuation. Exiting the shares a month or so ago has not been the wisest of decisions in retrospect. But I simply had a hard time in convincing myself that there was anything the company might report that would further impress investors. The market can be a harsh mistress indeed, and little did I realize that tech shares in general, and this one in particular, would need to melt up.Still, I have my own disciplines, and I try to stick to them. Very crudely put, with a market cap of $87 billion, and an enterprise value of $81 billion, the company has an EV/S of 5.4X. It also has a free cash flow yield that should reach a bit greater than 4% based on expectations for the next 12 months and a forward P/E of 32X. The metrics for EV/S and for free cash flow yield are a bit higher than I'm willing to pay for 20% top line growth. And, that predilection is compounded by the rapid rise in share based comp expense this past year.The shares aren't terribly unreasonable compared to other fintech superstars, but they no longer represent a visible bargain either. The issue of margins, GAAP margins particularly, is one that needs further exploration as they are not rising and are not expected to improve in this current quarter. Thus, while the non-GAAP P/E is certainly more than reasonable, it is built on a metric whose validity might well be questioned. And, the issue of Venmo monetization remains... well, it remains an issue. It is almost impossible to say at this point whether or not Pay with Venmo is going to expand PayPal's universe or simply draw from One Touch. It is really too soon to know how that will work.In fact, reading carefully what the CEO said on this latest call, it is apparent that the rapid increase in stock based comp expense is of some concern to management. That particular tailwind, which has been the mainstay in margin expansion this year, is expected to be a neutral element in 2018 earnings.I'm sometimes asked for a price target for the shares of the companies about which I write. The issue with price targets, of course, is that one has to make some over-arching assumptions about both discount rates and longer-term growth that are never really apparent in advance. The highest price target anyone has published is for PayPal shares is currently $83, and the First Call consensus price target is just $75, which would be appreciation of 6%. The $83 price target is based on a healthy 29X multiple on 2019 earnings. I have a difficult time in believing I can forecast the discount rate out 18 months, and I even wonder about some of the constituents in the company's operating model, including an inability, thus far, to raise GAAP margins. My guess, for what it is worth, is that PayPal shares are more likely to rest than outperform going forward.Should readers continue to hold the shares - that presents somewhat of a different issue. PayPal, for reasons to be discussed further, should be a category leader in a rapidly growing space for years to come. Many investors choose to maintain positions in strong companies indefinitely. I expect to see the company continue to execute on a high-growth strategy. I think that management is more committed to innovation than many other large companies in the tech world.PayPal announced the results of its Q3 last week. The headline numbers were all substantial beats compared to prior guidance and prior published expectations. The company grew revenues by 22% on a constant currency basis. It grew GAAP EPS by 17% and grew non-GAAP EPS by 31%. Regardless of my opinion on the matter, it is the later metric that is most often used for valuation purposes by analysts and many investors. GAAP margins were stable year on year, while non-GAAP margins grew by almost 160 basis points. The results were impacted by $.01 due to the impact of the hurricanes that struck Texas and Florida, and benefited marginally (about $.02 per share) from an inter-company tax adjustment related to intellectual property.The company had forecast that non-GAAP earnings would be in a range of $.42-$.44; non-GAAP EPS was in fact $.46. The company had expected revenues for the quarter to be $3.12-3.19 billion; revenues for the quarter were in fact $3.24 billion or about 2% above expectations. The role of FX in the beat was not material. The company had anticipated GAAP EPS of $.30-$.32, and in fact, GAAP EPS was $.31. While the company did not increase its expectation for GAAP EPS, it did raise non-GAAP EPS expectations from $1.82 to $1.87 which implies that Q4 guidance, heretofore not specifically provided, is $.01 higher than the prior calculation.Most analysts have re-done their models consistent with the company's forecast of trends it expects in 2018. The current consensus EPS number, as published by First Call, is now $2.25 which is up by 6% in the past quarter. That consensus still reflects some unchanged models; the ""real"" EPS consensus expectation is probably $2.30 for 2018.Partially because of increases in stock based comp, cash flow from operations grew by 26% while free cash flow grew by 36%. The company is now forecasting that it will reach more than $3 billion in free cash flow. That is another increase in terms of expectations from the $2.9 billion anticipated one quarter earlier.The company raised guidance for the last quarter of the year. For the year as a whole, the company had expected revenues to be around $12.83 billion, and it now expects revenues to be $12.95 billion. That calculated to another 2% increase in its revenue forecast for Q4 compared to the derived prior expectations.Payment volume grew by 29% on a constant currency basis, with the number of transactions growing by 26% and with the number of transactions per account growing by 9%. The growth in payment volume actually increased noticeably from the prior quarter. Most analysts look at payment volume excluding eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), and that rose by 34%. eBay payment volume has now declined to just 13.5% of the total, and while still a drag on percentage growth, it no longer is a central component in analyzing PayPal. The company, as might be expected, given its increasing volume and shifts in its mix to person to person transactions, is seeing a decline in its take rate which fell by 21 basis points when viewed holistically last quarter. At 2.84%, it is still a healthy number and has allowed the company to generate strong levels of free cash flow.The company on the call made a point of discussing its expense management. In fact, the CFO talked about operating leverage at scale. Looked at holistically, the company is reporting that its ""other operating expenses"" are rising at 9% per dollar of incremental revenue, and that normalized for acquisitions, operating expense growth was just 3.5% compared to a 20% increase in revenue. That looks great - but it isn't really an accurate representation of the company's expense performance. All of the leverage is coming from stock based comp. That really should not be acceptable to investors - although it seems to be at this time. The company's GAAP operating margin is 13% which hasn't changed year over year and which actually declined sequentially. At the least, such performance suggests that there are some issues that need fixing in the business model.In terms of guidance, the company is forecasting a more rapid cadence in the increase of the other expense category of some visible magnitude in this current quarter. That, in turn, has constrained the increase in full-year EPS estimates to some degree. Part of the increase is related to the expenses of the company's two smaller acquisitions, TIO and Swift Financial (The latter is a small business lender not to be confused with the Swift Network).Venmo, despite the advent of competitive offerings from large banks, most notably Zelle, still grew by 93% in the quarter. Overall, the company acquired more than 8 million accounts during the quarter, up by 88%, and an all-time quarterly record.I think it is reasonable to suggest that if PayPal's beer got any colder than it was this past quarter, it would be frozen. The company continued to expand its market share based on a higher proportion of mobile payments as a percentage of total payments. Mobile payment volume grew 54% last quarter and has now reached 35% of the total. I have commented about the OneTouch experience in earlier articles. This still appears to be a competitive differentiator. I should note that these really stellar numbers have been produced within the context of a rising tide - although I'm inclined to believe that most of the gains seen by this company are simply market share-related.If one had to encapsulate the winning strategy for this company into two words they would be mobile payments. It is hard to over-exaggerate what that has meant to this company's franchise. For those unfamiliar with the functionality, PayPal's One Touch offers users the ability to pay for merchandise on their mobile devices without entering login and billing information. Needless to say, that is an important feature and continues to this day to be the major differentiator that this company has been able to offer in the mobile payments space.The company is now using its mobile payment paradigm to help it secure payment volume in the burgeoning field of ""buy on-line and pick-up in the store."" The COO described this new experience model as one of home field advantages for PayPal.But beyond mobile payments, PayPal is benefiting noticeably from a so-called network effect. Users can get more benefits from PayPal experiences because there are more merchants using the PayPal payment technologies. The improved experience which users - at least on average - are enjoying has led to a more rapid growth of users. In turn, that leads to a higher level of merchant adds and more merchant engagements. The company is able to sell its new products such as bill pay and international remittances to a larger audience. Last quarter, as mentioned, PayPal added 8 million active new accounts, far above past expectations for that metric which had been 3-5 million. The company is now forecasting adding 30 million new accounts this year. Adding that many accounts simply creates a virtuous cycle because merchants can't ignore such a popular way of taking payments, and PYPL has a larger audience for its services.The company has emphasized a strategy that it calls its offering of PayPal Choice. Customers are now able to easily specify from which funding source they will make their payments through PayPal. Choice has led to some interesting partnerships with card networks and banks. It also has reduced user churn as well as obtain higher payment volumes per active accounts. On the other hand, it is also a factor that comes into play when looking at declining take rates. On balance, one reason why PYPL is doing as well as it is is that the company has not tried to shut out banks and card networks from its paradigm. It has taken what might have been a problem and turned into a growth driver.While Venmo has not to date been monetized, and it probably will not be a major growth driver in terms of reported revenues in 2018, it certainly does increase the number of active PayPal accounts which in turn lead to higher payment volumes. Venmo Pay is now available for use at 2 million merchants, and there are some modest fees that PYPL receives when this technology is used that is payable by merchants. But it remains incredibly popular among millennials for reasons that are not apparent, and this popularity seemingly is part of the popularity for PayPal mobile payments.Probably, the major investor concern regarding PayPal relates to potential competition and the prospect of price erosion and commoditization. I do not propose to go through all of the payment alternatives that are and will be available - lots of potential enterprises have an interest in the space. I have linked to a couple of market research studies. The market is huge. It continues to grow in double digits and mobile payments as a subset is growing at the fastest rate of all. PayPal is growing faster than the market for the reasons I have tried to suggest earlier in this article. Based on the market size and structure, despite competition, there is no reason to believe that PayPal can't continue to grow at rates of around 20% for several years to come.The competitor most often discussed and thought to be the most significant threat to PayPal is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)/Apple Pay. Apple is planning on integrating a peer to peer payment option into the next release of its operating system. Other competitors in the space include Amazon (AMZN), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Wal-Mart (WMT).Despite all of these large potential competitors entering the payments space, it seems relatively straightforward to believe that PayPal will continue to best its competition for some time to come. At this point, PYPL has a significant advantage in being a neutral player in the payments space that can work with everyone. Agnosticism, or whatever culturally correct phrase is currently in vogue, is a huge advantage in payments where there are so many potential partners.In addition, at this point, PYPL has a far broader set of solutions than its competitors. While I hate to use jargon, PayPal has the technology that allows it to provide an end-to end value proposition for its users, and it can do this across multiple operating systems. None of its competitors currently has that capability, and it doesn't seem likely that they will be able to extend beyond their unique ecosystem any time in the near future.I mentioned the network effect earlier in this article. That is another one of those hard to measure but crucial items to have in building a competitive moat in the payments space. To an extent, the huge body of active users and merchants all using PayPal makes it difficult for any potential competitor to dislodge the company from its position.When I look at costs, I do on a GAAP basis. It really is the only rational way to evaluate expense management on a sequential or historical basis, I think. I will look at the company's operating expense ratios both in the past quarter and sequentially. Customer support and operating expenses fell from about 12% of revenues to 10.7%. Sales and marketing costs were essentially flat year over year at about 8.5% of revenues. Product development costs fell from about 8% of revenues to 7.4% of revenues and general and administrative costs fell from 9.7% of revenues to 9% of revenues year on year.What's striking in the cost analysis was that transaction expense rose from 31% of revenues to 34% of revenues, while transaction and loan losses rose as well from about 10% of revenues to 11% of revenues. Overall, GAAP operating income was 13% of revenues last year and hasn't improved at all in the last year.In fact, this past quarter, operating income actually fell by 70 basis points from Q2 levels because of a higher level of transaction and loan losses. I think it is fair to say that some of the partnerships that PayPal has used to fend off potential competition and to grow its ecosystem are constraining margins and are likely to continue to do so. While the strategy that PayPal has adopted clearly seems appropriate to maximize long-term growth and even margins, it does have visible costs.Management has been able to mask these costs because of an explosion of stock based comp. Stock based comp through the first nine months of the current year grew by no less than 65%. Last quarter, stock based comp was actually up by 79% year on year. Looked at another way, stock based comp rose from 4.1% of revenues last year to 6% of revenues this year. That increase is the entire source of the company's reported non-GAAP margin gain. The increase in stock based comp was almost half of the increase in cash flow from operations.Stock based comp, which was 19% of cash flow and 30% of non-GAAP operating income, is not particularly unusual compared to many other tech vendors. But the cadence of the increase in stock based comp is obviously unsustainable. Management, as mentioned earlier, has already spoken about the expectation to control that kind of spending in 2018. Management also has forecast that op ex spending will climb at faster rates in Q4 on a non-GAAP basis. Exactly how and where the company might achieve margin gains in 2018, given current cost trends that include greater investment in opex as forecast on the latest conference call, has been left unspecified. I think that without better margin trends, the more optimistic analysts who are looking for EPS results above the current consensus, are likely to be disappointed. It is one reason I think it might be prudent to hold off establishing new positions in this name until improvements in cost trends become more visible.I think the primary issue in terms of valuation is not growth, or even competitive pressures, but the ability the company will have to grow earnings and cash flow without using dramatic increases in stock based comp. That outcome simply is not totally apparent to me at this point, and hence my view that current valuation precludes much positive alpha for these shares.As mentioned at the outset, PayPal has a current enterprise value of about $81 billion, and consensus expectations for the next 12 months are for revenues of $14.9 billion. That forecast is based on 20% top-line growth and yields and EV/S metric of 5.4X. That is a reasonable number, I believe, but not perhaps, an outstanding value.The EPS consensus forecast as it currently appears on First Call is for 2018 EPS of $2.25. The actual consensus expectations are a bit higher - there are some estimates on First Call that have not been updated which pull down the average. Using $2.30 as the actual current consensus reflects a forward P/E of about 30X. The P/E metric is by no means expensive for a company such as this. The problem is that much of the growth in earnings this current year is based on an explosion of stock based comp expense and is not really reflective of margin improvements.Next year's numbers reflect a modest improvement in operating expense ratios and no material increase in shares. Management also said that it will act to at least minimize the growth in stock based comp, and it has further indicated that it will accelerate non-GAAP expense growth in the fourth quarter. It is also going to have some expenses related to the integration of the two smaller acquisitions made over the summer.There is, perhaps, a frisson of discordance between all of these expectations. Most analysts who recommend these shares do so primarily based on expectations on quarters that will continue to beat expectations. It seems to me that it might be difficult for margins - real margins - to grow enough to support that expectation over the coming several quarters. The company is expecting non-GAAP margins to improve modestly, and I have no reason to doubt that this will happen. I do think it will be more difficult to maintain beat and raise EPS quarters because of the pressures I have indicated.So far, the impact of stock based comp on outstanding shares has been offset by share repurchase. As mentioned, although the increase in stock based comp is substantial, its overall ratio is not particularly out of the ordinary for tech vendors. The company is committed to an aggressive capital return strategy, which is based on share repurchase. The company, again thanks in part to the use of stock based comp, has been able to generate a substantial increase in its cash flow and is thus able to buy back stock and fund smaller acquisitions.The company is looking to develop what it describes as an ""asset light"" strategy for its consumer credit business. This might have some impact on the company's 2018 earnings expectation and will certainly enhance cash flow. The company is now forecasting free cash flow to exceed $3 billion this year, and it will almost certainly grow substantially next year as well. Much of the company's cash flow comes from adjustments for transaction and loan loss items which are part of the income presentation but which have not impacted cash. I think it is reasonable to believe that 2018 CFFO will reach $3.7 billion-plus. That is a free cash flow yield of 4.6%, a decent level for a company experiencing this kind of growth. While PayPal is not a cash flow story per se, it is likely that it will continue to generate more cash than income because of the levels of transaction losses it recognizes in income coupled with stock based comp.In many ways, PayPal is an admirable company, and over the long term, it is most likely to be one of the most significant beneficiaries of the trend to e-commerce, e-payments, and mobile. I have commented in the past on its talented management team. But the shares are up almost 73% year to date. The success of PayPal is well understood by many and is reflected in its valuation. I think investors are likely to be able to find a better entry point in this name although I expect the company will continue to enjoy success in its markets and that it will continue to gain share. Great company, but a more tendentious outlook for the shares in the near term."
4131133,103690,2017-12-11T13:29:14-05:00,"PayPal's financial results for the third quarter and year-to-date continue to impress from both a top-line and bottom-line perspective.The company remains disciplined with its margins alongside its rapid growth.The company is well-positioned and poised to take advantage of strong tailwinds related to the rise of digital payments and e-commerce.It is important to evaluate the stock from both a value- and momentum-investing perspective. Strictly based on value, the valuation looks a bit stretched, but a bullish case can be made based on momentum.","PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has come under pressure as the technology sector has hit a rough patch. Amid the recent sell-off and the concerns of a market correction, investors have initiated new positions and/or added to existing positions in the technology sector. PayPal stock price has rebounded slightly after losing as much as 10% in the past few trading sessions, but the technology sector as a whole continues to see volatility. I consider the pullback as an opportunity to take a fresh comprehensive look at PayPal as a potential investment. In this article, I look to evaluate the company’s financial performance, growth, valuation, investor expectations and potential risks moving forward.PayPal reached an all-time high in late November alongside other notable technology stocks. Similarly, the technology industry as tracked by the S&P 500 Information Technology Index .SPLRCT reached an all-time high. Amid the recent sell-off, the index declined by as much as 4%, while PayPal’s stock price declined by as much as 10%. Despite the recent pullback, PayPal has impressed and rewarded shareholders with the stock up over 80% in comparison to other notable payment companies Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) which have gained 41% and 42%, respectively. All three have outperformed the S&P 500 which is up 17% year-to-date.(Source: Yahoo Finance)The company’s impressive return for investors in the current year can be attributed to its recent performance, growth, and expectations moving forward. The company has seen double-digit growth in the current year and analysts are projecting close to 20% future long-term growth. In its most recent third quarter, PayPal’s revenue grew by 21.4% quarter over prior-year quarter, and the company exceeded consensus analyst expectations for earnings and revenue by $0.03 and $60 million, respectively.Top Line and Bottom LineTo summarize and provide a clear picture of the company’s performance year-to-date, we can look to the charts below which highlight revenue, operating income, net income, and EBITDA. Growth rates for each have been calculated on a quarter-over-prior-year-quarter basis.(Source: Charts created by Author, derived from information provided in Company's 10-Q Filings)In particular, the company’s third quarter was a standout. Growth in top-line revenue, operating income, and EBITDA came in the highest year-to-date, all above 21%. Net income growth trended slightly lower due to income taxes, but still remained in the high double-digits. Income tax expense was $71 million (16.8% of operating income) for 2017 Q3 in comparison to $37 million (10.6% of operating income) in 2016 Q3. Regardless, the trending growth is impressive.Growth of Customer Base and Transaction VolumePer the company’s third-quarter earnings presentation slides, the company continues to expand its customer base. In particular, the growth of its active customer accounts has trended upward from 11% to 14% in the third quarter. Per the definitions set forth in its earnings slides, “an active customer account is a registered account that successfully sent or received at least one payment or payment reversal through our Payments Platform … in the past 12 months.” Accordingly, the number of active accounts does not necessarily translate to revenue growth if users are only using PayPal for one or a few transactions each year. We look for clarification in another earnings presentation slide.(Source: Company's Third Quarter Earnings Slides)The more telling statistic is the company’s “number of payment transactions per active customer account” as defined by the “total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period divided by the active customer accounts at end of the period.” This has grown 9% from 30.2 in 2016 Q3 to 32.8 in 2017 Q3, indicating not only has the customer base expanded but the volume of transactions over that customer base continues to increase – implying that users are increasingly using PayPal.(Source: Company's Third-Quarter Earnings Slides)Consistent MarginsTo add on to the growth story, the company has been able to keep margins relatively consistent and stable. Based on GAAP numbers, for the nine-month period ended 2017, operating margin, net margin, and EBITDA margin are only slightly lower from prior year. In reviewing margins on a quarterly basis, one can see that margins have trended lower from Q1 to Q3 for both 2017 and 2016, which may suggest some business cyclicality and would not be a concern. Overall, margins have remained remarkably consistent for a company that is continuing to grow at a rapid pace.(Source: Tables created by author, calculated based on information provided in company's 10-Q filings)In its third-quarter earnings transcripts, management has summarized this nicely by stating:PayPal’s current analyst consensus for long-term growth is near 20%. This can be attributed to the company’s current dominant position in the digital wallet space in the U.S. and its expansion to other countries. It has been significantly building its network of individual consumers and merchants as evident by statistics published in the company’s earnings slides. PayPal is now a widely recognizable name in the payment space, and its acceptance as a form of payment has grown. In addition, the company is expected to continue to thrive with the continued rise of digital payments and e-commerce.Some recent reports and statistics relevant to the expected rise of digital payments and e-commerce can be found below:(Source: U.S. Census Bureau)In terms of competition, PayPal faces competition from notable names such as Apple Pay, Android Pay, Samsung Pay, Amazon Pay, Square Cash, etc. Just recently Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced its Apple Pay Cash which allows people to transfer money between each other, similar to PayPal’s Venmo and Square Cash.In addition to competition from U.S.-based companies, PayPal is susceptible to competition overseas. While PayPal remains in a dominant position in the U.S., it does not have the largest number of mobile payment users worldwide. Per Statista, as of August 2017 worldwide, the number of users for mobile payment platforms WeChat and Alipay which caters to China’s large population were 600 million and 400 million, respectively, in comparison to 210 million for PayPal. While the company receives about 54% of its revenue from the U.S., it does have a substantial portion of its revenue generated overseas, 11% in the U.K. and 35% in Other Countries, which make it susceptible to competition with payment apps developed and used in foreign countries such as WeChat and Alipay.(Source: Tables created by Authors, derived from information in Company's 10-Q Filings)Needless to say, PayPal has greater competition within the digital wallet space than before. However, with the expected growth of digital payments and e-commerce, and PayPal's current position in the industry, it would not be unrealistic to expect high double-digit growth in the next few years, making estimates near 20% reasonable. We’ll have to see how it plays out as more companies such as Apple offer greater functionality to mirror PayPal’s applications, but for now, the company has proven to be efficiently managed and has a step up on the competition in the U.S.Having covered financial performance and growth, I look to now cover the company’s valuation and evaluate the stock as a potential investment.Valuation Metrics Compared to PeersIn terms of valuation, we can review PayPal in comparison to peers Visa and Mastercard based on several metrics as shown below.(Source: Calculations by Author based on readily available market information, and other data from Reuters)At first glance, from the table above, readers may be quick to assume that the company is overvalued based on metrics of EV/EBITDA, P/E, and PEG when compared to peers Visa and Mastercard. However, P/S and P/FCF appear favorable for PayPal. Diving further, I looked at EV/EBITDA and P/E from a historical perspective to see how these metrics have changed over time.Basically, both metrics have drastically increased from prior year end for PayPal. The increase in stock price has been the driving factor for both numerators of EV and price in the EV/EBITDA and P/E calculations. While EBITDA and earnings continue to grow substantially by 21% and 18% in the third quarter, the stock price has risen by over 80% for the year. Just one year ago, these valuation multiples for PayPal were actually quite close to peers Visa and Mastercard.When running a simplified discounted cash flow using a 20% long-term growth rate, a conservative 10% discount rate and other assumptions, I came to a value of $65. I want to emphasize that I use this simply as a rule of thumb alongside other metrics as the valuation from this model is sensitive to slight changes in my assumptions.PayPal has had an impressive year in terms of financial performance and growth, but that’s not to say that Visa and Mastercard did not have an impressive year as well. To put it into perspective, for the recent quarter ended 9/30/17, Visa’s and Mastercard's EBITDA grew by 21.8% and 19.2%, respectively, in comparison to PayPal’s 21.2%. The future growth prospects are greater for PayPal as analysts are projecting long-term growth of 20% in comparison to Visa at 17% and Mastercard at 18%. Based on the expected growth of digital payments and e-commerce as discussed earlier, the 20% growth is certainly reasonable. In addition, PayPal’s expected growth is reasonable when compared to the projected growth rates of its peers, and the fact that PayPal is still considered a relatively smaller company – Mastercard 1.8x and Visa 2.9x the market capitalization of PayPal of $87B.Exceeding Analyst ExpectationsThe company has consistently exceeded or met analyst’s consensus estimates for revenue and earnings, which has increased investor’s confidence in management. In comparison to its peers, both Visa and Mastercard have also exceeded or met analyst expectations in recent quarters.(Source: Reuters)Value vs. MomentumThe stock price has trended upward nicely, and has not seen any substantial pullback in price except for the recent sell-off (presumably due to a rotation out of the technology sector). It has not only exceeded analyst estimates, but has continued to exceed analyst price targets which have been revised upward. The upward trend in price makes the stock an attractive target for momentum investors. There is a great deal to love about the company; however, when you look at the valuation metrics in comparison to its peers, it does make me pause and wonder if the valuation is a little stretched here.Based strictly on value, some investors may consider the stock as overvalued even when considering the company’s strong financial performance and long-term growth expectations. PayPal currently has a PEG ratio of 2.8 in comparison to the PEG of 2.4 for Visa and 2.0 for Mastercard. This is not to say that PayPal should trade at the PEG of its peers, but to put it into context, a lower PEG of 2.4 would translate to a price of $62 a share. That being said, based on prior momentum, there has been a lot to like about the stock and it may continue to always trade higher than what value investors may deem as “fair value.” The recent pullback does cause some concern for the stock’s momentum, as it briefly broke through its 50-day moving average of $71-72 reaching a low of $69 a share. The stock has slightly recovered, but if it starts to trend sideways, we may see further weakness ahead.PayPal remains a dominant player in the digital payment space. The company’s financial performance year-to-date is impressive, and the company has proven its ability to grow rapidly but remain disciplined in maintaining its margins. The increasing use of digital wallets, digital payments, and popularity of e-commerce will continue to drive the company’s growth. With all the positives surrounding the company, the only thing in question is the valuation.In assessing future growth, I would expect the long-term growth to be in the high double-digits, and find that the analyst consensus of 20% is reasonable. It’s hard to say how competition will play out, but as PayPal remains in the forefront I would side with the company moving forward until seeing otherwise. After justifying the significant growth rate and considering the performance year-to-date, from a value investing perspective, the valuation does look a bit stretched here even after the recent dip in price. But if you consider stock based on prior momentum, one can make the case that the recent pullback in stock price may be as good a time as any to initiate a new position or add to an existing position.However, if buying on this dip, I would hesitate to start a full position at current levels for a few reasons: (1) there continues to be volatility in technology stocks and the rotation out of sector may persist, (2) the stock has lost some momentum and did briefly break through its 50-day moving average, (3) with the stock being up over 80%, it may be reasonable to assume that some investors may trim their position until the end of the current year, or are waiting to sell in the new tax year 2018, and (4) the risks associated with being invested in the current bull market related to discussions of a market correction, interest rates, geopolitical issues, etc. Personally, when selecting individual stocks, I tend to side with value over momentum, but I can understand the reasoning for buying the dip here. For myself, and given my portfolio risk and current allocation, I will use a wait-and-see approach and consider initiating a position if it falls further, averaging over time. Despite my hesitation to directly invest in the company at the current time, PayPal is undoubtedly a great company with a very promising long-term growth story.Thank you for taking the time to read my article.

4116011,101431,2017-10-24T17:41:55-04:00,PayPal continues to beat analysts' estimates with revenue growth rates in the high twenties and ongoing strength in the bottom-line.Venmo is expected to turn profitable soon.The current level seems to be a fair entry point and there are several sources of growth optionality that can unlock further upside.,"PayPal’s (PYPL) core business gave another sign of strong momentum as the company delivered the highest QoQ growth in active customers (+3.8% over Q2) since the separation from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), leading the total to over 218 million active customers. While you can read the company’s results more in detail in the press release, I think it’s worth mentioning that Q3 results indicated another acceleration in the top-line growth and the 8th consecutive quarter without a miss on earnings or revenue estimates. Despite the already large scale, the number of active users is growing at a rising pace:Source: Author's ElaborationThe company expects 30 million net new active accounts for 2017, which means over a 15% YoY increase. The strong growth in net active accounts was not the only driver of sales growth for the core business. It’s worth noting that engagement continues to grow and rose to 32.8 times for the year, up from approximately 30 in the third quarter of 2016, which corresponds to almost a 10% YoY increase. PayPal is clearly gaining mind share as a payment method, further improving the strong network effect that has characterized the company’s growth.Growing customer accounts and increasing engagement help drive the top-line to growth multiples in the low twenties, while the bottom-line continues to benefit from an ongoing margin expansion that confirms a good level of operating leverage in the core business. In Q3, non-GAAP operating income grew by 32%, which included an operating margin expansion of approximately 160 basis points from Q3 2016.Another thing worth mentioning is that US revenue grew 21% versus Q3 ’16 and international revenues grew 22% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis, which means that the international segment is now growing faster than the domestic one, while even in the last quarter, there was a 400 bps gap.There are no other things to highlight in the latest earnings release. The balance sheet continues to be rock-solid and free cash flow generation continues to be excellent, with a 36% increase vs. last year and the management’s expectations of $3 billion in yearly FCF generation by the end of the year.PayPal’s Q3 clearly shows a company on a solid growth path that is obviously increasing its market share as a payment method. The company’s moat is expanding as a result of the self-fueling network effect and its financials show the possibility to generate a good operating leverage.Venmo, the P2P payment platform that includes social media features, can still offer excellent optionality due to the simple fact that despite the strong growth in the past few years, the division hasn’t started to be profitable yet. Despite the growth in payment volume from just $143 million to over $9.4 billion in just 4 years, Venmo continues to be a drag on net income.A few days before the earnings release, the company announced that Venmo's base of millennial customers can now pay with Venmo at over 2 million PayPal merchants across the United States. During the earnings call, the management also declared that many existing PayPal merchants are excited to offer Venmo as a way to pay on their sites and that Venmo has prompted some of the largest and most influential merchants in the US to come to PayPal for the first time, thus highlighting Venmo’s contribution to the company’s bargaining power.The chart below shows how Venmo is growing in terms of payment volume:Source: Author's ElaborationThe management gave us some important information during the earnings call, giving us more details on when Venmo is supposed to turn profitable:The management was a bit conservative and not actually precise but the main message is clear. We can expect Venmo to turn profitable next year, although we don’t have a precise indication of how much will be generated in earnings. This is enough because it means we can expect some further operating leverage and another source of bottom-line growth besides the core PayPal and Braintree businesses.The possibility to go asset-light was first mentioned in early 2016. Despite some mixed opinions about the strategy, I think the prospects of lower earnings volatility have contributed to lowering the perceived risk and helped the stock’s multiples.According to the management, PayPal doesn't operate the credit business to gain interest and fees but rather to grow user engagement and improve merchant wins and retention. The management said that customers who utilize credit services spend twice as much as new customers who do not. Moreover, they said that when existing customers enroll in either PayPal credit or the PayPal credit card, their total purchase volume increases 35%.Going asset-light on credit would shift interest and fee income but it would also shift default risk to the counterparty. At the same time, PayPal would continue to ""provide"" those loans to its customers. If customers do value the possibility to use credit services on PayPal and if it’s true that customers who use such services spend much more than the ones who do not, the PayPal network would surely benefit from the expansion of these services, even if the company will not collect fees and interest income. During Q3’s earnings call, the management said:If it accounts for just 2% - 2.5% or TPV, it’s clear that outsourcing the credit business wouldn’t make a big difference in revenue and profits. Anyway, it would free up some capital for better growth options and still allow the company to take advantage of the improving engagement that credit services seem to bring. I continue to have a positive view on this move.PayPal has a rock-solid balance sheet and generates a huge free cash flow. FCF is almost twice net income and translates into a 23%+ FCF margin. It’s obvious that the company can leverage its balance sheet and/or exploit its huge levels of FCF to pursue additional growth options when they appear. The management further confirmed this possibility in the last earnings call:While the management believes that many growth options will be developed internally and not by external acquisitions, the passage above clearly shows the management’s commitment to take advantage of external growth opportunities that can accelerate the company’s progress. They look at “hundreds” of opportunities every quarter and I think it’s likely that they will find something that can be easily integrated with PayPal’s huge network, as they did with Braintree (and Venmo). Moreover, using the sale of credit receivables in Q2 2015 to Synchrony as a benchmark, going asset-light could free up to $5 billion in cash, further increasing PayPal’s firepower.The management expects the current momentum to continue and sees the possibility for another slight acceleration in the top line next quarter. They expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.63 billion or 20% to 22% growth on a currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS are guided in the $0.50 to $0.52 range, which corresponds to a 19%-24% YoY growth.Revenue guidance in the range of $12.92 billion to $12.98 billion corresponds to a 20% to 21% growth on a currency neutral basis, while non-GAAP EPS in the range $1.86 to $1.88 translates into a 24%-25% YoY growth.Using these EPS and EPS growth rate implied in the company’s guidance, we know the stock is currently trading at 37x EPS and roughly 1.5x PEG. Using the expectations of $3 billion in free cash flow, the stock would be trading at 28x full-year FCF per share. I don’t think these multiples can be excessive considering the company’s growth prospects and the stability of the business. To make a comparison, Visa (V) is currently trading at almost 38x full-year EPS expectations and a PEG of 2.5, using Factset estimates for full-year 2017. Even MasterCard (MA) is trading at a slight premium, with a PEG of 1.6. Actually, I think the current valuation doesn’t discount several sources of growth optionality discussed in the paragraphs above. Considering the company’s huge free-cash-flow generation, the rock-solid balance sheet and the potential to monetize Venmo, I think there is still upside at the current levels.PayPal is clearly a company with a wide and increasing moat based on a strong network effect. I think it’s still worth holding the stock at the current price, especially for a long-term position, as the stock’s valuation looks fair based on the underlying fundamental trends but could benefit from a further multiple expansion offered by the aforementioned growth options.Thanks for taking the time to read this article.

4115908,102603,2017-10-24T14:38:00-04:00,"PayPal is the clear winner in the payments industry this year.However, there’s a lot of competition when it comes to digital payments.With the huge elephant in the room being bitcoin.But there could still be a huge opportunity for PayPal.","PayPal (PYPL) is quietly becoming the darling of the financial technology space. With an $81 billion market cap, it's now bigger than many conventional finance companies, including Capital One (COF) and Discover (DIS). It's quickly closing in on American Express (AXP) and Goldman Sachs (GS). Shares are already up 70% this year and trading at 30x next year's earnings estimates. Still, the bigger story is that PayPal is taking market share from conventional banks and is a more effective way to move money compared to bitcoin.The recent earnings showed that Venmo is a big win for PayPal. Venmo is meant to be the payment app for millennials, acting much like Square (SQ). PayPal is seven times the size of Square and is much cheaper, with Square trading at over 70x earnings.PayPal bought up Braintree in 2013, which owned Venmo. Last quarter, Venmo's payment volume doubled year-over-year to $9 billion and the company as a whole beat EPS expectations by 7%. Digital payments are the future and PayPal appears to have a leg up when it comes to competing with the digital currency leader - bitcoin. PayPal is much cheaper than bitcoin in terms of valuation, but PayPal is also doing a ton more transactions - over 60x the number of transactions compared to bitcoin. Transaction costs aren't an issue with PayPal, in the sense that they are much more reasonable. The time to process transactions are nil for PayPal compared to bitcoin. Granted, they are still very different, in that PayPal is a payment processor and you're still beholden to government currencies.Using bitcoin, right now, in stores is tough, if not impossible. With PayPal, it's rolling out Venmo in retail stores. You can now use Venmo to pay for online purchases if they accept PayPal. Some 2 million U.S. merchants now accept Venmo. The idea is to make shopping in-person as easy as possible and PayPal wants to allow customers the ability to skip lines and pay with their mobile wallet. It's also allowing users the ability to split retail transactions - the heart of why Venmo was created in the first place. Venmo is doing a lot of volume and PayPal is just getting around to monetizing that. The idea is to let Venmo users buy anything they want.Venmo is attacking the millennial and peer-to-peer angle - by also making payments more social, as well as hoping to get more involved with retailers. Venmo has a social feed and there is an opportunity to make more money by selling ads there. PayPal is carving out a niche with merchants. It's now in full harvest mode - harvesting its Venmo user-base and looking to keep more users coming back to PayPal with its mobile wallet.Who can keep up? Square is another public company, and one that offers a debit card for customers. Venmo is rolling out a similar card. PayPal (already has a debit card) and Venmo have a much larger user-base and from what I've seen, the adoption of Venmo has been much greater. There is Google Wallet - which did away with its debit card - but again has a smaller user base. Zelle is the relatively new way to send/receive money and is a partnership among the major banks - so only allows bank account usage, and the initial reviews aren't that exciting.The rise of 'all' these payment competitors hasn't phased PayPal's stock price, nor has it touched the income statement. EBITDA clocked in at $2.9 billion last year, and is expected to top $3.5 billion this year. Across the board, even as the likes of Square and Zelle, as well as cryptocurrencies, have popped up, PayPal is still growing. Revenue was $8 billion in 2014, hit $9.3 billion in 2015, then $10.8 billion last year, and is expected to hit nearly $13 billion this year. Earnings per share has grown all along the way as well, up from $1.10 in 2014 to $1.29 in 2015, then $1.50 in 2016 and $1.87 expected this year. Operating, EBITDA and net margin are all expected to grow year-over-year from 2016 to 2017.The Venmo monetization is helping drive this and it's relying less on eBay. That is, eBay was 13.5% of total pay volume last quarter, where it was 20% just a couple years ago. When its partnership with eBay end in 2020, it should be an even smaller part of the business. As well, PayPal is growing its partnerships with other financial players, such as Mastercard (NYSE:MA) and Skype - where you can no use PayPal in the Skype app.Going forward, PayPal should continue to to hold off the competition and even excel as it adopts to the changing financial payments environment. That is, it has a stronghold on the digital wallet market, and has a growing stronghold on the corporate payment processing network - i.e. its Braintree service powers Uber's billing.PayPal shouldn't have a problem adapting to the changing digital payments 'situation' either, as it's adapted in the past, buying up Venmo and Braintree to better cater to the changing market. The bet on mobile and flawless payments is just where PayPal needs to be.In truth, PayPal does trade at a somewhat premium valuation of 30x earnings, but it's growth justifies that. And cryptocurrencies won't have a negative impact on earnings, nor valuation. The key being that right now bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are being used more as a store of value than a currency. The transaction costs for using bitcoin is still very high. Paypal can easily keep its 30x P/E multiple going forward, at least for the next couple years, as growth opportunities remain robust, and as it proves it can fend off competition.PayPal started, in a roundabout, way accepting bitcoin a few years ago. PayPal has remained an intermediary when it comes to handling bitcoin transactions. There's a big opportunity here to figure out how to accept bitcoin and keep transaction costs to a minimal. Allowing users the ability to pay with goods and services and/or transfer money via bitcoin is interesting - and would be a big first-mover advantage. PayPal is already making a big push into agnostic style payments with its Choice investments.That is, PayPal is making a big effort to allow users the ability to choose their funding source for paying for items, etc. This could naturally process into creating an alternative to Apple Pay. A single digital wallet that you can use anywhere is exciting and should considered the great space race when it comes to digital payments. PayPal already has a leg up with an installed user base and recognition online. The One-Touch feature only makes having a single source for payments that much easier.What to look for - if PayPal makes a commitment to get rid of its consumer loan portfolio, it could signal that it is ready to focus on the digital payments landscape. A PayPal move to figure out how to accept or integrate bitcoin would be huge as well. In the end, PayPal is still a force to be reckoned with. It allows sellers the ability to reach customers with an online payment system, and looks to allow retailers the ability to better compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) by offering a more seamless in-store checkout experience. PayPal isn't cheap, but based on how it's fended off competition effectively in the past, it's premium valuation is more than warranted. Bitcoin is not a threat and likely won't be for several years, if ever. And other players like Square and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Wallet are losing out it PayPal's Venmo. Then there's PayPal's stronghold among businesses and it's potential to become a bigger player as it offers seamless billing via Braintree, like it's done with Uber. The move toward mobile, digital and flawless payments is a win for PayPal and its investors."

On the other hand, valuation is getting a big stretched at current prices. Is it too late to buy PayPal or does the stock still offer room for gains in the years ahead?"
4112328,101431,2017-10-08T21:16:37-04:00,"The market has positive growth expectations for PayPal, which are reflected in its stock price.By comparing PayPal's growth with the general trends in e-commerce, we see that analysts' estimates look fair.It's worth giving a look at some growth optionality that may arise in the next few years.","PayPal (PYPL) is a well-known online payment company that probably needs no introduction. After some uncertainty following the spin-off from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), PYPL has experienced a massive uptrend that has led the stock price to rise over 50% since the beginning of 2017. The recent performance was driven by a significant multiple expansion, a clear sign that the market is starting to discount higher growth rates for the future. At first impact, the stock’s valuation may look a bit stretched. PYPL is trading at more than 51x TTM EPS and very close to a PEG of 2 using last quarter’s EPS growth rate. These multiples seem to imply the expectations of ongoing fast growth and need a fundamental confirmation to be justified. A PEG rate of 2, for example, makes sense if the current growth rate is expected to be sustainable for a reasonably long time frame. After posting some bullish thoughts on PayPal and seeing the stock rally 15% in just 2 months, I want to give another look and reassess the validity of a bullish case.The market seems to be very positive about PayPal’s future and analysts have been constantly raising their price targets for many months. For the period between 2016 and 2020, analysts expect over a 22% EPS CAGR for the years 2017-2020 and forecast revenue to grow at least at a 17% CAGR in the same period. PYPL is now trading at 36x full-year EPS expectations of $1.84 and 30x 2019 EPS expectations of $2.20. Should the company maintain the growth trajectory expected by analysts for at least 5-6 years, the current price would be a fair entry point for sure. In order to assess the likelihood of a protracted growth at these levels, we have to analyze the company’s competitive position, the underlying trends in the industry and the potential sources of growth optionality.The first thing I look at when I analyze a growth business is the sustainability of the company’s competitive advantage over peers. To invest in a growth story with an acceptable degree of risk, we should be sure that the company’s competitive strengths have a good level of durability and are hardly replicable. PayPal’s competitive strengths seem to have both these characteristics. PayPal’s business is protected by a good moat based on a strong network effect. As more and more customers use the service, the more it becomes valuable for sellers and vice-versa. With over 210 million active customers including 17 million merchant accounts, I think the PayPal network has already reached the critical mass needed to sustain the business in the long term. In addition to that, it’s reasonable to assume that the moat will just get increasingly wide as an increasing number of customers and merchants start to use the service. As we can see in the chart below, the number of customers is in a solid uptrend, with the growth rate actually accelerating.Source: Author's elaborationThe strong growth is fueled by the expansion of e-commerce at the expense of traditional stores. In this context of increasing e-commerce penetration, the only reasonable outcome I see is that PayPal will continue to grow its network, further strengthening its competitive advantages. Even if Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t accept PayPal, I think this is a marginal problem and a source of upside risk. As I wrote in a previous article:E-commerce growth is a factor that will sustain PayPal’s growth and strengthen its network effect at the same time. Anyway, to understand whether the 17% revenue growth rate implied in analysts’ estimates makes sense, I gave a look at industry trends. E-commerce growth is to PayPal what food is to humans. So the most obvious thing to do is compare the company’s growth rates to those of the e-commerce industry.Between 2014 and 2016, PayPal’s revenue grew at a 21.9% annual growth rate in the United States, and at a 16.23% rate on a global basis.Source: Author's elaborationIn the same period, e-commerce grew at a 15% rate in the United States and between 18% and 24% on a global basis, according to different estimates.There are some important considerations to be made in this regard. First, it’s evident that PayPal’s growth in the United States is significantly higher than the overall e-commerce growth rate. PayPal is evidently gaining mindshare (and market share) among consumers as a preferred payment method. This is even more evident if we consider that a large part of the e-commerce growth in the United States has been a result of Amazon’s growth, which doesn’t accept PayPal as a payment method.Another important consideration is that on a global basis, PayPal seems to be still lagging the overall e-commerce growth, which means it’s not increasing its market share among payment methods or not increasing it significantly once Amazon is factored out.Now, if we consider that the e-commerce growth rate in the U.S. is actually accelerating (see table below) and that on a global basis the CAGR is expected to be around 20% for the next 4-5 years, the 17% CAGR that analysts are forecasting seems to be fair, leaving little room for disappointment.Source: census.govAlthough these good growth prospects seem to be already priced into the stock, there are some sources of growth optionality that can make PayPal investment case more compelling.The first is related to Venmo, a P2P payment platform that includes social media features. Despite the fast growth of the last few years, the division can offer some good growth optionality that is not fully priced in the stock at these levels. The main concern about Venmo is related to competition from Zelle, a P2P service backed by banks and credit unions, including a few large ones. I am more positive on Venmo compared to many analysts as I think Venmo’s social network features create a network effect that, together with the first-mover advantage and leading position in the millennial segment, will likely translate into a long-term competitive advantage. This is how Venmo is growing:Source: Author's elaborationAnother growth option that is not currently on the table but that may arise in the next few years is related to Amazon. We know that Amazon doesn’t accept PayPal on its platform. In the past, the company’s representatives justified this decision with an apparent “lack of interest” from Amazon’s customers in PayPal as a method of payment. This is a lie or, if you prefer, a nonsense, while the reality is that Amazon has tried to defend its Amazon Pay service from PayPal, even if the e-commerce giant’s payment system is almost irrelevant if we exclude the Amazon platform.Let’s consider that Amazon accounts for almost half of online retail sales in the U.S. and accounted for more than half of sales growth in 2016. If PayPal managed to enter the Amazon segment, the actual growth rate would probably be not even comparable to analysts’ estimates. As a result, the stock would be an easy double in the short-medium term. This is not very likely to happen soon, as Amazon will try to make a few more bucks or cents on third-party transactions to compensate the large and growing losses in its direct selling business. In any case, as PayPal continues to grow, it may become increasingly difficult to ignore it.In general, I still have a positive view of PayPal even at the current levels, as the business is solid, largely profitable and protected by a strong network effect. The growth prospects implied in the analysts’ expectations seem to be achievable by the company’s current core business, while some growth options may arise in the future. Divisions such as Venmo and Xoom definitely have room to grow and monetize better, and some additional growth may come from the possible, although currently improbable, expansion of PayPal into Amazon.The main risks I see at the moment are the following:Thanks for taking the time to read this article.

4115382,103480,2017-10-23T07:48:43-04:00,"PayPal has experienced massive growth in recent years, particularly driven by P2P transaction volumes on its Venmo platform.It is the leader in payment processing, with $114 billion in total payment volume processed in Q3, up 30% y/y.The company has just recently begun to monetize Venmo, with its Venmo for Merchants offering taking transaction fees similar to PayPal’s existing merchant processing solutions.With both revenues and cash flows up double digits, PayPal has significant fundamental support as well as a wide moat to give investors confidence in its rising stock price.","By now PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) has become a household name, and among millennials, Venmo (which many are unaware is owned by PayPal) has become the default way to transfer money between friends. Since PayPal’s spin-off from eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) in 2014, the company has done exceptionally well standalone, with its $85 billion market cap now twice that of eBay’s (eBay had originally purchased PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion).PYPL data by YChartsDespite a ~70% year-to-date run, PayPal still carries massive opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on the shifting trends toward digital payments. The company processed $354 billion of payments in 2016 (this figure is tracking to ~30% growth in 2017), and its major growth vehicle, Venmo, only comprises about a tenth of this payments volume and is just starting to become monetized.While PYPL is a flashy technology stock that seems to defy standard valuations, recall that the company is generating $2.5 billion of free cash flows, is projected to grow revenues at 20%, and capture significant operating leverage and expand profits as it seeks new monetization avenues for Venmo and its other assets. It has the unique position of being entrenched into the digital payments ecosystem through its flagship PayPal platform, while also having newer, faster-growing subsidiaries in Venmo and Xoom to drive growth. With its technology leadership in the payments space undisputed, PayPal will remain the market leader for a long time to come.The company just reported results for Q3 that defied analyst expectations - with revenue, total payment volumes, and earnings all beating consensus. With its fundamentals affirmed, this is a good time to go long.A quick overview for the unfamiliar: PayPal basically pioneered the idea of peer-to-peer transfers, bypassing the necessity of bank wires or cash transactions. It was founded as a merger of two payments startups, and counts Tesla's (NASDAQ: TSLA) Elon Musk as one of its co-founders. Shortly thereafter, the company went public and was almost immediately snapped up by eBay for $1.5 billion.In its earlier days, PayPal was probably best known for facilitating payments between buyers and sellers on eBay, back when the online auction site was still the biggest game in e-commerce - a distinction that has been waning for years now, especially with its latest dismal earnings release. PayPal's ease of use led to a ballooning of its popularity, however, and it grew to over one hundred million users quickly and operated largely independent of eBay. In 2014, it was spun off as a separate company in mid-2015. Since the spin-off, eBay's value has nearly doubled, with a majority of those gains occurring this year:PYPL data by YChartsThe following infographic, taken from PayPal's 2016 10-K, offers good insight into the scale of its platform and key metrics:Figure 1. PayPal key metricsPayPal also has two key subsidiaries, Venmo and Xoom, the latter of which is focused on international transfers (the company takes fees on foreign currency exchange). P2P transfers are always free (except for expedited transfers), but merchants who want to use a PayPal platform to accept customer payments pay fees, which form the bulk of its revenue.Venmo is still a small part of PayPal's base - in Q3, it provided $9 billion of its total $114 billion TPV (total payment volumes). But Venmo is growing volumes at 93% y/y, versus PayPal overall which is growing transaction volumes at roughly 25-30%.Users typically don't understand how Venmo makes money, as P2P transfers are always free, and up until recently in October, it remained largely without a monetization base.In October, it rolled out ""Venmo for Merchants"" to 2 million merchants, allowing them to accept payments straight from a user's Venmo account, which can be drawn directly from their linked bank balances or from the cash sitting in their account.The list of big name merchants that use Venmo for Business includes the following (taken from Venmo's website):Figure 2. Venmo for Merchants, anchor clientsIn addition to supporting merchant processing for the first time, Venmo also announced an ""expedited transfer"" service - in which it can clear a transaction in fewer than the 2-3 standard business days for a $0.25 fee. Venmo believes this is ultra-competitive against other P2P platforms which charge a 1% fee, so it offers cost savings on instant transfers larger than $25.Though $0.25 is only a token fee, the sheer volumes that Venmo processes could turn this feature into a meaningful contribution for PayPal's top line.Q3 was a big quarter for PayPal. The company reported $3.24 billion of revenues, representing 21% y/y growth and an acceleration over Q2's y/y growth rate of 18%.Figure 3. PayPal Q3 resultsGrowth acceleration - especially at PayPal's scale, when it is already churning out more than $10 billion in annual revenues - is a prize for investors, so it's no surprise that shares skyrocketed after the earnings release. Analysts had only expected $3.18 billion in revenues.Core payments metrics also trended well, with TPV up 30% y/y to $114 billion. TPV, like revenue, showed tremendous acceleration over Q2's 23% y/y growth.The company has been fortuitous in its decision to drive product development and management focus on mobile payments - through both PayPal as well as Venmo - as mobile transaction volumes grew 54%, outstripping TPV growth in PayPal overall. Venmo itself processed $9 billion of TPV in Q3, still a small 8% of PayPal's total payment processing volume, but its TPV grew an outstanding 93% y/y.PayPal ended the quarter with 218 million active accounts (up from 197 million accounts at the end of FY16) and processed 1.9 billion total transactions, up 26% y/y. Its user base also showed increased engagement, as the company disclosed that the average user completed 32.8 transactions over twelve months, with this average up 9% y/y. See the growth of the company's platform metrics below, taken from its earnings release:Figure 4. PayPal key metrics, quarterly growthPayPal didn't disappoint on the profitability spectrum either - GAAP EPS grew 17% y/y to $0.31, and pro forma EPS grew 31% to $0.46, beating analyst consensus calling for $0.43.The company also generated $841 million of FCF, up 36% y/y. It has delivered $2.2 billion of FCF in the nine months year to date, up 29% y/y. At this rate, PayPal is well on track to deliver ~$3.25 billion in FCF this year, valuing the company at a 26x multiple to its FY17 free cash flow - still a cheap valuation when factoring in its superior growth profile.Figure 5. PayPal free cash flowSo we've established that PayPal's business is humming along nicely and growing in the double digits. What can take its growth into the next leg?The name of the game going forward is continuing to acquire more merchants into the fold. Venmo for Merchants will help significantly in this regard - while it offers a service that's essentially identical to PayPal's merchant processing solutions, Venmo's user base of millennials is valuable to merchants and opens the door for PayPal to acquire merchants it couldn't previously.The already strong tailwinds that are driving more online transactions, and the use of PayPal to execute those transactions, is another major growth driver for the company.Trading at a ~26x EV/FCF multiple, PayPal's valuation remains undemanding, especially when its growth trajectory is virtually assured.PYPL EV to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsThe best long-term investments are supported by market-leading companies playing in sectors that benefit from secular tailwinds. With the PayPal/Venmo combination as the undisputed leader in transaction processing, and with huge amounts of transaction volumes going digital, PayPal makes for a uniquely strategic portfolio choice."

In after-hours trading, the stock shot up another +4%, more than offsetting the cumulative losses of the week and pushing the price up an impressive +72% for the trailing 52-week period.Credit: MarketWatchRevenues of $3.24 billion topped consensus by $60 million, the widest beat margin since the 2015 eBay (EBAY) split, and represented accelerating top-line growth of 22% ex-FX impact. Operating metrics also looked robust, with TPV (total payment volume) of $114 billion well above consensus of $109.1 billion. The +88% increase in active customer accounts is better than last quarter's +80%, with total payment transaction increase of +26% picking up the pace sequentially. Venmo also seems to have contributed substantially to the strong performance, with TPV growing +93% to $9 billion and accounting for 5% tailwind to total company's volume growth. Not surprisingly, however, the take rate (revenues divided by TPV) dipped noticeably YOY, to 2.84% this time from 3.05% in 3Q16.Farther down the P&L, transaction expenses seemed rather rich, growing at a faster pace than revenues. But virtually every non-transaction cost above the operating profit line remained under check, helping PayPal use operating leverage (a.k.a. scale) to deliver a non-GAAP operating margin improvement of 150 bps. I expect this improving trend to continue in the long run, as the company continues to build up its user network.See my summarized P&L below.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsPYPL has been on a wild ride lately. Not a roller-coaster, but a rocket one.Valuations, as measured by forward earnings, have shot up by about 10 turns compared to the same period last year to lead the credit and payment services space in this category at a P/E of 38.1x (see graph below). On a forward PEG basis, the stock is also the most richly valued within the peer group, at 2.2x. In spite of the recent stock price run, PYPL continues to be a Wall Street darling, with 70% of sell-side analysts maintaining a Buy or Strong Buy rating on the name.PYPL P/E Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThis is my first time covering PYPL, and I will not attempt to make a definitive statement regarding the appeal of owning the stock without further due diligence - i.e., take my views with a grain of salt. But what I have seen so far is promising, to say the least.My first impression is that the elevated stock price may be a reflection of the higher quality of the business and the company's growth prospects, which seemed understated to me at first (+18% long-term EPS expectations, trailing MasterCard and on par with Visa). The San Jose-based company, with its tech DNA, seems to be one of the best positioned to benefit from the boost in e-commerce and peer-to-peer payments, despite the natural and expected increase in competition that could put some pressure on the take rate - including from incumbent platforms, like Apple Pay (AAPL) and others.With sector-wide trends looking favorable and following a strong 3Q17 beat, PYPL seems to be an interesting GARP (growth at a reasonable price) play worth investigating further.Note from the author: if you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow DM Martins Research.

4106200,103373,2017-09-12T14:20:37-04:00,PayPal keeps notching up 20%-plus growth numbers quarter after quarter.What are the key drivers of this phenomenal growth in a mature industry?What metrics suggest that PayPal’s growth is not a flash in the pan?,"PayPal’s (PYPL) growth has been phenomenal in the last few years as the company continues to notch up 20% growth quarter after quarter. What are the key drivers of this growth? What forward-looking areas has PayPal latched onto that will support a prolonged period of YoY growth? Is this a good time to invest in this payments company that is still a relative newbie in a world of lumbering giants that are still growing? What makes PayPal’s growth phenomenal is that, despite being a new entrant to the payments processing industry and being pitted against formidable and well-established players, PayPal did a lot better than Visa (V) in terms of revenue increase over the last five years. Between 2012 and 2016, PayPal added $5,180 million to its top line, compared to Visa’s $4,661 million and MasterCard’s (MA) $3,385 million. Source: PayPal Q2-17 Earnings Slides This industry topping revenue increase in the last five years was no stroke of good luck, and there is one metric that clearly shows that PayPal’s moat is steadily widening, and that it will keep the company in the lead for many more years to come: PayPal’s merchant services. By the end of the first quarter of 2016, PayPal had 14 million merchant accounts, which grew to 17 million by the end of the recently concluded second quarter of 2017. The three million additions in merchant accounts has resulted in a nearly $25 billion increase total payment volume. Though the number of active customer accounts keeps increasing as well, the truth is that most of the payment volume growth is actually coming from merchant services. As you can see from the graph above, from accounting for 80% of Total Payment Volume during the third quarter of 2015, merchant services now account for 86% of the company’s total payment volume. The metric also shows that merchants have been increasing their engagement with PayPal. It could be due to several factors, such as increased trust, PayPal continually adding more services and more customers, and so on. During the first quarter of 2016, PayPal’s total payment volume was $81 billion, with 82% - or $66.4 billion - contributed by merchant services. During the second quarter of 2017, PayPal’s TPV was $106 billion, with 86% - or $91 billion - contributed by merchant services. In other words, during Q1-16, 14 million merchant accounts led to a TPV of $66.4 billion, and several quarters later, in Q2-17, 17 million merchant accounts led to a TPV of $91 billion. Additionally, the fact that average payment volume per account increased from approximately $4,773 to $5,353 during this period further validates increased engagement, with merchants transacting a lot more now than they did six quarters ago. The other important factor to consider is PayPal’s cross-border trade. According to PayPal, 22% of its TPV is due to cross-border trade. That’s more than one-fifth of merchant services TPV coming through due to cross border trade. This was the opening in the payments market that PayPal has made use of, thanks to eBay, and now, the company is sitting pretty with 17 million merchant accounts and nearly 10 million merchants engaging in cross border sales. Source: PayPalThe combination of merchant accounts, ably supported by cross-border trade, is a wide moat that will be extremely hard for its competitors to break. These customers who are already using the PayPal platform are not going to switch services that easily unless the competitor’s offering brings some tangible additional benefits. And that’s easier said than done, because PayPal will move swiftly to negate any incremental benefits its competition puts out. PayPal knows that this moat will keep its ship moving steadily forward, and the company has been smartly adding service after service - Venmo (Digital Wallet), Xoom (Money Transfer/Remittance), TIO (Bill Payment and Financial Services) - with an aim to add more customers to its platform, which will make the platform even more attractive for current merchants and also draw new merchants into the fold. The growth of e-commerce already has shrunk global markets, and it will continue to connect merchants and customers all over the world. PayPal has made it extremely easy for merchants and customers to conduct their trade in a transparent manner, and the company has earned their trust. The more services PayPal adds to its repertoire, the more customers it will bring under its umbrella, increasing the opportunity for merchants to grow their average transactions and making the platform extremely attractive for even more merchants to keep signing up.It’s a self-feeding cycle that PayPal has been constructing over the past several years, and that’s going to fuel the company’s growth over the next decade at least. With such a long growth runway and a robust ecosystem of products to keep customers and merchants coming in and coming back, this is one of the better investment opportunities in the payments industry."
4112067,23998,2017-10-06T10:18:03-04:00,"With PayPal in the news Thursday, thanks to the expansion of its partnership with MasterCard, we revisit one of our subscriber hedged portfolios featuring PayPal from August.We review the performance of that portfolio so far, focusing on PayPal and its hedge.We close by noting how this portfolio has generated competitive returns so far despite taking on much less risk than the market.","The PayPal Alumni Who Dominate Silicon ValleyWith PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) announcing an expansion of their partnership on Thursday, we were reminded that PayPal featured in another of the hedged portfolios we presented to Bulletproof Investing subscribers in August. Here we update the performance of that portfolio, with a focus on PayPal and its hedge.Each week, we present three portfolios to our subscribers. One is the $100,000 portfolio with the highest ratio of potential upside to potential downside, another is the highest ratio $1,000,000 portfolio, and then we present a $1,000,000 portfolio comprised of our top names. This was the $1,000,000 with the highest ratio of potential upside to potential downside. The idea here was for an individual to hold a concentrated portfolio designed to maximize his potential upside while strictly limiting his downside risk to a drawdown of no more than 7%. This is what Portfolio Armor presented us with, given those parameters:In addition to PayPal, the site included Boeing (NYSE:BA), FMC (NYSE:FMC), IPG Photonics (NASDAQ:IPGP), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), Unilever Plc (NYSE:UL), and Unilever NV (NYSE:UN) as primary securities, based on their net potential returns. The site attempted to allocate roughly equal dollar amounts to each of those names, but rounded down the dollar amounts to make sure it had round lots of each stock.In its fine-tuning step, it selected Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to absorb as much of the remaining cash as possible. That's what ""cash substitute"" refers to in the portfolio: it doesn't mean this is a cash equivalent (of course, it's not); it means it's a security that when collared according to your risk tolerance with a tight cap (the site uses 1% or the current money market seven-day yield, whichever is higher) has a potential return greater than the current money market rate. The point is to minimize your cash level because cash offers negligible returns and, because each position in your portfolio is strictly hedged, you don't need cash to ameliorate your risk.Note that each of the underlying securities was hedged. On our website, each of the ""+"" signs in a portfolio can be clicked to expand the hedge. Here's a closer look at the hedge on PYPL:As you can see above, PayPal was hedged with an optimal or least expensive collar, while four of the other primary securities in the portfolio were hedged with optimal puts. The site tries hedging securities both ways, estimating the net potential return both ways, taking into account the historical incidence of outliers. Essentially, the lower hedging cost of collars is weighed against the chance for higher upside when hedging with puts. In PayPal's case, the collar won out.Recall in our hedged portfolio above, Portfolio Armor estimated a potential return of 19.47% for PayPal over the time frame of the hedge (which expires in late January). It's been a little less than two months since the portfolio was created, but so far, PayPal has gained about 69% of our potential return estimate.First, let's look at the current quotes on the options in PYPL's hedge above, then work out how it has done since, taking into account the hedge. Here's the relevant part of the option chain for PYPL via Fidelity:The columns we're concerned with there are the ones labeled Bid, Ask, and Strike. The way we value options when tracking performance is to use the intrinsic value or the midpoint of the bid-ask price, whichever is lower (we don't use last price since options often don't trade every day and the last price can sometimes be unrepresentative of what you'd be able to buy or sell the option for now).Recall that the call option in our PYPL collar hedge was the $70 strike one. Since PYPL closed at $65.82 on Thursday, the intrinsic value of that option was $0. On the bottom left of the image above, you can see it has a bid price of $1.92 and an ask price of $2.07. So we value this at $1.995, and since we had 21 contracts covering 2,100 shares, the call position as of Tuesday would have cost about $4,189.50 to buy-to-close.The put option in our hedge was the $57.50 strike one, which you can see at the top right of the excerpted option chain. Since PYPL closed above that on Thursday, that put had an intrinsic value of $0, so we value it at the midpoint between its bid price of $0.95 and its ask of $1.07, which is $1.01. And since we had 21 contracts covering 2,100 shares, that comes out to $2,121.In general, the value of a hedged position equals the value of the underlying security, plus the value of the put options you own on it, minus the value of the call options you're short on it (if any). So the value of the PYPL position in our portfolio, as of August 10th, was $121,842 (2,100 shares @ $58.02) + $8,190 - $1,701 = $121,765.And the value as of Thursday was $138,222 (2,100 shares @ $65.82) + $2,121 - $4,189.50 = $136,153.50.$136,153.50 represents an 11.8% gain from $121,765. Not as good as PYPL's 13.5% return unhedged over the same period, but better than a sharp stick in the eye. And, unlike holding PYPL unhedged, the maximum downside risk for this position is a decline of 7% from the starting value.As you can see, this is a bit tedious to calculate manually, so we've created an automated tool to track performance in hedged portfolios. Let's use it see how this portfolio has done since.Here's how the entire portfolio has performed since August 10th:The portfolio as a whole was up 4.35% as of Thursday, net of hedging cost and opening trading fees for all positions. Over the same period, the market, as represented by the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY), was up 4.47%.Note, though, that SPY and this portfolio don't start at the same dollar amount on the left side of the graph. SPY starts at $1,000,000, but this portfolio starts at $997,739.50. Our portfolio starts $2,260.50 in the hole, due primarily to our assumption that we enter each option position at the worst end of its spread. As one of our Marketplace colleagues commented to us recently, this is a very conservative assumption.Although this portfolio is lagging the market slightly so far, it is nevertheless generating a competitive return, and doing so with far less risk. In a worst case scenario - if another 2008-style crash happens over the next several months - an SPY position might be down 40% or more. In that scenario, the PayPal hedged portfolio shown here would be down 6.66% at most. You have a shot at decent returns when the market is doing well, and you won't lose much when it's not. Heads you win, tails you don't lose too much."
4103461,103561,2017-08-31T16:13:19-04:00,PYPL's focus on strategic partnerships has allowed the firm to reduce competitive risk and drive up revenue growth.PYPL's emphasis on its mobile segment should allow the company to benefit greatly from the m-commerce trend.The firm's plans to monetize Venmo are expected to be an important growth driver in the coming years.,"Due to its ability to enhance network effect, capitalize on the accelerating m-commerce trend, and develop new revenue streams, I believe PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a company with great upside potential. The company is well-positioned in the market, considering its business qualities, financial health, historical growth, and potential growth drivers.PYPL’s two most distinctive competitive advantages lie in its sound security system and first-mover advantage. With 15 million transactions per day and more than $200 billion total payment volume (TPV) annually, PYPL has maintained losses within 27-31 bps of TPV, the lowest among the industry. The company utilizes artificial intelligence technology to review patterns of likely frauds from its customer data base, thus spotting potential fraudulent purchases. Since PYPL is one of the largest digital payment companies in the world, the company has a larger customer data base than its competitors that allows it to detect more fraud patterns.As a pioneer in the global digital payment industry, PYPL enjoys first-mover advantage. While this isn’t necessarily a sustainable competitive edge, it has allowed PYPL to develop competitive edges such as network effect. For instance, as of 2017 Q2, PYPL reached 210 million customer accounts and 17 million retailer accounts. This large size of customer base and merchant coverage has prompted more retailers and individuals to join PYPL, thus creating an economic moat hard for competitors to replicate. Furthermore, operating in more than 200 markets, PYPL has overcome regulation issues in 200+ countries and regions and countless financial institutions over the years. As handling regulatory requests is extremely time-consuming, this also serves as one of PYPL’s strongest competitive edges.With more than 85% of global customer transactions involving cash and a $100+ trillion total addressable market according to PYPL, the digital payment industry has enormous growth potential. The fast-growing industry grew 19% in 2016 ($2,221 billion total transaction value in 2016) and is expected to grow 15% annually by total transaction value from 2017 to 2021. The huge market potential within the industry is expected to increase cutthroat competition and thus lower margins, with global firms such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Square (NYSE:SQ) expected to attract more digital transactions worldwide. Going forward, adoption of mobile commerce and mobile payments is expected to be the main growth driver of the industry as smartphone penetration rate in mature and emerging markets continues to increase. M-commerce accounted for 11.6% of U.S. e-commerce in 2016 and is forecast to reach $284 billion, or 45% of the total U.S. e-commerce market in three years.PYPL’s management team focuses on expanding PYPL's ubiquity and value of the PayPal brand through partnerships and new enhancements. The company has announced a number of partnership deals with competitors such as Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), and Apple in recent years to expand their market reach and provide existing users with more options. As a result, customer adoption, measured by active customer account growth, and user engagement, measured by payment transactions per active account, have both increased (Exhibit 1). PYPL managed to grow 6.6% in active customer accounts and 3.9% in payment transactions per active account in the first half of 2017, compared to 10% and 13% in 2016.Exhibit 1. Active customer account growth ($mlns): 2014-2017 Q2Source: PYPL analysts’ dayFurthermore, PYPL focuses on developing new enhancements to increase customer engagement. For instance, One Touch has been driving customer engagement and improving PYPL’s mobile performance by creating frictionless buying experience for buyers. As of 2017 Q2, over 60 million customer accounts and 5.5 million merchants opted in One Touch; payment volume from mobile devices increased 50% year over year, accounting for 34% of TPV ($36 billion). Other enhancements include PayPal Credit, which increases customer engagement and spend, and PayPal Working Capital, which drives merchant engagement and processing value. By extending the company’s market reach and deepening market penetration, PYPL has enhanced its powerful network effect.PYPL also strives to develop new revenue streams and diversify its business. For instance, the company acquired Xoom in late-2015 to explore cross-sell opportunities and expand its global customer base.PYPL’s GAAP operating margin has declined in recent quarters (Exhibit 2). In 2017 Q1, the company’s margin was 14.5%, down 150 bps year over year; in 2017 Q2, operating margin was 13.7%, down 30 bps from last year. Margin decline was due to a couple of reasons. For one thing, Xoom, PYPL’s online international money transfer service the company acquired in November 2015, is not yet profitable. Substantial growth in Braintree, PYPL’s subsidiary that focuses on mobile and web payment services for merchants, also contributed to lower margins with its low take rate and high transaction costs. Lastly, PYPL’s focus on strategic partnership to reduce competitive risk contributed to margin compression due to an increase in transaction expenses (Exhibit 3).Exhibit 2. GAAP Operation margin: 2014-2017 Q2Source: PYPL annual reportExhibit 3. Transaction margin: 2015 Q3 to 2017 Q2Source: PYPL annual reportPYPL’s profitability can be further analyzed using DuPont analysis in the following.Source: FactSetAs can be observed, though PYPL’s ROE has remained in the range of 10-11%, it has been on a downtrend since 2016 mainly due to a decreasing ROA. If we break down ROA into two parts as ROA = Net profit margin * Asset turnover, it appears that this decrease is a result of decreasing margins, as asset turnover has been stable over the quarters.Source: FactSetIn terms of balance sheet, PYPL reduced all debt in 2015 Q3 and currently has zero debt. The main source of PYPL’s liability are funds payable and amounts due to customers.PYPL’s performance in revenue and EPS growth have both exceeded that of the industry in the past four years. The digital payment giant’s revenue maintained a growth rate of approximately 18% from 2013 to 2016 on a currency-neutral basis while growing 14.7% and 16.9% in the first and second quarter of 2017, respectively. The company also enjoyed high single-digit EPS growth in 2016 while generating EPS growth of 6.7% (Q1) and 25.9% (Q2) in 2017. This outperformance was primarily driven by growth in TPV, which grew by 26% in 2016 to $354 billion, 22.5% in 2017 Q1, and 23.5% in 2017 Q2. TPV increased mainly due to PYPL’s continuing expansion and deepening market penetration.Exhibit 4. Revenue and revenue growth compared to the industrySource: FactSetExhibit 5. EPS and EPS growth compared to the industrySource: FactSetFCF margin has remained within 20-24% in recent quarters, generating approximately 20 cents of FCF for every dollar of revenue earned. The firm generated $2.5 billion in FCF in 2016, a 36%, or $665 million increase from the previous year. The increase in FCF during this period was mostly driven by higher cash generated from operating activities. The firm generated $603 million in FCF in 2017 Q1 and $747 million in Q2. PYPL’s ability to consistently generate strong cash flows has allowed the company to return large amounts of cash to shareholders. The company announced a $5 billion share repurchase plan in 2017 Q1 which will be effective after the completion of the previous $2 billion repurchase plan.Exhibit 6. FCF and FCF margin compared to the industrySource: FactSet As the world moves towards a cashless society, the digital payment industry enjoys an enormous growth potential that accounts for $100+ trillion total addressable market. PYPL, with its strong network effect and constantly increasing new enhancements, creates stickiness for its users and retailers. Thus, the company is expected to profit greatly from this global trend.Additionally, PYPL has also been actively developing its mobile payment and mobile commerce segments in response to the upcoming m-commerce explosion. In terms of mobile payment, there is Venmo, the firm’s P2P payment platform, which has surged in popularity by incorporating social media features. The platform has enjoyed substantial growth in recent quarters, processing $6.8 billion in 2017 Q1, a 113% increase from the previous year, and $8 billion in 2017 Q2, a 103% increase year over year. Going forward, as the shift to mobile payments continues, Venmo is expected to maintain its high growth rate.Though Venmo's take rate is currently low due to its lack of monetization, PYPL has announced its plans to capitalize on the platform. The firm plans to expand Pay with Venmo, the app that allows users to make purchases at retail stores using Venmo, by the end of 2017. PYPL anticipates Pay with Venmo to be available at millions of retailers, which will give a serious boost to the company’s revenue growth.As for mobile commerce, PYPL focuses on Braintree. Braintree has helped a number of popular apps (e.g. Uber, Airbnb, StubHub) develop their payment gateways as growth in mobile payments spiked in recent years. The business segment currently processes over 1 billion transactions quarterly and has over 269 million Braintree cards on file as of 2016 Q1, a 108% increase from last year. In addition, TPV exceeded $50 billion in 2015, which is more than double than the $23 billion in 2014. The platform is expected to experience substantial growth as the mobile payment trend continues its acceleration, prompting more merchants to seek for payment solutions.Though investors may be intrigued by PYPL’s growth prospects, there are also risks that should be taken into consideration, such as competitive risk, foreign exchange risk, and regulatory risk.Although the global payment industry is still far from saturated, it is rapidly evolving and highly innovative, which may affect the competitive landscape negatively for PYPL. For instance, the shift from e-commerce to m-commerce has opened doors to established technology companies such as Apple, Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), etc. In 2016, Apple Pay grew new accounts by 200% compared to PYPL’s 10%, while transactions increased 500% year over year in Q4. The technology giant’s renowned product, iPhone, has an estimated total installed base around 400 million, suggesting a huge potential customer base. As time moves forward, more financial and technology competitors may develop digital payment solutions that have similar functions to PYPL, intruding PYPL’s competency and lowering margins.PYPL is also subject to foreign exchange risk as it operates in 200+ markets across the globe and has 47% of its revenue exposure in non-U.S. regions. The fluctuation of the U.S. dollar value versus currencies such as the British Pound and Euro impacts the translation of net revenues into the U.S. dollar. Additionally, cross-border trade, which generally provides higher margins than similar transactions that take place within a single market, is also subject to foreign exchange risk. While PYPL strives to hedge portions of its foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure, it is impossible to eliminate these effects completely.Lastly, PYPL’s business is subject to regulations and policies and legal interpretations in the markets in which the company operates. As the payment industry grows, this may result in increased regulatory oversight and tighter enforcement of regulations that apply to PYPL. Also, as PYPL expands and localizes their international activities, the firm will be obligated to comply with the laws of more nations and markets.PYPL has an impressive earnings beat track record, exceeding analysts’ estimation every quarter since its separation from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2015. That said, the company had two dips during last year while beating estimates. The first dip took place in 2016 Q2, when PYPL announced partnership news with Visa, raising investors’ concerns of lower transaction margins. Stock price dipped again later in 2016 Q4, this time because though PYPL’s performance was in line with average estimations, it was on the lower side of analyst expectations.PYPL performed especially well in the first half of 2017, beating sales and earnings targets in both quarters while also announcing news of partnership deals with companies such as Apple, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Citi (NYSE:C), and Chase. This outperformance has prompted analysts to revise earnings estimation for future quarters upward and also drove up PYPL’s stock price. EPS target for 2017 Q3 increased from $0.41 to $0.43, while the target for 2017 Q4 was revised to $0.51 from $0.49. Stock price has appreciated 52% year to date.Exhibit 7. Earnings surprise track recordSource: FactSetThe 10-year DCF valuation indicates that PYPL’s intrinsic value is $100.2, suggesting a 61% upside potential. Revenue growth is projected to be in the range of 16-17.5% in the next three years and then start to decrease gradually. Such projection is based on the growth potential of Braintree and Venmo’s monetization, which is anticipated to have a larger impact in 2018 and 2019. In addition, as the mobile payment trend expands, PYPL’s popular enhancement One Touch is also expected boost the company’s TPV greatly as consumers and merchants seek for payment solutions that solve friction problems.PYPL’s operation margin is forecast to decline over the years, from 14.6% in 2016 to 12.5%, on the basis of the company’s focus on strategic partnerships. Tax rate is projected by averaging the value of the past two years. For the WACC calculation, key inputs are as the following: a tax rate of 16%, PYPL’s beta 1.18, risk-free rate 2.13%, cost of equity 8.76%, and cost of debt 0% since PYPL has no debt.Exhibit 8. DCF valuationExhibit 9 shows PYPL’s relative value compared to its major competitors and the industry. Relative to its peers and the industry, PYPL trades at a premium based on forward PE and is considered fairly valued based on forward PEG. The company's PE ratio translates into a projected earnings growth (22.7%) higher than its peers (Visa: 20.4%, Mastercard: 16.7%, and Apple: 8.4%). The company’s forward PEG translates into an expected growth rate of 19.5% for the next 12 months, which is slightly above PYPL’s own estimation (17-19% in 2017) but reasonable when considering the expected impact of Venmo’s monetization in the next two years.Exhibit 9. Valuation multiples compared to peers and industrySource: FactSetUpon reviewing PYPL’s competitive edges, financial health, historical performance relative to the industry, growth drivers ahead, and impressive earnings surprise track record, the DCF model sets PYPL’s target price at $100, providing a 61% upside."

4103591,23998,2017-09-01T09:55:19-04:00,"A couple of recent articles have been bullish on PayPal. As we note, it's interesting to see one of the 90s Dot-Com stars shining again today.Interesting, but not surprising: PayPal was one of our top names last month, and is again now.We elaborate, and show a few ways to hedge in the event our current bullishness on PayPal ends up being wrong.","PayPal (PYPL) was essentially the Fairchild Semiconductor of the Dot-Com boom, spawning the so-called ""PayPal Mafia"" of alumni (pictured above) who went on to found other companies such as Tesla (TSLA) and Yelp (YELP), so it's interesting to see recent bullish articles on it, such as those by I-Shiuan Lin and Matt Levinson.Interesting, but not surprising to us, as PayPal was one of BulletProof Investing's top names on August 3rd, and again on August 31st. Here we'll explain why PayPal is ranked so highly by our system now, and how longs can protect themselves if our bullishness ends up being wrong. First, we'll take a quick look at how PayPal has done since it appeared in our top names on August 3rd.Since PayPal appeared in our system's top 10 on August 3rd, it's up about 5.6%, versus about 0.2% for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). Bear in mind that positions in our portfolios are meant to be held for up to 6 months, so this is just an interim look at performance.A practice we started in a recent article, to avoid charges of cherry-picking, is to post the performance for all of our top names from the same date when mentioning one. So we'll do that here too. First, this was our entire top 10 as of August 3rd.And here's how they've done since.In a couple of previous articles, we mentioned how our system comes up with its potential return estimates. We'll recap that briefly here, for those who missed them, using PYPL as our example this time.Our system uses underlying price history as well as option sentiment to estimate potential returns for securities over the next six months. In a nutshell, we start with the assumption that any security is going to begin to revert to its long-term mean return, and we test that assumption by gauging the market for options expiring about six months out on the security. The gauge we use is to attempt to hedge the security against a greater-than-9% decline with an optimal, or least-expensive collar. For there to be an optimal collar available, a couple of conditions have to be met:We were describing this gauge of option sentiment to a hedge fund manager on Thursday and he called it a ""sanity check"" on the price momentum screen. That's a good way to put it.The screen capture below from Portfolio Armor's admin panel shows our system's take on PYPL as of Thursday's close.One key figure there is in the ""Adj. Exp Return"" column. That shows our system's potential return estimate for PYPL over the next 6 months, 29.6%. But the number that determines our overall ranking is in the ""Net Exp Return"" column, 23.8%. That's PYPL's potential return net of hedging cost.If our system's bullishness on PayPal over the next several months ends up being misplaced, here are a few ways you can limit your downside risk. For each of these examples, we'll assume you have 1,000 shares of PYPL and are willing to tolerate a drawdown of 15% over the next several months, but not a drawdown larger than that.Uncapped Upside, Higher CostAs of Thursday's close, these were the optimal puts to hedge 1,000 shares of PYPL against a greater-than-15% decline between now and late April.The cost of this protection was $2,450, or 3.97% of position value (calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts). The 15% decline threshold includes the 3.97% cost, so if you're hedged this way, you'd only be down 11.03%, not including the hedging cost, in a worst-case scenario.Capped Upside, Lower CostThis was the optimal collar, as of Thursday's close, to hedge 1,000 shares of PYPL against a greater-than-15% decline between now and late April while not capping your potential upside at less than 29.6% (our site's potential return estimate for PayPal).The put leg of this collar uses the same strike as in the first hedge, so the cost is the same: $2,450, or 3.97% of position value. But selling the call leg yields a credit of $630, or 1.02% of position value (calculated conservatively, using the bid price of the calls).So the net cost is $1,820, or 2.95% of position value, assuming you placed both trades at the worst end of their respective spreads.Capped Upside, Negative CostWe're including this third hedge because our site's potential return estimate for PYPL is much higher than that of Wall Street. Wall Street's consensus 12-month price target for PYPL (via Nasdaq, below) implies a low single-digit potential return by April.So for this hedge, we've used the highest cap we could while eliminating the positive hedging cost. That turned out to be a cap of 13%.As of Thursday's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 1,000 shares of PYPL against a greater-than-15% decline while not capping your potential upside at less than 13%.Note that our hedging algorithm was able to use a less expensive put strike in the context of this collar. The cost above was $1,840, or 2.98% of position value. The income generated from the short call leg was a bit higher though, $2,190, or 3.55% of position value.So the net cost here was negative, meaning you'd collect $350 when opening this hedge, assuming, again, you placed both trades at the worst end of their spreads. If you placed the trades within the bid-ask spread, you would have collected more than $350.Our system is bullish on PayPal based on underlying price action and option sentiment, while other Seeking Alpha contributors are bullish on it for fundamental reasons. It should be encouraging for bulls when technical and fundamental views align on a stock. Nevertheless, there's a chance both the technical and fundamental bulls on PayPal will be wrong. One of the hedges above may be worth considering, as insurance against that."
4103297,103602,2017-08-31T09:07:01-04:00,PayPal's stock has seen significant growth recently.PayPal still has many advantages over its competition that insulate it from both traditional payment companies and newcomers to the industry.PayPal has developed its business through acquisitions (e.g. Venmo) that position it well for the future.,"IntroductionPayPal (PYPL), perhaps the most well-known online payment company, has been on a tear recently. Its stock is up over 50% since the start of this year, and shows no signs of slowing down. For some investors, it may seem like PayPal does not have much more room to grow given its already commanding market share and brand strength around the world. However, PayPal does still has many opportunities for growth within the online payment industry available that should continue to help grow the stock price for investors.Fundamentals PayPal has seen impressive growth recently which means it is important to analyze it against industry peers to see whether it has become overvalued or not. While these numbers may strike some as too high to merit investment, PayPal’s fundamentals indicate a good value for the stock when compared with competitors. It does have a higher P/E than both Visa and MasterCard, but otherwise its fundamentals show it in a better light. Its PEG of 1.5 is right in line with both the 1.4 of Visa and the 1.8 of MasterCard. Also, PayPal also has a much lower P/B and P/S ratio than these two competitors. PayPal’s FCF yield also shows that it is generating similar levels of free cash flow (relatively) to Visa and MasterCard.Economic MoatOne of the fundamental reasons PayPal represents a good investment is its economic moat. This economic moat is composed of two important factors. The first is that the barrier to entry in the online payment industry is high. According to an analysis by Josh Beck of Pacific Coast, the complexity of PayPal’s e-commerce business model diminishes competition and increases the advantage PayPal has against newcomers because it is very difficult to build up the complex network required to run an online payment business. The second key factor is the brand awareness and trust that PayPal has built up over the years. Many people are nervous or have misgivings about making payments online which means they are wary about trusting companies with their personal financial data. However, PayPal has been around since 1998 and has steadily cultivated its brand name and image, so customers are more willing to trust it with their data and transactions than they would be with a newcomer to the industry. Another advantage that PayPal has is the benefits of the “network effect.” PayPal has over 210 million active users, according to a Statista report, which has made it a leader in the online payments market. Because of the visibility and popularity of the service, more and more retailers are adopting it as a payment method because of the ease and flexibility it offers customers. As more retailers implement PayPal, more customers will then be exposed to it and begin to use it themselves. The reinforcing nature of the network effect has given PayPal a sizeable advantage that continues to grow and help broaden PayPal’s reach with each passing day.Positioning for the FuturePayPal is not a company to rest on its laurels, and has been making sizeable developments to its business to keep pace with the changing online payments industry. Key acquisitions and technological innovation have helped position the company for the future. The two most important of these was the acquisition of Venmo in 2013 (as part of the larger acquisition of Braintree) and the development of the OneTouch.Venmo is projected to be a major revenue grower, according to Josh Beck, since it has seen 16 straight quarters of triple digit growth and saw over $8 billion in transactions. Venmo also has a strong advantage over competitors like Zelle. Venmo is the most well-known mobile payment app among millennials which is important because millennials are the most likely to use these types of payment methods. Since PayPal has been able to obliterate the competition with Venmo, it stands to benefit from this vital source of revenue.The other service that PayPal has adopted in response to this trend of mobile payments is OneTouch. OneTouch is designed to simplify and accelerate the online payment process by allowing users to enter their details only once. The mobile conversion rate has reached 87% in the last quarter, which was double the industry average of 44%. And only about 40 million accounts have opted in to the service out of the more than 200 million users which indicates there is significant growth available in the future.The importance of these two developments is that PayPal is establishing itself for the future. By doing this, the company is ensuring that it can continue to see user and revenue growth even as more traditional modes of payment are phased out for mobile payments.PartnershipsOne interesting thing that PayPal has been doing is entering into partnerships with other major companies, many of which are competitors. These companies can be divided into essentially two broad categories: credit card and other payment services and major online commerce companies.The first category includes heavyweights such as JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Chase, Citigroup (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and Discover Financial (NASDAQ:DISCA), Visa (NYSE:V), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). This strategy to partner with major payment companies is a smart long-term move for PayPal because it is making these potential competitors partners instead. This should boost revenue by generating more ways in which people can use PayPal.The second category of partnerships is more lucrative in the short term. PayPal has entered into agreements with giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). While the agreement with Baidu will probably have limited impact since it only allows PayPal to be used with merchants located outside of China, the Apple partnership is a major boost to revenue. The deal with Apple allows iTunes users in 12 countries to use PayPal to buy content. In the latest quarter, Apple saw revenues of $7.266 billion from the iTunes service which was an increase of 22% on Q3 revenue in 2016. Even though PayPal was not involved in all sales, it still has a massive opportunity to grow revenue with this partnership. RisksCompetitionThe competition in the online payment industry is fierce. Not only are traditional companies like Visa and MasterCard major players, but technology giants such as Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and even Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are trying to inch their way into the space. Other, completely novel payment methods like Bitcoin are also gaining traction. However, PayPal does not need to worry too much about this competition marginalizing its place within this industry. The first segment of competitors, the traditional companies, have entered into a wide array of partnerships with PayPal that ensure PayPal benefits from these companies rather than only losing revenue and customers The third segment of Bitcoin and other crypto-currencies are also not a major threat just because they are used by such a small percentage of the population (only 3% globally) that they cannot make a major impact on the industry.The second category, though, is the one that could cause the most concern. Companies like Amazon are well-known, highly-used businesses that have already disrupted many other industries. However, PayPal has enough of an advantage over these companies to avoid losing much revenue to them. Some companies have almost given up. Apple, which designed its own payment method (Apple Pay) entered into an agreement with PayPal to allow PayPal to be used on iTunes sales. While Apple Pay is still in use, this partnership underlines how many people use PayPal and how companies like Apple see a partnership as benefitting them more than if PayPal were excluded. Since PayPal also benefits more than if it were excluded, it sees rising revenues from more market exposure. Amazon, though, has not entered into any such agreement. It has developed a system called Amazon Payments that has recently seen explosive growth. According to a report from February, Amazon had over 33 million customers use the payment method and had seen both total payment volume double and the number of merchants accepting Amazon Payments increase by 120%. While this is certainly impressive growth, there is a major obstacle in Amazon’s way. CEO of PayPal, Dan Schulman, explained at the 2017 Bernstein’s Annual Strategic Decisions Conference how being a “neutral third party” is a significant advantage. Before, when PayPal was a part of eBay, many “merchants… though of eBay as a potential competitor, and therefore, were reluctant to put a payment scheme in that takes data and information that might somehow be shared with eBay.” Amazon is one of the biggest competitors for many companies in all types of industries. Therefore, merchants will probably not want to use a payment system that could give data to Amazon. This will mean that outside of a few select industries such as hotels or restaurants where Amazon has no position, there will be little incentive for merchants to implement Amazon Payments and thus little growth available. PayPal, meanwhile, as a neutral third party, will be able to continue to grow in all industries that use online payment systems because it is not a threat to merchants.ConclusionPayPal, a company with over 200 million customers, partnerships with a vast number of major companies, and a global reach, presents many reasons to buy for investors. Even though its stock has been rising this year, it still presents a significant growth opportunity to investors. PayPal has built up its competitive advantage and revenue streams and now stands ready to see steady growth into the long-term which should benefit investors for many years to come."
4098078,101421,2017-08-11T13:39:41-04:00,PayPal has agreed to acquire Swift Financial for an undisclosed sum.Swift has developed small business online lending services based on alternative and traditional credit evaluation criteria.The deal is part of PayPal's effort to ramp up its Working Capital unit to foster strategic lock-in for small business merchants.,"Quick TakeFinancial services technology company PayPal (PYPL) has announced an agreement to acquire small business financing company Swift Financial for an undisclosed amount.Swift provides business loan and short-term financing underwriting to small businesses.PayPal is acquiring Swift to bolster its Working Capital unit as a strategic move. It seeks to provide a range of financial services to small business merchants that help to solidify and deepen their relationship within PayPal’s platform.Target CompanyWilmington, Delaware-based Swift was founded in 2006 to streamline the process of providing cash advances and loans to small businesses in the U.S.Management is headed by founder and CEO Ed Harycki, who was previously director of business lending at MBNA America and founder and CEO of Accucard.Swift’s main offerings are two financial products:The company states that it has provided funding to over 20,000 businesses since inception.Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company disclosed the acquisition price or terms. PayPal did not file an 8-K that would have been required if the transaction had been a material amount, nor did it provide any change in forward financial guidance, so the transaction appears to be a non-material event.PayPal is acquiring Swift in order to build on its underwriting capabilities within its PayPal Working Capital unit that it launched in 2013.The two companies had previously worked together, so the deal likely has very low integration risk.PayPal wants to build its small business financing capabilities as a strategic imperative that assisted in retaining small merchants has customers for its payment processing and other services.As PayPal stated in the deal announcement,Swift provides additional underwriting data that can help PayPal ‘accelerate [its] efforts to democratize financial services,’ meaning, provide more loans to small businesses based on additional criteria that may be better than traditional credit evaluation.Since its launch in 2013, PayPal Working Capital has provided more than $3 billion in funding to 115,000 small businesses. Small business lending is proving to be a more lucrative aspect of online lending, especially when compared to consumer lending which has seen market turmoil in recent years through volatile peer-to-peer lending marketplaces.The addition of Swift should be a net positive for PayPal as it seeks to provide a wider range of financial services to enhance small business merchant lock-in to its platform.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, insider activity, and IPOs.

4102365,55512,2017-08-28T12:58:45-04:00,"PayPal recently reported excellent results.However, Bitcoin is also a remarkable ""digital money"" opportunity.We take a look at investing versus speculation with ""digital money""","I've recently been writing a lot about Bitcoin. That's brought my focus back on banks like Wells Fargo (WFC), but also credit card companies like Synchrony Financial (SYF) and American Express (AXP):This activity has also reminded me to review PayPal (PYPL) again. I'll take a look at PayPal as a possible investment right now. Then, I'll compare PayPal with Bitcoin for added depth.Brief Overview of PayPal EarningsOn July 27th PayPal reported with solid results:Furthermore...Earnings beat by $0.03 and revenue also beat by $50M (18.5% YoY). I was also surprised to see a huge increase in active customer accounts - 6.5 million active accounts with new additions up 80%. That's so big, it makes me think they are pulling a Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), creating fake accounts. And, I saw that transactions were up 23%.PayPal's Bigger Picture Beyond Moving Money AroundHere's a nice strategic overview of the results by Dan Schulman:Integrations and partnerships include tie-ups with Baidu (BIDU), JPMorgan (JPM), Visa (V), Apple (AAPL) and several others. These are big players with deep pockets getting into bed with PayPal. We're far beyond eBay (EBAY) at this point, deep into the financial circulatory system. They are making friends with the big guys.PayPal is also enjoying the relentless thrust of ""mobile first"" payments.Furthermore, there's still tremendous room for growth. Consider:I don't want to overreach but it's important to know that the ocean is big. As long as PayPal can tap into the opportunity, and they don't screw up, growth can almost happen automagically. It's really about catching the shift to digital commerce and digital money.PayPal Versus BitcoinPayPal is well positioned for growth. There's a tremendous tailwind pushing this company forward as the world moves from cash to bits and bytes.But, would it make more sense to invest in Bitcoin? After all, Bitcoin is a digital currency. Isn't that really what PayPal is all about? Let's peel away some layers of the onion.It's true. Bitcoin isn't widely accepted, but it's now starting to show up in the real world:What can you buy?There are other examples. The point is that it's slowly becoming real.That doesn't automatically mean we should put in our money. That's just one clue at the opportunity.Instead, we have to look here:Bitcoin has a market value of over $70B right now. It's been on a rampage.(That's why it's noteworthy, not because it's real or not real. People holding a lot of Bitcoin are getting rich.)Just looking at the first half of 2017:And while you can invest in Bitcoin directly (e.g., using Coinbase) you might simply wish to put money in the Grayscale Investment Trust (GBTC). There are good reasons for both, if you're looking to jump into the fire.That's really the bigger question. Should you put money into Bitcoin or PayPal?We already know that PayPal is a strong and growing business. We know that the stock has done well, too. Take a look at one year performance:Source: Seeking AlphaWhile the P/E is a bit rich for my blood, earnings are strong, and we're near a 52-week high. So, there's been a good opportunity for capital gains here.But, quite frankly, it's not the growth numbers that are grabbing my attention with Bitcoin or PayPal. It's not even the core fundamentals, in the normal sense. Instead it's something more profound.Investing in PayPal Versus Speculating with BitcoinFirst, I don't think that Bitcoin will go to zero. But, that doesn't mean it's a normal or regular investment, especially for conservative value-oriented investors. Instead, anyone putting money into Bitcoin has to accept that it's a speculation. Warren Buffett gives us insight on this topic:Like gold, you cannot fondle Bitcoin.We can debate if gold is an investment or not at another time. What matters here is that Bitcoin is like gold in that it doesn't produce anything. Therefore, almost by definition it's a speculation. As a speculation, it's not going to be an ""investment"" for a huge number of value-oriented, conservative investors.Yes, you can put real money into Bitcoin but it won't create or do anything for you to actually create more money, like farmland.Sidebar: I like to think about how farmland can create money which allows me to buy more farmland. Lather, rinse, repeat. But when you hold Bitcoin? It can go up or down in value, but you can't use Bitcoin to directly buy more Bitcoin because it's not producing anything.You might argue that Exxon Mobil (XOM) doesn't produce anything either, because it's selling a commodity. That quickly falls apart because of the production and transformation that Exxon provides, plus the transportation and much more. It's doing something with the raw materials and bringing something to the market for buyers. It's creating value.That's exactly what PayPal is doing, but in a different way. We can place value on PayPal. You can use PayPal for actions like:In other words, at a minimum, PayPal is a value-adding business on top of the money that flows through it. Your investment in PayPal is an investment in the infrastructure, the business relationships, e-commerce software, and more.PayPal is a money company but it's also a ""value layer"" on top of the money. Therefore, we come to the second point. We can place some value on PayPal's digital products and services: we can determine intrinsic value of PayPal.I do think we can calculate the intrinsic value of Bitcoin, but it is dramatically more difficult.So again, PayPal wins as an investment at a deep level because it's way more transparent to the eye of an investor. As a growth company, PayPal might be a little bit speculative but it's way less speculative than Bitcoin. Please understand that you might make more money with Bitcoin. In fact, you might always and forever be able to make more money with Bitcoin. However, that will be a matter of successful speculation not because of due diligence or fundamental analysis. Conservative, value-oriented investors around the world are nodding their heads in agreement with this line of reasoning.Conclusion: It seems obvious to me that PayPal is a better investment than Bitcoin. The first reason is that Bitcoin isn't an investment at all but a speculation. The second reason is that we can understand and place real value on what PayPal does for people and businesses. It's an investment because it doesn't just store value or dollars, but instead it creates value in the market.It's critical to understand that Bitcoin may substantially outperform PayPal well into the future, and perhaps forever.Just because Bitcoin is a ""speculation"" and ""doesn't create value"" we cannot ignore the fact that millions own it. If we reach a true tipping point, and more people and business start accepting it, and using it, the value could be astronomical (upwards of $100K in 10 years).In short, if you want to own an understandable, fast growing company in the world of digital currency then PayPal is worthy of your due diligence. On the other hand, if you're looking to take on enormous risks with equally enormous, world-changing potential, then Bitcoin is worthy of your further investigations.No matter what, both PayPal and Bitcoin are part of the digital money explosion.

Cloud IQ has now raised more than $18 million in funding since inception in 2012.PayPal and Cloud IQ had developed a previous relationship, with PayPal offering Cloud IQ’s system to its client base.The key aspect of PayPal’s investment in Cloud IQ is its development of AI/machine learning technology to power its automated platformAs PayPal’s Jeremy Jonker stated in the deal announcement,So, PayPal is beginning to not only partner with AI/ML companies, but to invest in them. This signals an understanding by management that its business model needs to adjust to a new environment that requires a fundamentally greater degree of technology-enabled services that can adapt to current conditions in real-time, rather than static functionality.PayPal has been moderately active investing in startups in recent years, as the chart below shows,(Source:CrunchBase)PayPal’s investment pace appears to be picking up. Extrapolating from 2017’s activity year-to-date, management is on track to exceed 2016’s investment pace significantly, and 2016 exceeded that of 2015.So, it appears PayPal management is beginning to increase its focus on investing in the next generation of technologies such as AI/machine learning.Another candidate for investment may be blockchain technologies, as they may have the greatest potential payoff and potential threat to PayPal’s core business.Security startups that use AI/ML technologies have also been hot targets for investment and acquisition, so I would not be surprised to see PYPL moves in this area as well.In any event, I’m positive that management appears to be on the move and focused on new technologies as the financial technology space continues to indicate a high propensity for change in the coming years.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, insider activity, and IPOs.

4091066,99406,2017-07-27T01:57:23-04:00,"Revenue growth and earnings growth continues apace.More partnerships were announced and the quarterly partnerships range from minor to very impactful, in my humble opinion.A very low tax rate did give earnings an artificial boost, but real growth is still present.Could this company have the best balance sheet other than the cash hoarding tech giants?","PayPal (PYPL) grew revenues at an 18% clip this quarter including slight currency headwinds on the back of a 23% increase in Total Payment Volume (TPV) and 10% growth in transactions per user.According to SA, revenue beat by $50m and eps was $.03 higher than expected.Revenue growth in prior quarter's was 17%, 18%, 17%, 15%, and 19% in the past 5 quarters.TPV has grown from $60b in mid-2015 when the company split from eBay (EBAY) to over $106b in this quarter.EPS came in strong at $0.34 against $0.27 last quarter, but with a caveat. The company had a GAAP effective tax rate 690bps or 6.9% lower than last quarter.That is clearly an abnormal tax rate for a US based company and likely means that eps and earnings where higher than they otherwise should have been.Still, despite that technicality, there was actual earnings growth this quarter. Revenue outpaced expenses by almost $100m and the share count was flat quarter over quarter.The interesting thing about PayPal's balance sheet is that there is not much on it, especially assets wise. The company only has roughly $1.5b in actual physical equipment and property, with the rest being cash, promises, and money it holds for account holders.The only liabilities the company has made of of mostly funds owed to account holders with minor amounts in long term deferred tax and accounts payable. There balance sheet is essentially as strong as it can be without the company hoarding cash, which it has no reason to do.PayPal's strong performance the past two years has been fueled mostly by numerous partnerships that were initially had a mixed reaction by the street but most analysts have been overwhelming positive lately as their strategy to become a partner with most large financial institutions rather than a competitor became clear.PYPL data by YChartsPayPal highlighted some of these recent partnerships and announced new ones with their earnings.In regards to the Baidu partnership, I think this is relatively little value as I am not sure how much Chinese consumers patronize PayPal's merchants outside of China. I doubt any consumers would signup for PayPal just to use it to pay when they are outside China, but perhaps it could leave to a deeper relationship in the future and more significant benefits could follow.The Bank of America (BAC) partnership also appears limited in scope as it just allows BOA cards to added easier to PayPal's wallet, possibly to boost in store purchases. With all the credit card companies as willing partners already, I think the volume and transaction boost should again be minor, but it can't hurt.The partnership I feel will have the biggest impact is the Apple iTunes one, which was announced earlier in the quarter.The countries it covers include the important ones like the US and Europe and a large majority of these purchases are on mobile, chiefly on iPhones. Mobile is a market PayPal has been dominating and focusing on and is a natural fit for their One-Touch platform and other quality of life features.Apple's iTunes and other service platforms grew at a 22.3% clip last quarter and is now on track to do over $7 billion per quarter. Not all of this is iTunes related but a larger part is and provides another growing platform to where PayPal can gain share and grow payment volume with the growth of services.The other partnerships should drive incremental transactions per user and more account signups in the aggregate, but ones like the Samsung Pay partnership are minor in that these digital wallets from various providers still have very small market shares, below 1-2%, and if PayPal is only a small portion of that then the potential customer base is tiny relative to existing account numbers. Still, the strategy for PayPal is now crystal clear and they continue to deliver new partnerships and extend existing ones, which bodes well for TPV and revenue going forward.The only problem for potential PayPal investor's is valuation. The company expects $1.32 to $1.36 in GAAP earnings this year. At ~$58 a share, the company trades at a whopping 43 times earnings, likely more as it is moving in after hours.PYPL PE Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThis is just about double its growth rate, which could be a fair price given that many stocks are not growing more than a few percent and interest rates remain very low.Predicting consistent or even growing revenue over more than a year or two is usually foolish and wrong as growth always tends to sputter and slow as businesses mature and face competition, but PayPal's numerous partnerships given it a higher probability of keeping its 15-20% growth chugging along.PayPal had another solid quarter and the only hair or caveat was extremely low one time tax rate. This had a noticeable but small impact of around a ~$20m boost to net income, but did not deter the company from showing consistent revenue growth in line with the past 5 quarters and real earnings and eps growth.The valuation is definitely elevated and leaves little room for error, but the business underlying the stock is performing excellently and should be on all investor's short lists."
4092370,103048,2017-07-30T02:27:48-04:00,"Recent earnings reaffirm our previous buy rating and make PayPal's growth prospects look even better.PayPal beat analyst earnings forecasts yet again on the 26th, since going public, PayPal has exceeded analyst earnings expectations for every single quarter.Their strategic partnership strategy is already paying off, user growth is already starting to accelerate and is increasing at a double digit rate.Venmo's total payment volume more than doubled year over year this quarter.PayPal's strong brand and scale makes their platform almost seem insurmountable.","PayPal (PYPL) reported 2nd quarter earnings which beat both top and bottom line analyst expectations on the 26th after the market closed. Their quarterly earnings not only exceeded analyst expectations but they also exceeded their own guidance, their user base and user interaction is continuing to grow at a healthy pace. Venmo in particular impressed yet again with its total payment volume (TPV) more than doubling year over year. It is worth noting that PayPal has beaten analyst earnings per share forecasts every single quarter since it separated from eBay (EBAY), a true testament to PayPal's strong fundamentals and ability to generate strong growth. After their latest earnings report, I believe their growth prospects are even stronger since I last wrote about them. Even after the stock's most recent run up, which was sparked by their latest earnings report, we still believe PayPal deserves a strong buy rating2nd quarter revenue was reported to be $3.14 billion dollars which exceeded analyst forecasts of $3.09 billion, EPS was $0.46 beating analyst expectations of $0.43. PayPal also raised their annual revenue and EPS guidance to the $12.78-$12.88 billion dollars range and $1.80-$1.84 range respectively. Analysts were originally expecting annual EPS forecasts to be $1.78 and annual revenue to be $12.72 billion. It should not be surprising to anyone that PayPal would raise their yearly outlook, especially when you factor in all of their new strategic partnerships and payment processing growth from Venmo. Before we get into that though, we should take a closer look at their earnings. Revenue grew 18 percent year over year to $3.136 billion dollars, free cash flow for the quarter was $747 million, up more than 51 percent year over year. Operating margins also improved by 110 basis points to 21 percent compared to operating margins of 19.9 percent the same quarter last year. Net income spiked 27 percent year over year growing from $436 million to $554 million. In terms of user and payment transaction growth, PayPal did not disappoint either. For the 2nd quarter, PayPal added 6.5 million active new customer accounts. Now PayPal has over 210 million active customer accounts with 17 million of those being merchant accounts. Total payment volume (TPV) was up by 23 percent year over year reaching $106 billion dollars. As a result, the number of transactions for the 2nd quarter was 1.8 billion representing a 23 percent year over year increase. These are some impressive growth figures to post, but they should not be surprising to anyone who understands the fundamentals about PayPal. Their unique and easy to use platform combined with their new collaborative business strategy will continue to generate growth for years to come. New strides in their social mobile payment platform, Venmo, will also accelerate growth. Venmo is a mobile application which allows users to send money to each other through their mobile devices extremely quickly and with ease. It has become a very valuable asset for PayPal since it is popular among the coveted millennial crowd. The platform was acquired last year in July for $800 million dollars and it has proven itself to be a very fruitful investment. Venmo processed $8.0 billion in total payment volume translating into a 103 percent growth in payments processed. As long as Venmo continues to see their user base grow, PayPal can leverage that to make more merchants accept it as a form of payment. This process snowballs as it also makes it more appealing for users to use, if it is more appealing to use then it becomes more popular as a result. If it is more popular, then merchants are more likely to accept it as payment method. Venmo will be a significant driver in growth and value for PayPal in the future. Currently, it still has a lot more room to grow and most likely will continue to grow. Strategic partnerships have also played a critical role in PayPal's impressive user base growth. For the 2nd quarter, they negotiated several collaborative partnerships/agreements. They made collaborative agreements with banks such as JPMorgan (JPM), Citi (C) and Bank of America (BAC) while also extending the olive branch to competing payment processors. Apple (AAPL) now accepts PayPal as a form of payment in their ecosystem, and Android Pay also recently started accepting PayPal as a payment method for everything. Their original collaborative agreement with Visa (V) was also expanded to include the European region. Most recently, they made an agreement with Baidu (BIDU) to allow Baidu wallet users to use PayPal as a method of payment. These agreements make PayPal's platform more attractive for consumers to use and more attractive for merchants to accept. The more deals they execute, the stronger their brand and platform grows. Instead of directly competing with other payment processors, they are now working together so both parties can benefit. Every deal they make will further accelerate the growth of their user base and thus generate more revenue. PayPal will not stop making these deals anytime soon either, they will continue to negotiate with willing companies and execute deals. Each time they are able to execute one, it will act as a catalyst for user growth and thus increase the value of their platform. One of PayPal's biggest advantages over their competitors is their sheer size and strong brand recognition. PayPal is one of the most consistently used and fastest money transfer platforms out there, other competitors will have to fight an uphill battle versus PayPal. Scale wise, PayPal has a huge international and domestic presence with the needed infrastructure to support it. In the past two years alone, PayPal has made over a dozen agreements with different companies to further increase their market share. PayPal's platform is so well developed and well known by users, it will be hard for any competing platforms to steal any market share from it. A recent morning consult poll found PayPal to be not only one of the most well-known payment platforms but also one of the most used. PayPal's size and brand gives it a strong competitive edge over other payment processing companies, especially new ones. PayPal's ability to craft and execute collaborative deals with other companies, even competing ones, will be a huge driver of growth for the future. Venmo has proven itself to be a fruitful investment and is PayPal's way to capture the market share of younger generations. Their most recent earnings not only reaffirm my bullish view on growth, but they actually make it even stronger. We give PayPal a bullish rating and are reiterating our buy rating, even after the most recent run-up."
4088536,58641,2017-07-18T17:22:32-04:00,"Visa just signed a deal that will allow PayPal to issue physical debit cards in Europe.Last month, I called for PayPal to issue physical debit cards to all of its customers. For years, only Americans enjoyed the privilege of having a Mastercard PayPal debit cards.A debit card will allow businesses and people to use PayPal like a typical bank-issued charge card. PayPal’s future is better when it allows its user to also shop offline.Global adoption of PayPal debit cards can help the company notably increase its total payment volume.","Getting a physical debit card is one great way that bank account holders can conveniently shop on brick & mortar stores. Visa (V) recently signed a deal that will allow digital payments leader PayPal (PYPL) to issue physical debit cards in Europe. PayPal is not a bank. However, this new development further enhances PayPal’s transformation as a pseudo-retail bank. PayPal definitely is safeguarding tens of billions of dollars that millions of people saved up.PayPal is so popular now that alleged money launderers may be using it to hide cash. Issuing a physical Visa debit card can inspire these PayPal cash hoarders to spend some of their money.(Source: Motek Moyen Photoshopped A Sample Mastercard Debit Card)PayPal’s relevance as a payments processor is stronger if it enables all of its users do traditional shopping. PayPal cannot be complacent as the king of online shopping payments. Its next source of growth is obvious. Even in a well-developed country like U.S., traditional shopping acounts for far more transactions than e-commerce ($3.9 trillion versus online/mobile shopping’s $294 billion).PayPal can substantially increase its total payment volume (and transactional fees) by letting all of its account holders have physical debit cards. PayPal’s total payment volume for the last two previous quarter was $99 billion.(Source: Statista)Consumer card payments reached $23.1 trillion globally. PayPal has obvious economic benefits if its debit cards can help it garner 2% share of that massive global payment volume.$23.1 trillion x 2% market share = $462 billion/year payment volume from PayPal Visa debit cards.The higher amount of payment volume that PayPal processes, the higher its net revenue will be.My article last month proposed that PayPal really needed to issue physical debit cards to all of its customers, not just U.S. residents. There are millions of non-American people (like me) who have thousands of dollars stashed at PayPal. We want to spend our PayPal savings on traditional brick & mortar shopping, not just on online purchases.PayPal’s lucrative currency conversion fees could notably increase in total volume after Europeans, Asians, Africans, and Latinos start using their PayPal debit cards to pay for their daily groceries, gas/diesel refill, restaurant tabs, and mall shopping.For example, a Dutch Seeking Alpha contributor who has managed to save $47k in his PayPal account is ideal user of a PayPal Visa debit card. He will likely spend more after he gets a Visa PayPal Visa Debit Card. He will use it not just for online purchases. Charging 2% currency conversion fee on a Dutchman doing a 5K euro PayPal Visa Debit Card mall shopping spree will give PayPal an extra $100 in new revenue. Multiply this showcase scenario by 30 million European PayPal users and you will understand how big the economic opportunity is involved in this new Visa-PayPal partnership.PayPal doesn’t breakdown the per-region user base but it has 203 million active users around the world. Common sense tells me that most of that user base is not from United States.Mastercard (MA) is PayPal’s partner for its physical debit cards for Americans. However, Visa is clearly the runaway global leader in credit and debit card total network volume purchases. PayPal’s global roll-out of its physical debit cards has a great partner in Visa.Visa-stamped debit cards accounted for 70% of the network purchase volume last year.(Source: wallethub.com)Europe could just be the first expansion market for PayPal’s debit cards. Next region will probably be Asia and then Latin America. The more extensive global presence of Visa (compared to Mastercard's) is why PayPal chose it. These two leading payments processing providers can benefit from each other’s strengths. Visa has the expansive global network of partner banks and merchants. PayPal is a quasi-bank that holds a massive cash hoard that 203 million users saved up.Luxembourg actually granted PayPal a banking license in 2007. Along with Ireland, Luxembourg is the most-favored tax haven in the world. In other words, PayPal and Luxembourg host secret stashes of money. PayPal and Visa issuing debit cards will encourage people to spend more of their PayPal money.No financial details were divulged over the Visa-PayPal Europe debit card partnership. However, I expect Visa to get a fair cut from PayPal’s transaction fees/currency conversion fees garnished from debit cards. Visa would not have agreed to support PayPal’s debit card campaign if it wasn’t getting a fair share of the projected revenue.PYPL is outperforming the YTD return of V and MA but I might also buy some Visa. V's forward P/E ratio is notably lower than that of MA and PYPL's. (Source: Morningstar)"

Similarly, the company is also building alliances with the big banks, including names such as Wells Fargo (WFC), JP Morgan (JPM), and Bank of America (BAC).Image source: PayPalThe complete financial details of these agreements are not disclosed, but everything indicates that PayPal is making lower margins per transaction under these alliances. PayPal’s evolving relationship with Visa and MasterCard can provide some insights about how these agreements work.Card companies charge substantial processing fees on payment transactions, so PayPal used to encourage its customers to link their PayPal accounts directly to their bank accounts via ACH as opposed to credit cards in order to avoid those fees.Under the new agreements, PayPal has promised to make it as easy as possible for customers to choose either bank accounts or Visa and MasterCard accounts. In exchange, PayPal will now be more easily accessible in mobile wallets using Visa or MasterCard networks.In a nutshell, PayPal is making smaller profits on every transaction via accounts linked to Visa or MasterCard, but the company will also gain more exposure to mobile payments by joining forces with two tremendously powerful brands in the sector.PayPal’s business model is quite attractive. Most of the company's costs are related to the infrastructure necessary to process transactions, and a high proportion of expenses are fixed. As revenue grows over time, PayPal spreads fixed costs on an bigger revenue base, which generates expanding profit margins on sales.The company reported a vigorous increase of 20% in constant-currency revenue during the second quarter of 2017, to $3.14 billion. Transaction expenses increased 31%, putting some downward pressure on profit margins. On the other hand, this was more than offset by positive margin contribution from leveraging other expenses.At the end of the day, PayPal delivered an increase of 110 basis points in adjusted operating margin during the quarter, reaching 21% of revenue. This shows that the company can still generate expanding profitability in spite of growing volume-based expenses.Image source: PayPalPayPal is also doing a sound job in key areas such as user growth and engagement. The company ended the last quarter with 210 million active accounts, adding 6.5 million new accounts during the period. This was the largest organic increase in users over the past three years, so the business is clearly gaining momentum.PayPal processed 1.8 billion transactions during the quarter, growing 23% year-over-year. Transactions per active account increased 10% versus the second quarter of 2016. Growing engagement has positive implications in terms of sales and profits, and it also means that the platform is providing a valuable and appreciated service to customers.Image source: PayPalImportantly, PayPal still has enormous room for growth. According to management, approximately 85% of all commerce transactions around the world are still made in cash, and the total addressable market for PayPal over the long term is worth nearly $100 trillion.Image source: PayPalConsidering the gargantuan size of the market opportunity, it makes sense for PayPal to focus on strategic positioning by building alliances for growth over the years and decades ahead.By partnering with all kinds of players, both in technology and in financial services, PayPal is leaving some money on the table when it comes to profit margins per transaction. However, the business model allows for expanding margins as revenue grows over the years, and recent financial reports show that the business keeps performing remarkably well across the board.Even more important, the long-term market opportunity for PayPal is gigantic, so management is doing the smart thing by prioritizing long-term growth over short-term margins."
4088576,101431,2017-07-18T22:15:50-04:00,"Apple has recently allowed PayPal payments on its Apple Store, Apple Music and iTunes.I see this as a positive sign that could suggest a potential ""partnership"" with Amazon is more likely.Venmo is also another interesting source of growth, while the asset-light strategy should have a neutral effect at worst.","Image Source: Company websiteA quick look at PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) historical performance gives us an idea of the underlying trends that support the company's growth. Between 2012 and 2016, revenue grew at a 17%+ CAGR, while net income grew at a 15.8% CAGR. In the same period, FCF rose at a 24% CAGR.Between Q1 2014 and Q1 2017, active customer accounts grew at an 11%+ CAGR, or 2.67% per quarter. Despite the growing size of its operations, the number of active customers continues to grow at a pretty much constant rate, which has actually shown an acceleration in the last few quarters:Source: Author's elaborationThe strong growth rates are an obvious consequence of the positive trends in the eCommerce industry, which is aggressively and constantly gaining market share at the expense of brick-and-mortar retail. Although Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn't allow customers to pay with PayPal (unless we use the MasterCard (NYSE:MA) prepaid card), the growth trends that supports PayPal are healthy enough even without the contribution of the eCommerce giant. Just like in any other business that generates network effects, PayPal becomes increasingly valuable as more and more people use it, which attracts more retailers to adopt it as a payment method. With 200 million active users, almost every retailer that doesn't compete with PayPal has all the interest in trying to generate incremental sales, thanks to the higher flexibility for customers. In this context of increasing eCommerce penetration, the only reasonable outcome I see is that PayPal will continue to grow its network, thanks to the self-reinforcing nature of network effects.The possibility that Amazon changes its approach and decides to adopt PayPal despite the direct competition to Amazon Pay is just a valuable source of upside risk that can improve PayPal's already excellent growth prospects. Considering that talks on a potential partnership between the two companies have cooled down, a change of stance from Amazon would have a strong positive effect on PayPal stock. We shouldn't underestimate the probability of a future partnership. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also competes with PayPal through its payment system Apple Pay, a factor that didn't prevent the Cupertino company from allowing PayPal as a payment method on its Apple Store, Apple Music and iTunes.This ""partnership"" gives us a strong positive signal - it means that the benefit of having PayPal as a payment system goes beyond the negative effects of allowing it to compete with Apple Pay. This is something that was already evident thanks to Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) Ali Express, which has allowed PayPal as a payment method for a while despite the direct competition with Alibaba's Alipay (now a partner of Alibaba, but the Chinese giants continues to benefit from a profit-sharing agreement).Amazon's motivation for not allowing PayPal on its platform has been that Amazon's customers wouldn't have any benefit in having PayPal as an option. Last year, Amazon Pay's vice president, Patrick Gauthier, said PayPal would already be on Amazon if customers really asked for it. I see two possible implications of this statement:A direct competitor like Apple does see value in letting PayPal ""invade"" its territory - something that tells us a lot about the value of PayPal and its network. Of course, we must consider that Apple Pay works differently from PayPal, and it's basically a payment card substitute, but the implied message remains the same - Apple could refuse PayPal in order to try to drive more payments volume on Apple Pay. Instead, it decided it was more convenient to have PayPal as an additional payment method, and the only reasonable explanation is that the company sees incremental benefits that more than offset the possible loss to competition.The first mentions of an asset-light strategy from PayPal management started to be shared in early 2016. Despite some mixed opinions about the move, I think the prospects of lower earnings volatility have contributed to lower the perceived risk and, therefore, contributed to some of the multiple expansion we have seen in the stock price since then.According to management, PayPal doesn't run its credit business to gain interest and fees but to increase user engagement and improve merchant wins and retention. Management reported that customers who utilize credit services spend twice as much as new customers who do not. Moreover, they said that when existing customers enroll in either PayPal credit or the PayPal credit card, their total purchase volume increases 35%.If on one side going asset-light on credit would shift interest and fee income, it would also shift default risk to the counterparty. At the same time, PayPal would continue to ""provide"" such loans to customers, increasing their engagement and reinforcing its position. It is reasonable to assume that if customers do value the possibility of using credit services on PayPal and customers who use such services spend much more than the ones who do not, the PayPal network would surely benefit from the expansion of these services, even if it won't collect fees and interest income. As the total volume of operations increases, PayPal's network effect will become stronger and the company will benefit.Using the sale of credit receivables in Q2 2015 to Synchrony as a benchmark, going asset-light could free up to $5 billion in cash. Considering a reduction in operating income between $250 and $290 million, I think there would be a small reduction in EPS that couldn't be offset by additional share repurchases, given the current market cap. Anyway, the lowered risk would easily offset the small EPS reduction and may even have a positive effect on the stock price. In general, I would welcome a move to go asset-light even in these conditions because of the benefits in terms of user engagement and ongoing positive effects on PayPal's network.Regarding Venmo, despite the strong growth rates in the last few years (in excess of 100% YoY), I think the division can offer some good optionality for further growth that is not fully priced in the stock at these levels. As is evident in the chart below, the division has shown more than healthy growth trends in the recent past, but looking at analysts' comments and questions during the recent earnings calls, it's clear that some market participants have doubts about Venmo's monetization strategy because they are concerned about competition from Zelle (a P2P service backed by banks and credit unions), and it's in part understandable because both platforms have their competitive advantages.Source: Author's elaborationVenmo offers a standalone mobile and web app, while Zelle is hosted within a bank's website and mobile apps. Venmo also has a stronger network effect, thanks to its first-mover advantage and leading position in the millennial segment, but Zelle too has its pros, such as the support of more than 30 banks, including a few large ones. Anyway, I think the most important competitive advantage that Venmo has is that its network effect is strengthened by social interaction between users, while Zelle doesn't benefit from any kind of social interaction. This characteristic puts Venmo in a much stronger position in the millennial segment, which, in my opinion, will eventually translate into a long-term competitive advantage.PayPal's growth prospects remain solid, driven by the secular growth of eCommerce and the consequent benefit for online payment providers. After seeing even Apple accepting PayPal payments on its platforms despite the direct competition with Apple Pay, I see the possibility of a partnership with Amazon as a bit more likely. The value in PayPal's network effect is probably higher than many believe, and if it's true that the main reason why Amazon doesn't allow PayPal on its platform is because customers didn't ask for it, it's obvious to assume the probability of a partnership will increase as PayPal grows, until a point where it will be too big to be ignored. I see a possible partnership with Amazon as an upside risk that is not priced in the stock today. In addition to that, I also see another source of upside risk in Venmo's growth due to its strong position in the millennial segment and excessive concerns about competition, while I don't think the implementation of an asset-light strategy can have a negative effect.Thanks for taking the time to read the article.

4087372,103001,2017-07-12T20:37:02-04:00,PayPal's Venmo is loved and widely used by millennials.Venmo has sustainable growth prospects as the shift to mobile continues.PayPal's free cash flow and EV/EBITDA ratio suggest it is trading at a reasonable price.,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is on a roll recently. With its new partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), you will soon be able to use PayPal to purchase items on the iTunes App Store. PayPal has solidified itself as a large player in the payments industry by partnering with almost every major payment company or competitor. Not only is it a huge success, but the company also owns Venmo, a fast-growing app that millennials love to use. In this article, I outline Venmo's success and why PayPal stock should be in everyone's growth portfolio.Venmo is Loved and Used by ManyVenmo seems to be very popular with millennials, as it makes splitting purchases easy, is fun to use, and allows people to interact in a new way. On Venmo's official blog, you can see new features that make the app so popular. You can use countless emojis to describe payments. Venmo even has customized emojis for festivals.(Source: The Venmo Blog)Venmo can also be used within iMessage to send payments. The video below shows how truly simple it is to pay using Venmo.(Source: YouTube)It is hard imagine another peer-to-peer payment network that will be able to grow as fast as this one in the future. Venmo is widely used by millennials, it is easy to use, and many enjoy using it.Venmo Represents an Opportunity for Long-Term Sustainable GrowthAs the shift to mobile payments continues, Venmo is experiencing dramatic growth. According to PayPal's Q1 press release, the app processed $6.8 billion in total payment volume in the quarter, which represents over 100% growth from the same quarter last year. It is hard to find growth that impressive anywhere. See the table below that was created by looking at the company's earnings releases.(Source: Jones, Brock ""Venmo Total Payment Volume Growth"")Venmo appears to have a large runway of growth ahead of it, as it is still in its early stages of adoption, growing over 100% year over year in each of the last three quarters. With this growth in peer-to-peer payment volume, PayPal is searching to monetize Venmo to create future profits. Over the last year, Venmo has begun to allow users to pay some merchants through the app. In the future, it could replace credit cards, as Venmo accounts are linked directly to bank accounts. This could allow PayPal to charge a small fee to the merchant each time a user buys with Venmo, like credit card processors do now. It is difficult to quantify the revenue this could produce, but as mobile payment adoption continues in the U.S. and around the world, Venmo has the opportunity to produce billions of dollars in future free cash flow. Not to mention, PayPal as a whole already produces almost $2.5 billion in free cash flow and has no debt.PayPal is Reasonably PricedCurrently, PayPal is reasonably priced for its current trajectory and growth capabilities. Its market capitalization is just under $70 billion, and it is currently at its 52-week high. As you can see below, PayPal stacks up well compared to FANG stocks when you compare the enterprise value to EBITDA. See the table I made using each company's most recent 10-Q and 10-K below.(Source: Jones, Brock ""EV to EBITDA Table for FANG and PayPal"")The EV-to-EBITDA ratio is used to measure the cost of the entire enterprise regardless of its capital structure. With PayPal's growth potential, it seems to be at a reasonable figure of 27.63.Not only does PayPal seem fairly priced based on its EV/EBITDA, it also produces large amounts of cash. The company has just issued a repurchase program to the tune of $5 billion. With no debt and high amounts of free cash flow, it can return lots of cash to shareholders. PayPal's ability to return cash to shareholders, while still having massive growth opportunities, shows how great its business really is.ConclusionPayPal has solidified its place in the payments industry and has a clear pathway to long-term growth through Venmo. It is also reasonably priced according to the EV/EBITDA ratio, and produces large amounts of free cash flow. PYPL is an excellent stock for long-term growth investors to add to their portfolios."
4090290,73185,2017-07-25T14:58:12-04:00,"PYPL reports earnings Wednesday, 7/26, after the bell.The quarter featured multiple highlights, including Apple adding PayPal as an accepted payment method in the App Store.PYPL stock is a pure-play on the boom in e-commerce, and because of this, PYPL stock has lots of growth left.","Digital payments, specifically mobile commerce, is on fire right now. Just look at the stocks of PayPal (PYPL) and Square (SQ). As the digital payments growth narrative has gained momentum, these stocks have just taken off. PYPL is up about 50% year-to-date, while SQ has almost doubled in 2017. One of these digital payment giants, PYPL, is set to report earnings this week (Wednesday, 7/26, after the bell). We are bullish into that report as we believe the secular growth narrative surrounding digital payments has only grown stronger over the past several months.PYPL data by YChartsPYPL stock is a pure play on the e-commerce transition. As long as retail continues to shift from the physical channel to the digital channel, consumers will continue to shift from cash to digital payment methods (only 20% of young people spend more than $5 on cash purchases in a week). PYPL is the king of the digital payment space. Naturally, PYPL wins when shoppers shop online.Moreover, PYPL owns Venmo, which is the hottest mobile payments platform in the marketplace. Everything is going mobile, and Venmo is at the heart of that transition. Venmo is quick, easy, relatively friction-less, and even fun to use (it has a Facebook-like news feed, so its social in nature). Because of these qualities, Venmo is particularly popular among Millennial consumers. This high level of popularity among a young demographic (against a backdrop of booming e-commerce sales) implies that Venmo's growth runway is very, very long.Overall, PYPL is a secular growth story with lots of growth left. This growth story really picked up over the past several months, and that makes us particularly excited about the quarter. Here are the highlights over the past several months:All in all, it looks like PYPL had a blowout quarter thanks to a surge in digital payment popularity. This blowout quarter will likely become more of the norm as digital payment usage proliferates at an unprecedented rate over the next several years. We like PYPL stock in both the near and long term windows."
4088443,103048,2017-07-18T12:50:02-04:00,"PayPal is a fundamentally solid company with promising growth prospects.New deals with Google and Apple will create additional sources of revenue and more opportunities down the road.As the e-commerce market grows, PayPal's innovative and payment processing and transferring service is posed to benefit greatly.In the future, it is very possible that PayPal will make more collaborative agreements with other companies like Amazon.PayPal's payment platform is very low cost, easy to use and secure to use.","PayPal (PYPL) has been in the news recently because of their recent collaborative deal with Apple (AAPL); Apple will now accept PayPal as a payment method for their app store and other digital markets. With the global e-commerce market expected to surpass 4 trillion dollars by 2020, PayPal is in a superb position to capitalize on this consumer trend. Their payment processing platform is wonderfully designed and optimized to appeal to all customers who want a safe and secure payment method. This collaborative deal with Apple opens up a bundle of opportunities for PayPal and creates more collaborative possibilities with Apple down the road. If you look at the big picture, there is a possibility that Amazon and other companies will also accept PayPal as a viable form of payment in the future.PayPal allows their users to move their money and pay for products using their payment processing platform and technology. Founded first in 1998, PayPal has grown into a successful and well respected company with over 203 million active accounts. They make their money with merchant transaction fees and by getting interest from the money in users' accounts (at no cost to the user). Much like a bank, when the money sits into the account, PayPal collects interest from the money. There is also a fee regarding currency conversions, in some ways PayPal can be thought of as a bank. One of the main appeals of using PayPal is their reputable history and secure payment system. All of the information on their site and app is encrypted and secured, you only need to put your information into the site once. Once you connect a debit/credit card to PayPal, you have no need to do it again. When you buy something using PayPal, PayPal is not giving out the information to whoever is selling the product, they process the payment themselves. This decreases the risk of your personal information being compromised, all of it is stored in one place and PayPal does not give it out to anyone.Merchants are essential for the continued growth of PayPal, the more merchants which have PayPal accounts and accept PayPal as a form of payment, the more money PayPal makes. As more companies and merchants adopt PayPal as a viable form of payment, it will attract more users to the platform as well, and with more users, merchants have a bigger incentive to accept PayPal as a form of payment. PayPal has also been entering strategic partnerships in order to accelerate growth and make their platform more attractive to users; their recent partnership with Apple is just one example of many more strategic partnerships to come in my opinion. Many would say our society is heading towards a cashless future where our transactions will be processed digitally; if that is the case, PayPal has a huge opportunity to capitalize on that shift.SourceSo far, PayPal is growing at an impressive rate that shows no sign of slowing down anytime soon. Total payment volume for the last quarter was up by 25 percent year over year, this in turn resulted in a total revenue increase of 19 percent year over year last quarter. Non-GAAP EPS for the quarter came out to be $0.44, a 19 percent increase year over year. This impressive revenue and earnings growth is due to more active users and merchant accounts for their core PayPal platform; the total number of consumers and merchants is still growing at a healthy pace while user engagement also increases.SourcePayPal's active user base has been steadily increasing since the company's inception. As long as this number keeps growing, PayPal should continue to generate increased revenues. They ended last quarter with 203 million users, an 11 percent increase year over year. The average payment transactions per active account also increased by 12 percent. In total, $1.7 billion was processed last quarter, a 23 percent increase year over year.SourceFrom a scale perspective, the larger PayPal gets, the more strategic partnerships it can pull off. With more and more people using PayPal as a payment option, it becomes more and more compelling for companies to partner with PayPal and gain access to those potential customers. These partnerships open up more streams of revenue and makes their platform more attractive to use at the same time. In the past few months alone, PayPal has done an amazing job at pushing through these strategic collaborations. Apple's recent collaboration with PayPal makes their growth prospects even better than they already are. For now, PayPal users in Canada and Mexico will be able to use PayPal as a payment option for Apple services (e.g. App Store, Apple Music, iTunes, etc). This will be rolled out in the United States in the near future; however, no specific release date is known.PayPal is a great alternative payment option for people who do not wish to disclose their credit/debit card information when making purchases digitally on the app store and other Apple services. What makes this deal really great is the future potential implications it suggests; there is potential now for further Apple-PayPal collaboration. For example, PayPal can be integrated into Apple's iMessage and people could send money to each other through texting. PayPal also has a deal with Alphabet/Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG) as well; in April, they announced that their payment service Android Pay would allow users to select PayPal as a method of payment. This deal adds another stream of revenue for PayPal and makes their payment platform even more appealing to use. There is the possibility that Apple Pay will integrate with PayPal in a similar way to how PayPal and Android Pay integrated as well, but we do not know if that will happen for sure. What we do now know is that Apple would not be entirely close minded to a potential agreement; after all, Apple has already let PayPal have access to their services ecosystem. If both sides can benefit, there is no reason why they would not collaborate.With that being said, PayPal has done a wonderful job burying the hatchet with would be competitors to unlock more growth opportunities. PayPal has made collaborative agreements in order to increase growth with both MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V), two competitors. Through their partnership strategy, they can greatly accelerate growth while making their platform more flexible and easy to use. Their scale and large customer base makes them an attractive partner to have. Each new partnership greatly adds more value to both their brand and appeal. It is not a bad thing to have so many partnerships and opportunities for growth. The biggest benefactor of these partnerships is probably the customer as well. The happier the customer and the more satisfied they are with PayPal, the more likely they will do business and make transactions with the PayPal. It almost seems like PayPal has the perfect formula for continued and sustainable growth. PayPal will definitely continue to build new partnerships in the future generating more value.There are rumors that Amazon (AMZN) and PayPal are in the process of making a deal which will finally allow PayPal to become a payment option for shoppers. Currently, Amazon does not accept PayPal as a method of payment, but that could easily change in the future. Critics of this idea say that Amazon is too ambitious and would rather build their own payment platform, but that argument makes little sense. Apple and Google both have their own payment platforms, but they are still working with PayPal because it benefits both parties mutually. Amazon will benefit a lot more from working with PayPal versus trying to compete directly. PayPal's management is great at closing deals and there is no doubt that they are trying to close this one. However, it would be foolish and very speculative to invest solely based on this idea. It is very likely that PayPal will form more agreements with more companies, but it is impossible to predict if Amazon will cave in or not.Instead, I think we should look at more predictable factors, such as the growth of consumer e-commerce spending. PayPal's digital payment platform will benefit directly from the continued growth of e-commerce market. According to the National Retail Federation, online sales in 2017 will grow 8-12 percent in 2017 alone, 3 times faster then brick-and-mortar sales. Many people use payment services such as PayPal in order to process e-commerce sales, both merchants and customers can use PayPal for their transactions. However, this does not mean that PayPal will only benefit from digital payments. They have made steps to increase their physical presence too. Visa and MasterCard have both made deals with PayPal. PayPal users can make in-store payments using Visa and MasterCard's tokenization programs. This allows people who hold debit cards and MasterCards to pay for products in physical stores using funds from their PayPal wallet. Instead of using their own payment network, they are using the already well established networks of Visa and MasterCard. By forging these two collaborative deals, PayPal will be able to establish a physical foothold.We think that PayPal will continue to post solid growth numbers for years to come. There are fears that PayPal will succumb to competitive pressure from other payment processing platforms, but that idea has been around since 2002. Those fears failed to materialize back then and they will fail to do so now. In fact, we are actually seeing PayPal work with their competitors instead of directly competing with them head on. PayPal's stock has risen over 40 percent since the year started because of their growth, and that growth shows no sign of stopping."

It also has not implemented carrier billing as a payment option.PayPal is more secure when making online purchases. I hated giving my credit card info to Apple just to buy games for my 4-year old daughter.I will try to unload some AAPL and or AMZN to buy more PYPL.Getting accepted by Apple could also inspire Amazon to finally accept PayPal as a payment option on its online marketplace.,"Apple’s (AAPL) decision to start accepting PayPal (PYPL) as a payment method for purchases made on the iTunes App Store and Apple Music fortifies my previous buy rating for PayPal. Apple’s backing is going to be a long-term tailwind for PayPal. There are around 728 million iPhones active today. Some of us iPhone/iPad owners have been longing for an alternative to the old credit/debit card-only payment method when shopping for iOS apps/in-game items.(Source: Apple/PayPal)The combined online purchasing power of 728 million iPhone users is worth more than $20 billion/year. There will be tens (or even hundreds) of millions of iPhone owners who will embrace PayPal as their default payment method when shopping at the iTunes store. PayPal is definitely more secure than using a credit card to do online/mobile purchases.(Source: Newzoo)After our country’s Commission on Elections got hacked last year, I hated using my Visa (V) credit card on online purchases. The last time I used it was to buy a game for my four-year old daughter. That was over a year ago. With PayPal on the scene, I might start buying again from the App Store. I switched to buying apps/games on Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play Store since it supported PayPal and carrier billing for many years now.(Source: Motek Moyen)My point is that Apple and PayPal have reciprocal benefits from this new partnership. Enabling PayPal as an alternative payment method could inspire more security-conscious iOS device users to spend more on the iTunes App Store. In return, PayPal will make money from Apple’s customers. It charges merchants like Apple for online purchases processed through PayPal.PayPal usually charges online merchants a 2.9% fee on the purchase amount plus a fixed fee based on currency rate.(Source: PayPal)How PayPal Will BenefitI do not know the financial terms between Apple and PayPal. What matters more is that Apple operates the most profitable App Store on the planet today. Even if we guesstimate that Apple agreed to give PayPal a flat 1.5% fee, PayPal is already in for a good ride.As per App Annie’s chart below, the iOS App Store is expected to do $40 billion in transactions this year. This is expected to grow to $60 billion by 2021.(Source: App Annie)Let’s assume that 50% of that $40 billion app purchases will be processed through PayPal.$20 billion x 1.5% = $300 millionThree hundred million dollars of new revenue just for processing iOS app store purchases is already a notable economic benefit for PayPal. Its previous quarterly revenue was only $2.98 billion. Processing $20 billion worth of iOS app store purchases can also help increase PayPal’s $99 billion/quarter payment volume.ConclusionMore than just the economic benefits, PayPal also won a lot of PR (publicity) points when Apple accepted it as a payment method for the app store, iTunes Store, and Apple Music transactions. Tim Cook finally acknowledged that PayPal’s global presence (and more secure payment processing) can help Apple’s loyal horde of customers.I look forward to Apple also eventually allowing PayPal as an alternative payment method for its online and offline retail stores. Next only to Amazon (AMZN), Apple is the second-biggest e-commerce vendor in the U.S.A. It will be safer for some security-conscious Americans to buy the latest iPad or iMac from Apple’s online store using a PayPal account.I might unload some AAPL and/or AMZN to buy more PYPL. PayPal's stock is outperforming Apple's anyway. (Source: Google Finance)Apple’s acceptance of PayPal as a payment method could also inspire Amazon to accept it soon. The rumor earlier this year was that Amazon and PayPal were negotiating."

However, in all but name, PayPal is now a pseudo-bank on a global scale. Millions of people have stashed tens of billions of dollars at PayPal’s vault. It makes perfect sense that PayPal should consider issuing physical debit cards to its customers.PayPal's subsidiary Venmo is already testing a physical debit card. Giving its customers the convenience of a physical debit is the ultimate loyalty-building move for PayPal. It takes 2-3 business days for me to transfer PayPal dollars to Philippine pesos to my bank account. I want the convenience of immediately spending my PayPal money like how a regular debit card is used on groceries, mall shopping, gasoline, and restaurant meals. Venmo is not yet available in many countries.The impulse-buying compulsion of a physical debit card can also increase PayPal’s currency conversion fees from its customers. Instead of PayPal charging me once a month 2.5% in currency conversion fee, a physical debit card will likely result in me getting charged currency conversion fees 10-15x in a month.The more currency conversion fees that PayPal can extract from its users, the better it is for the company’s top line and bottom line. Charging currency conversion fee is a massive gold mine for PayPal because it operates in 200 countries, and it supports 25 different currencies.There are millions of outsourced freelancers (including me, an outsourced senior analyst at I Know First) who have thousands of dollars hidden at PayPal. Giving these outsourced Asian, Indian, and Latino programmers, designers, translators, and other freelancers physical debit cards is a good business move for PayPal.Implementing physical debit cards is not a difficult task for PayPal. It already has multitude of international and local banks in 200 countries where it operates. Tying up with a local bank in Philippines with a currency conversion fee-sharing agreement could quickly enable PayPal debit cards.Final ThoughtsMobile shopping is not the only answer to PayPal’s ambition to become a long-term leader in fintech. Retail spending using physical debit card is definitely a larger growth catalyst for PayPal. In spite of the hype over online and mobile shopping, their combined global transaction is still much smaller than traditional retail shopping.As per the recent report of Retail Touchpoints, 94% of retail sales is still processed through old style brick-and-mortar stores. Most, if not all, brick-and-mortar stores support credit/debit card swiping. Only a few of them bothered to support fancy mobile payment systems.Again, PYPL is a buy even if it doesn’t issue a physical debit card. But I’ll double up my PYPL bet if it does issue a physical debit card like its subsidiary Venmo is now doing.On a technical note, using Exponential Moving Average (EMA) analysis, PYPL is most likely to continue its upside trend. PayPal’s 5-day EMA (53.56) has crossed above its 13-day EMA (52.95). The 13-day EMA is also above its 20-day EMA of 52.47. The 5-day, 13-day, and 20-day EMAs are all above PYPL’s 50-day EMA of 50.03. I like EMA over SMA (Simple Moving Average) because it gives more weight to the most recent stock prices.(Source: stockta.com)A Relative Strength Index (RSI) analysis also told me that PYPL’s RSI score of 67.42 has not yet breached the 70 level. A score of 70 and above would have signaled that PYPL has crossed overbought territory.(Source: stockta.com)"

I like the idea of virtual currency transactions and the ability to easily send money to parties. I never would've thought PayPal would face open-source competition. There's a new cryptocurrency on the block that threatens to disrupt PayPal's business model. Should this disway investment?What differentiates Ethereum from BitcoinThe (relatively) new kid on the block, Ethereum has differentiated itself from Bitcoin in a couple of ways. While PayPal has processed hundreds of transactions per second without issue, Bitcoin has been limited to 3-4 real world transactions per second since its inception. In theory, that number could be pushed to 7, but that requires that the transactions be of the most basic form (small amounts with few terms). Should Bitcoin garner serious adoption, it requires that it can keep up with demand. Here's where Ethereum comes in. Currently, the Ethereum blockchain can support around 20 transactions per second, which pales in comparison to PayPal. That is until the Raiden network comes alive, which promises minimal fees and virtually unlimited transactions per second. The technology is pretty complicated, but in essence, instead of bottlenecking the transactions by forcing them to be ledgered onto the ethereum blockchain, Raiden works P2P (peer to peer).I've been playing with Ethereum for a couple weeks now, and it is quite intuitive. Within an hour I figured out how to get my PC mining the virtual currency, had a wallet signed up and joined a ""pool"" which allows me to pool resources with other ""miners"".Source: My ethereum mining operation (my desktop)None of this is particularly good for PayPal. Ethereum provides complete anonymity, while PayPal is bound by immense government regulations. It took me less effort to begin to mine my own ethereum than it would have been to create a PayPal account. Sending and receiving currencies was just as simple, and the algorithm would make it simple for one to layer on PayPal style services and protections.Another big plus of holding currency in ethereum instead of PayPal is the lack of the currency's dilution. There's a reason people don't like holding a lot of cash in, cash. If your money is not doing something (invested) it's constantly losing purchasing power. There are a limited number of ETHs that will ever come into existence, and each one is harder to produce than the last.PayPal's investment thesisPayPal has always seemed like a much more sensible holding to me than the FANG stocks. It trades at a premium multiple (over 40x), but it is also posting excellent growth. Despite its newfound competition, PayPal continued with its string of excellent financial results. The company grew its customer base another 10% to almost 200 million, and they grew the total payment value by almost a third.While other authors on Seeking Alpha discuss the investment as being sound assuming a near 30x EBITDA valuation, I see this as assuming the best case scenario. Should the headwinds start to affect performance, which I believe they will, based on Ethereum solving the main issue that held back BitCoin, growth, and multiples will face significant compression.Let's play with the two scenarios I see most likely and determine what a fair valuation is for Paypal.Scenario A, Crypto bubble:This is what the market currently expects, given Paypal's frothy valuation. In that case, we have what is a fairly valued company (cheap relative its peers like Square (SQ)). The company is growing TPV 25% YOY with no end in sight, trading at below 30x FCF and can grow rapidly into a large scale Visa (V). This seems like an acceptable, albeit historically expensive entry point.Scenario B, Cryptos soar:What concerns me about PayPal is what their bread and butter are, online transactions. While Visa, MasterCard and Square all focus on physical transactions that are much more immune to cryptocurrencies, PayPal could be hit hard by an improved Ethereum or PayPal. Sites like Overstock (OSTK) already accept bitcoin. They are actually working on a blockchain stock exchange, I'll be writing on it, follow me if that interests you... Then PayPal's premium valuation relative Visa and MasterCard (MA) could actually head in the other direction. Those names trade in the high 20s forward PE, while PayPal trades above 40. That presents a lot of downside risk if PayPal's growth is hit by cryptos. Assuming PayPal fetches the same multiple as credit card companies should crytpos take-off (I believe it'd be lower), that puts the stock at $35 (30% downside risk). That doesn't mean the stock would be cheap, either. That gives it a high 20s ratio. Should they begin to experience additional pressure, there is plenty more room to fall.What to doI'm going to wait. I'd like to see where cryptocurrencies go after they can support enough transactions to bring them into the mainstream. While PayPal is no Amazon (AMZN) it is certainly no fire sale either. I'd consider it expensive given the industry headwinds it faces. If you have cash burning a hole in your pocket, I'd look towards MasterCard, Visa or Amex (AXP) instead.Thank-you for reading.

(NASDAQ:PYPL) reported a strong quarter on Apr. 26, 2017, followed by a big jump on the market. Now PYPL shares are trading at their 52-week high of $50. The total return since its spin-off from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) is ~45%, 2.8x of the total return of S&P 500 during the same period. PYPL's performance is obviously decent; however, it has been a very controversial stock. Investors' concerns included the increasing competition from deep-pocket players (such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), etc.), the decreasing ""Take Rate"" and doubts on PYPL's moat. Even if PYPL has consistently delivered strong performance quarter by quarter, the shares ended up with higher volatility than the market (as measured by the S&P 500). Total Return of PYPL vs. S&P 500 since July 6th, 2015 Source: FactSetPYPL's best comps are Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). As shown in the following two charts, in the past, PYPL was trading at a discount to V and MA on both P/E and EV/EBITDA basis. Recently, PYPL has finally closed the gap with V and MA. Specifically, PayPal is currently trading at 26x NTM EPS, in line with MA, one turn higher than Visa and two turns higher than PYPL's historical average. On EV/EBITDA basis, PYPL is one turn discount to V and MA, and two turns higher than its own historical average. P/E NTM of PYPL vs. V and MA Source: FactSetEV/EBITDA NTM of PYPL vs. V and MA Source: FactSetHappy to see PYPL's recent jump, investors might be asking: what would be the upside potential from here? The consensus rating shows the average price target as $50.95 (2.4% upside from current price as of May 15), indicating PYPL is seemingly fairly priced on the market.Consensus rating Source: FactSetIn my view, PYPL has significantly higher growth potential than V and MA given its unique two-sided network, richer ""money movement"" utility and upgraded strategy of lifting customer engagement. My 12-18 month price target for PYPL is $74, representing 48% upside from current price. I expect PYPL to be a long-term winner in the payments space.Investment Thesis#1: Lifting customer engagement represents the most sustainable growth driverPYPL used to be a payment button behind eBay. Through acquisitions and spin-off, the payments use cases for PYPL have been greatly enriched. The customer engagement trajectory is indeed impressive. As shown in the below chart, PYPL's customer engagement as measured by number of transactions per active user went up from 11 to 32 during 2006 to 2017.Source: Company filingsTo increase customer engagement, PYPL is making great efforts, such as PayPal One Touch, new acquisitions, and partnerships.1) One Touch continues to lift customer engagementPayPal One Touch is the seamless one-click checkout function that eliminates the need to re-enter passwords in each secure online transaction no matter what device to pay from or what merchant to pay.PayPal One Touch Source: InternetOne Touch is now available in over 200 markets and has been adopted by 50 million users, 5 million merchants, 75% of top 1,000 US retailers and 64% of the top 500 US retailers. One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product in PayPal's history according to company blog post, which is attributable to One Touch's great benefits to retailers.One Touch User Adoption Source: Company filingsFirst and foremost, One Touch offers merchants significantly better conversion rates by making it faster and simpler for its customers to check out in a tap. The experience converts online buyers at a rate of 87.5%, outpacing all competitors, with the next closest checkout option scoring 36.4% lower than PayPal on average (according to ComScore research).Second, as PYPL COO Bill Ready noted, implementing One Touch requires no work on the retailer's part. He said while ""others in the industry are out there trying to convince merchants to integrate"" different checkout experiences and features, PayPal basically just shows up and starts ""solving problems for them without them having to do work.""2) Acquisition remains part of PYPL's core strategySince 2011 PYPL made successful transition to mobile payments through acquisitions. It has a very attractive collection of payment assets (as shown in the below chart), including PayPal Core, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and Paydiant; PayPal next-gen commerce Braintree and TIO Networks (to be completed).PYPL's payment solutionsThrough acquisitions, PYPL built up a very strong mobile payment portfolio.Venmo: Acquired in 2013, P2P payment with social media, and very popular in the Millennial generation. In Q4 2016, Venmo processed $5.6 billion in payment volume, an increase of 126%. For the full year of 2016, Venmo processed $17.6 billion, up 135%. In Dec. 2016, Venmo passed the $2 bn monthly payment volume vs. $1 bn in Jan. 2016.Xoom: Acquired in 2015; a digital solution for global remittance. People can send money home or pay bills for family members overseas in ways that are easier, secure and less expensive.Braintree: Acquired in 2013; in-app payment solution that serves top new economy players who push the boundaries of commerce, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Uber, Airbnb and Dropbox.Modest: Acquired in 2016; a mobile-commerce start-up that is currently integrated in Braintree Commerce.Paydiant: Acquired in 2015; a white-label mobile wallet and customer loyalty solution. It is currently used by Subway.PayPal Credit (otherwise known as Bill Me Later): Acquired in 2008; customer financing and merchants financing.TIO Networks (announced in Feb. 2017): Consumer bill payment.Let's take TIO Networks as an exampleIn Feb. 2017, PYPL announced the acquisition of TIO Networks for $233 million. $233 million represents a 25.2% premium over TIO's 90-trading day volume-weighted average price as of February 13, 2017. Vancouver-based TIO was founded in 1997 by CEO Hamed Shahbazi and has created a suite of bill payment services and processing network with more than 65,000 physical location endpoints throughout North America. TIO Networks processed $7 billion in consumer bill payments in fiscal year 2016 and serves more than 14 million consumers with more than 10,000 supported billers and 900 operated self-service kiosks. TIO services include: a) Self-service kiosks; b) Mobile Pay via app; c) walk-in bill payment at Global Express; and d) Softgate payment exchange for cash-based customers.TIO Networks represents very complementary businesses for PYPL. Its customers are ""more than 2 billion people worldwide who do not have affordable access to basic financial services"" according to PayPal CEO Dan Schulman. TIO Networks have built relationships with more than 10,000 supported billers and 14 million consumer bill pay accounts. There is very little overlapping between TIO's customers and PYPL's existing customer base. The strikingly different scale of each business indicates a great cross-selling opportunity, which will eventually become a multi-billion-dollar new market for PYPL, just like Venmo.This kind of acquisition strategy I think is PYPL's core strategy because: 1) Strong cross-selling opportunity that benefits from the company's very strong two-sided network. Each PYPL acquisition greatly expanded PYPL's payment scenarios and thereby it will be able to quickly ramp up users for each newly integrated payment solution. 2) Enhanced mobile payments portfolio can enjoy mobile secular growth trends. How big is the market? According to BI Intelligence, mobile commerce in the US will be $284 billion, up 338% from $65 billion in 2015.With $9bn+ in cash and $2bn + in FCF annually, I think PYPL is indeed in good position for continuous acquisitions. In consequence, customers will have more and more reasons to use PYPL. I think it would not be difficult for PYPL to grow customer engagement from 2-3 times per month to several times per week or even higher. In EU, PYPL has a proven success of 2-3 times/week engagements under the partnership with Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD).3) Partnership strategyFor investors who have followed PYPL for long, they might have noticed PYPL's upgraded strategy. Following PYPL's announcement of Visa and MasterCard partnership, PayPal furthered collaboration with more players across different industries. Specifically, PYPL partnered with Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to deploy Express Checkout in more than 1.5 million QuickBooks small businesses and self-employed customers worldwide. PYPL extended partnerships with cellular carriers, software providers, and leading consumer brands. In addition, PYPL formed strategic agreement with Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS).Partnership has two-fold benefits. First, this is essentially the way for PYPL to wind up competition. PayPal's competitors such as Visa, MasterCard, Facebook, Google, Citi (NYSE:C), Discover and FIS (NYSE:FIS) (add timing) all became its partners. Furthermore, partnership enables PYPL to accelerate customer engagement. For those partners, PYPL's strategy is ""Customer Choice"" that is collectively utilizing its platform to serve customers of all partners. In Q4 2016, since the launch of Customer Choice, PYPL gained 5.4 million net new actives - highest organic total within two yearsPYPL partnership Source: Company websiteInvestment Thesis#2: Decline of take rate reflects business expansion rather than pricing pressurePayPal's take rate is the revenue the company generates as a percentage of total payment volume earned through the PayPal platform. It is considered an indicator of how much PayPal is able to charge its clients for payments products and services. With that being said, investors are very much concerned about the fact that PYPL take rate has been declining YoY. As shown in the below two charts, before 2011, take rate was generally flat. High correlation between TPV growth and revenue growth was reflected in the chart as well. In contrast, after PYPL penetrated mobile payments market through Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, etc., the take rate started to decrease. However, I wanted to argue that PYPL's take rate decline suggested PYPL's transition to mobile payments, nothing related to pricing pressure.PYPL Take Rate Source: Company filingsPYPL's TPV growth vs. revenue growth YoY Source: Company filingsSince 2013, PYPL enjoyed increasing growth in mobile payments through Braintree, Venmo, etc. A lot of ongoing transformative things actually make the take rate measurement very problematic. I think investors should be rational when looking at PYPL's take rate change. The explosively growing TPV move then offset the decline of take rate, which I believe is the norm for PYPL's volume growth driven business.ValuationI used the DCF valuation for PYPL and my base case gets to $74/share. In addition, the following sensitivity table shows the price range of PYPL.ConclusionPYPL represents the best investment in the payments space. I expect PYPL to be a sustainable growth story because of its network effect, well-diversified product portfolio, and secular growth of mobile."
4078803,103281,2017-06-05T12:38:38-04:00,The company has already grown 35% in 2017.Partnerships and acquisitions not losing steam.Competition is scrambled.,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been one of the trailblazers in 2017 and although some think its rise is coming to an end, a closer look at the company and its surroundings paints a pretty optimistic picture.Here's where the payment provider is right now in terms of valuation and guidance. Share price recently reached an all-time high at $53.52 and the company already has numerous buy ratings attached to it from analysts.It's current guidance reads like this:- The company expects revenue to grow 15-17% at current spot rates and 17-19% on an FX-neutral basis, to a range of $12.520 - $12.720 billion.- The company expects GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.28 - $1.33 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.74 - $1.79.Analysts are also very positive in terms of their ratings.But both the company guidance and analyst targets are conservative. There is strong data that supports a far stronger growth in revenue from mobile payments and analysts don't seem to really take into account the different inroads PayPal is making in expanding its partnerships with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). (There have also been talks with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), although Bezos' giant could go it alone and create its own payments platform.)Mobile is where growth is already coming from right now, despite all the warmongering from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and their respective payment systems. Despite having hundreds of millions more customers they both haven't managed to carve a significant share and left PayPal with a smile on their face, as the latter have registered a 51% increase in mobile payments compared to Q1 in 2016.So where has this recent growth come from?There are two answers: Venmo, the peer-to-peer app that has lodged itself into the millennial lifestyle and the ""one touch"" registration functionality that allows customers to connect their device with their already existing account and never have to enter their credentials again on it.Leveraging its solid existing customer base and combining it with several solid acquisitions (Venmo was owned by Braintree, who were acquired in 2013) and continued innovation, it actually seems like PayPal has outfoxed the phone makers in their own backyard.This is what underpins this year's 35% move up and what will continue to drive it beyond, not only the consensus price of $52, but also the highest current forecast of $62.Competition is also helping out. It looks quite fragmented and no one, except for Sofort, has managed to make a dent into PayPal's growth. Judging by the numbers from Built With Pty Ltd, that tide has also been stemmed in 2017.Where is future growth going to come from? There are three angles, in terms of partnerships and innovation, that PayPal is working on that make me a believer in their continued outperformance.The first one is their deal with Alphabet/Google. On April 18th the two companies announced that PayPal users will be able to link their accounts with Android Pay, increasing the percentage of potential transactions in physical stores like coffee shops.Although this seems as the least important part of the puzzle, with physical transactions destined to become a thing of the past, there is still a huge percentage of consumers who prefer doing things the old fashioned way and they will continue to move around a significant portion of payments in the coming decades.The second is their burgeoning partnership with Facebook. The two have come together on almost every platform that Facebook owns but the ones that interest me the most are the integrations with the Messenger App back in October 2016 and with Instagram.With Instagram, PayPal has always been front and center when it came to payments. The first tests were in 2013 and with the growth of Instagram and its revenue, PayPal has always been there and will continue to piggyback on their success.The case with Messenger is one of uncharted waters. Text messaging has become ubiquitous but payments within that framework haven't, except in China and the pervasive WeChat app.Sending money via text is still looked upon as risky in the markets where PayPal has the strongest foothold (the U.S., Germany and the UK) but there could be a couple of surprises in terms of transaction volume here.The third and final angle that I'm most curious about, is the one that tells me that PayPal has the capacity to innovate at the necessary level to continue growth. Digital currencies are all the rage right now and it's only a matter of time before they enter the mainstream.What PayPal is doing in this regard can still be described as exploratory, although they hinted at integrating Bitcoin in 2014 and have since filed a patent application for a device that accepts cryptocurrencies.But this quote from PayPal board member Wences Caceres on May 23rd can be taken as a glimpse into the future of that integration: ""the Internet doesn't have a currency and it desperately needs one"".Weak competition and continued growth in online commerce pave the way for PayPal's stock price to move above expectations. Internal growth combined with existing partnerships are expanding faster than the company is calculating in its guidance. This ties stock performance to growth in mobile payments.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Bitcoin's usage, measured in transactions per day by Coindesk, continue to climb as well.As more and more services built around Bitcoin continue to proliferate, the currency's utility will continue to increase. At the end of April, there were 1,150 Bitcoin ATMs around the world. As it becomes easier and easier to both access, spend and transfer value between dollars and Bitcoin, the digital currency's popularity is in a positive reinforcing loop that is driving adoption.With a market capitalization of $25B, Bitcoin is quickly getting too big to ignore for traditional financial institutions.Where's PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) In All of This?PayPal, once heralded as the digital bank of the future, has ironically been far behind the curve in terms of Bitcoin adoption.Although the company did anounce a partnership with Coinbase in mid 2016 to allow its users to buy and sell Bitcoin, that's basically been the extent of their involvement.Rather than leading a disruptive charge to bring crypto-currencies into the mainstream, PayPal has let companies like Coinbase do the innovating.This risk-averse mentality is something that's applauded by Wall Street, but seems painfully counterproductive for a company that is predicated on being a digital bank.Products built on top of crypto-currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum continue chip away at the service offerings of established financial institutions. If PayPal wants a piece of the action, they will need to do a lot more than partnering with the startup that's beating them at their own game (Coinbase).More About CoinbaseFounded in 2012, Coinbase is on a mission to create an ""open financial system that is not controlled by any one country or company,"" they believe ""an open financial system can be a great equalizer and lift billions out of poverty while accelerating the pace of innovation around the world.""At its core, Coinbase is a online crypto-currency bank. It allows you to store your Bitcoin/Ethereum and send it to anyone with a Coinbase account, in over 33 counties.Coinbase has several core tenants of mission statement that are worth noting, the first is to be the most trusted company in their space. The second is being the easiest to use. As a happy Coinbase customer I believe they are genuinely accomplishing both of these goals and building critical brand equity with young, well-educated, tech-savvy millennials. A demographic any financial institution would drool over.The company has raised $117M since its founding, from some of the world's most respected venture capitalists and individual investors.Coinbase's main business can be split into two divisions, consumers and merchants.On the consumer side, Coinbase has over 6.7M users hosting 21.5M wallets on its platform. On the merchant side, Coinbase has 46,000 businesses using its product to accept Bitcoin/Ethereum from their customers. Additionally, the company is investing in a growing developer community that has already produced more than 9,000 apps.Coinbase's main source of revenue is derived from taking a small cut of each transaction that occurs through its platform.Although the actual figure is unknown, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong tweeted that revenue grew 2.5X in 2016.Token Browser, As An Example Of Coinbase's InnovationBeyond its flagship platform, Coinbase has launched several exciting stand alone products. Perhaps the most interesting, is a newly announced Ethereum-based mobile browser called Token.Token will allow for instant payments around the world, secure messaging and host an app marketplace. Essentially, it's Venmo 2.0, built on open-source crypto-currency protocols.Venmo is the peer to peer payment app that PayPal acquired in 2013, as a part of a deal where it bought out Braintree for $800M. Venmo has quickly become one of PayPal's top assets, and produced TPV (total payment volume) of $5.6B in Q4 2016, up 126% year over year. In Q1 2017, Venmo's TPV grew 26% sequentially to $6.8B.Coinbase's vision for Token is not only to facilitate payments but to create a peer to peer lending network. This would entail giving users a digital credit rating based on their payment histories on Token.Token's vision is the beginning of a very exciting transition into a society where instead of going to banks for loans we open an app and can solicit loans from friends, family or other individuals. A true democratization of the financial system.With a much grander vision, and crypto-currency backbone, Token has the potential to outdo Venmo in the long term if it begins to gain traction with Coinbase's core users.Although Venmo is the dominant mobile payment solution right now, the competition is coming. This is just one example of how Coinbase is slowly chipping away at different pieces of PayPal's business, and becoming more and more of a threat by the day.Why PayPal + Coinbase Makes SenseFirst, I want to say that I believe PayPal needs Coinbase a lot more than Coinbase needs PayPal. However, PayPal has enough capital to acquire Coinbase outright with no dilution, so if management is willing/wanting to sell, then we have potentially have a win/win situation.PayPal already is behind in offering services around digital currencies, and part of the reason may be hesitation to damage PayPal's brand. Acquiring Coinbase and leveraging their brand name to integrate Bitcoin and Ethereum functionality would help isolate the risk to PayPal's core image.PayPal has become a massively profitable digital payments leader, and literally has billions sitting in the bank. Although the core business is performing well know, its growth rate is eroding lower, and the lack of a leadership position in digital currencies continues to loom as the company's biggest threat.Acquiring Coinbase will not have any noticeable near term revenue impact (I'm guessing), but it will solidify PayPal's leadership as a crypto-currency bank. The combination of PayPal's capital and massive userbase could serve to turbo-charge Coinbase's growth.In the long term, I believe Coinbase will become the dominant crypto-currency bank and continue to expand its offerings to compete with more and more financial services that PayPal offers.Coinbase's CEO, Brian Armstrong, has proven to be a visionary in the space, and would be a critical asset to PayPal. If PayPal let's Coinbase continue to run its course, it won't be long before they are full-fledged competitor. This has the potential to be a real threat to PayPal's business.PayPal's ValuationAt $49/share with 1.25B shares outstanding, PayPal is trading for a market capitalization of $61.3B.In 2016, PayPal produced revenue of $10.8B and operating income of $1.6B, up 17.2% and up 8.6%, respectively. This puts the valuation at 5.7X P/S and 38.7X P/EBIT, based on 2016 numbers.Given a top-line growth rate below 20%, the earnings multiple seems very pricey. Although, it may be partially justified by the steady nature of PayPal's business and its consistent profitability.In short, it looks like PayPal's business is not adequately pricing in the growing popularity of crypto-currencies, and their potential to damage its core business. If Bitcoin and Ethereum continue their current trend, then the market may slowly begin to price in this threat, significantly impacting Paypal's lofty earnings multiple.ConclusionPayPal should go beyond partnering with Coinbase and buy the company outright.This will both accelerate top-line growth in the long-term by giving PayPal exposure to the crypto-currency trend, and mitigate the risk posed by the burgeoning success of Coinbase and its subsidiaries (Token)."

But thus far this year, PayPal's share price has already increased by more than 25%. What comes next?In my opinion, the valuation based on the DCF model will give the most accurate response.Building the DCF model for PayPal, I used the following assumptions:PayPal does not have a debt load that greatly simplifies the WACC calculation. The beta coefficient is determined based on Reuters data. Here is the calculation:So, the baseline scenario assumes that by the end of the current year, PayPal's revenue growth rate will reach 17.5%, and then it will start to slow down gradually. It is worth noting that PayPal's management is expecting the company's revenue to grow by 17-19% in 2017:In this case, the DCF-based target price of PayPal's shares is $53.5, which is very close to their current price:The optimistic scenario assumes that PayPal's revenue growth rate will reach the level of 18.5% in 2017 (CAGR = 15.6% over the next ten years):In this case, DCF-based target price of PayPal's shares is $56.4, offering 13% upside:And finally, the highly optimistic scenario assumes that PayPal's revenue growth rate will reach 19% by the end of this year (CAGR = 16% over the next ten years):In this case, DCF-based target price of PayPal's shares is $57.9, offering 16.6% upside:It is worth noting that PayPal is a relatively young company, so its beta coefficient is above 1. Assuming that PayPal's beta coefficient drops in the future, the WACC will reduce. Although, the converse proposition is also true. In order to show how these changes could affect the growth potential of the shares, I provide a valuation sensitivity table:As you can see, only if the baseline scenario is realized and the WACC increases to the level of 8.25%, the target stock price of PayPal will drop below the current level. All the other options imply the capitalization growth of the company:CONCLUSIONMy DCF valuation indicates that the current price of PayPal's shares corresponds to the border of the low range of its price. Moreover, I believe that, at this moment, the optimistic scenario of PayPal's revenue growth rate is most likely to happen.I don't have a trade position regarding PayPal shares. And I believe that to be an advantage in terms of analysis, because I am able to consider indicators impartially without subliminal motivation to see positive or negative sides even if they don't exist."
4071709,92456,2017-05-10T13:14:03-04:00,The payments business is getting more crowded.… But this business is still so far from saturation that there’s enough space for everyone.The development of Apple Pay indirectly helps to expand the market in which PayPal operates.,"Over the past two years, commenting on the quarter results of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tim Cook has been necessarily paying attention to Apple Pay, each time using more and more colorful adjectives:Q3 2016 Earnings Call:Q4 2016 Earnings Call:Q2 2017 Earnings Call:And, although Apple does not provide any figures, according to Tim Cook, Apple's mobile payment service is developing dynamically enough. But should it bother of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and its shareholders?At first glance, PayPal really has to worry. Despite the diversity of the payment services, PayPal's own vision of its future entails emphasis on development of services for merchants with a focus on the mobile segment:Source: PayPal investor relationsAgainst this background, Apple's active development of the service that allows to make payments in person, in iOS apps, and on the web, seems at least undesirable for PayPal. Thus, according to Canaccord Genuity, the active development of Apple Pay will reduce PayPal's share of online payments from 16% in 2016 to 9% by 2021.Over the past five years, iOS has been stably holding 20% of the mobile operating system market worldwide. In other words, iPhones are currently accountable for 20% of all smartphones in the world, which is about 500 million smartphones. Apple Pay is designed for the iPhone 6, 6s, 7, 6 Plus, 6s Plus, 7 Plus, and SE. In my opinion, this is approximately 40% of all iPhones, which means, that about 200 million users are potential customers of Apple Pay. For comparison, according to last quarter's data, PayPal has only 203 million active customer accounts.Apple ecosystem gives its users a very wide range of services, hence, the introduction of mobile payments seems quite logical. If I carry my iPhone with me everywhere, why wouldn't I use it to pay in stores and on websites? Therefore, the success in promoting Apple Pay is quite predictable. But in reality, not everything is as smooth as Tim Cook claims. Conducted alternative researches do not indicate that Apple Pay enjoys unconditional popularity among users.According to PYMNTS.COM, at the moment of launch of Apple Pay at the end of 2014, more than 50% of users have tried Apple Pay and used it. By March 2017, a similar proportion falls to 18.4%.Source: PYMNTS.COMSimilarly, the share of those who, comparing Apple Pay versus swiping a card at checkout by ease, safety, speed and convenience of use, estimated Apple Pay as ""much better"" has decreased over the past two years.Source: PYMNTS.COMOther statistics from PYMNTS.COM also does not indicate an exceptional popularity of Apple Pay.As you can see, it is not enough for Apple just to wait until Apple Pay wins its share of the market. A huge amount of work remains to be done in order to popularize this payment service, and not only this won't hurt PayPal, but will even help it to develop.People are extremely conservative in financial matters, therefore, more than 70% of consumer payments are still effected in cash. It is hard to believe, isn't it? Moreover, this share will decline relatively slowly, reaching 50% only in six years.Primarily, this suggests that the market of the electronic payments, let alone mobile payments, is still very far from saturation, and it is too early to talk about high competition at this stage. Only in the United States the volume of in-store mobile payments should double in the next three years. In my opinion, there is still enough space for everyone.Moreover, the technology of contactless payment with smartphones, actively promoted by Apple, activates other smartphone manufacturers, forcing them to add this functionality in the new models of gadgets, which, consequently, will expand PayPal's opportunities.Also, you should understand the conceptual difference between the strategies of Apple and PayPal in the electronic payments market:Apple Pay is a convenient and secure way for the owners of Apple gadgets to make purchases.PayPal is a convenient and secure possibility to make purchases, transactions, reserve funds for owners of any gadgets based on any operating system.Do you feel the difference is the development opportunities? Apple is developing its closed ecosystem trying to provide its clients with the widest range of services. On the other hand, PayPal is developing its ecosystem, embedding its services in the ecosystems of other companies and providing its customers with the most convenient solutions. The two companies chart their own course.To SummarizeElectronic payments are only beginning to enter into people's daily lives. Therefore, the main current task for PayPal and Apple Pay is not to compete with each other, but to accelerate the transformation of the users' preferences, which makes them partners. Moreover, the market strategies of Apple and PayPal have very little in common, which also does not imply their rigid competition.I don't have a trade position regarding Apple or PayPal shares. And I believe that to be an advantage in terms of analysis, because I am able to consider indicators impartially, without subliminal motivation to see positive or negative sides, even if they don't exist."
4068998,21815,2017-05-04T09:18:08-04:00,"PayPal came out with good Q1 figures and very good news about its P2P service Venmo.It looks increasingly likely they have one of the major payments platforms for the digital age and worries about the fintech revolution might be overblown.While we have little doubt the future contains significant leverage in the business model, this is less apparent at present than management wants you to believe.We would buy the shares if the gap fills in the graph.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) produced some solid quarterly earnings and the market moved the shares higher in the wake of these. There was indeed quite a bit to like:Here you can see how things developed:Then there was the increased guidanceThe Venmo growth is impressiveThis is a bit of a mixed blessing, of course as the for the majority of Venmo users, the service is free whilst PayPal has to pay banks a transaction fee. This causes PayPal's take rate to go down a bit, from the Q1CC:Before you ask yourself why the company has acquired Venmo, you have to consider the upside as well, here is management during the Q1CC. First the generalities, stressing the platform value and stuff:Then with a surprising monetization kicker (our emphasis):So it's all in the Venmo buy button. Millions by the end of the year, we certainly like the sound of that. Basically what PayPal is doing is using Venmo as a hip new customer acquisition tool and might have been the first company to have figured out a way to monetize mobile peer-to-peer payments.It isn't yet terribly important at 7% of PayPal's volume, but this will keep increasing and we think this is an important positive take-away from the earnings.The network takes shapePayPal has amassed an impressive list of partnersThe CEO talks in considerable length about the wonders of these alliances, albeit in sometimes rather obtrusive language (not the greatest communicator we've come across), but the benefits are clear.There is a price to be paid though in the form of lowering the take rate, or sometimes not even a take rate at all, but that's where the CEOs ""engagement"" comes in, we guess.TailwindsThere are some structural tailwinds that the company is profiting from, which are no mystery:Here is CEO Dan Schulman (Q1CC):Of course, monetizing Venmo with a buy button is a main driver of the latter.MarginsThe company has a fairly aggressive share buyback program ($517M during the first quarter alone!) that has already reduced the number of outstanding shares:There are a couple of noteworthy elements:So earnings per share (helped a bit by a decreasing share count) and revenue growth is consistent with the growth in new active accounts and the number of transactions per active accounts.Yet there is some margin creep:By no means a dramatic decline, but a decline it is. Now, SA contributor Greg Wajda has pointed out that margins are still rising on a non-GAAP basis and he rants against this:Of course, we are with him on this (as we also ranted against adjusting earnings for stock based compensation ourselves previously, here and more generally here). The practice is widespread though.During the Q&A session of the CC, management prided itself on achieving operating leverage:But a little earlier they also argued this:Big categories of expenses growing at 28% and 31%, that's certainly faster than revenue growth. Let's look at expenses in historical context:S&M and R&D are declining parts of revenue, but these are the smaller parts. We don't really see much of a decline in SG&A as a percentage of revenues. Let's take the income statement from the 8K:Well, total operating expenses were 84% of revenues in Q1 2016, but rose to 85.5% in Q1 2017. It might be us, but we don't see much operating leverage. Of course this is on a GAAP basis, perhaps the leverage is in the non-GAAP figures.Indeed, the leverage is in the non-GAAP 'other expenses' (which include customer support and operations, sales and marketing, product development, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization). But on a non-GAAP basis.The Q1 difference between GAAP and non-GAAP figures is $150M in total, split out:This is actually likely as GAAP EPS is considerably lower at $0.32 and it's only up 6% for the year, growing really much less than non-GAAP EPS and a good part of that growth actually comes from buybacks. One might keep that in mind.ConclusionWe have nothing against share based compensation, in fact, quite the contrary, especially if this practice is used to let employees share in the company's fortunes, which would be good for the economy. However, netting them out of earnings gives a somewhat distorted view of earnings, we're against this, even if the practice is widespread.In the case of PayPal, focusing on non-GAAP earnings loses sight of the fact that earnings aren't actually growing all that much, despite the impressive growth of the company. The company has to pay for its topline growth.Now, there isn't necessarily anything wrong with that either, as the increased presence could very well set the company up for achieving positive leverage in the future, and important parts of the business already generate leverage.Given the ongoing fintech revolution, the company is also right to emphasize growth over profitability.In the meantime, given the normally quite gradual share price movements in PayPal, we think it's quite likely that the shares will fill the gap that opened up in the chart after the positive Q1 earnings news, the stock is also highly overbought.We would wait until that happens before buying. Buying we would though, because it is becoming ever more apparent that PayPal is building one of the winning payment platforms, one that will profit from powerful tailwinds."
4065901,99406,2017-04-27T01:33:25-04:00,All company-specific metrics except margins are headed in the right direction.Earnings are following revenues higher.PayPal's non-namesake brands continue to excel and conquer their markets.,"IntroductionAs a user and investor in PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), I always look forward to the company's earnings releases, which prove to be contentious for investors and analysts in the few days following the quarter.As I have done a few times before, I offer up here my thoughts and analysis on PayPal's Q1 and attempt to cut through the non-GAAP EPS to let you know what is really going on with the company.RevenueRevenue has been strong at PayPal ever since it left eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), and this quarter is no exception. Revenue was up 19% yoy on a constant currency basis or 17% including currency.PayPal has set up all sorts of partnerships to drive revenue in the past two years, so even though it is a growth stock and revenue is important, I personally had no worries about strong revenue, as it was almost guaranteed with the company's partnerships outlined below.What hurt PayPal almost every time one of these partnerships was announced was analysts getting worried about margins.The core of the issue is that though the company may process more transactions, it earns less when a consumer uses a credit card and goes through another middleman like Visa (NYSE:V) or Android Pay (GOOG, GOOGL) rather than the more lucrative transactions using a debit card or bank account direct on PayPal's app or website.And that is where we head next.MarginsI find it interesting that margins have been mostly de-emphasized from the company's materials. It isn't until Slide 17 of the release presentation that you get the useful table that lays out some important metrics for the company, like take rate and transaction margin.The company cites on the right there that increased Venmo transactions contributed to the lower take rate and presumably other measures, but transactions margin fell an entire 1%, so it must be more than that.Furthermore, you can see how most of these metrics have been trending down for the time frame given, which aligns nicely with all the partnerships we mentioned above.In addition, using the actual income statement, you can see how gross transaction costs as a percentage of revenue have grown from 29.5% to 33.2% year over year.So the question then is how much and how long can the 15-19% revenue growth last, and where margins will bottom. A continued slide below 50% in a few years will likely get the analysts humming and buzzing and smack PayPal with more than a few downgrades.VenmoVenmo, PayPal's unique social/millennial focused peer to peer payment app, which it acquired a few years ago, doubled transactions since the year-ago quarter. PayPal management remarked on the call that it continues to invest and grow this platform and nurture the social nature that has made the app successful.The company is also using its existing PayPal relationship to work with vendors to also accept Venmo with almost no additional setup, training, or other hassle, since they have an existing setup to use PayPal.This is a perfect example of an actual synergy that could have been hypothesized when PayPal bought Venmo rather than the other dubious synergies most companies seem to tout, like firing some accounting or HR staff.Venmo might not yet be large enough to warrant the attention and time of individual vendors or even large stores like Macy's (NYSE:M) or Costco (NASDAQ:COST). But with PayPal's help, the app can get placed in places it can succeed, where millennials shop and are likely to use the app.A note on non-GAAP EPS/metricsI do have to lambaste the company here a bit, as it clearly gives non-GAAP EPS more prevalence than GAAP EPS in both its guidance and materials.And what might a simple payment processor like PayPal have that is so complicated and one-time in nature that it needs to adjust it out?The answer is relatively easy to find. Have a look:That's right, folks. The only thing the company is adjusting out is stock-based compensation expense. I thought this was by now accepted to be a real expense, considering it has ""expense"" in the name and GAAP. Warren Buffett, and everyone else, clearly thinks it is a real expense.The other thing PayPal adjusts out is payroll taxes for that stock compensation. Really?The only things I think are acceptable to adjust out and present are truly extraordinary things like the accounting adjustments that are necessary when the Venezuelan government nationalizes your plants and steals your assets.Employee compensation expenses that are likely to occur year after year and likely grow? No way.Finally, if you are wondering why the company does this, remember the part earlier where I mentioned margins were so important. Well, then take a look at how PayPal magically turns its non-GAAP margins positive in the chart below when they were (actually) negative.Clever, eh?Back to the positivesWith that rant out of the way, we can return to the good stuff, as there was a lot to like here. Actual GAAP EPS was up 2 cents for the quarter, and the share count was down slightly, as PayPal spent half a billion to buy back shares.Guidance was strong, as the company forecasted $1.28-1.33 in earnings in 2017. Looking back, it expected full-year 2015 GAAP EPS to be $.89-.95, so the earnings are steadily rising hiring.Payment volume, transactions per user, accounts, and most other company-specific metrics were up nicely this quarter as they have been for the past few.PayPal's balance sheet continues to remain very stellar once you subtract out deposits from customers. The company has only a billion and half dollars in long-term liabilities against $5-6 billion in cash and investments, most of which is overseas. The company has the ability to take on debt to make more acquisitions, or it can continue to use its free cash flow. That is how it acquired Braintree, Venmo, and Xoom and how it will likely pay for Tio, given the company is only in the $200-300 million range.And finally, one of the big news pieces was that PayPal announced a new $5 billion buyback authorization. This will take a few years to complete, to be sure. The company mentioned this is partly to reduce shares outstanding and also to combat share issuances for compensation.So the board authorizes spending real money to offset stock-based comp, but it is not an expense. Right!ConclusionNon-GAAP shenanigans aside, PayPal had a very strong quarter. All metrics except for margins are continuing upward. Earnings are lagging behind revenue but have grown over 43% since 2015.The company's partnerships continue to keep the core PayPal brand relevant and growing, while the other brands like Venmo and Xoom are growing and expanding nicely and look to be nearing some big milestones. Xoom is now in 80 countries, and Venmo is doubling transactions year over year even as it reaches $6 billion in payment volume."
4067942,40691,2017-05-02T14:11:34-04:00,"68% of mobile payments users are using Venmo most often.Venmo processed $6.8B in mobile payments in Q1.Rapid smartphone adoption, alongside a large unbanked population, makes the theme of mobile payments an attractive investment.","Over the last week shares of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) have moved higher by 7.2% on the back of a strong first quarter earnings report. The digital and mobile payment company reported $0.44 EPS, beating analyst estimates by $0.03. On the topline, PayPal reported revenues of $2.98B for the period, beating analyst estimates by $40M with over 17% year over year growth. Over the last year, shares of the company have returned 21%, beating the S&P's 14.7% return over the same period.I've written about PayPal quite actively in the past. I believe that PayPal's dominance in the mobile payments industry is underappreciated by the market. Mobile payment technology has come so far in the last decade. Rapid smartphone adoption, alongside a large unbanked population, makes the theme of mobile payments an attractive investment. And in my opinion, there is no better way to invest in mobile payments than to invest in PayPal.Each quarter I watch anxiously to see the company breakout it's Venmo user data. Until recently, I believe that the market hadn't noticed the jewel inside PayPal's portfolio of payment technology. If you are unfamiliar, Venmo was founded in 2009 as a way to easily transfer money for small goods. In 2012, Braintree acquired Venmo for $26.2 million. In 2013, PayPal acquired Braintree for $800 million. In short, Venmo makes it easy to send and receive money from friends and family.In the first quarter, Venmo processed $6.8B in mobile payments, more than double the volume processed in the first quarter of last year. The growth was entirely organic too. The company was able to growth without spending capital on advertising due to the viral social customer acquisition strategy. Venmo has ingrained itself into Millennial friend groups and circles. And such, Venmo has created significant barriers to entry for new mobile payment apps.In the days leading up to the quarter, a new survey of 2,170 Millennials found that Venmo is leading the category. The researchers asked the following question: ""Which of the following mobile payment apps do you use most often?""Researchers found that 44% of respondents answered ""Venmo"", 1% of respondents answered ""Square Cash"", 14% of respondents answered ""My bank's mobile payment app"",and 4% of respondents answered ""Other"". However surprisingly, 35% of respondents answered ""I don't use a mobile payment app"".In other words, of those who use a mobile payment application, 68% of users are using Venmo most often.The street has pushed parent company PayPal to think about a monetization strategy for Venmo. Management is working to make Venmo a major payment option. During the conference call, the company announced that they are opening up Venmo as a mobile payment option for merchants that accept PayPal, without any additional integrations.The future looks promising for the mobile payments industry. Venmo's user metrics and recent survey data suggest that Venmo has cemented itself atop the mobile payment landscape. And for that reason, I still believe that PayPal is the best way to gain exposure to the growth of mobile payments."
4062594,98236,2017-04-16T00:31:20-04:00,"PayPal shares continue to stagnate.The company's business continues to grow at close to 20% net of currency.PayPal continues to dominate the mobile payments space, which is growing at triple-digit rates.The feuds the company has had with credit card issuers have been more or less abated with no real damage done to this company's business model.The company's Venmo service, still not producing revenues, continues to grow at triple digits and drive other PayPal engagement.","PayPal - Some thoughts about disruption, monetization and competitionPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has not been the greatest stock to have owned in the 18 months or so since it was spun out of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in the summer of 2015. The shares are up by a bit more than 10% over that span. Most other payment shares have done quite a bit better. The IGV tech/software index is up 25%.Some observers have predicted apocalyptic scenarios regarding the company's future. Other observers have simply thought it was too highly valued. The underperformance of the shares since the company became a public entity, coupled with continued strong operating performance, has had a significantly salutary impact on valuation. The apocalyptic scenarios... well, just like those predicting the end of the world, they haven't played out yet.PayPal is a name in which investors have to look beyond the numbers in order to get comfort... or do they? It is cheaper than has been the case, and it dominates one of the greater business opportunities in the tech world - that of mobile payments. Monetizing the mobile payments opportunity along - and it reputedly has a 41% share of the space - is likely worth more than the company's entire valuation. It is going to report its results in a couple of weeks - I expect the results to continue to show positive trends - but that has been true for the other quarters since this company has been independent.The consensus expectations, as portrayed by Firstcall, are for 16% top line growth and for EPS of $.41 for the quarter and $1.72 for the year. Why should the shares work this time around when they have done so little in terms of reacting to earnings releases over the recent past? What should the shares be worth?That there are many companies in the payments space is self-evident. I believe this company presents investors with the leading opportunity in e-payments and particularly mobile payments. And it is run by leaders who have a deep understanding of the space. Trying to quantify those contentions is an undertaking that is difficult, if not impossible. And I say that as an analyst who likes numbers and prefers to quantify all that can be quantified.I might normally choose to put some kind of analysis of disruption, monetization and competition in PayPal's space further back in this article after discussing the company itself. Most readers know something about the company, and many readers use some of its services. I use it myself, and it has proven to be a useful tool for accepting payments. If you are under a certain age, PayPal, and its subsidiary Venmo, is how you send money and split the tab when you go out to eat or drink. And it how you get money from your aunts, uncles and parents.But the share price performance of this company going forward is going to relate to how it solves the problems of being a disruptor or itself getting disrupted, how it monetizes some of its free services such as Venmo and how it competes both with existing competitors and new market entrants, particularly in the mobile payments space. So, I chose to start the article with comments that I most often put at the end. The company's financials are not that complicated. Its prospects are considered by some to be more than a little murky. At the end of the day, for this company it is all about mobile payments. One can read the statistics about growth - or better yet, one can use mobile payments or use services such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) or Airbnb (AIRB). Even to a very conservative writer as I am, what is happening in the payments world is apparent.PayPal is one of the success stories of the Fin-Tech space, and its peers are a host of other firms that both compete and partner with the company for processing payments. Last quarter, the company announced partnerships with both Citi (NYSE:C) and Fidelity National (NYSE:FIS). Investors have bought into the fin-tech story of recurring revenues and modest-to-moderate growth. They have been willing to value most fin-tech shares very highly because of growth stability and visibility. The PayPal story is a little different in that the growth is a bit beyond moderate.There is some concept amongst some investors that tech in general and fin-tech specifically is a zero-sum game. Competition is frenzied, and competitors make wild, unsubstantiated claims as to how they are going to rule one little corner of the world. Mobile payments is really one of the more massive opportunities in the tech world these days. Today, I have taken a train and paid for the ticket on a mobile app. I also used my phone to pay for coffee and pastry. The apps aren't quite seamless, but they work - it is MetroNorth, and nothing regarding the railroad is seamless. In time, most payments will be made on mobile devices even by technophobes.Much of the growth for the payments space in the future is clearly going to be in its newer segments, and most particularly in mobile. It is hard to dispute that PayPal has a leadership position in mobile payments these days. It is equally difficult to dispute that there are new entrants into the space with high levels of brand recognition. Many commentators are concerned that Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), Android Pay (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon Payments (NASDAQ:AMZN) are going to damage PayPal's growth prospects in mobile. As it happens, so far none of these entrants has been particularly successful with their technology.Mobile payments itself is divided into many different nooks and crannies. One component of the space that is wildly popular amongst millennials is Venmo. Venmo is known as a service that lets parents send money to their kids in college. It is a service that can also be used to share a bar tab or a restaurant bill. But so far, it hasn't generated any noticeable revenues. Obviously, owning a site that is wildly attractive for payments within a certain demographic is a significant asset. There are opportunities to take Venmo into merchant transactions, but that is nothing likely to move the meter in the short term.As can be seen in the attachment, Venmo and PayPal simply dominate the space, and while the banks combined are pushing their alternative called clearXchange, now called Zelle, Venmo has a cult-like following amongst millennials. Does anyone really believe that the consortium of banks that owns Zelle is going to have a great deal of success in displacing Venmo. How might it do that? Given the lead Venmo has and its triple-digit growth, how might that happen? Ask your own group of millennial contacts how they pay each other and why they like Venmo. It might surprise you.How do you quantify something that is offered for free? It is all about engagement. When you invest in tech growth stocks, you try to recognize that there are business opportunities that simply do not lend themselves to current quantification. When I look at either Amazon or Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), I do so knowing that I simply can't use typical valuation parameters. Venmo is something like that in that it produces little revenue currently that is traceable to the service.Venmo and the core of PayPal's mobile payment technology were acquired by PayPal back in 2013. I commented about the transaction in a prior article. These days, that $800 million acquisition seems like one of the bargains of this decade. I seriously doubt I would be writing this article had it not happened. It is the Braintree technology stack that has vaulted PYPL into its leadership position in mobile payments. One finds the Braintree technology as the payment engine in services such as Uber and Airbnb. Many start-up mobile apps will instinctively turn to the Braintree technology, which itself has brand recognition as well as technology that makes it easy to use as part of an overall service.I have used Venmo and don't quite see its attraction as something unique or part of the college experience. But then I do not like sending money to kids because they need to go to a concert or have a big date. It is convenient that Venmo is linked to my PayPal account, I suppose, but I never had that much trouble sending money with PayPal. But, of course, I never knew that money had to be in an account in 20 minutes either. Kids!How should investors value Venmo? It is one of the less tangible assets that allows investors to develop a higher growth rate construct for the company than might otherwise be the case. It is an asset that clearly has been copied but continues to lead its field. And it is one of the reasons to invest in PayPal shares.The key reason for investors to consider PayPal is the runway in mobile payments - the part of the space where merchants pay someone to facilitate the use of mobile devices to pay for things. To a certain extent, some of the stratagems that have been developed by participants in the space have been blind alleys. The switch from card swipes to contactless cards and phone taps has seemed to be more of a solution that isn't solving a problem. Do you really care whether you swipe a card or insert it into a slot?But the use of different kinds of ecommerce experiences, and particularly mobile ecommerce to supplant physical shopping, is almost a given at this point, and PayPal is a leader in facilitating that trend.The last time I wrote an article about PayPal, I mentioned that one of the company's significant assets was its COO, Bill Ready. When investors are buying into a concept, one of the things into which they are buying is leadership. Mr. Ready doesn't get the public attention of someone like Evan Spiegel of Snap (NYSE:SNAP) or Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). But in evaluating the future of a company that is in the business of overturning decades-old payment technology, the bona fides of its leadership are key. Mr. Ready is one of the thought leaders of the mobile payments revolution. Indeed, he had been the CEO of Braintree, and his role at PayPal makes the company far more likely to come up with the next big things in the space.Again, investors can't quantify service offerings that do not yet exist. But I think it is fair to say that successfully technology investment, besides looking at traditional valuation metrics, also involves looking at senior management and their ability to innovate and make appropriate choices. Just to pick an example that is currently in style, what would Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) look like today but for the choices that were made by its current CEO in many areas over the years. The expectation is that Mr. Narayen will continue to make the right choices, and it is my expectation that Mr. Ready and CEO Dan Shulman will continue to drive the right decisions at the right times for this company.My own thought is that if investors believe in the future of the mobile payments space, they are most likely to achieve that potential through investing in a company that is run by a team that includes one of the pioneers and thought leaders in the space. I don't think most investors have the specific expertise to determine whether or not some specific feature or function that PYPL offers is unique or a competitive game changer. And I know I certainly lack that kind of ability. But it is reasonable to look at the record of PayPal's COO and believe that the company does have that kind of expertise which is likely to leave it with a significant competitive moat.The issue of MasterCard and VisaI believe one of the principal issues that investors have dealt with in making an investment decision regarding PayPal is their concern about current and potential competition between PYPL and what are perceived to be rivals, such as Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MC). Last summer, peace was declared and agreements were disclosed. The principal parts of the agreement included an agreement in which the company stops steering Visa cardholders from using their Visa cards for PayPal transactions. In exchange, Visa has opened up its tap and pay application to PayPal's mobile app. At the time the accord was signed, analysts were concerned that the economics of the deal would eat into PayPal's margins. The company's core business is to facilitate the payments users make for merchandise and services by accessing their bank balances and transferring payments to vendors. It makes far less money if the transfer comes through the Visa interconnection. PayPal and MasterCard have a similar arrangement, and most of the other major card issuers have reached agreements on working with PayPal by this time.I am not going to try to evaluate the specifics of the transactions between the rivals. There are too many statistics necessary that are not in the public domain for anyone to develop a credible analysis of what happened and what might reasonably be expected. But the future for PayPal is not so much in dealing with credit card issuers as it is in dealing with the mobile payments world. The heart of PayPal's mobile payments offering is called One Touch. More and more millennials are using One Touch as their payment methodology of choice where it is offered. And One Touch is very easy to use these days and allows customers to check out without entering their user name and password. It is the technology that facilitates payments inside of apps such as Airbnb, StubHub and ParkWhiz.The real competition that PayPal will have going forward isn't Visa and MasterCard, but Stripe, a start-up online payment company that offers many of the same set of features and functions offered by PayPal and did so in advance of the current One Touch offering. Without discussing the differences and similarities in detail, the huge growth in digital and mobile payments ought to allow for at least two successful vendors in the space.Why does PayPal draw those awful negative reviews and what do its finances actually reveal?PayPal shares may not have seemed to be controversial - and yet, their performance seemingly belies the ratings of analysts who publish their recommendations on Firstcall. Perhaps it has been the company's rather unusual tenure as a subsidiary of an unrelated entity, eBay. At this point, eBay, while still a significant component of payment volume at 16% of the total, has been dwarfed by other sources of transactions. Mobile is now 33% of total spend on PayPal. Perhaps it is the view that if PayPal is successful, it must mean that Visa and MasterCard will suffer. Perhaps it is the level of stock0based compensation expense, although at 4% of revenues and 24% of non-GAAP earnings, it is not at extraordinary levels even compared to peers in the payments space.One of the principal concerns expressed about the company since it has become public relates to its declining take-rate, which, so the theory holds, will hobble margins and ultimately growth as PayPal services become more commoditized. That theory seems less viable with passing quarters, and indeed, the decline in the take rate was the smallest in Q4 compared to all of the quarters since PayPal became an independent public company.As discussed earlier, the company entered into agreements with both Visa and MasterCard that it has artfully described as consumer choice transactions. During the 4th quarter, the impact was well within prior expectations. Volume-based expenses grew by 27%, but transaction margins remained healthy at about 58%. In all, transaction expenses were just shy of $1 billion in the quarter and were 32% of revenue for the quarter compared to 29% of revenue in Q4 2015. That difference would appear to be the impact of PayPal's agreements with major credit card issuers on margins. Overall, the company saw a 25% increase in payment volume and a 19% increase in net revenues.Over the course of last several quarters, some analysts have expressed concerns relating to the company's position in extending loans to some consumers of its service. Transaction and loan losses were 10% of revenues during the quarter compared to 9.6% of revenues the prior year, and appeared to be consistent with prior expectations for that metric.PayPal has expressed its intention of moving much of its consumer lending business off-balance sheet and utilizing third-party funding. Many observers will be happy to see a lower level of consumer receivables outstanding on the company's balance sheet. Given the interest rates PayPal charges and the demand for credit, it is not expected to have much trouble in finding third-party funding sources to enable the company to minimize the capital it devotes to credit services.During the course of the conference call, the company discussed the growth in other operating expenses outside of credit losses. Overall, operating expense on a GAAP basis rose by 8.5% year over year and was 36% of revenues compared to 38% of revenues the prior year.Overall, GAAP operating income was 15% of revenues compared to 16% the prior year, while non-GAAP operating income margin rose, due both to higher stock-based comp and depreciation expense. I think in terms of margins going forward, there are probably as many secular tail winds as headwinds. It was, I thought, telling that the company was able to actually reduce sales and marketing expense in actual dollars year on year in Q4 and to limit the increase in research and development costs to just 3% year on year. I would expect that the costs for running the network and general and administrative expense will show more favorable trends in 2017 to allow PayPal to maintain margins even if it sustains lower margins on transactions.The company is forecasting flat-to-slightly up non-GAAP operating margins in the current year, even after some impact from the costs of its hedging program and FX headwinds in aggregate. PayPal, to the surprise of some analysts, increased its expectations for revenue growth this current year by a few hundred basis points compared to its prior estimates. PayPal has some discrete service offerings - and in particular One Touch - that are taking off at this point, and the company apparently has been able to use the Venmo offering to accelerate the growth of revenues for services that bring revenue to it.The company has developed lots of payment relationships with companies such as Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and Facebook that tend to be unheralded, but which, in aggregate are apparently starting to move the meter in terms of revenue growth. (FB has recently launched a group payment option within its Messenger that is similar to Venmo, but it is not a serious rival to Venmo at this time.) PayPal is actually forecasting FX neutral revenue growth of 17-19%, just slightly less than the 21% constant currency revenue growth achieved in 2016. Given that foreign revenue is just slightly less than half of the total, FX is a substantial and essentially unknowable factor in forecasting revenue growth over any significant time period.Given the many secular tailwinds the company has, and the rapid growth of its newer services and partnerships, I think the odds favor that it is likely to over-attain revenue guidance this year, as was the case last year.Overall, shares have an average rating of Buy from the 40+ analysts who report their recommendations to Firstcall, but 13 of the analysts covering the name consider it a Hold, and earlier this week, it was downgraded by a European brokerage, National Bank, AG. The downgrade from Buy to Sell, was apparently related to valuation, but it is not all that easy to understand given PayPal's share price stagnation, both this quarter and going back over some period.ValuationIs the valuation stretched? I don't think so, because I think PayPal has made the right strategic moves and has built a commanding position in the mobile payments space that is undervalued. I think the issues that animated concern last year in terms of the company's agreements with credit card issuers seem significantly overblown in retrospect. I think it will, over time, better monetize the payments it facilitates through Venmo. And given the company's management, I expect it will continue to innovate with new payment services that will be able to generate revenue that is not yet forecasted. The recent announcement of PayPal's purchase of TIO Networks, while obviously not of huge significance in terms of currently projected financials, is an example of payment niches, as yet under-exploited, that are likely to add to the company's growth rate over time.PayPal shares closed Thursday at $42.55. With 1.2 billion shares outstanding (essentially unchanged year over year), the company has a market capitalization of about $52 billion. It has a total net cash balance of cash and equivalents, including long-term investments of $6.5 billion, which yields an enterprise value of $45.5 billion. At the current forecast revenue level of about $12.6 billion for the year, the EV/S is 3.6X. That is what happens when shares stagnate and revenues grow. At that valuation level, PayPal shares are valued at significantly below that of most other companies in the payments space, and are arguably growing significantly faster.The company is forecasting non-GAAP EPS of $1.72 for the current year with its expectation of flat margins. That is a P/E of 24.7X. Again, on a reported earnings basis, PayPal is one of the less expensive of the larger payment vendors around.PayPal is forecasting free cash flow of greater than $2.7 billion for the year, including capex of about $600 million. Last year, CFFO grew by 24% and free cash flow was $2.55 billion. I would be surprised if the company saw such a small increase in free cash flow this year based on its earnings forecast and the other trends in cash flow. But using the forecast provided by management, the free cash flow yield is almost 6% - one of the highest free cash flow yields seen in the space, and one of the higher free cash flow yields available in a company growing organically close to 20%. About 20% of the company's free cash flow is a product of stock-based comp, again a relatively low metric for that calculation. At this point, PayPal does not pay a dividend, but is buying back shares at a modest pace. Clearly, with free cash flow of $2.7 billion, it can achieve a more optimal capital allocation strategy for shareholders or execute a significant acquisition. 80% of the company's cash balance is offshore, and thus, it has been reluctant to pay the taxes necessary to redeploy the capital in order to pay dividends. Should the tax laws change, management has foreshadowed that it will reconsider that strategy, although the payment of a 1-2% dividend is not necessarily a game changer for many potential investors.It has not been uncommon amongst investors to use some form of sum of the parts to justify valuation. It is worth noting that the company most talked about in the payments space these days is Stripe (STRIP), which has a valuation of $9.2 billion. Stripe has about 1/3rd the market share of PayPal in mobile payments at the moment, as best as can be determined. Just how the volumes of services such as Uber and Airbnb figure into that calculation is not known by this writer. It is not easy to determine which service is growing faster in the mobile space. But if the math is worth doing, the mobile payments component of PayPal ought to be worth $27 billion and perhaps more. That would leave the rest of PayPal valued at less than $20 billion. How much might Venmo be worth? How much is the balance of PayPal's ecommerce revenues worth? Probably a considerable multiple of $20 billion.Stripe is a poster child as a epayments unicorn, but it doesn't have Venmo, and it doesn't power payments for Airbnb, Uber, Lyft etc.One can't buy Stripe shares, and the boyish looking founder, Patrick Collison says an IPO is not imminent. If Stripe were to do an IPO, it would almost certainly command a premium over its last valuation when it was funded toward the end of 2016. Attempting to invest in the mobile payments space, if it can reasonably done, is not a hard decision to make. I think buying PayPal shares at their current valuation is a more than reasonable strategy to accomplish that objective at a valuation that can be readily justified. Maybe not as exciting as an IPO in Strip might be, but a good investment that can produce positive alpha. It is worth looking at before earnings, I believe."
4066121,22148,2017-04-27T12:08:06-04:00,PayPal reported another solid quarter for Q1.The digital payments company produces consistently strong and growing free cash flows.The stock offers a reasonable value backed by huge stock buyback plans.,"My last recommendation on PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) over a year ago was to buy the digital payments stock alongside a $2 billion share buyback. After a big rally, the company still signals value even with the market cap soaring beyond $55 billion.At nearly $48, PayPal trades at all-time highs. Do the numbers support an even higher price?As with most of the payments-related companies, PayPal is a consistent earnings machine. The Q1 results were no different with EPS up 19% and revenues up 17% including currency impacts.The company is able to consistently ride the shift away from cash to digital and mobile payments. In the process, PayPal is able to grow active customers and hence payment volumes. Maybe even more important is the ability to ramp up engagement on a quarterly basis with the number of payment transactions per active account up 12% over last year.While the valuation was always a concern by traditional metrics such as EPS, its free cash flow generation is what makes the story very intriguing. For Q1 alone, PayPal produced $603 million of FCF and the quarterly ratio regularly tops 20% of revenues.These massive and consistent cash flows allows PayPal to return significant amounts of capital to shareholders. During Q1, the payments company repurchased $517 million worth of shares at an average price of $42.38 per share.The company has spent about $1.5 billion on the previous $2.0 billion repurchase plan leaving $488 million remaining. To ramp up capital returns, PayPal approved a massive $5.0 billion share repurchase plan providing $5.5 billion of firepower going forward.On top of forecasting 2017 free cash flow in excess of $2.7 billion, PayPal already has over $6.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet. Clearly, the company is flush with cash and sees solid value in the stock.Clearly, the stock isn't exceptionally cheap at 23x forward EPS estimates. The key investor takeaway though is that PayPal offers reasonable value while providing strong support for the stock with consistent cash flows and stock buybacks."
4065053,102101,2017-04-25T15:02:39-04:00,"PayPal is one of the 10 out of 450 fintech start-up ideas that survived the dot-com burst.With its market share and leadership in online payment, it is hard to doubt the value generating capabilities of its business model.As a result, taking a bullish position appears to be the less risky option for investors who want an exposure into the future of online payment.However, before going bullish, it will be interesting to know how strong PayPal ranks in an industry that is now being prodded with the needle of disruption.","For every investment, sustainability lies in the hand of debt and equity investors who determine how much capital should be risked for management to generate returns in excess of the risked capital.To assess the health of an idea under favorable and unfavorable macro and competitive conditions, two important valuation yardsticks stand out. Growth and returns generated in excess of invested capital.Historically, PayPal (PYPL) has been able to demonstrate strong and sustainable growth. This has been highlighted by its payment volume and active user growth. These metrics provide a leading indicator of a continuing upward ramp in revenue driven by price (margins per transaction) and volume (total payment volume).Source: SimplyWallStHowever, much of the competitive moat which has ensured increasing growth and ROIC is now being challenged. Regardless of the headwinds to future returns for investors, I believe 4 risks stand in the way of PayPal’s ability to generate positive alpha in the long run.OverpricingMA EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsThis can be determined by PayPal’s valuation relative to peers in the payment industry. While it is important for investors to pay more in excess of every dollar in revenue/earnings, it is equally imperative to ensure that valuation ratios don't veer into extreme territories. Overvaluation is generally an indication that investors are demanding less in return for every dollar of capital invested in a business. This might signal a willingness to gain market share at the expense of profitability. In the case of PayPal, a slight overvaluation is allowed for it to keep its market share which is being gnawed at by fintech start-ups and big banks that are fighting for a share of the next payment revolution. PayPal is still slightly discounted using its forward EV/EBITDA multiple. This is indicative of the market's need to discount its loan risk and declining take rate which I will delve into later.Disruptive competitionDisruption in the payment industry is being driven by the need to simplify payments for consumers at every vertical of their financial transaction. In the past, PayPal has been able to secure a stronghold in online payment, driven by consumer’s rapid adoption of a cashless payment system. While PayPal has enjoyed its fair share of its middleman fee for every online transaction that is being processed within its network, competition is shrinking margins per transaction, measured by the ""take rate."" Simultaneously, a new green field is being established in the offline payment vertical fostered by smartphones and new technologies which facilitate faster and contactless means of payment.Here is the critical point.The bearish narrative which starts from the chapter of PayPal losing out on market share and future growth potential needs to be separated from its ability to take on competitors in the offline/retail market.In terms of online card payments and transactions, PayPal has built such a wide moat in brand awareness and security that it is nearly impossible for new entrants to sustain a competitive battle with it. However, the few competitors that exist can only survive in niche markets that PayPal has either been unable to penetrate or by virtue of significant regulatory hurdles will be considered to not be in the best interest of PayPal. It will be hard for any new entrant to focus its strategy on battling PayPal’s online business, given the shrinking margins in some of the payment packages.To offset those declining margins, PayPal is expanding into the offline retail market which currently has a host of competitors including Android Pay, Samsung Pay, Apple Pay, AliPay and many more merchant products.The pushback by major retailers to allow a single dominant platform stems from the need to own the data churned from the consumer's experience down the path-to-purchase. I feel merchants might be reluctant to forgo the opportunity to collect actionable data on their users if they allow a third party payment system to dominate their offline sales.This has consigned most payment platforms to serving their own network of users. Google (GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is focusing on android app payments, Apple (AAPL) on iOS and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) on users of its devices.This remains the biggest issue for PayPal. In an attempt to take on the myriad of competition, PayPal has introduced Paydiant for merchants to create customizable payment wallets. It is yet to be established how PayPal will make a fortune on that, however, if successful, it can slow down the pushback from competitors who are planning to acquire capabilities that might disrupt the payment industry.Demand softnessSource: McKinseyDemand continues to grow as the proliferation of mobile devices coupled with the adoption of easy to deploy forms (cashless) of payment continue to drive the growth of technologies that facilitate smooth payment. Leading drivers of demand stagnation are currently indicative of more growth as e-commerce and contactless payment drives the new wave of revolution that is brewing in the payment industry. According to a Mckinsey research, total payment volume will continue to increase driven by growth in APAC (with China leading the way) and more growth will also be witnessed in North America, Latin America, and EMEA. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that fundamental macro forces will continue to serve as tailwinds into PayPal's near-term growth. However, more competition by other payment platforms coupled with FX instability might increase volatility as the payment market becomes more fragmented.Poor Sales conversionThe leading indicators of declining sales are the take rate and transaction margin. While total payment volume is projected to trend upward, the need to innovate faster and expand into new markets means PayPal will be forced to process more transactions at a shrinking take rate. This is already happening with Venmo (free peer-2-peer platform) and Braintree driving growth but recording lower margins per transaction.ConclusionInvestors will have to determine how much multiple expansion will be sufficient to support management’s investments in new playing fields required to grow market share at the expense of competition. While PayPal has the potential to profit from its new investments, there is a growing threat from competition.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4057956,22675,2017-03-26T16:10:27-04:00,"PayPal is leading the fast-growing online payments industry, which could end up making the stock tremendously undervalued.In the next 3-5 years, it will face off with ecosystem players Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google in what will be a very difficult battle.A big issue is that those players, while never in the payments space, have tremendous power and are not as concerned about margins/profits compared with increasing ecosystem usage.","Currently, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a challenging stock to value, but for very different reasons than stocks such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) that are playing an extremely long game. I'd argue that PayPal's fate will be decided to a large extent in the next five years. Why? Because despite great execution and key acquisitions, it will likely face off either directly or indirectly with the big ecosystem plays (Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)), which most of you know generally turns out to be the kiss of death.PayPal Is In A Terrific PositionPayPal is the clear leader in the extremely fast-growing online payments market, which, to some extent, is due to its early entry in the market, but also its ability to quickly become global - a feat that many competitors and analysts downplay.The leadership was also given a better chance of succeeding when it was spun off from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), which faces all kind of different issues. Thanks to terrific execution in products such as PayPal One Touch, PayPal has been able to fend off competition, increasing its number of customers and their engagement:(Credit: PayPal earnings slides)PayPal must continue to adapt quickly to a fast-changing area where an increasing number of consumers are making payments through different applications. The company leadership does seem to have the right strategy:The opportunity in mobile is incredible:(Credit: Valuewalk)Of course, that also brings competitors...The Great ThreatAll of that being said, the world is changing quickly, and an increasing number of industries are being disrupted by the ecosystem plays which seem poised to disrupt and take their share in the payments space. Some players have been able to successfully compete with the ecosystem plays, of course, with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) being one of the best examples, as it has now leveraged most ecosystems to its benefit. But, the examples are rare. Let's take a look at the specific threats they create for PayPal.Apple - The most valuable company in the world maintains a fairly closed ecosystem and has already started competing with PYPL thanks to Apple Pay, a payment method used by clients to pay for offline and online goods and services, with clear rumors that Apple will soon be getting into the P2P payments game. Apple has an incredibly valuable customer base, one of the top messaging platforms (iMessage) and controls iOS, giving plenty of incentive for not only businesses to accept (and even promote) Apple Pay, but also leverage in getting its own terms accepted.(Credit: Market Realist)Facebook - The good news is that at this point, Facebook does not seem determined to use only its own payment solution, but rather, is trying to simply have its ecosystem (especially its messaging services Messenger and WhatsApp) used as the networks to send money. That provides an incredible opportunity for PayPal, but also adds two areas of concern. The opportunity being obviously that Facebook will likely prefer working with a non-ecosystem player, and PayPal would fit perfectly. But it's unlikely that Facebook will commit to only one payment platform (unless it is its own) at any point. There's also a risk that Facebook will eventually find a way to tax transactions that occur on its network in the same fashion as Facebook and Instagram pages, where an increasing number of businesses now feel forced to advertise to reach the audiences that they built.Google - Not only does Google have the most used ecosystem in the world in Android, but it also has its own payment solution: Android Pay. Google seems determined to succeed, but will need to get better at working with others (merchants, banks, etc). That being said, Android Pay currently seems to be the most likely Apple Pay competitor.Amazon - Amazon might be the greatest threat of all, despite not being as global of a player. It has hundreds of millions of paying customers, and has been eager to increase the presence of Amazon Payments, which can now be used to pay businesses on one-time and recurring payments. Amazon's range of goods and services and total ecommerce market share has been expanding so quickly that it's impossible to ignore the threat. While many are skeptical of Amazon's desire to become an online bank because of the regulations involved, it's likely that it will cover as many areas as possible, including transfers, conversions, etc. Even in the loans space, Amazon has been quietly emerging as a big threat for PayPal and others, with annual loans in the billion dollar range according to The Information. While Amazon might be willing to work with PayPal, it will have very little leverage in negotiations (which have already started, according to Bloomberg), and Jeff Bezos will capitalize on this advantage. You can look at what Amazon ended up doing recently, aligning with Chase for a credit card, leading analysts to express concern for competing banks/credit cards such as Discover (NYSE:DFS) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).Working with any of these big ecosystems will be extremely difficult. Just think of how PayPal was reportedly cut out of Apple Pay because it was working with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). Being the ""Netflix"" of payments and being able to be present on each of these ecosystems will be an extremely challenging task.One Key Acquisition Might Save The DayOne thing that seems increasingly clear is that the concern for PayPal at this stage of the game would be much greater if it had not acquired Braintree and (which included) Venmo, which are both growing extremely quickly.Clearly, Braintree is at the forefront of the payment processing business, competing with Stripe for the growing pie.Venmo, on the other hand, has been doing incredibly well in the P2P sphere, and if the NCAA basketball tournament is any sign, the growth has been staggering:(Credit: QZ)I am a strong believer that PayPal would be in big trouble without those two acquisitions, which have been gaining traction, market share and are well positioned to do well in this new mobile era.Be Very CarefulI do believe PayPal will be okay in the short to medium term and would invest in the name, but I'd be very cautious about getting out if momentum turns. PYPL's current forward P/E of 21 is clearly a reasonable valuation given the growth and the incredible opportunity in a fast-growing space.(Credit: YCharts)There's no doubt that there will be tremendous pressure on PayPal in the coming three to five years as the ecosystem players start investing more heavily into the payments space. This will increase pressure on margins, since they are more concerned about getting market share than the actual shorter-term profitability of what they consider a feature to their ecosystem."
4060488,96466,2017-04-05T13:22:59-04:00,The current market price of PayPal's stock is near all-time highs.Revenue keeps growing continuously at impressive rates.The number of active accounts is constantly increasing.Operating efficiency needs further improvements.The target price range is around the current market price of the stock.,"With sales over $10.8B in FY2016, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the largest players in the credit services industry. The company is surrounded by competitors like Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), and American Express (NYSE:AXP) (net sales $15.9B, $10.8B, and $32.1B in FY2016, respectively). Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) may also be viewed as a competitor in the payments business, but its payments unit does not generate more than $800M in annual revenues, as per the latest 10-Q report.PayPal's shares gained 10.3% year to date. Over the year, the stock has grown in value by 11.5% compared to 20.6% and 17.2% earned by the credit services industry and the S&P 500 index, respectively (see Diagram 1). The stock has increased by 28% since the company's IPO in July 2015. The current price is around $43 per share, which is a little lower than the all-time high of $44.24 reached in October 2016 (see Diagram 2).Diagram 1(Source: Morningstar.com)Diagram 2(Source: Nasdaq.com)The latest 10-K provides some interesting data for analysis. The annual revenue has increased by 17.2%, having reached a record level of $10,842M in FY2016. The three-year average growth rate is 17.3%, which is much higher than the benchmark. The three-year average net income growth also is significantly higher relative to the industry (See Diagram 3). PayPal expects revenue to grow 15%-17% this year. Taking into account these data points, we expect the sales growth rate to be around 17.6% in the next two years and then to decline below the level of 17%. As a result, our key scenario is quite optimistic in nature.Diagram 3(Source: Morningstar.com)Now, let us analyze PayPal's customer base.The number of active customer accounts has grown by 3% in Q4 FY2016. The total number of active accounts has reached a level of 197 million. The quantity of accounts has been increasing at an average quarterly rate of 2.7% during the last three years. As you can see in Diagram 4, there's a linear trend in the growth of PayPal's customer base. This relatively modest figure explains only about 20% of growth from the company's revenues: the rest seems to be driven by increases in average revenue per user. Investors should keep that in mind when projecting revenues in the mid-term.We would like to draw your attention to the fact that the number of transactions per active account has been growing faster than the number of new customers. The average quarterly rate is 2.8% during the last three years (see Diagram 5). This may imply a high level of loyalty to services provided by the company.Diagram 4(Source: Statista.com)Diagram 5(Source: PayPal data)PayPal's operating efficiency does not look great at all. According to figures presented in Diagram 1, there is a lot of room for improvement. The company's operating margin stands at 14.6%, which is about 50% lower than the benchmark. Notice that the operating margin has been on downtrend since FY2013. The net income margin is about 4.5% lower than the market average. We expect further downward pressure on the net income margin in FY2017.Capital expenditures as a percentage of revenues have declined by 6.2%. Research and development spend has been in decline over the last five years. The shrinking of capital spending and R&D will likely affect revenue growth and product offerings in the long term.Diagram 6(Source: Morningstar.com)DCF Model: We would like to strengthen our financial analysis by including a financial model to conclude the fundamental valuation of company's shares. The DCF model is presented in Diagram 7.The model shows that, after adjusting for balance sheet items, the fair value of equity is around $53.7B. Consequently, the stock's fair value is around $44 per share, which is 2% higher than the current share price.Diagram 7(Source: Morningstar.com, Author's DCF Model)Our analysis is based on certain assumptions. The sensitivity analysis covers a range of possibilities resulting from deviations from the base scenario. Assumptions related to WACC and the terminal EV/EBITDA multiple show that the fair price range is between $42 and $47 per share. This means that the target price range is just around the current market price of the stock (see Diagram 8).Diagram 8(Source: data - Morningstar, Model by author)PayPal seems overvalued by all comparable ratios (see Diagram 9). The potential decline in the P/E ratio is around 50%, in the P/S ratio - nearly 30%, and in the P/B ratio - approximately 50%, relative to median market figures.Diagram 9RecommendationPayPal's valuation depends largely on the growth of average revenue per user around the world. The current above-average ratios confirm the market's belief in the company's top-line growth and yield little to no margin of safety at current price levels. The biggest risk for current investors is seeing revenue growth slowing down faster than expected. This possibility will inevitably lead to a large haircut to the company's market value (remember LinkedIn). In our opinion, the risk is not justified by expected returns, which are already accounted for in the current share price.We suggest the target price for PayPal's stock to be around $44.5 and the fair price range to be between $42 and $47 per share. We recommend staying away from this stock at the moment and aim at an entry price point of around $40 per share.Societe Financiers is an investment research team focused on long-term, long- and short-only ideas.

4052116,70365,2017-03-05T03:46:20-05:00,"From price-to-earnings perspective, Paypal's shares trade at a premium compared to those of established payment facilitators - Visa and MasterCard.However, earnings can be easily manipulated and nothing provides a better picture of a company's prospects than its cash flows.Based on my DCF model, Paypal's shares currently have 36% upside potential.","Investment thesisSince PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) spin-off and its second IPO in July 2015, the company's shares have added a little over 20% and slightly outperformed the broader market. Despite relatively high earnings multiple, PayPal's extraordinary free cash flow growth will likely help the stock to stand out also in the upcoming years.Revenue growth confirms that PayPal's concept is sustainableAccording to Reuters financial highlights, annual sales growth over the past 3 years has reached a rate a little over 17 percent, which confirms that the business has met the first condition of a successful story. As Dr. Andrew Stotz, CFA, put it, revenue growth is a ""proof of concept"", or in other words, proof that the market wants your product. If a company moves its products or services up through the value chain, it can afford to raise prices. Therefore, revenue growth can either come from increased volume of sales, increased prices, or both. Lastly, a long-term track record of revenue growth indicates that the business model is economically sustainable and innovative enough to keep up with the pace of the changing world.Looking at peer revenue growth since PayPal's IPO, Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) are clear laggers. Over the period of almost two years, the company's twelve months trailing revenue has climbed by 35 percent, whereas that of Visa and MasterCard have increased just by 24 and 14 percent respectively.An asset-light business model facilitates scalabilityIndisputably, one of the company's key strengths is its asset-light business model which facilitates PayPal's expansion and growth with minimal incremental cost. Unlike capital intensive businesses, PayPal has the flexibility to expand its reach to a new location, partners and customers at the simple click of a button. This ultimately allows the company to focus on core operational opportunities and risks, thereby extracting the greatest value from R&D and formation of strategic partnerships generating synergistic effects. As I learned from an article of my SA fellow, asset-light businesses also belonged to favorite investments of famous investors such as Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.High P/E, Low P/FCFAlthough PayPal trades at a valuation premium from price-to-earnings point of view, free cash flows give a different picture. At the time of writing this article, PayPal's twelve months trailing price-to-earnings ratio stands at almost 37x, while the company's twelve months trailing price-to-free cash flow hovers around 21x. As free cash flows are generally harder to manipulate than earnings, PayPal's overall multiple valuation conveys a positive image.Outstanding FCF growthMoreover, PayPal's growth rate of this key measure belongs to the highest within its peer group. Over the period PayPal's shares have been publicly trading, free cash flow has expanded by 44 percent and does not show any signs of slackening. With an estimated free cash flow growth of 16.9%, Peter Lynch's variation of its famous earnings line projects five-year annual rate of return to reach approximately 13 percent, which is well above the broader market's long-term average. Should the current free cash flow growth positive surprise track record continue, we may see even higher returns.DCF analysisBased on my blended DCF model, PayPal's shares offer more than 30 percent upside potential. Under the perpetuity growth version, fair value of the stock is around $49 dollars, assuming terminal growth rate in perpetuity of 5 percent. Under the EBITDA multiple approach, the intrinsic value is $67 dollars if we assume that the current EV/EBITDA (as calculated by Capital IQ) will not change.The bottom lineClearly, PayPal is a long-term buy. As more and more people get used to various alternative payment options in their daily lives, some experts from the financial industry even think that payment plastic cards will eventually disappear. With globalization as a tailwind and earned trust of more than 180 million users, PayPal is set for continued growth in the upcoming years. Even though there are many new entrants to the global payment processing industry, PayPal's position is not likely to be threatened due to strong relationships with customers it has built over the past several years. As one saying put it, trust takes years to built, seconds to break and forever to repair.Author's note: To bring similar articles to your attention, please consider subscription of my SA feed by clicking on the ''Follow'' button at the top of this page, or alternatively, connect with me on Twitter.Additional disclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion and do not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

4057725,92456,2017-03-24T10:40:52-04:00,Digital payments market is only at the beginning of its growth due to the inertia of human habits.Key quantitative and qualitative parameters of PayPal business show stable growth.The market underestimates PayPal.,"All other things being equal, the most attractive companies for investment are those that:In my opinion, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) meets all these criteria.Let's start with the overall capacity of the online payment market.The development of IT technology outstrips human habits. According to a study by DIGITAL PAYMENTS 2020 conducted jointly by Google and The Boston Consulting Group, two years ago, the cash and non-cash payments were accountable for 78% and 22% of payments respectively. Today the situation has not gone away from this ratio, and these shares will be equal only by 2023.It is expected that among non-cash payments, the highest growth rate will be shown exactly by the digital payments, which will be accountable for 37% of all payments by 2025.Of course, the continued growth of the mobile Internet will affect the digital payments market. For example, according to research by Ovum, by 2019 the global user base of all types of mobile payments will reach 4.8 billion, despite the fact that two years ago it did not exceed 700 million.Directly in the United States, according to eMarketer, 31% of smartphone users will make mobile payments by 2019 (in 2016 this share was 19%). And the total value of mobile payment transactions in the US will grow by 128% YOY only in 2017, amounting $61.75 billion.So, as we see, the digital payments market is just beginning to evolve, and at this stage, it is difficult to overestimate its potential.Let's proceed directly to PayPal.The number of active customer accounts of PayPal has been growing at an average annual rate of 11% per year during the last two years with no signs of deviation from the trend. Here it is important to understand that each new active PayPal account adds value to PayPal in the eyes of the clients not using the company's services. In other words, the more of your friends use PayPal, the more likely, sooner or later, you also will have a PayPal account. It is a network effect. And so I believe that in the future the growth rate of PayPal user base will increase.The number of payment transactions is also growing steadily by an average of 24% annually, which exceeds the rate of growth of active customer accounts. PayPal customers tend to increase the frequency of use of the company's services.Accordingly, the number of payment transactions per active account is steadily growing:I've already mentioned that the mobile payments market would witness rapid growth in the future, and it is nice to see that PayPal corresponds to this trend. Last year, mobile total payment volume of PayPal grew by more than 50%, and by the end of this year, it will probably reach $50 billion.For the two previous years, the share of mobile payments in total payment volume of PayPal grew from 21% to 31%. This is encouraging because adaptation to the era of mobile Internet is integral to the success of virtually any company in the future.I would like to touch on Venmo, acquired by PayPal in 2015 together with Braintree. Total payment volume of this mobile payment service in Q4 2016 grew by 126% YOY providing almost 6 per cent of the total payment volume of PayPal. In my opinion, this was one of the most successful PayPal's investments for now.It is important that PayPal is developing with approximately equal activity in both the United States and the rest of the world. According to Q4, the ""International"" segment was accountable for 47% of the total revenue of the company. Such diversification of geographical sources of revenue is always a good thing.A few words about how popular PayPal is in the global world of e-commerce. According to Datanyze, PayPal is installed as a payment system on 75.89% of websites in the United States:And here is the data on the other key countries:As you can see, only in South America the share of PayPal does not exceed 60%. On the other hand, in Japan PayPal is almost a monopolist. It is very important that PayPal has already entrenched in leadership positions in India and China, the e-commerce market potential of which is very far from exhaustion.Among the key financial indicators of PayPal, I would like to highlight the dynamics of Free Cash Flow, consistently growing since the separation from eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). The steady increase in free cash flow amid revenue growth and zero debt means that PayPal's opportunities to acquire new companies, pay dividends or implement reverse repurchase of its own shares are rising. Therefore, the sustainability of company's capitalization is growing.PYPL Free Cash Flow (Quarterly) data by YChartsAnd now the fun part - even with all these positives, you cannot say that PayPal is overrated.Comparing PayPal with Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) through the most versatile EV/EBITDA (Forward) multiplier, we find that PayPal is substantially cheaper, although the gap is reducing.PYPL EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsWe get the same result using P/E multiplier (Forward):PYPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsPUTTING IT ALL TOGETHERPayPal operates in the market, the growth potential of which is not limited even by the following decade. Moreover, the company already occupies the leading positions, has high brand awareness and demonstrates steady qualitative and quantitative growth. At the same time, PayPal is clearly not overrated. I think this indicates that a long-term investor should consider adding PayPal shares to his portfolio."
4038192,20256,2017-01-20T06:25:21-05:00,Strong trading methods generate diverse ideas.Sometimes specific knowledge is more important than system.Knowing how to balance gets the best result.,"Last week's Stock Exchange illustrated how human traders could call upon models as ""consultants,"" effectively creating their own trading room. If you missed the post, please check it out. This week the gang is short on fresh ideas - and I vetoed one of them! We never reach for new trades, and that itself is a good tale.My crew varies widely in reading skills. Felix reads everything - and very carefully. Oscar reads the sports section. Holmes is a dog. Athena does not read since she already knows everything. It is my job to keep up with relevant world events, and our modeling guru (Vince) to create and monitor systems. One way that we judge our team is by comparing our approach to the recommendations of Brett Steenbarger. He is the world-class leader when you want to combine the theoretical and the practical. This week he explains why trading methods need a deep foundation.This is great advice! Traders who sit staring at a screen when nothing is happening are simply wasting time. It also illustrates the usefulness of having teammates to provide other ideas and spark the thought processes. Let's take a look at this week's ideas. As usual, I will conclude with a brief observation.Getting UpdatesWe have a new (free) service to subscribers to our Felix/Oscar update list. You can suggest three favorite stocks and sectors. We report regularly on the ""favorite fifteen"" in each category - stocks and sectors - as determined by readers. Sign up with email to ""etf at newarc dot com."" Suggestions and comments are welcome. In the tables below, green is a ""buy,"" yellow a ""hold,"" and red a ""sell."" Each category represents about 1/3 of the underlying universe. Please remember that these are responses to reader requests, not necessarily stocks and sectors that we own. Sign up now to vote your favorite stock or sector onto the list!This Week - When to Reject a Trading IdeaHolmesThis week I'm buying Fomento Economico (NYSE:FMX), a distributor of soft drinks, owner of small format stores, with investments in the Heineken Group.For the last year, this stock has (until Nov 7th) bounced between the mid-80s and mid-90s piquing my interest in a trade. Then (and fortunately) before I had the chance to pull the trigger, it swooned down to 75 and has been basing there for the last 2 months. I don't really understand why it dropped so quickly and so precipitously, but now that it's basing, I don't care.So, I'm buying here with a tight stop, 72, and looking for a move back into the mid-80s. It is a nice risk/reward setup.J: You said that you are buying. Did you come into some money?H: Uhh... I meant that I am recommending to our clients.J: It is an interesting idea, but we are not making the trade.H: Why not? It fits my criteria very nicely.J: On rare occasions, we humans override decisions from the trading models.H: Why would you ever do that?J: Because we know the criteria you use and monitor facts that you might not be seeing.H: I see the stock price, volume and other technical indicators. What more do I need to know?J: Sometimes there are dips that do not really provide a near-term rebound potential. In this case, our new president is talking tough on trade with Mexico. The peso is lower. A time to buy may come, but there are much better opportunities right now.H: What is a president?J: That is exactly what I mean!AthenaI admit it. I have nothing new this week. The current market has not generated fresh, strongly-trending stocks.J: That is fine. As you know, it is a mistake to reach for trades. Stick to those that have a significant edge. How about reviewing one of your recent choices?A: My pick of Zions Bancorp (NASDAQ:ZION) hasn't done much yet. You were skeptical from the beginning. You said that you liked the sector but it had gone too far, too fast. I had originally planned to hang on for a few weeks at most. Part of me feels like it's time to get out of this holding and move on to the next thing.J: This is another name caught up in the Trump transition speculation. When the expectations for short-term interest rates get some clarity, the bank stocks will react. This holding is OK - for now.FelixI will once again begin with my responses to reader votes for the favorites list.My list provides rankings within each zone, as well as the basics about buy, hold, and sell. The list includes the top overall vote-getters from our (free) subscription list as well as some new requests I got during the week.J: The stocks are about the same as last week.F: The list changes, but only as the reader favorites change. I encourage my fans to submit requests.J: The order of the ratings has changed. Are you going to resume showing us the week-over-week comparison?F: I am thinking about that problem. Some of the stocks were not rated last week. For the moment, readers must follow their favorites each week.J: Maybe we'll get some good new suggestions. What is your featured stock for this week?F: You will not like my answer. I have nothing new this week.J: That is what you said last week! Aren't we still reviewing your request for a raise?F: Yes, but you should base your decision on my results, not the number of picks. My holding period is longer. As you know, I have had the best performance since you added me in September. I have been better than the dog, and a lot better than Oscar.J: The lawyers say that we cannot discuss performance online - only when we have an investor request. Instead, how about reviewing one of your recent selections?F: My recent pick of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is sure to make Athena jealous. Since I recommended it on December 29, the price has popped a tasty 3%. Of course, short-term returns aren't really my thing. I'll probably be holding on here for another few months, at the very least.J: That has worked out well. I agree that it is consistent with some of your other long-term holdings.OscarHere are my ratings for the top reader interests. There are still three open slots, so keep the questions coming.J: Interesting. What do you have for us this week?O: I'm getting into a new sector this week: Healthcare Services. Just look at the chart for Humana (NYSE:HUM). It's ridiculous. I don't think I've ever seen a 50-day moving average shoot up at a 45-degree angle before. Now you are the public policy guy, not me, so does this really make sense?J: No one really knows just yet. We know that there will be a ""repeal and replace"" policy on ObamaCare. The outlines of this are still pretty vague. I have written on this subject several times; I am standing back until there is more clarity.O: You cannot always sit on the sidelines. This is worth a shot. As far as time frames are concerned, I almost certainly won't hold onto this for longer than a month. That is, unless someone who reads something other than the sports section can find a reason to do otherwise. BTW, I think there could be some upsets this weekend.J: Isn't your fantasy football season over?O: Yes. I am working on becoming an NBA expert while I wait for March Madness.ConclusionOur models provide diverse ideas, but that is only the starting point. Every trader needs a team to provide ideas, but also the capacity to reject suggestions that are off base.Diversity in Ideas is a Strength, but Be Ready to Veto!"
4046429,101421,2017-02-15T16:41:32-05:00,PayPal intends to acquire bill payment provider TIO Networks for $233 million in cash.TIO has developed a multi-channel bill payment service that serves online users and under-banked offline users.The EPS-neutral deal represents a bridge to bring under-banked offline consumers into PayPal's system.I'm bullish on the acquisition over the medium term as a source of existing customer lock-in along with a source of new customers.,"Quick TakePayment processor PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) has signed a definitive agreement to acquire TIO Networks (TSX:TNC.V) (OTC:TNCGF) for $233 million in cash.TIO operates a multi-channel network of bill payment services and technologies for online and offline customers.The purchase promises to reap benefits to PayPal in the medium term by expanding and extending its offerings into bill pay, which can be an effective customer loyalty service and way to source new customers in offline and under & non-banked markets.There is no immediate accretion to PayPal from the deal, but I await its plans for investing in the new service suite to capitalize on the acquisition.Target CompanyVancouver-based TIO was founded in 1997 by CEO Hamed Shahbazi and has created a suite of bill payment services and processing network with more than 65,000 physical location endpoints throughout North America.The company processed $7 billion in consumer bill payments in fiscal year 2016 and serves more than 14 million consumers with more than 10,000 supported billers and 900 operated self-service kiosks.TIO's MobilePay bill payment service is highlighted in the video below:(Source: grumomedia)TIO operates a multi-channel family of bill payment services designed to make it easier for users to pay their bills on time:Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryThe all-cash deal in the amount of $233 million represents a 25.2% premium over TIO's 90-trading day volume-weighted average price as of February 13, 2017.PayPal, which had $9.8 billion in cash on hand as of December 31, 2016, should have no trouble funding the deal with available cash.TIO's FYE July 31, 2016, revenue was reported as $57.1 million, so PayPal is paying 4x trailing revenues for the deal.Given that PayPal's Price/Sales multiple is currently 4.66x, the purchase price is not out of line considering that TIO is operating at $7 million EBITDA and generating significant operating cash flow.Management stated that 'there will be no change to PayPal's previously communicated fiscal 2017 guidance and three-year outlook based on the acquisition of TIO.'There are three apparent rationales for the acquisition:So, TIO promises to act as an on-ramp into PayPal's electronic payment processing service for under-banked or non-banked consumers worldwide.PayPal appears to be paying a reasonable price for this logical extension of its electronic payment service by extending and expanding its offerings and most importantly, adding on offline footprint that can act as a bridge to bring new customers into the online world.I view this deal as a positive for PayPal and look forward to hearing how it is going to roll out more offline access in new geographies to capitalize on the investment.I write about IPOs, follow-ons, secondaries, and M&A.

4032730,62963,2016-12-26T09:44:14-05:00,The secular shift from cash to electronic payments will continue.PayPal has a strong competitive position.Operating margins will be stable and may increase modestly.,"PayPal (PYPL) is the leading global digital wallet and a leader in mobile and e-commerce payments. It operates a proprietary global technology platform that connects merchants and consumers around the world.Industry - Electronic PaymentsThe shift from cash and cheque to electronic payment will continue. 85% of global consumer transactions is cash (PayPal Analyst Day 2016). The use of cash is less in advanced economies and over time, as payment networks improve, emerging economies will accelerate their move away from cash. This trend supports growth rates in electronic payments, which are a multiple of nominal GDP growth.The adoption of mobile devices will continue to be a tailwind for electronic payments. Mobile devices will blur the distinction between online and offline, and mobile devices will begin to do both. Further, consumers in emerging economies are using smartphones; sometimes this is their first access to a computer. Emerging economies will be a huge tailwind for payments companies.Finally, another tailwind is e-commerce. The chart below shows e-commerce will continue the momentum and is expected to reach 12.8% of all worldwide sales. The opportunity for payments is vast and PYPL CEO Dan Schulman sees the TAM growing to $100 trillion (PayPal Analyst Day 2016)Business ModelPayPal's operating margins are lowest when customers choose credit cards to pay since it has to pay higher credit card-related fees through to the issuer of the consumer's credit card. Margins are highest when customers use transaction bank accounts to pay, as the fees it pays to banks for this are lowest. Financially, it makes sense for PYPL to steer customers to bank accounts where PYPL clips the higher margin. So, when PYPL announced its customer choice initiative, the share price was under pressure as there was concern over margins. Under PYPL's customer choice initiative, the customers will have more choice on the payment method and may increase the use of Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) credit cards in PayPal and Venmo wallets.PayPal believes customer choice will increase customer engagement, retention and activation and will increase partnership opportunities. Customer choice is an opportunity for PYPL. However, there is concern on margins. To allay some investor concerns, management provided three-year guidance in its recent earnings outlook and has forecasted stable and growing margins.Barriers to entryIt is extremely difficult to establish a payments network, because there needs to be simultaneous acceptance of the network by both consumers and merchants. PYPL has 192 million consumer accounts and 15 million merchant accounts. This is something Square, Inc. (NYSE:SQ) does not have as Square scales its business primarily with merchants. SQ offers a strong suite of merchant solutions but doesn't have relationships with consumers. For the moment, SQ is on track to reach free cash flow positive this year. However, it will need to scale further to reach the margins of the likes of PYPL.Competitive DynamicsAccording to PYPL S-1, its list of competitors is far too large to list in this article. Payments is a very competitive market. We believe the TAM is large enough for many players to reach sufficient scale and succeed. We also believe PYPL will continue to succeed for the following reasons:What really mattersTwo things are critical for investors in PYPL. Competitive dynamics and operating leverage. Competitive dynamics was discussed above.As we assess the operating leverage potential, it's worth pointing out PYPL is not MasterCard and will never have the margins of MA. As shown in the chart below, PYPL's take rate has declined recently but TPV has accelerated. This is largely a result of merchant mix and product mix and Braintree's take rate.The good news is PYPL can drive down fixed costs to offset the fall in take rate. The white line in the diagram below shows non-volume driven expenses and these are going down as a percentage of revenue. Further, non-volume related expenses are 40% of revenues, and of this 40%, 75% is fixed. Therefore, 30% of all PYPL expenses are fixed.We believe CFO John Rainey was hired into PYPL to drive down the fixed costs and take costs out of the business. PYPL provided a three-year outlook in its recent earnings release that operating margins will be stable to growing from the current level of around 20%. We believe PYPL can increase margins significantly. However, it has decided to sacrifice expanding margins by implementing its customer choice initiative, which will sustain revenue growth and increase partnership opportunities.Peer Review/ValuationsPYPL has the fastest growth rate and lowest PE ratio, as the market sees PYPL as having limits on its operating leverage and operating margins. We have left SQ off the table above as SQ isn't profitable and needs to be valued using either free cash flow or sales multiples. No, that's not a typo, Visa has 65% operating margins. We can see V and MA trade at a slight premium to PYPL as they are effectively duopolies in card networks who are still driving operating leverage.Key RisksAs mentioned earlier, PYPL has a strong competitive position. Some of the key risks include:Investment SummaryPayPal is well-placed to benefit from the secular shift to electronic payments, and is progressing well in the mobile space. PYPL's two-sided network is its secret sauce; PYPL has a relationship with both consumers and merchants.Xoom and Venmo have strengthened PYPL's consumer offering as PYPL begins to offer new features and services to consumers. Braintree and Paydiant have strengthened PYPL's merchant business and will allow PYPL to take on Stripe.We expect PYPL to continue to scale its business and become more valuable in the overall payments ecosystem. Customer choice will increase opportunities for partnerships and to grow. Operating margins will remain stable and may increase over time. We recommend buying shares in PYPL at current levels."
4037409,98236,2017-01-17T16:16:16-05:00,"PayPal shares are somewhat controversial these days as investors and analysts debate if the company can achieve upside to current forecasts.The company will be reporting Q4 and full year 2016 results in less than two weeks. Based on strong macro tailwinds, I expect to see a beat.The company's investments in mobile technology and its Venmo platform are showing explosive growth that is helping to drive market share gains.The company continues to weather competitive announcements with the signing of numerous new customers and market share gains.Valuation metrics are surprisingly reasonable if the company is able to achieve its aspirational goals.","PayPal - A discussion of moats and sauces and spoons to stir the potPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is soon to report earnings for its fourth quarter and 2016 and to provide a guidance update. The call is scheduled after the market closes on Thursday, 1/26. Is this a good time for investors to enter the name? I wrote about PayPal in a positive fashion back about six months ago, and have written about several other payment companies as well. Not to hold anyone in suspense. I will be reprising and updating the positive investment case for the name based on the specifics of its strategy and the macro environment in which the company exists. But more than that, I think for those contemplating making an investment in PayPal shares, the time to do so is most likely before rather than after the earnings release and conference call.In the July quarter, investors were unhappy with the results although they were basically in line and the shares fell 10% in 10 days while tech shares, in general, appreciated marginally. Back in October, the shares appreciated by 10% the day after earnings. Almost all the alpha the shares have seems to take place in the wake of earnings calls and that was certainly the case the last two quarters.I don't purport to have an informational advantage on how this quarter might have turned out. Given that e-commerce sales were strong this late holiday season and that apparently the trend toward mobile e-commerce continued unabated, I would imagine that PayPal may have seen a corresponding upside to its business. And as there are some high-profile analysts who do not think that can happen, it suggests that there is the potential for positive alpha in the wake of the earnings call. But I am not about to suggest that I have anything like second sight.The payment space is highly competitive with a host of companies that are sustaining organic growth in the mid-single digits and have had incredible stock-market performance over the past decade, although 2016 was a year in which the share value for most companies in the space more or less marked time. A couple of months ago, a contributor on this site advanced a thesis suggesting a 70% downside risk in the shares of PayPal. The shares are perhaps relatively controversial in the payments space. 41 analysts report their ratings to First Call. 26 either like it or love it, with the ""like its"" marginally outweighing there more enthusiastic brethren. The naysayers number 13 and there are two lonely underperform ratings. The average price target for the shares shows 12% appreciation for the year, with revenues forecast to grow by 17% and EPS forecast to increase by 15%.17% revenue growth for one of the largest payment companies is no mean feat when most of the rest of the payments pack is growing in the mean single digits. Rivals Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) are both forecast to grow at an 11% rate.With so many commentators spewing electrons on this name, it is not an easy undertaking to find unique and insightful things to say. I saw another commentator on this site apologize the other morning about perhaps being redundant or boring - of course, he was commenting on one of my favorite dart targets, Paul Krugman. I won't apologize for writing about PayPal but will hope that I am producing some better understanding of the company that leads readers to make more informed investment decisions.PayPal's Recent PastI first wrote an article about PayPal back in July. The shares are up 15% since I initially wrote my article despite not beating headline estimates in either of the quarterly reports since that time. Over the same period, the IGV index rose by 7% and Visa shares rose by 9%. So, there has been some modest level of positive alpha for the shares over the past six months. A significant level of controversy has grown up amongst some analysts simply because of the share price performance and concern that the company will be unable to exceed estimates going forward.Although it has been months since last quarter's results were released, some of the numbers that were part of the earnings presentation bear a bit of current scrutiny to see if the concerns about the potential for the company to beat current consensus expectations might have some validity. The overall growth of the payment business is and has been quite a bit faster than the growth in retail sales and that is likely to continue that trajectory for the foreseeable future. Mobile payments are increasing their wallet share of the total payments pie. Just about all payment vendors offer some kind of mobile payment option, and mobile payment growth is an increasing component of the landscape. If there is one single factor that has and is likely to continue to set PayPal apart from its competitors, it is the success it has in mobile. At the end of the day, PayPal's growth numbers, when compared to the other larger payment vendors, are really on a different trajectory altogether.Last quarter, PayPal recorded an 18% growth in revenues - 21% in constant currency. That was a bit faster than the growth in Q2 and was driven both by increases in transaction revenue but also by other valued-added services which grew by 28% in CC.Part of that growth was a product of the company's One Touch mobile solution and Venmo, which is a way of sharing payments and sending money to friends. Apparently, amongst millennials, Venmo facilitates cool exchanges that somehow enhance the payment experience. I actually have a Venmo account that a friend tried to set up for me - needless to say I have never used it as I simply am not cool enough to have fun paying for something. If I knew how, I would probably close the thing - but far be it for me to gainsay what is working.I am not going to try to rank either One Touch or Venmo in terms of their user experience or functionality compared to other options that exist for achieving the same result. I am the last person to ask how engaged users of these services feel when they buy something or send money. But I do know that both services exist in a fast growth environment and their results suggest that potential users see their benefits. Venmo processed almost $5 billion in payments last quarter, a 131% year-on-year improvement in that metric.Mobile payment volume for PPYL increased by 56% last quarter to nearly $26 billion. The growth in mobile and Venmo payments are the main drivers of what has allowed PayPal to grow share in its space and they really represent the opportunity the company has to exceed estimates in 2017. Last quarter, mobile payments reached 29% of TPV, up from 24% all of 2015.Although a bit hard to see, the company is enjoying some leverage at scale. Excluding Xoom, a company PayPal acquired a year ago, its other expenses grew 9% compared to total revenue growth as reported of 18%. That is a commendable achievement for a company of this scale.The biggest risk to this company's future is the longer-term decline in take rates and transaction margin. This is likely to be offset by continued improvements in operating expense categories as Xoom is integrated and despite further increases in spending on global branding and security.Perhaps the biggest single issue that PayPal stock is dealing with relates to the relationship the company has with Visa and MasterCard and the revenue sharing to which has agreed with those vendors. Back in September, the company announced an extension of its partnership with MasterCard. The precise terms of the agreement have never been revealed but many observers felt that the agreement would negatively impact PayPal's revenues. Indeed, one reason why PayPal shares lifted in October was that the company's guidance belied that apprehension that the deals would lower margins.In answer to a specific question, CEO Dan Shulman said, ""So Visa, MasterCard and the issuer implementations, those will happen as we go through next year. But we don't assume a lot of either revenue or volume increase as a result of that. So, we are trying to be reasonably conservative on the - on what we will see next year from that. ""How can PayPal grow its market share?One answer provided by Mr. Shulman during the Q3 conference call of some interest related to the broad brush that e-commerce at the moment is 10% of retail sales and that PayPal is 1% of e-commerce. Notionally, then, the TAM for PayPal is the other 99% it doesn't have. Management has actually presented a three-year projection extending through the end of this decade that has forecast that the company will double the amount of payment volume that it processes, will increase its revenues by more than 60% and will maintain current non-GAAP operating margins. Free cash flow is forecast to grow in line with revenue which means that the company will either institute a dividend or more likely continue its share repurchase so that EPS by the end of the period will be up 75% from the current consensus forecast of EPS of $1.50 for 2016, i.e. EPS of about $2.60-2.70. Needless to say, trying to forecast the EPS for 2019 is not a task undertaken lightly and suggesting that EPS will be in any kind of tight range should not be taken too seriously by investors. But it does suggest the overall quantitative parameters by which management is driving operations.In early 2017, I think it can be said that PayPal has a set of capabilities that might reasonably lead it to achieve its longer-term goals. Perhaps, most importance of these capabilities is its overwhelming brand recognition and the recognition of several of its different platforms. It also has substantial scale advantage; it is the leading provider in its space by some recognizable amount. And it has developed capabilities in risk management regulatory capabilities and the ability to connect merchants and consumers simply and efficiently. Are these adequate capabilities to provide the company with sustainable competitive advantage? I think they are - clearly, there will be a wide spectrum of opinions on that point. I do think it is important to understand that this company will innovate in terms of the services that it offers and that taking a snapshot today and freezing it is probably not a useful tool in analyzing the company's competitive moat.It is hard to overstate the influence of the trend toward mobile payments where PayPal has a significant leadership position in terms of the company obtaining the overall market share that it is projecting. While there all kind of metrics and all kinds of competitors in the space, I think the major factor that PayPal has in its favor is marketplace momentum.Part of that momentum is a product of PayPal's acquisition of Braintree a bit over three years ago. I think it is fair to say that Braintree has been one of the more seminal acquisitions in the payment space - it is one of those deals that keep on giving. Braintree payment volume quadrupled in the first two years it was owned by PayPal and it continues to grow. Payment volume reached $50 billion at an annual rate by Q3 2015 and it will cross $100 billion of payment volume in the next 12 months according to management forecasts.Part of the Braintree acquisition was Venmo. Braintree had actually bought Venmo the year before its acquisition by PayPal for just $26 million. It too is showing explosive growth.Braintree, prior to its acquisition, had secured customers such as Airbnb (AIRB), Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) and Uber (NYSE:UBER) for its platform. I also believe that Bill Ready, who was the founder of Braintree is one of the stars of the PayPal management team. The erstwhile CEO of Braintree is now the COO of PayPal and had been the company's chief product officer until his recent appointment. Not to make too much of a single individual, but to the extent that PayPal develops the recipe for secret sauces, Mr. Ready is most likely to be the responsible chef.Venmo and Braintree, for the most part, have lower take-rates and higher volume per account than what might be called core PayPal. As Braintree has become a larger component of the total company, take rates have declined some - about 19 basis points year on year. The company has forecast that this metric will continue to decline. Investors are typically quite concerned that a take-rate price war might break out and hurt the profitability of this company. There is no real sign that a price war is imminent.Venmo is still a relatively small contributor to payment volume - a bit less than 6% of the total last quarter. That said, however, it achieved 131% growth in payment volume. I do not suppose anyone thinks that the Venmo phenomena can continue along its current trajectory. As I said earlier in the article, not being a millennial, I have no deep understanding about what makes a payment platform cool for users. But while Venmo is still small, looked at another way, it is providing 20% of PayPal's growth in TPV.PayPal has a small business in extending credit to the customers of some of its merchants. PayPal credit has been a subsidiary of PayPal for the last eight years. One of the contributors to this site feels that extending these kinds of loans to the customers of its customers is a very risky business for the company. The numbers do not bear out this concern.The company is not likely to become a major consumer credit supplier anytime soon. Its receivables outstanding are just $4.5 billion and on its call it said that its strategy is to partner with financial institutions to create solutions where it supplies technology and others supply capital.PayPal spent $1 billion to acquire Xoom. The transaction closed 14 months ago. Recently, Xoom was integrated within PayPal and customers can use their wallet balances to make Xoom payments. Xoom had revenues of $42 million and was losing money when it was acquired. Its growth was modest - in the high-single digit range. The company doesn't report Xoom revenues so we can't determine if it has been a significant growth contributor. My guess is that it was not specifically because it would have a material impact on PayPal's growth but would have significant revenue synergies. The company hasn't chosen to quantify the financial results of its cross-selling activities with Xoom and it is probably a bit early in the game for it to be meaningful.Again, I have no way of sitting here on January 16th 2017 and writing that PayPal will meet or exceed estimates that it has presented for the next three years. I have no such second sight. I really don't have the ability to know what number the company is going to print in two weeks. The company has a significant product roadmap and Bill Ready and the entire PayPal product development team have a record of innovation and imagination that I am sure will create service offerings as yet undefined and certainly not quantifiable. But I think it is reasonable to suggest that there is a reasonable and substantive case that can be readily made supporting the company's aspirational objectives.ValuationFor the most part, other than the report of one outlier that I have cited earlier, most of the issues surrounding these shares relate to their valuation more than concerns regarding the company's business. The company has a current share count of 1.21 billion shares and has a market capitalization of $55.7 billion as I write this before the market opens on Tuesday. The balance of the company's cash and investment accounts is $6.4 billion. So the enterprise value is $49.3 billion. The analyst consensus and company sales projections are $12.6 billion for the current year which puts EV/S at a bit under 4X, reasonable enough for a business forecast to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow at 17% or so over the next three years.The P/E sits at 24X, again based on the consensus estimate and the company's forecast for 2017 results. PayPal uses stock-based comp. Stock-based comp, at $317 million represented, 31% of the reported earnings through nine months while it was $257 million or 29% of reported earnings for the same period a year ago.Cash flow from Operations is substantially greater than net income. The largest differences between the two metrics are the provisions for transaction and loan losses, depreciation and stock based comp. Overall, cash flow turned out to be about 2.2X reported net income through nine months compared to 2.1X for the same period in 2015. The company raised its estimate of free cash generation to $2.2 billion and said that cash flow would track reported non-GAAP earnings next year. That suggests that free cash flow this current year will be approximately $2.6 billion, a free cash flow yield of just over 5%. I think that is a very reasonable ratio for a company forecasting that it will be able to grow that metric by more than 60% over the next three years while reducing the number of shares outstanding.I think that the above valuations reflect tensions between those who think management will be able to accomplish its goals and those who think that competition, in particular, will bring down growth and margins. I have, I hope, presented the positive case for what the company needs to do to achieve its aspirations. I think the odds favor that it will be able to do so. If it does, I think that the company can and will create a significant level of positive alpha for investors going forward."
4036678,23998,2017-01-13T10:57:21-05:00,"Seeking Alpha Pro contributor Bulls & Beards warned at the end of October that PayPal could fall 70%.PayPal shares have climbed since bottoming at the beginning of December, but institutions have been net sellers in dark pools on 27 of those 29 trading days.We elaborate, and present a cost-effective way for PayPal bulls to stay long while limiting their risk.","Institutions Unloading PayPal In Dark PoolsAt the end of October, pseudonymous Seeking Alpha Pro contributor Bulls & Beards called PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) a ""ticking timebomb"" with 70% downside risk. The stock dropped about 8% within a month of his article, but has climbed back to nearly even since.As PayPal has climbed back from its December 1st low though, institutions have been net sellers of it in dark pools on 27 of those 29 trading days.The dark pool chart above is from Squeeze Metrics (reminder: we have an affiliate relationship with that site, and get compensated if readers join). Readers of our recent article on Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), Seeking Alpha In The Dark, may recall how trading in dark pools - private exchanges where institutions avoid the transparency of public markets - offered insight into where that stock was headed. Recall that the Dark Pool Indicator, or DPI, measures how bullish or bearish dark pool investors are on a security: below 50% is bearish and above 50% is bullish.On Thursday, PayPal was had a bullish DPI of 59%, but that was the first bullish DPI it had since December 5th. We've highlighted Wednesday instead on the chart above instead, as its DPI of 26% is more representative of the period. The average DPI for PayPal since December 1st has been 34%. To put that figure in perspective, it's worth reviewing this article on the S&P 500 stocks with the best and worst DPIs in 2016. As that article shows, two of the stocks with the most dark pool selling last year had DPIs averaging 33%, Cognizant Technologies (NASDAQ:CTSH) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF).As that article makes clear, not every stock with a low average DPI will do poorly - SYF ended up the year 22% - but, on average, DPI is worth paying attention to: the spread between the average performance of the five S&P 500 stocks with the highest average DPI and the five stocks with the worst was 18.2% last year.Cost Effectively Limiting Your Risk In PayPalLet's say you own shares of PayPal and are bullish on it. You would be in good company: as Seeking Alpha News Editor Clark Schultz reports, bullish Wall Street analysts outnumber bears on PayPal 26-to-1. So you want to stay long the stock, but you want to limit your risk in the event Bulls & Beards and the institutions that have been unloading PayPal in dark pools end up being right. At the same time, you don't want to pay to hedge. Here's an approach to consider.Although PayPal bulls outnumber bears on Wall Street, the bulls have fairly modest expectations. As the graphic from Nasdaq below shows, the consensus 12-month price target implies a potential return of about 5% over the next six months.Our Portfolio Armor website is more bullish, estimating a potential return of about 10% over six months. If you can tolerate a drawdown of up to 15% over the next six months, but want to protect against any drop worse than that, you can do so with an optimal collar.We used the Portfolio Armor iOS app to find this hedge using those parameters for 1,000 shares of PYPL as of Thursday's close, but you can also do this manually using the process we laid out here.As you can see above, the cost of the put leg of this collar was $880, or 2.12% of position value (calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts). But the income generated by selling the call leg was a bit higher, as you can see below: $1,250, or 3.01% of position value (this was also calculated conservatively, assuming the calls were sold at the bid).So the net cost of this collar was negative, meaning an investor would have collected an amount equal to $370, or 0.89% of position value when opening this on Thursday. Note that, since the cost was calculated conservatively, the investor would likely have collected more than $370 when hedging with this collar."

We believe the company's results have helped allay concerns about competitive, technology and regulatory risks. 3Q metrics show that PayPal retains a sizable lead versus Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and others and that PayPal's continued innovation in order to stay ahead and to generate new revenue streams is working, in our view.PayPal's recent new products, One Touch and Venmo, contributed to the 18% YoY revenue increase in the quarter. With electronic payments gaining market share at a rapid pace compared to cash and checks as transactions shift to online and mobile, One Touch for mobile and Venmo for P2P help make the overall PayPal offering compelling. Driven in part by expanding access to the internet - with an estimated 438 million mobile devices in the U.S. accessing the internet in 2013, and this metric expected to reach more than 690 million devices in 2018 - people want an e-currency they can trust.PayPal Established and Gaining Market SharePayPal noted that it gained market share in 3Q16 and ""extended its leadership position."" That doesn't surprise us. People trust PayPal to process their transactions and keep their financial data secure. PayPal has strong brand recognition in the space.The company was launched in 1998 and has attained credibility with consumers and businesses alike over the years. It is significantly more established than the other companies in the space. Apple Pay, for example, debuted domestically in October of 2014 as a mobile first product and subsequently launched expansions internationally and into desktop. PayPal, by comparison, is already available in 203 markets, according to PYMNTS.com. In fact, approximately 45% of its TPV involved an international vendor in 2015 and roughly 22% represented a cross-border transaction.PayPal also is significantly ahead of others in retailer integration, we believe, both in online and mobile. PayPal finished 3Q16 with 15 million active merchant accounts. In the mobile space, PayPal's One Touch is used by more than half of the top 500 online retailers, according to Recode. By comparison, Apple Pay and Android Pay each list fewer than 150 retailers on their respective websites.First to Online, Early in Mobile and P2PIn the early days, PayPal helped build the industry and, in turn, benefited from its expansion. As illustrated by Payments News, PayPal's quarterly payment volumes increased dramatically from 2001 to 2013 as e-commerce transactions grew rapidly. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales grew from 1.1% at the beginning of 2001 to 7.0% by the end of 2013.New Products Help Keep PayPal's Growth at Double DigitsBoth One Touch and Venmo contributed to the 18% year-over-year growth that PayPal recorded in 3Q16. PayPal launched One Touch as a mobile product to simplify the checkout process and enable payment without having to enter payment details for each transaction. Citing comScore data, PYMNTS.com notes that with One Touch, PayPal has 87.5% conversion of shopping to actual sales, which is significantly ahead of 51.1% for Visa (NYSE:V) Checkout and 45.6% for ""all other forms"" of payment. In 3Q16, PayPal processed almost $26 billion in mobile payment volume, which represents a 56% YoY improvement. According to management, One Touch is the ""fastest rollout of any product PayPal has ever had.""PayPal introduced Venmo to enable P2P money transfers and sharing. Users can split the check or share other payments and send money to friends. In January 2016, people used Venmo to transfer more than $1 billion, a 250% y/y advance, according to Newsweek. Venmo processed $7.5 billion transactions in 2015, up from $2.4 billion in 2014. During its 3Q15 call, management noted that, ""the average Venmo user already interacts with the app more than two times per week."" Venmo processed $4.9 billion in volume in 3 Q16, which represented a 131% y/y improvement.Moreover, the company has agreements with both Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (MA), which management noted gives it ""a seamless, quick and simple way to activate PayPal payments at the point of sale.""PayPal's revenue growth remains at the double-digit level. However, it experienced some margin decay during 3Q16 primarily due to the shift in business toward Braintree and increased provisions in the company's credit business. These are factors to watch but for now we believe the strong topline growth trumps the slight margin decline.Industry Outlook: Positive CatalystsOverall, eMarketer expects global e-commerce spending as a percentage of total retail expenditures to reach 9% in 2018, up from 6% in 2013, reflecting rising consumption among younger, internet savvy users. Mobile represents 29% of total e-commerce transactions in the U.S. and 34% globally. But the mobile payment space is growing. Mobile accounted for 28% of the payments PayPal processed in 2015. By 3Q15, mobile accounted for about 30% of the company's payment volume. PayPal processed $26 billion in mobile payments, which represented a 56% y/y advance, and is ""on track to process well over $100 billion in mobile payment volume in the next 12 months.""We also believe that PayPal has an advantage as a relatively platform agnostic service. It is available on iOS, Android and Windows, unlike Apple Pay, which is only available through the Apple ecosystem, or Android Pay, which is available only to Android devices.PayPal remains in double-digit growth mode, with younger PayPal products such as One Touch and Venmo enjoying significantly higher growth rates and likely to contribute to PayPal's overall expansion for the foreseeable future, in our view. We believe that PayPal has a wide and sustainable lead in the e-payments space."
4022546,96126,2016-11-11T12:56:52-05:00,"PayPal reported strong growth across all key metrics and investors reacted by fiercely bidding the stock to new all time highs and a fresh breakout.PayPal has acquired the social payment app Venmo.Year to date, PayPal has repurchased 26 million shares of common stock and has returned $945 million to shareholders.","We've had our eyes on Paypal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) attractive growth narrative for awhile now but remained uninterested due to stagnant price action. The stock has been coiling in a 16-month ascending triangle ever since the IPO on July 6, 2015. Finally last Friday the earnings release reported strong growth across all key metrics and investors reacted by fiercely bidding the stock to new all time highs and a fresh breakout. Price has now retraced back to its breakout point since the earnings release, but we're looking for a rebound to enter a position.PayPal processes all types of digital payments, including mobile for both consumer and merchants worldwide. Most people are familiar with using Paypal to buy products online from sites like eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). They're the ""go-to"" trusted source for sending payments on the web - a titled earned through 15 years of trust building with Internet shoppers.The key with digital wallets and online payments is trust. There are so many predatory scams out there waiting for the ignorant Internet surfer to hand over their hard earned money only to get swindled. PayPal has earned customer trust over the years by protecting consumers from getting scammed. With trust comes an increase in PayPal processed transactions with in turn means more revenue as they receive a small cut from each transaction. PayPal is now raking in 10.5 billion a year with strong profitability and larger macro forces working in their favor.Paypal is a leader in E-commerce payment processing, a space currently experiencing rapid growth. For the first time ever UPS' (NYSE:UPS) annual shopper survey said that consumer bought more of their products on the web than in physical stores. The numbers came in at 51% for this year up from 48% last year and 47% the year before. The graphic below from WSJ breaks down the data further.But what's interesting is that in the first quarter of 2016 only 7.8% of all retail sales in the U.S. were made online. That means people are still making the more expensive purchases offline in a brick-and-mortar environment. We expect that to change in the coming years as paying via a digital wallet becomes more ubiquitous and gains widespread trust.You can also see in the graphic above how much Millennials have embraced paying via smartphone. This trend will only grow stronger. As credit/debit cards become relics of yesteryear, Millennials will purchase everything with their smartphone.PayPal is aware of this paradigm shift and is working to service the coming plastic purge.For starters they've rolled out OneTouch payment technology, which allows single click purchases at all merchants who have a PayPal account. This drastically lowers the friction for purchases because you no longer have to enter in tedious password, billing, or shipping info.On top of that, PayPal has acquired the social payment app Venmo. Right now it's primarily used to transfer money between friends and family. Instead of going through the annoying process of managing multiple tabs at a restaurant or bar, it's easy to put it all on one person's card and pay them back through Venmo. The app also has a social component to make it fun for the younger generation. Upon sending a payment you enter a little description or emoji describing the purchase and the payment posts to an in-app news feed that your community can see.These things might seem trivial, but it's making the app incredibly sticky. Venmo payment volume is up 131% to $4.9 billion this quarter. PayPal's plan is to hold off on monetization of these payments until the network reaches a critical mass, which they believe may happen in the first half of 2017. The plan is to start using near field communication (aka NFC) to allow Venmo users to pay merchants for products in store. Paypal will then take a cut of those transactions.Venmo is also not the only mobile app PayPal has bets on. They recently announced integration with Facebook commerce, a market with enormous potential. Users will be able to link their Paypal accounts to Facebook in order to pay for things bought through Messenger or Facebook stores.This is a great example of why the trust factor in payments is so important. Facebook already has a means of transferring payments through messenger through their own native technology. But consumers aren't thrilled at handing over their credit card info to Facebook. It's just not a widely trusted source for payments. PayPal's goodwill is strong. Consumers have been using it to buy things off the Internet since E-commerce began in the early 2000s.PayPal is flooding the zone now on everything digital payments. They've even partnered with one of the most popular cryptocurrency wallets Coinbase. You can transfer your Bitcoins out of Coinbase and they will directly show up as U.S. dollars in a PayPal account.The shifts in PayPal's strategy have paid off so far and have impressed investors with robust growth.Active Customer Accounts continue to climb.And their revenue has shown an impressive 21% yoy gain.PayPal growth is not without some concerns though. The payment processing space is highly competitive and a lot of high quality companies want a piece of the fintech revolution.PayPal has a hardware problem.Next year you will only be able to pay for things in-store with Venmo if you have an Android phone. Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) NFC chip is closed to third-developers at the moment so PayPal can't capitalize on the large amount of people that would want to pay with iPhone.Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MC) are investing and building their own checkout integrations. Square is also making it easier and easier for SMB's (small medium businesses) to bypass the PayPal environment completely.Despite the stiff competition, we feel as though PayPal still understands the digital payments space better than anyone. They've had a tremendous amount of trust built up among consumers due to their 15 years of relevance on the web and they seem to understand the habits of the Millennial generation too. They have a strong mobile presence with Venmo, a positive relationship with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and an ability to handle cryptocurrency.The stock is a buy and management believes so, too. Year to date, PayPal has repurchased 26 million shares of common stock and has returned $945 million to shareholders. Our strategy is to jump on the for the ride targeting a price of $53 a share given by the implied move of the breakout pattern."
4031386,101453,2016-12-19T10:17:33-05:00,"Zelle is a no-fee electronic payments transfer system that represents big banks’ response to PayPal’s Venmo service.PayPal still has the largest market share in the person-to-person payment transfer industry, but will recede once Zelle becomes adopted by most popular US banks in 2017.Is Zelle a threat to PayPal’s business or will the company, along with fintech generally, adjust to deepen its penetration in other parts of the banking industry?","ThesisTraditional banking models are seeing increased competition with respect to consumer financial services in light of no-fee person-to-person payment apps, such as Venmo. Larger banks are responding back with a recently launched electronic payment network known as Zelle, which looks to be fully adopted by many/most mainstream US banks in 2017.While banks may be gaining on PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and eating into their market share in electronic payments transfers, its influence (and fintech's influence generally) in customers' lives will allow for disruption in other channels, such as personal and commercial lending and personal financial management.The uptake of person-to-person payments by traditional banks probably doesn't represent a challenge that's anything out of the ordinary, even though PayPal's services mix is likely to change moving ahead.OverviewAs the world of personal finance increasingly shifts toward purely digital format, big banks are increasingly taking on PayPal's (PYPL) dominance in the electronic payments market. PayPal was largely the first major player to capitalize on the trend favoring the more convenient option of desktop-based payment transfers in lieu of checks and cash (and later mobile).Out of necessity, big banks are developing faster and more reliable options to increase the convenience of their existing payment transfer services. Banks have offered person-to-person transfer and wiring services for several years through both desktop and mobile app options, but the payments regularly took several days to transact (with additional fees for expedited options).Transaction volumes in this space are growing and leading to a maturation in the industry. Among PayPal and the ""big three"" of JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), transactions volumes were estimated near $100 billion in person-to-person transactions in 2015, up 25%-30% over 2014, going by the companies' public disclosures.Much of PayPal's growth over the past two years can be attributed to its acquisition of Venmo as part of the $800 million acquisition of Braintree in September 2013. Venmo, most popular among millennials with its in-built social network functionality, and provides free phone-to-phone payment transfers (although it passes off credit card royalty fees to customers). PayPal states in its public filings that it processed $41 billion in mobile person-to-person payments in 2015, up 42% from the previous year.Much of this growth can be attributed to Venmo's influence in fortifying its electronic payments arm. The app's transaction volumes increased by over 3x in 2015 (213%) to $7.5 billion, or 18% of PayPal's total payment volume. Its processing volume in Q4 2015 ($2.5 billion) was higher than that of all of 2014 alone ($2.4 billion).In 2016, Venmo is set to more than double its 2015 performance. Through the first three quarters of 2016, Venmo has processed $12 billion in person-to-person payments, with $4.9 billion in Q3. Should Venmo hit a realistic target of $5.5-$6.0 billion for Q4, that would provide a year-over-year growth rate of 133%-140%.JPMorgan (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), and Bank of America (BAC) began releasing their person-to-person transaction volumes beginning in Q2 of 2016. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo disclosed the entirety of their 2015 person-to-person volumes, which came to $21 billion and $10 billion, respectively.Bank of America reported 2016 figures, both in year-to-date and quarterly form. It also provided year-over-year growth rates for year-to-date and Q1 and Q2 data, which allows one to obtain person-to-person transaction volumes for those respective periods in 2015. This allows us to build out full-year estimates for 2015 for all three banks, assuming similar person-to-person volume growth trajectories among each.Based on these projections, considering only these four companies alone, PayPal has 45%-50% market share while JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America combined have 50%-55% and growing. So while PayPal may still process more person-to-person payments than each individual bank by a factor of around 2.5x on average, the improved convenience options among each of the big banks present a competitive threat to a notable portion of PayPal's business model.(Source: company filings; modeled by author)Big banks have capitalized on customer demand for fast and convenient transfers through the formation of clearXchange. The digital payments network was initially started by Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Chase (NYSEMKT:CCF) in 2011, but has expanded to 24 banks and fintech companies since. ClearXchange has one particular advantage over PayPal in that these banks can process payments between individuals nearly instantly if they have an account at an institution that permits real-time transactions through the service. In the case of PayPal's services, payments transfer in real-time between PayPal accounts, but may still take one or more business days to finalize the end-to-end.In October, clearXchange introduced the Zelle payment network, which is intended to allow all participating banks to meet the demand for instant person-to-person transfers instead of only for particular institutions beginning in 2017. Zelle will compete directly against Venmo as a no-fee transfer system. Accordingly, without making a royalty on this activity, neither the value of Zelle nor Venmo can be quantitatively determined. The value in each platform lies in their ability to create a sticky customer base that either converts to fee-based products or services in the present or else down the line.It was nonetheless important for mainstream banks (and eventually smaller institutions) to develop a service in direct competition. The longer the delay the more traditional banks would risk ceding more of their customer finances to PayPal and/or other fintech competitors. Zelle also has the opportunity to create a level of customer loyalty that can potentially counter additional threats to its business model.On the flip side, PayPal and other fintech companies have penetrated so far into the consumer finance and banking industry that it can be expected that they will work to disrupt other financial segments as well. Matters such as lending and financial management are increasingly moving away from the traditional banking model and toward fintech. The momentum is currently in favor of fintech when it comes to wresting away market share from traditional banking services.Q4 is expected to shed further insight on the ongoing competitive dynamic between the two industries, as holiday-related sales will provide a larger than average quarterly data point. Where market share begins to settle by the end of 2017 as Zelle becomes a part of more customers' lives (i.e., banks get up to speed with PayPal) will help determine how the true competitive picture might appear going forward."
4016612,102395,2016-10-31T08:30:00-04:00,"PYPL is not Visa. We believe any reasonable cut of the data indicates 75%+ of EBITDA is derived from its relationship with EBAY and its subprime credit book.We believe EBAY intends to renegotiate or terminate its operating agreement with PYPL at expiration. Small changes in this relationship will hit earnings in a big way.Despite management’s claims to the contrary, the credit book is a serious problem. It is extremely low quality, woefully underreserved, and a shockingly large piece of earnings and earnings growth.The circumstances and guidance around the wildly hyped Visa and MasterCard “partnerships” are very suspicious. We believe management intends to put the business at serious risk to meet expectations.Various other serious issues: tax rate sustainability is questionable; accounting gimmickry is inflating earnings and growth rates; an overlooked poison pill prevents a takeout; and, oh yeah, Apple Pay.","Editors' Note: This was originally posted in identical form for PRO subscribers on Friday, October 29thNote: Unless otherwise specified, all reported earnings figures are adjusted for non-recurring items but do not add-back stock-based comp or the cash payroll taxes associated with stock-based comp. We think this is a silly practice by the Company.A ""regret trade"" is what you do when you miss a great opportunity and then buy something that shares similar characteristics to that original opportunity thinking you've cleverly given yourself another shot, but that something ends up being worse than the 2016 presidential candidates. For example, if you bought Endo Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ENDP) or Concordia Healthcare because you missed Valeant (VRX) c. 2012, that is a regret trade.If you bought Northstar Asset Management (NSAM) or Fifth Street Asset Management (OTCPK:FSAM) because you missed Altisource Asset Management (NYSEMKT:AAMC) c. 2013, that is a regret trade. If you bought Liberty Latin America and the Caribbean because you missed Liberty Global (NASDAQ:LBTYA) c. 2009, that is a regret trade. In our opinion, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is the regret trade for everyone yearning to recreate the magic of Visa (NYSE:V) or MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and we think they will be similarly disappointed. Trust us. We are expert regret traders after having owned nearly all of these spectacular blow-ups.PayPal is not a payment processor. OK, fine, it processes payments, but it's not the high quality, scalable, secular champion payment network like Visa or MasterCard that the market thinks it is. And while the debate around the stock seems to revolve exclusively around the competitive threat du jour like the latest _____Pay entrant, or what the recent Visa/MasterCard ""partnerships"" will do to earnings (for the record we also think this stuff is bad), we think that misses the broader point of what PYPL actually is, where they make their money, and why earnings could get vaporized in a second by any number of events.We have been flummoxed by the mass delusion that growth-obsessed bulls seem to suffer on this name, so we thought we would lay out the bear case that has heretofore only been mentioned in whispers in the darkest corners of Wall Street. So, without further ado, and as Pierre Omidyar, the founding Frenchman of eBay (NASDAQ:eBay), might say: nous vous presentons le bear case.When analyzing a company, it's usually a good idea to figure out where it makes its money to ascertain whether or not those cash flows are sustainable. Ben Graham probably said that somewhere. In PYPL's case, the Company's disclosure actually lends itself to a fairly natural segmentation of the business by channel: on-eBay, off-eBay (""Merchant Services""), and PayPal Credit (and we consider both the processing and lending sides of PayPal Credit since we view them as symbiotic though the Company only considers PayPal Credit to be the lending side).Can we tease out the economics of each of these pieces, and more importantly, can we recreate a P&L for each channel? Let's see what we know about the economics of the on-eBay piece for starters. Warning: this will be dry but we have to get through it to get to the good stuff.Looks like we're off to a good start where we'll be able to see how on-eBay has grown over the past several years and how the take-rate there compares to the rest of the business. What about the cost structure components to get to transaction margin (i.e., revenue less transaction expenses less transaction and loan losses per the Company's definition)?Making progress. Now we get into the more challenging bit: figuring out which components of opex go where in order to see the contribution margin of this channel. The proper way to do this would be to work down the P&L figuring out what goes where until you get to the truly unallocatable fixed costs, but we're not able to do that with the disclosure the Company provides, so instead let's be lazy and allocate all of opex based on TPV just to get a ballpark sense for how important on-eBay is to PYPL.There is one caveat, however, and that's PayPal Credit. We think this business actually has two sets of overhead- overhead for the processing side and overhead for the lending side- so allocating costs to it based on TPV would understate its total costs. We assume opex for the lending business of PayPal Credit at 4.5% of average gross loans,[4] and then allocate the remaining opex across the channels based on TPV. Putting all of these pieces together, we end up with a P&L for the on-eBay segment that looks something like this: That's an actual picture of us when we realized eBay could easily contribute over 50% of EBITDA at PYPL. And, worse, we think this realistically understates its EBITDA contribution because opex is probably skewed much more heavily towards the off-eBay channel. Let's think about each line item of opex and whether or not it should logically be higher as a % of TPV relative to the off-eBay channel:For fun, let's see what eBay's contribution to EBITDA is if we put all of product development and sales & marketing in off-eBay (with the exception of the eBay customer acquisition costs disclosed in filings), and then allocate the remaining customer support & operations and general & administrative costs based on TPV (with the same PayPal Credit opex caveat as before).Yeah, that's pretty big. So, to recap, we have eBay contributing around 50% of EBITDA when we simply allocate opex based on TPV, but in reality we think on-eBay costs are probably lower than that, so eBay could be contributing as much as 65%. Despite management's soothing words about eBay being a small piece of the business and shrinking (to cite one example: ""historically, we've had a large part of our business on eBay. eBay in the last quarter represented about 18% of our total volume and we've continued to see that come down since our separation and that's because we're diversifying into other large merchants…""[5]), we believe it's actually a massively profitable channel and an outsized contributor to earnings. This makes sense directionally as depicted by the following professionally-designed graphic:""Well, so what?"" you might ask. ""Even if PYPL generates most of its earnings from eBay, that's not necessarily a bad thing. And besides, they entered into a five-year operating agreement at the spin-off in 2015, so the relationship isn't changing until 2020 at the earliest."" And you would get partial credit for that answer. Congratulations on earning a gentleman's C, but we expected more out of you. Our view is that there are a handful of problematic implications stemming from this relationship.Most obviously, there is a funny valuation disconnect where eBay trades at ~16 GAAP 2017E EPS while PYPL, in large part just a vendor to eBay based on where we think its EBITDA comes from, trades at ~31x GAAP 2017E EPS (we are using GAAP here to strip out stock-based comp add-backs but we are adding back amortization to PYPL).If you own PYPL, you are basically exposed to the same top-line risks as eBay but you're paying a 100% premium for it; if you want to short eBay, PYPL is the vastly superior way to do it. But the bigger problem is that we think there's a high likelihood that the eBay/PYPL relationship gets altered in a meaningfully adverse way to PYPL.PYPL has good reason to be insecure about its position with eBay. As part of a combined entity, eBay constantly made decisions to shield PYPL from competition in order to maximize value for the whole eBay/PYPL ecosystem rather than maximizing value for standalone eBay.For instance, in 2006, eBay banned Google Checkout[6]; in 2007, eBay limited buyer protection to PayPal funded transactions[7] in a move presumably to insulate PYPL from competition; and in 2008, eBay adopted ""PayPal Only"" policies in Australia[8] (only to be rebuffed by regulators on anticompetitive grounds[9]) and the UK.[10] eBay's objectives naturally change post-spinoff: the company is now entirely unconflicted and incentivized to drive volume growth and one of the ways it can do that is by driving down payment processing costs for its merchants.This is probably why so many legal protections needed to be put in place when PYPL was set off on its own - to prevent eBay from killing it right off the bat. To be sure, the language PYPL used in its roadshow presentation about the eBay's operating agreement wasn't exactly overflowing with reassurance about the symbiotic nature of the relationship between the two companies.Maintain usage? Does that make anyone feel warm and fuzzy? Did PYPL really need a binding legal agreement to make sure eBay continues to use it? We doubt ""five-year contract in place to delay their largest customer from dropping them like a bad habit"" would be on Warren Buffet's checklist for a great business.Additionally, the agreement provides for payments to PYPL from eBay if their penetration on eBay falls below 80%, basically forcing eBay to continue using PYPL despite what the economically rational thing to do might be. Does this really sound like a business that is confident about its position with its largest partner (and the source of the majority of its EBITDA in our opinion)?So, what could eBay do differently now, or what could happen at the expiration of the operating agreement? Here are a few thoughts:eBay could declare itself a ""merchant of record"" and eviscerate PYPL's take-rate on eBay. As the relationship currently stands, eBay acts as an aggregator of small merchants for PYPL rather than one giant merchant, and that's why the overall take-rate on eBay is ~150bps higher than the overall take-rate off-eBay where PYPL's merchant base skews larger.[11]As a ""merchant of record,"" eBay would take responsibility for the transaction including any customer support or fraud issues, but would also turn payment processing into a profit-center, collecting payment processing fees as revenues and negotiating down its own direct backend processing fees with vendors, including PYPL, as one giant $80bn behemoth of a customer.[12] ""But that's not an online marketplace's model,"" you say?To which we respond: Amazon, merchant of record.[13] ""But they're massive and they also take control of the inventory so that makes sense,"" you say? To which we respond: Etsy, merchant of record.[14] ""But eBay isn't exactly a dynamic, hungry company looking to ruffle feathers,"" you say? Well, let's ignore the concept of fiduciary duty for one moment and take a look at the operating agreement itself to see if it can shed any light on eBay's intentions:[15]Wow. Right up front in the table of contents we see that they've devoted an entire section to the topic of being a merchant of record. Must be on their mind. The section opens with the expected language about ""eBay shall not declare itself as the Merchant of Record for transactions between users effected through any service or offering available on… [eBay]...""[16] So far, so good. Exactly as you might expect based on the Company's descriptions of the nature of the operating agreement. But then they throw us a curveball that neither PYPL's nor eBay's management team has mentioned on any public call as far as we can tell:[17] (emphasis added)Wait a second! What's all this ""test jurisdiction"" stuff!? It appears to us that eBay is seriously exploring its payment options as a standalone entity and wants to be able to start experimenting as the merchant of record prior to the expiration of the operating agreement. We think this could be a prelude to a full potential roll-out in 2020. If eBay knew operating as a merchant of record made no sense for the business, we doubt there would be any language about ""test jurisdictions"" at all in the agreement.Given the fact that a) there are serious marketplace peers that act as merchants of record, b) eBay could desperately use an easy win in the revenue growth department with processing fees, and c) this could also be a means for eBay to organically drive more merchant and volume growth by potentially cutting processing fees to the merchants, we think this should happen with pretty ugly results for PYPL.Short of declaring itself the merchant of record at agreement expiration, eBay could do a number of other things with its payments system that would improve its business while damaging PYPL's:· eBay could use its immense scale to push for lower processing fees from PYPL on behalf of its small merchants, presumably driving merchant growth at no cost to eBay. We think PYPL would have very little leverage in this negotiation.· eBay could drop PYPL altogether and exclusively work with third-party processors to accept cards and ACH payments. There would ostensibly be some disruption and a negative volume impact at eBay from dropping PYPL altogether, but on the other hand if processing fees fell meaningfully, there would arguably be a benefit to merchant growth. Ultimately, we would note that Amazon has never used PYPL and things seem to have worked out fine for them. Asked in an interview about whether AMZN would ever accept PayPal, Amazon Payments Vice President Patrick Gauthier noted ""It's quite simple. Amazon starts with the customer. If our customers were asking for it, it would have been on Amazon already.""[18]· eBay could be an aggressive adopter of other digital payment options: Visa Checkout, MasterCard Masterpass, Apple Pay, Android Pay (eBay probably has no reason to ban Google this time around[19]), and maybe even Pay with Amazon (just kidding). But seriously, there are more options for online payment now than ever before (i.e., more than one), and from eBay's perspective, if it can drive volumes at no cost to them, why wouldn't they add as many payment options as possible? We wouldn't be surprised if eBay's list of accepted payment methods eventually looks as crowded as this:[20]· eBay could do nothing and let the payment mix go where it goes organically. While eBay is currently punished if PYPL falls below 80% of payment volumes on eBay per the operating agreement, we can use Etsy as a benchmark for where a more natural level of penetration might be without any coercion. Per Etsy's S-1, ""…buyers can pay for purchases using Direct Checkout (ed: cards and ACH) or PayPal,"" and it notes that ""36.1% of active sellers used Direct Checkout"" in 2014.In other words, only 63.9% of active sellers used PayPal when given the choice. This number fell to 59.8% in 2015 according to Etsy's 2015 10-K, but the company integrated PayPal into its Direct Checkout option in Q4 2015, so it's not clear how comparable this figure is. All the same, if this is the natural level of PayPal penetration for a marketplace business, there is pain in store for PYPL.It certainly seems like there should be some big changes coming for the eBay/PYPL relationship. eBay now has the incentive to make a big change (versus historically when it benefitted from owning PYPL), the ability to make a big change (eBay has all the leverage in our opinion), the willingness to make a big change (otherwise the operating agreement and volume requirements wouldn't be necessary, and the phrase ""test jurisdiction"" certainly would never have made it into a filing), and the playbook to make a big change (see: ETSY, AMZN).How bad could it get for PYPL? Well, based on reported 2015 figures, if you sensitize pre-tax earnings to different levels of take-rate degradation and market share loss for PYPL's on-eBay business, you end up with hits to pre-tax income in this neighborhood:[21]If PYPL's take-rate on eBay fell by 200bps (remember, the off-eBay average take-rate is about 150bps lower than on-eBay, and if eBay were to operate as a merchant of record it would by PYPL's largest merchant by far suggesting the take-rate hit could very reasonably be in the 200bp area), over 70% of 2015 earnings would get vaporized.If PYPL lost 20pp of share on-eBay, similar to what its share is at payments-neutral ETSY, and lost 50bps of take-rate (we believe Etsy's payment processing is a profit-center and they charge merchants 3-4% so their own processing costs- the benchmark for PYPL's take-rate on-eBay- must be somewhere south of that), around 35% of 2015 earnings are history.When eBay starts discussing what they're doing in their ""test jurisdictions"" in just a year-and-a-half, we think the market will be rudely awakened to this risk.To summarize what we've covered so far: eBay is very likely a huge-to-massively-huge piece of earnings at PYPL, eBay has the ability to annihilate said huge-to-massively-huge piece of earnings at the expiration of their operating agreement, and eBay experimenting with operating as a merchant of record in ""test jurisdictions"" in the next ~2 years will serve as a catalyst for the market waking up to this risk.Speaking of uncomfortably large pieces of earnings coming from surprising places, did you know PYPL is a subprime lender? In 2008, eBay bought BillMeLater and subsequently rebranded it as PayPal Credit in 2014. The rationale for tucking this business into the eBay/PYPL complex was to provide a point-of-sale source of credit for folks who may or may not be creditworthy but just don't have the cash for that Shake Weight that I really want right now- I mean ""they"" really want right now.Management is fond of saying that they're not in ""credit for credit's sake"" (see conference appearances or earnings calls on any of June 7, May 21, April 28, March 22, March 2, and February 23 just this year) but that their credit customers drive more volumes through their processing business.[22] Of course, Visa and MasterCard have done OK driving volumes without offering credit, and back when these companies were introducing themselves to the public markets they basically shouted from the mountaintops that they weren't taking credit risk.[23]At any rate, while we agree that PayPal Credit very likely drives volumes on the processing side, we question the sustainability of these volumes given their dubious financing dependency. See what has happened to RCII, CONN, or SIG recently, for instance, as case studies of what can happen to a business when low quality financing drives retail volumes.Further, what is less well-known, and actively obfuscated by management in our opinion, is how profitable the lending side must be and how much of PYPL's total earnings growth in the past has been driven by growth in this business.When we say PYPL is a ""subprime"" lender, we really mean ""subprime."" Here's how PayPal Credit's credit quality stacks up against the standard credit card issuers[24]:PayPal Credit's credit quality is literally off the charts! But not in a good way. Now to be clear, the Company only reports FICO scores above 680 rather than the 660 that these comparables show so that's how we are presenting it, but we think the point stands that PYPL's consumer credit book is of vastly lower quality than traditional consumer credit issuers. Here are some more data points for context:· According to consumer credit reporting agency Experian, a 670 FICO is generally considered the cut-off for ""subprime"" classification,[25] so nearly half of PayPal Credit's book is subprime.[26]· LendingClub has already blown up because of credit quality issues, yet nearly half of PayPal Credit customers wouldn't even qualify for a personal loan there! Per LendingClub's 10-K: ""[Personal] loans must meet certain minimum credit requirements including a FICO score of at least 660…""· PayPal Credit's customer base is even deep into payday lender territory. Online payday lender Enova notes in its 10-K that their ""customer base for consumer loans is predominantly in the low to fair range of FICO scores, with scores generally between 500 and 680 for most of [their] loan products."" In other words, that problematic approximate half of PayPal Credit borrowers is even in payday loan range!So credit quality = bad. But why? On the demand side, we think it's a function of adverse selection. If you have access to a credit card, you would use that rather than PayPal Credit because at least then you would get an implicit discount through rewards/loyalty points. We suspect PayPal Credit users are those who are so un-creditworthy that they can't qualify for a credit card or for additional credit on an existing line. To illustrate, here are three borrower profiles drawn at random from May 2016 personal bankruptcy filings with PayPal Credit listed as a creditor. To be clear, these are the first three we pulled.These are ugly, but, yes, we acknowledge that we're pulling data from a biased sample (i.e., those that have already filed for bankruptcy so they will by definition be ugly), so calm down. All the same, we think the point stands that PayPal Credit is likely doing zero underwriting if these are the types of folks that get loans and these borrowers probably turned to PayPal Credit as a last resort.It makes sense that consumers without access to credit would be clamoring for PayPal Credit to finance their Snuggies and Chia Pets, but why has PayPal deemed them worthy of credit when others have turned them away? And to say PayPal has pushed this product hard would be the understatement of the year. Loan growth has been on fire, vastly outstripping processing volumes.There are more red flags here than in a Communists' Day parade in Beijing.[27] In our experience, consumer lenders with torrid growth inevitably blow up, because if you are originating loans at a much faster rate than GDP growth, you are almost by definition allowing credit quality to deteriorate. Additionally, the fact that the credit book is growing so much faster than transaction revenues suggests that credit is rapidly becoming a bigger and bigger piece of this business.We think this demolishes management's attempt to soothe concerns over this business with their claim that ""[PayPal Credit] has been [a] relatively constant [percentage of TPV]… over the last several years.""[28] And, holy smokes, just look at that acceleration in loan growth! They've been pushing PayPal Credit so hard that they've actually gotten slapped down by the CFPB for acting like a skeezy subprime lender by engaging in deceptive advertising, mishandling billing disputes, and signing people up without their knowledge.[29]You can actually see some of these dodgy PayPal Credit practices in action. Does this look like a company that is ""not in credit for credit's sake""? But back to the point: the aggressive push to grow the PayPal Credit loan book by management can be attributed to a few factors in our opinion.· First, PayPal Credit transactions are wildly profitable because as we understand it there are no third-party processing costs; according to eBay's former CEO John Donahoe ""[PayPal Credit] is [their] lowest-cost funding source.""[30] Based on Morgan Stanley estimates for funding costs,[31] a $100 transaction at a 3% take-rate becomes $0.80 of transaction margin on a credit card (3% take-rate less 2.2% transaction expenses), $2.50 of transaction margin on a debit card (3% take-rate less 0.5% transaction expenses), and a full $3 of transaction margin on PayPal Credit (3% take-rate less 0% transaction expenses).· Second, PayPal Credit inflates headline processing volumes, in many ways by enabling transactions to take place that never should have and will ultimately turn into credit losses. According to the Company's Investor Day presentation, ""New to PayPal Credit customers spend 2x more… than New to PayPal non-Credit customers,"" and ""PayPal customers who adopted PayPal Credit transacted at 73% more PayPal merchants in the following 12 months."" This makes perfect sense: an alcoholic will drink more alcohol if you offer it to him than a non-alcoholic, but that doesn't mean offering it to him is a good idea.Again, see what has happened to SIG, CONN, RCII, or any number of financing-dependent retailers for the ugly side of juicing volumes by lending to people who can't pay it back. In PYPL's case, these transactions might eventually turn into credit losses, but this is a stock that trades on volumes and top-line growth in our opinion, so management is potentially being rational trading volume growth today for credit losses tomorrow, but it's not a very good fact pattern if you're long the stock.· Third, and most importantly, we think lending itself is massively more profitable than PYPL's core processing business, so growth in the lending business helps support overall company margins and is a nifty way to engineer earnings growth when your core processing business doesn't actually have all that much operating leverage. We think this is a key part of management's plan to maintain margins in the face of increasing transaction expenses as a result of the Visa and MasterCard ""partnerships."" More on this later.The $64k question, of course, is just how big is PayPal Credit in the scheme of things? Management considers ""PayPal Credit"" to only be the lending business but we'll highlight the associated processing business as well since we see them as symbiotic. Let's go through the P&L the same way we went through the on-eBay channel:Top-line: check. Now to transaction margins:Moving along. Now to the tricky part again where we have to allocate opex. Again, the proper way to do this would be to identify just the variable costs associated with each part of PayPal Credit, but we're not able to do that using the Company's disclosure and we're just trying to get a ballpark sense anyway.On the lending side, we assume opex of 4.5% of average gross loan balances which is in-line with a comp set of LC, DFS, COF, and SYF with the caveat that we strip out sales and marketing expenses from peer metrics since we don't think PYPL Credit's lending business itself has any marketing costs (it free rides off the processing side).On the processing side, we'll think about opex two ways: first assigning none of the identifiable opex (sales & marketing, product development) to it based on the same rationale for the on-eBay allocation and then allocating the remainder based on TPV, and then just a plain old full allocation based on TPV. Here's how the lending side of the business looks:23% of EBITDA!? And growing!? We acknowledge there will be debate about the yield on these loans since 20% is only the stated APR and they offer borrowers a six month grace period so the effective yield would be lower on that basis, but on the other hand, we think these are small dollar loans and the Company charges $25-$35 late fees which could be very large on small balances and very frequent on a subprime borrower base. Since 20% comports with management's guidance, we think that has to be in the right ballpark.[Editor's note 11/7/2016 5:21 p.m.: Individual and firm names redacted at their request.]Our math has also been corroborated by [name redacted], a former senior PayPal employee, who, according to sources, indicated on a [firm name redacted] hosted call recently, that just the loan products at PayPal Credit generate operating income in the 8-10% range on loan balances. If accurate, that would imply our math is very nearly dead on. We would also highlight that the lending business appears to have an EBITDA margin about 2x that of the company average.We think this business is a key part of management's strategy to keep margins from falling in the face of transaction cost hikes in the face of the recent Visa and MasterCard ""partnerships"" and constantly declining take-rates. This is borne out by the aggressive ramp in loan growth relative to TPV growth in the last 18 months.Here's how the processing side of the business looks under both opex allocation methods:What do you know? Another 4-7% of EBITDA at incredibly high margins that are of arguably dubious provenance. If these numbers are even remotely right, the lending side of PayPal Credit is a surprisingly large piece of earnings, and, combined with the processing side of the business, it's downright scary. Did we mention this isn't Visa?Now management is very sensitive about what the market knows about this business and they are very, very, very careful (read: lawyered) about how they describe what it means to PYPL overall. They constantly quote it in terms of TPV or revenues to make it seem minuscule with things like: ""[PayPal Credit has] been a pretty consistent portion of our volume… Credit relative to total volume of around 2% to 2.5% over the last several years,""[36] and ""the Credit business today at PayPal is less than 10% of PayPal's revenue.""[37]We think this is a red flag by itself: the Company is feigning disclosure by releasing a relatively innocuous metric (contribution to TPV or revenues) while not disclosing the much more relevant metric (contribution to earnings), but we are starting to see this as an emerging pattern when management has to talk about things they don't want to (see on-eBay earnings discussion).During the Q&A session of the Investor Day, an astute sell-side analyst asked about the profit contribution from PayPal Credit to which management responded ""we intentionally disclosed revenue and not profits, but profit is not appreciably larger than the high single digits number that we see in revenue right now (emphasis: ours)."" Now, first of all, we think this comment is so vague as to be meaningless: What is ""appreciably""?What kind of profit figure are we talking about? Gross profit? Operating profit? Pre-tax earnings? GAAP or non-GAAP? And how is the Company allocating overhead and the economic cost of capital of funding these loans with equity? Second of all, the fact that the Company is actively avoiding talking about the credit book's contribution to earnings strikes us as a red flag because if it wasn't ugly, presumably they would just disclose it and dispel fears about the worst.We would encourage interested readers to contact management to see if they can get a straight answer on this point because we haven't been able to. Management assertions to the contrary notwithstanding, math is math, and we think it is a mathematical impossibility that this is not a deceptively large piece of earnings. Just think about the unit economics of a traditional transaction versus a PayPal Credit transaction:[38]PYPL makes over 5x more on a PayPal Credit transaction than a traditional non-PayPal Credit transaction if this is even remotely accurate. How could PayPal Credit not be a much, much larger piece of earnings than revenues or TPV? We would also note that just the Synchrony Financial rev share of $119m plus gain on sales of $40m alone would be ~10% of a clean 2015 pre-tax figure of $1.6bn, [39] in our opinion directly contradicting management's statement about the earnings contribution from PayPal Credit. We naturally question management's forthrightness in how they discuss this business.Of course, generating a big piece of your earnings from a credit book isn't necessarily a bad thing, even if the market is in the dark about it, as long as you don't have an ugly credit event that spoils the party and as long as you're reserved appropriately. Well, we have more bad news. We think PayPal Credit is woefully under-reserved. Here is how their consumer book reserves stack up against the usual suspects using YE2015 figures for comparability purposes:First, let's just take a moment to admire PYPL's credit metrics compared to peers. Pretty outstanding, right? Companies with much more experience in consumer lending may be afraid of running with this kind of risk profile, but PYPL appears to laugh in the face of things like ""underwriting"" and ""risk management."" Second, notice that PYPL's reserves relative to charge-offs and delinquencies are a fraction of peers' levels. They don't even have enough reserves to cover their delinquencies!If PYPL reserved for their consumer credit book like a standard consumer credit issuer, that would require an incremental $180-$450m of charges on our math. On the commercial side, if PYPL just reserved like ONDK, which we think is the best peer given the target market, they would take an additional $20m charge. Putting this together, we're looking at $200-$470m of incremental charges, or 10-30% of clean 2015 pre-tax earnings just to reserve appropriately in a benign credit environment!In a stressed credit environment, it's easy to see how half of earnings could get wiped out on credit losses. You can think about the extent of their underreserving in a few other ways: 9% of loans were made to borrowers with a FICO score below 599 (borrowers in this range are euphemistically categorized as ""bad"" and ""poor credit"") while the Company has only reserved 5.3% for losses across its entire book; and nearly 10% of loans were delinquent at year-end yet again the Company only had reserves to cover half of those potential losses.PYPL should have to double reserves (a ~$200m charge) just to reflect the risk of existing delinquencies, not to mention build a cushion for future delinquencies! We don't think the market would take kindly to a payment processor missing earnings because of credit risks that no one knew existed.It might be worth recapping what we've covered so far:· eBay appears to be a huge piece of earnings (50-65% of EBITDA)· eBay has the ability to crush those earnings· PayPal Credit appears to be a huge piece of earnings, as well (28-30% of EBITDA including the processing side)· Credit losses have the potential to crush those earningsSweet recap.We've covered the on-eBay channel and the PayPal Credit channel, and that leaves one piece remaining to examine: the off-eBay channel, or what the Company calls ""Merchant Services."" The numbers here will be quick to run through since we've already built income statements for the on-eBay channel and PayPal Credit. Rather than talk about each line-item individually like we did for the previous discussions, let's just lay out the numbers that are implied for off-eBay by our work on the other channels. This is what that looks like:There are some surprising takeaways here. That this is a much lower margin business and much smaller piece of the earnings stream makes sense based on our findings thus far, but what is really problematic for the Company is that this channel appears to have not grown earnings at all between 2012 and 2015 despite a more than doubling of TPV and several deals (Braintree+Venmo, Paydiant, Xoom).In other words, nearly all of PYPL's earnings growth over the last several years has been driven growth in PayPal's subprime credit book and eBay. The off-eBay business must have a much lower contribution margin than the rest of the business, probably as a result of a much higher variable cost structure because that's realistically where all the biggest costs reside: sales and marketing (signing up new merchants and new consumers without the eBay freeride), product development (need to innovate to grow off-eBay; and how much innovation do you need on the credit side when you offer all comers one fixed interest rate?), customer support and operations (a collection of businesses of varying size and scope; dealing with millions of merchants rather than just one eBay), and G&A (again, it's probably more unwieldy and costly to manage a portfolio of various businesses rather than the on-eBay business).From this perspective, all that really matters for earnings growth is growth in eBay volumes and growth in its subprime credit book; and remember the subprime credit book has grown faster than TPV historically while margins have been flat overall, suggesting that PayPal Credit has in fact been used to support overall company margins as growth in lower margin off-eBay volumes have dragged them down. If this is correct, we think PYPL misses earnings even if it hits sell-side volume growth expectations (unless they continue to really step on the gas in PayPal Credit) because the sell-side isn't capturing this dynamic.Another important dynamic that the sell-side is out to lunch on is the massively-hyped, recently-signed ""partnerships"" with Visa and MasterCard. To give the reader some background, PYPL has historically ""steered"" consumers in various ways to fund their PayPal transactions with ACH funds rather than debit or credit cards because it is a massively more profitable transaction from PYPL's perspective- like multiples more profitable.The payment networks (Visa and MasterCard) and the banks hate this because they're getting cut out of volumes. It's especially offensive to the banks because PYPL sports a 30x+ P/E multiple and $50bn valuation basically freeriding on the ACH network rails that they built, while the banks can't get a break on anything: their valuations are in the toilet, their earnings are getting slammed by interest rates, and don't even get them started on the regulatory environment. Don't even!So within the last three months, PYPL struck agreements with Visa and MasterCard where they committed to end steering and enable consumers to use their credit cards to fund PayPal transactions freely and easily. In our opinion, PYPL got basically nothing out of this and Visa and MasterCard threw them a bone with face-saving talking points and allowing them to call it a ""partnership,"" but we'll let interested readers judge for themselves. What is interesting to us is just how confused the market is about what to make of these agreements. Here's our perspective on the action in the stock related to this stuff:Phase I: Market either blissfully unaware of what steering is or that it might be a problem.Phase II: Market begins to suspect PYPL may be taking advantage of the ACH network and over-earning as a result.Phase III: Market gets excited about a potential positive announcement with Visa after PYPL moves its Q2 2016 earnings date to coincide with Visa's.Phase IV: Market rudely awakened to the fact that the agreement reached with Visa to stop steering announced on the Q2 2016 earnings call in July might actually be bad for earnings after the Company conspicuously refuses to reaffirm medium-term guidance.Phase V: Management hits the road and starts talking up these agreements, indicating to investors that they ""shouldn't assume… that these deals are automatically dilutive to earnings in 2017.""[40]Naturally, the market's reaction to management's promotional commentary was something like this:Phase VI: Q3 2016 earnings when the Company effectively misses earnings (they reported an in-line quarter on non-GAAP EPS supported by an epically low 10% tax rate), guides to an implied 2017 non-GAAP EPS below Street estimates, and the sell-side takes their 2017 non-GAAP EPS estimates down, but management doesn't budge from its 2017 and medium-term operating margin guidance despite the impact that dropping steering will have on the cost structure.As a result, the stock is up over 10% that day and is now 10-15% higher than before the market knew what steering was because management has successfully convinced the market that the risk it didn't know existed, isn't actually a risk. Makes sense. Here's a snapshot of sell-side 2017 EPS estimates against the stock price to illustrate what a funny story this is.We think that there is a unique piece of information that suggests these Visa/MasterCard ""partnerships"" are unequivocally bad for PYPL. We won't try to convince you, gentle reader, about how much PYPL's suspension of steering will hit earnings by- there has been enough ink spilled on that one already. We have our view and the sell-side has their own heavily-influenced-and-promoted-by-management view.But what we will point out is that the Company line, the line that goes something like ""even though we'll take a hit on transaction costs, we'll make it up on volumes and we've done all the testing to prove it,"" is quite suspicious. And not just for the obvious reason that if it was true they would have done it years ago, but because PYPL management teams have been parroting this line for nearly a decade. Let's take a look at what past PYPL management teams have had to say on the topic with our commentary below (source: Bloomberg transcripts):Uh, what on Earth is going on here? If management has been saying they weren't steering and were open to consumer choice for at least the last seven years, why were these Visa and MasterCard agreements necessary today at all? And why is management today using the exact same rationale for opening up to consumer choice as former management teams (who apparently never actually did)?And if they were actively steering consumers to ACH in the past despite it making so much economic sense to not steer according to the current management team, why were the former management teams too dumb to see that and why were they apparently lying about it? There is something really weird going on here.We think the logical answer is this: PayPal aggressively steered consumers to ACH in the past because it was the profit-maximizing thing to do, and the old management teams were being less than forthright in their description of their steering and consumer choice practices in order to not arouse the ire of the banks and payment networks.The current management team was finally forced to face the music by the payment networks, which hate PYPL's steering, and they tried to come up with a plausible sounding and face-saving reason to allow consumer choice, which happened to be the recycled talking point of former management teams who clearly didn't actually believe it.This odd fact pattern alone suggests to us that these agreements will be far more detrimental than management now assures us:So they're going to take a hit on margins in 2017 from opening up to consumer choice, but they're going to make up for it on ""other revenue and cost initiatives."" And longer term they'll pick up volumes and there will be operating leverage and everything will be great! Are you curious about what kind of ""other revenue and cost initiatives"" they have in mind? If so, you're more curious than a PYPL sell-side coverage analyst.Here's our theory on the ""revenue initiative"" part: it is probably higher margin than the rest of the business, you can grow it at will, and it rhymes with ""DayDal Dedit."" You guessed it. We think they will just goose volumes at PayPal Credit (ostensibly by increasing approval rates and reducing credit quality). Consider the following timeline:· July 21: PYPL enters into a no-steering agreement with Visa (stock down 6.8% that day on margin compression fears as management conspicuously avoids reaffirming medium term guidance).· September 6: PYPL enters into a no-steering agreement with MasterCard.· September 13: PYPL talks up V/MA agreements at a Deutsche Bank conference and indicates that investors ""shouldn't assume… that these deals are automatically dilutive to earnings in 2017.""[52] (stock up 9.8% in the two weeks surrounding the conference- we assume they were talking with investors outside of the conference itself).· September 15: PYPL announces in a Braintree blog post that it will be rolling out PayPal Credit to Braintree merchants.[53] There is no mention of this on PayPal's website as far as we can tell. · October 20: Management reaffirms medium term margin guidance (stock up 10.1% that day).Does it seem like more than a coincidence that management neglected to reaffirm guidance, then rolled out PayPal Credit to nearly a quarter of its volumes by our estimation, then reaffirmed guidance? In our opinion, management is clearly going to gun it on PayPal Credit in order to meet expectations. This will work for a while, but earnings quality will get worse and worse, and it's already pretty bad.More importantly, we think management is putting the entire business at risk if it continues to play this game and a spectacular blow-up will be inevitable. We'll close this point just by noting that many other high-growth lenders have met similar fates over the last few years.Source: Google FinanceWell, this is getting long and we should probably wrap it up. One of the challenges of laying out the PYPL short thesis is that there are so many problems with the business that, like a Clinton scandal, it's hard to pick which ones to focus on and many end up falling through the cracks as a result. We'll fire off a few more rapid-fire style and then we promise we'll be done.· There is a serious question about the sustainability of their mid/high-teens cash tax rate. According to Company filings, it sounds like their tax rate will effectively double in 4-5 years. Let's go to the 10-K (emphasis added):There has been no discussion in filings nor any management commentary about any sorts of renewals, renegotiations, or appeals on this tax point. In fact, the only tax rate guidance from the Company that we could find was for 2016 for 18-19%.[54] In 2015, the Company paid $216m of cash taxes on $1.5bn of pre-tax income for an effective cash tax rate of 14.5%. In the 10-K excerpt above, the Company discloses that their Singapore/Luxembourg tax rulings saved them $285m in 2015, in other words, their tax rate would have doubled to 34% without these tax rulings.We would note that both Visa and MasterCard pay an effective tax rate of 30% with similar geographic mixes, so a 30%+ tax rate seems reasonable in this space. How are they able to maintain such a low tax rate? Let's go back to the 10-K's disclosure around geographic pre-tax income mix:Well, either they somehow lose money in the US, the geography where they had 55% of their sales in 2015, or they are shamelessly earnings stripping using the same shenanigans that have gotten Apple, Starbucks, Amazon, and McDonald's in trouble recently. As such, given the political environment, we would put a low probability on the Company somehow maintaining its current tax rate in the face of these expiring tax rulings. A recent article from Bloomberg Intelligence entitled ""Spate of Scandalous Sweetheart Deals Sparks Tax Rule Reawakening"" notes:The Company wasn't able to give us any comfort about their ability to preserve their tax rate as these beneficial tax rulings expire, but we would encourage interested readers to give them a call and try them. The sell-side expects an 18%-19% tax rate in the coming years, a jump to 30% implies a ~15% hit to earnings.· We think there is a fair amount of accounting gimmickry and quality of earnings issues.First, the Company has a few 100% margin pieces of revenue that flow through without much fanfare: gains on sale of loans, a revenue sharing agreement from Synchrony's PayPal-branded private label credit card, and hedge gains. We established earlier that the former two items represented 10% of a clean 2015 pre-tax earnings figure. Including $199m of hedge gains, these three items add up to almost 22% of clean 2015 pre-tax earnings.Also, gains on sale and Synchrony revenue share grew by $120m in 2015 (growth in Synchrony revenues was driven by a one-time renegotiation) while ""clean"" EBITDA grew by $333m, so these two non-core items alone represented over 35% of ""clean"" EBITDA growth in 2015.[56] We don't think this is why bulls own PYPL, and we would note that this is on top of the already massive and lower quality earnings contributions from eBay and PayPal Credit.Second, the Company's definition of EBITDA is atrocious in our opinion. While the Company adds back some reasonable things like amortization and one-time expenses, it also adds back not just stock-based compensation (which we think is silly- this is a nearly 20 year-old company, not a high-growth, cash-burning start-up), but they also add back the cash payroll expenses associated with stock-based compensation grants which we think is completely indefensible albeit small dollars.These stock-based comp add-backs lifted earnings by over 20% in 2015 ($356m of stock-based comp on $1.6bn of clean pre-tax income), and are expected to run at 20-25% of clean earnings going forward based on sell-side estimates.And remember, this is how the Company guides and how the sell-side values the Company; we think they're basically made up numbers. If you think that somehow $350-$500m of stock-based comp expense is not economic so it's legitimate to add it back, let's see what PYPL management has to say:[57]In other words, the Company wants you to add back $350-$500m of expenses because they're non-cash, but then ignore the very cashy $500-$750m cost of buying back those shares (1% to 1.5% of a $50bn market cap). Are we the only ones on crazy pills that think this is a complete farce? So when you hear someone say ""PYPL trades at the same forward multiple as Visa or MasterCard,"" say ""not so fast, cochise. It trades at a 25% premium if you don't add back the ridiculously large amount of stock-based comp that they use cash to buy back anyway.""There have also been press reports about the SEC cracking down on companies' usage of such silly add-backs,[58] and if PYPL starts guiding to GAAP EPS (i.e., actual EPS), we are confident the stock would be down 20% that day as the market applies the current multiple to the correct earnings figure.We would also point out that the Company appears to be getting more and more aggressive with their doling out of stock-based comp, and the skeptic in us would say that is because they will add it back to EBITDA anyway so it's an easy way to create earnings out of thin air (just pay that employee $100 of stock rather than $100 of cash and voila! $100 more non-GAAP EBITDA!).Just a 100bps move on SBC/opex penetration would have added 230bps to the Q3 2016 non-GAAP operating income growth rate, so this is material. In fact, in Q2 2016, this stock-for-cash dynamic added over 430bps to the reported non-GAAP operating income growth rate (for the sake of completeness, it added 80bps in Q3 2016, 133bps in Q1 2016, 82bps in Q4 2015, and 361bps in Q3 2015)! Also, interestingly, it never seems to hit the reported growth rate.We expect SBC penetration to go up as management will need to manufacture earnings growth to prevent margins from declining in the face of the new Visa and MasterCard agreements. You can already see a wide divergence in GAAP vs. non-GAAP reported growth rates that we think are being driven in part by this dynamic.Third, we think management cherry-picks its disclosures. For instance, the Company's Q3 2016 earnings release boldly proclaims:Wow! 18% revenue growth, but it was even higher at 21% if you exclude pesky but uncontrollable FX moves! (Note: stellar GAAP EPS growth rate, guys…) What management doesn't draw your attention to is that they acquired Xoom in November 2015, so there is inorganic revenue growth in these numbers. Xoom did $42m of revenue in Q3 2015 and was growing at ~8% in when it was acquired, so just assuming it continued to grow at that rate post-acquisition implies Xoom added 230bps to that 21% FX-neutral revenue growth.This also implies GAAP organic transaction revenue growth was really only in the 14% range. Of course, maybe it's just not management practice to strip out acquisitions from their number...[59]Oh, dear. Management is apparently happy to flag things that make their numbers look better, and not so happy to flag the same things when they make their numbers look worse. Between things like this and their aggressive stock-based comp add-back practices, we think management is waving a red flag in front of the bull that is Mary Jo White and the SEC accounting team.· We think the probability of PYPL getting bought is much lower than bulls expect. Lots of bulls throw around the idea of PYPL getting bought by any number of companies- Alibaba, Facebook, Amazon, MasterCard, you name it. What they haven't noticed is that there is effectively a poison pill in the operating agreement, the very same operating agreement that rained on our eBay take-rate parade. Here's the relevant language:[60]Got that? So if PayPal gets bought by a ""Specified Person"" per the agreement, eBay gets to declare itself a Merchant of Record and proceed to maul PYPL's take-rate (and a 200bp move hits PYPL's earnings by 70% as we've shown). What kind of multiple would someone pay for an immediate 70% hit to earnings? Now the list of ""specified persons"" isn't provided in the document but we think it's a very safe bet that it includes direct competitors of eBay's (Alibaba, Amazon) and potential social network competitors (Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), LinkedIn (LNKD) and now Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)).But what about the traditional payment networks like Visa or MasterCard? The obstacles there in our view would be size (a PYPL deal would be controversial and massive relative to either one of those companies) and scope (Visa and MasterCard revel in the fact that they don't take credit risk, as we've shown, and we doubt they would jump at the chance to stray from that, not to mention all kinds of other fit problems in our opinion).And what about American Express, CEO Dan Schulman's alma mater? Well, we are skeptical that American Express would jump at the chance to buy a business run by a guy after they've recently shut down a business formerly run by him, reasonably indicating a lack of faith in his capabilities and strategic vision. From a January 2016 Bloomberg News article:[61]Ultimately we think the list of potential bidders is very, very short.· Also, Apple Pay.In our view, going from monopoly status to non-monopoly status implies a lot of bad things, but we're tired and we'll let interested readers sort this one out for themselves. Yeah, no, that's it.Well, that about does it, and, boy, have we covered a lot. We think we've demonstrated that far from being a disruptive, secular winner, PYPL is basically a disadvantaged vendor to eBay and a subprime lender, both of which have serious valuation and earnings durability implications. On top of those two fundamental issues, we think we've demonstrated that there are a load of other serious problems with this Company and many, many ways this stock goes down a lot.Well, what's it worth? Our base case valuation methodology is as follows:· Estimate 2016 EBITDA by channel in a status quo scenario (on-eBay, PYPL Credit - Processing, PYPL Credit - Lending, off-eBay). For the record, we are approximately on top of sell-side numbers at this point.· Haircut on-eBay's take-rate by 150bps as though eBay declared itself the merchant of record today. And remember, that would only bring it even with the off-eBay take-rate despite eBay being PYPL's largest customer by far.· Haircut PYPL Credit EBITDA by $300m for a more reasonable provisioning policy.· Haircut earnings by $225m based on a mere 10pp mix shift from ACH to credit on our estimate of $100bn of vulnerable TPV.[62] Remember, management may grow PayPal Credit aggressively to hide this.· Apply a 30% tax rate as though they Company's tax rulings expired today.· Add-back amortization to earnings but don't add-back stock-based comp.· Apply MasterCard's 2016E P/E multiple of 28x despite the much, much lower business quality at PYPL.· Give credit for four remaining years of overearning both on their on-eBay take-rate and their apparently expiring tax rate.That gets us to 2016 cash EPS of $0.34 and a price target of $12.50, down over 70%.

4014914,47521,2016-10-25T20:31:52-04:00,PayPal's Venmo makes it the leader in the mobile payment space.Will process over $20 billion by end of 2016 - just getting started.Resistance from those opposing cashless society won't harm the company - market wants digital payment options.Why PayPal will enjoy its competitive advantage for a long time.,"Source: VenmoComing off a solid quarter where it beat revenue expectations and met earnings projections, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is positioned for long-term growth and profits, as it continues to grow its ubiquitous Venmo app, and making significant strategic alliances ensuring it will outrun its competition.In the last quarter, PayPal's Venmo processed about $4.9 billion in payments, and is expected to process approximately $20 billion by the end of 2016.With a customer base in place from its prior financial transaction business, it was an obvious step for PayPal to enter into the mobile payment business, and the simplicity of using Venmo makes it a desirable way of making transactions by customers.All that has to be done is to add a new credit card to the service and it instantly syncs customer contacts to the phone. It's then ready to make whatever payments the users want to make to their contact list. There's nothing else to do but use our phones to quickly send money.There are some competitors rising to challenge PayPal's dominance, with the latest being Zelle, which is backed by many financial institutions. But I don't see it being able to stop the momentum of PayPal in the mobile payment space, at least for the next five years or so.The overall mobile payment market will continue to grow, as it spreads across to many areas of the world that are increasing their disposable income. The bulk of payments made in the U.S. already don't include cash, and that's going to come close to 100 percent in the not too distant future.PayPal is leading the way, and there is a lot of room for it to grow as it expands its service around the world, and finds new ways via partnerships to increase mobile payment transactions far beyond where they are today.Source: StockCharts.comLatest earningsPayPal exceeded expectations for third-quarter revenue, generating $2.67 billion for the quarter, beating analyst estimates of $2.65 billion. Earnings were in line with expectations, coming in at 35 cents per share.Active customer accounts in the quarter climbed 11 percent, while the number of transactions processed soared 24 percent. Overall payment volume finished the quarter at $87 billion, up 25 percent. This is one of the areas I see its strategic partnerships accelerating company growth.The number of active customer accounts have consistently increased over the last six years, and PayPal is positioned to continue that over the next six years as well; even if it only included the Venmo part of its business.Along with its core service, the company also has increased active customer accounts via its Xoom service.The company offered some promising guidance for fiscal 2017, with revenue growth expected to be in a range of 16 percent to 17 percent.For the fourth quarter, it's looking at revenue to finish between $2.92 billion and $2.99 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share is projected to end the quarter between 40 cents and 42 cents.The company upwardly revised its revenue guidance for full-year 2016 on the low-end of its estimate, increasing it from $10.75 billion to $10.78 billion. On the top-end, it maintained its prior guidance of $10.85 billion in revenue.Citing Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson, CNBC reported he sees ""Venmo's peer-to-peer transaction volume to grow to about $84 billion in 2019 from $14 billion in 2014.""Resistance from cashless society opponents won't make a differenceThere are a small but vocal group of people that oppose the emergence of the cashless society who believe it could lead to a loss of freedom and too much control over the monetary system because of the removal of cash as an option for those who want to keep their financial transactions private.While understandable, and there is some risk there, it isn't going to make a difference with the mobile business of PayPal, or the mobile payment industry in general. The reason is the market wants digital payment services, meaning demand is driving growth and adaptation by consumers and businesses. That isn't going to change.I only mention this because there are some financial and investment influencers that embrace the concerns of a cashless society, and speak out consistently against it.From an investment point of view this doesn't matter. There is going to be a lot of money to be made as the number of mobile transactions increase, and whether investors are favorable to it or not, it's going to continue to grow.The point is resistance and possible risks to freedom aren't going to take away the growth and profit opportunity that accompanies this long-term trend. My view is if you don't like it, make money while voicing your opposition. It's not going to go away or stop growing.I tend to agree the cash option should remain available to those who want it. Even so, I can't remember how many years it's been since I've even had cash in my wallet, or used it to pay for something.PartnershipsMobile payments now account for almost 30 percent of PayPal's business. Not only will that mix as a total of its portfolio continue to grow in percentage, it'll fairly quickly become the dominant revenue and earnings source of the company.Among some of the significant partnerships PayPal has entered into are Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat (CHAT).The potential of the volume represented in these partnerships alone are mind-boggling. It definitely suggests PayPal is going to enjoy a prolonged period of meaningful growth from its mobile payment business, with my major concern not so much being its competition, but the upcoming recession that will, without a doubt, slow down spending by businesses and consumers.Competition, while not unimportant, isn't going to slow down PayPal's growth because of its position in the segment of the market and the soaring demand for services. It will ride the momentum as the market leader. Others will participate to one degree or another that growth, but not near as much as PayPal will.Only a prolonged period of global economic contraction will slow down the mobile payment market in general, and PayPal specifically.CompetitorsThere are some major competitors in the mobile pay space, including Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), Square Inc. (NYSE:SQ), and most recently, Zelle, which is backed by some of the major financial institutions.Apple Pay generated transactions of just under $11 billion in 2015, while Square had a transactions total of $35.6 billion. These are far below the $87 billion in transactions coming from PayPal's Venmo.Square and Apple Pay are pretty well known, so I want to focus on Zelle in this part of the article, as it is getting a lot of media coverage at this time, and it should be understood in relationship to its potential to compete against PayPal, rather than temporary hype.Zelle is an app built by Early Warning, a bank-owned company backed by financial giants like Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Citibank (NYSE:C) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). It is expected to launch in early 2017.If there is any competitive advantage with the service at all, it would be that it is built upon the existing payment network that connects the major banks mentioned above, and others, and offers the ability of users to instantly make deposits. Venmo and other competitors don't offer that feature at this time.The problem with Zelle is it is something offered too little to late to make a difference. I've seen similar types of moves in other industries, such as when Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) appeared on the scene, and it took a long time for traditional companies to provide alternatives to the service.I see this with Zelle too. It may attract some mature customers liking the deposit option (although that can be offered by competitors as well, although with more risk), but I don't see the key millennial mobile transaction processing customer base flocking to Zelle instead of the existing services that already have mind and heart share.From PayPal's point of view, I don't see this as a legitimate competitor at all. It will generate some interest, but I think it's going to be very minimal and irrelevant.As mentioned earlier, the only thing I see over the next several years being a real threat to PayPal is the global economy, not its competitors. This assumes the company doesn't make some major mistake which would open it up to losing market share and growth momentum.ConclusionIt's interesting to read about competitors to PayPal in the mobile payment processing market, because the company has jumped out to such a big lead, it seems to be irrelevant to look into its much smaller competitors. But this is PayPal's battle to win or lose, and I see it being a big winner in this extraordinarily fast-growing market.That isn't to say its competitors don't matter, only that the mobile payment tide is going to raise all ships, and PayPal in my view will continue to not only grow along with the sector, but extend its lead over its closest competitors.For that reason, as mobile payment revenue becomes a larger percentage of PayPal's overall business, it will propel the company to new revenue and earnings heights, and shareholders should rid a long-term growth cycle which will eventually be slowed down when the recession hits, but will continue on for many years to come.PayPal is better positioned to benefit from that growth than any competitor at this time. The introduction of Zelle isn't going to change that."
4011070,58641,2016-10-10T01:41:15-04:00,"PayPal already charges me 4.47% fee on payments I receive.It also charges me a currency conversion fee to withdraw U.S. dollars to my Philippine bank.Revenue from the currency conversion fee could rise up after PayPal makes serious inroads in international remittances.I rate the stock as a Buy. Even with its currency conversion fee, PayPal still offers cheaper fees on international money transfer.PayPal could eventually threaten Western Union and MoneyGram's long-running dominance in the global remittance industry.","I already asked my bank, Banco De Oro, last year. They told me that they are not getting any share of PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) ""currency conversion fee"" whenever I withdraw U.S. dollar money to my Philippine peso account. Currency conversion fees could add up to a hefty annual sum after PayPal starts getting adopted as a tool for migrant remittances.Aside from the usual 4.4% fee plus fixed fee that PayPal charges its customers, currency conversion fee is another way that the company can benefit from the fast-growing international mobile remittance industry. Juniper Research estimates that mobile international remittances will grow from $15 billion in 2015 to $25 billion by 2018.Other people call PayPal's currency conversion fee as plain stealing. However, I believe the company is simply exercising its right to make more money from its users. Anything that legitimately helps pad PayPal's revenue stream is fair trade practice. It does not charge any fee when withdrawing funds to another currency.I just withdrew $500 to my Philippine bank account. The screenshot of my Activity tab below shows PayPal did not charge me any fee. However, the current U.S. dollar to Philippine peso exchange rate is 48.237. The company used a 1 US dollar = 47.06 Philippine peso exchange rate.(Source: Motek Moyen)Prior to agreeing to withdraw the $500, PayPal's Review Page did clearly state that it includes a currency conversion fee. It is the reason why it is converting my dollars at a notably lower exchange rate. PayPal made 558.50 pesos ($11.58) on my withdrawal. This is an effective rate of 2.31%, and it represents the company's take from its currency conversion fee scheme.(Source: Motek Moyen)PayPal Still Offers Cheaper Fees On International Money TransferPayPal charges me 4.47% fee when my Israeli employer I Know First sends me my salary. It therefore gets $6.78 for every $100 that I Know First pays me - which, in turn, gets withdrawn to the Philippines. Even with the added cost of the currency conversion fee, PayPal's rate is still much lower than Western Union's (NYSE:WU) fees. Western Union charges $14 on $100 sent and $37 on $500 sent.(Source: Western Union Philippines)PayPal's international money transfer fee is also lower than MoneyGram's (NASDAQ:MGI). MoneyGram charges $11.99 when sending $500 from the U.S. to the Philippines and $19.99 if sending $900. PayPal's notably lower fees on international money transfer could help it disrupt the core businesses of Western Union and MoneyGram.(Source: MoneyGram)Based on SaveonSend.com's analysis, Western Union continues to dominate the global money remittance industry. PayPal's subsidiary, Xoom, is still a far fifth-ranked player in the international remittance business.PayPal Needs To Educate Overseas Workers About Its Lower FeesGoing forward, I hope PayPal starts marketing itself as a cheaper alternative to Western Union and MoneyGram. In my country alone, millions of overseas Filipino workers still continue to rely on Western Union and MoneyGram to send their hard-earned dollars back home.PayPal is already a world-famous brand. Unfortunately, majority of overseas workers still do not take advantage of digital money transfer services like PayPal. Most Filipinos still queue up on Western Union- or MoneyGram-authorized agent outlets to send or receive money.I am sure citizens of other countries also do the same. In spite of its success in digital e-commerce, PayPal's money transfer service is still less popular than Western Union's decades-old method of sending money. The company needs to educate more people about its services and make it more convenient. The fees on processing billions of dollars in remittance money is something that PayPal needs to improve its long-term growth prospects.The $75.9 billion annual remittance money being sent from the United States to other countries is mostly benefiting Western Union and MoneyGram.The World Bank estimated that migrant remittance industry will process $610 billion this year. PayPal getting 10% of that business (and charging a 6% fee) could produce new revenue of $3.66 billion. The company's 2015 revenue was $9.25 billion. Expanding its business to include international remittances, therefore, could substantially accelerate PayPal's top line growth.(Source: World Bank)ConclusionPayPal needs to compete more against Western Union and MoneyGram. It is time for it to grow beyond its digital-only business model. If it wants to benefit from the international remittance industry, the company has to build its own retail network of partner outlets where people can send/receive money.Xoom, Western Union, and MoneyGram have thousands of partner agent shops where people can send/receive money in the Philippines. It is time PayPal starts advertising aggressively that it could use Xoom's 15k partner outlets in the Philippines where overseas workers and migrants can send money.Three million overseas workers remitted $28.5 billion to the Philippines last year - making it the third-biggest country receiving international remittances. Most of the transfer fees likely went to Western Union and MoneyGram.PayPal should spend some advertising money to attract the attention of migrant workers. Like the Philippines, India, which is top receiver of remittances ($72.2 billion), and China ($63.9 billion) have a large population of migrant citizens and workers.Eroding Western Union and MoneyGram's market share in international remittances requires PayPal to first gain the support of migrants and overseas workers. As per the World Bank, there are 247 million people who live/work outside their home countries.PayPal should try harder to monetize from these people's habit of making international money transfers. One universal way that people express their love/devotion to their relatives is to keep sending them money."
4014052,98366,2016-10-23T04:32:01-04:00,"Another strong quarter from PayPal saw total payment volume increase at a strong rate.
        We think the rise of online shopping will be the catalyst to solid long-term growth.
        Growing active accounts and rising transactions are a perfect mix.
        We think PayPal is a must-own stock and a great long-term buy and hold investment.","There are very few stocks out there that we would class as must-own stocks. But we would have to agree with analysts at Jefferies that have labeled global payments powerhouse PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) a must-own stock. Thanks to the continuing growth of online shopping, even after the post-earnings jump in its share price, we think PayPal represents a fantastic long-term buy and hold investmentDespite the fact that online shopping is big business, it represents only a small part of total retail sales presently. In the first quarter of 2016 just 7.8% of all retail sales in the United States were made online. Although we still believe bricks and mortar retailing has a future, we see significant growth ahead for online shopping over the next decade. This puts PayPal in an incredibly strong position for growth, especially with its market-dominating position. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with Apple Pay, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) with Android Pay, and other payment companies such as Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) will no doubt be strong competition. But right now PayPal is entrenched and not looking likely to give up its share any time soon.Once again payment volumes grew in the third quarter despite currency headwinds. According to its quarterly presentation payment volume grew slightly quarter on quarter but over 24% on the prior corresponding period to $87 billion. As you can see below, the year on year growth has been very strong.Source: Company PresentationPlaying a key role in this has of course been an increase in active customers. The long run of quarter on quarter growth continues, leading to year on year growth in the quarter of approximately 11% to 192 million accounts.Source: Company PresentationBut it isn't all about gaining new customers. Of course new customer accounts growth is vitally important for the company's growth, but the number of payments they make is just as important. A business could grow active customer accounts at a rapid rate, but if its customers are transacting less and less often then total payment volume will start to shrink. Thankfully, and impressively, PayPal continues to see a rise in the number of payment transactions per active account. During the third quarter PayPal processed 1.5 billion transactions, which was up 24% on the prior corresponding period. Transactions per active account increased 13%.Source: Company PresentationThis is something we expect could continue to grow for some time to come. As online shopping grows, we believe that we are likely to see more and more transactions per active account.There are two factors that we expect to drive this, with one being the ex of its overall presence. In the third quarter PayPal added a number of notable merchants to its platform that now boasts 15 million active merchant accounts. Notable brands using PayPal include H&M (OTCPK:HNNMY), Costco Mexico (NASDAQ:COST), Yelp (NYSE:YELP), and Yandex Direct (NASDAQ:YNDX).We think the second driver will be One Touch. When One Touch is enabled shoppers can skip entering login and billing info and just click buy. It really is as easy as it sounds. And anything that makes transacting easier and quicker, without compromising on security and fraud protection is going to go down well with shoppers in our opinion. This certainly appears to be the case as well. As of the third quarter over 32 million active consumer accounts and 4 million active merchant accounts had enabled One Touch.But it's not all about PayPal's core product. We have found the growth of its Venmo service to be very impressive. Venmo lets users split payments for cabs, food, or bills, for example, with friends and is growing at a rapid rate. In the third quarter the service handled payments of $4.9 billion, after volume grew a staggering 131%. We think the service has a lot more growth in the tank and really fills a niche in the market.So overall we are very pleased to be invested in this growing company. Admittedly at 39 times trailing earnings its shares appear at first glance to be a little on the high side.But with management forecasting earnings per share to come in between $1.48 and $1.50 for FY 2016, we feel this makes its shares about fair value now at 30 times forecast earnings.Moving forward management believe for the next three years, at least, that total payment volume will grow by upwards of 20% per year on a constant currency basis. As they are also hinting that operating margins will expand during this time, we expect that its earnings growth will remain strong enough to justify a PE ratio of 30.For FY 2017 we have forecast earnings per share of approximately $1.75. At 30 times earnings this would mean a price target of $52.50, equating to a 12-month return of just under 19% from its last close price.It is for this reason that we agree with Jefferies. PayPal is a must-own stock."
4010168,22742,2016-10-04T23:04:05-04:00,There is a difference between being a successful investor and just wanting to be one: understanding value.There are several ways to value a company. Find one that makes the most sense to you.Here are the methods I use to value a company and what my current estimated valuation is for PayPal.Point-counterpoint links to other well-conceived articles on PayPal.,"Are you a successful investor?This is more than just a rhetorical question. It is what defines how comfortably one will be able to retire or if s/he will be able to retire at all. As we all know, it starts with saving. But what to do with those accumulated savings? Results are what defines success as an investor - not just short-term gains, but those long-term compounded annual returns over a period of five years or more. Many money managers occasionally outperform the market indices like the Dow Jones Industrial average (DJI), the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), or the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:QQQ), but very few can do so consistently, year after year.I invest primarily for rising dividends, but I also like to add some growth stocks by which I can convert the appreciation to income-producing securities in the future. Today, I will value a company that does not yet pay a dividend, but is considered a potential fast grower by most analysts.When the market becomes overvalued, I hedge and accumulate more cash. I find that one of the keys to investing success is to limit losses. When the value of a portfolio falls by 50 percent, one must double the remaining amount just to get back to even. Fortunately for me, I have found a tool that helps me with that conundrum. I will share more about that later in the article.Valuation models to considerThere are plenty of valuation models to choose, ranging from simple to highly complex. Generally speaking, the simple models have as few as one or two assumptions that the investor/analyst must decide upon (in reality, this is called guessing) to reflect future outcomes from the company and thus derive an estimate of fair value. The more complex models can require many assumptions, which can also lead to either a much higher degree of accuracy or create far more opportunities for human error. As you might guess, I prefer the simpler models, but also use some moderately more complex models for validation.As I have mentioned in the past, I like the DDM (dividend discount model) and the DCF (discounted cash flows) models. I also like to use the average historical P/E (price-to-earnings ratio) as a check. This would be a value based upon an earnings multiple approach. It can be argued, and rightfully so, that investors are paying now for the future earnings of a company. But the definition of ""earnings"" is getting harder to pin down, as more than 90 percent of large-capitalization companies now report non-GAAP EPS (earnings per share) instead of GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) EPS. When I look up historical EPS for the S&P 500 by year, I find tables from several different sources, all with different numbers for each year. In aggregate, GAAP EPS are much lower than non-GAAP earnings, and the gap between the two is rising. Therefore, I do not rely on any valuation that requires an input value for future earnings. Estimating the net present value of future free cash flow provides what I believe to be a much more reliable valuation for a company. Management and analysts can work magic with EPS, but free cash flow is hard to manipulate.A little background on PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL)As a rule, I do not analyze many companies that do not pay a dividend, but since a reader asked, I decided to include this one. Obviously, I will not be including a DDM valuation.PYPL was established in 1998 and became publicly traded through an IPO in 2002. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) bought PYPL later that same year. In July 2015, EBAY spun PYPL off in another IPO valuing the company at around $46.6 billion. Today, with the current share price of $40.78 (as of 4:00 p.m. on Tuesday, October 04, 2016), the market capitalization stands at just over $49.2 billion.The company offers a range of digital payment solutions for consumers and merchants worldwide and in various currencies. It is primarily a technology payments platform that enables commerce.Due to the limited history, the data I will use comes from Old School Valuations and includes the data since 2013 provided by the company in SEC filings in conjunction with its IPO. Since a picture is worth a thousand words. I will use charts to provide some visual illustrations. The first is a chart of the stock price since the IPO. PYPL has moved erratically since the IPO, from $38 to the current price of $40.78 over the last year and a half. That works out to about a 4.1 percent annual return and no dividend.Chart by Mark Bern, CFA data source: oldschoolvalue.comEarnings bounced back in 2015 after a rough tumble in 2014, but that pace of growth has moderated to a more reasonable 10.4 percent over the TTM (trailing twelve-month) period. Since online retail sales are increasing at about 15 percent clip Y/O/Y (year over year), it could be assumed that PYPL should be able to match that rate of growth going forward for at least the next few years. But I would hesitate to expect too much more than that.Chart by Mark Bern, CFA data source: oldschoolvalue.comFCF (free cash flow) is, in my opinion, one of the most important indicators of financial health for a company. It does not necessarily need to continue to rise every year, but it does need to be consistently positive. The reason it can drop occasionally is that management of a company may find it prudent to increase capital expenditures in some years to meet expected future demand growth. FCF is what is left over from operating cash flow after adding back depreciation and amortization and subtracting capital expenses. Here we see that PYPL has a healthy trend in its FCF being generated.Chart by Mark Bern, CFA data source: oldschoolvalue.comNow we take a look at the annual change in net debt. Through 2015, the trend was down, but in 2016, it has sharply reversed course and is increasing at a significant rate. Concurrently, the company began buying back shares in 2016 of over $760 million. Additionally, in 2015, it made investments, primarily in available for sale securities, net of maturities of about $4 billion, and made acquisitions during the year of $1.2 billion. Those items account for the use of FCF and added debt as well as a reduction in cash of $808 million during the year.The investments can be converted to cash when needed in the future. It appears that PayPal, like many others, is taking advantage of low interest rates now in preparation to meet cash needs of the future. The company will need those funds for future expansions and acquisitions to maintain its growth and sustain its technological competitiveness.How I value PayPalLet me now look at a couple of tools that I like to use when sifting for bargains in equities. First up is F.A.S.T. Graphs. The site provides an average (or normal) P/E of 28.1 for PayPal, but with very little history. The current TTM P/E based on GAAP EPS is 37.1. Using non-GAAP Forward EPS, it comes down to 28.2. That would indicate that PYPL is only slightly overvalued. If we set the future P/E to the expected future growth rate of 15.3 percent CAGR (compound average growth rate), we can project a future price estimate of $46.54 by the end of 2021, which works out to an annual rate of return of 2.64 percent.The higher current P/E is justified by the tremendous growth exhibited in 2015, but that rate of growth is not sustainable. The evidence is in the TTM growth in earnings of only 10.4 percent. It is hard to justify a P/E over 28 when the earnings growth is running at only ten percent.I also use OSV (the Old School Value site), primarily for historical data and as a way to check my valuations. OSV serves up three different valuation models: DCF, Graham's Formula (best used for cyclicals, companies with volatile cash flows and growth stocks) and EBIT multiples (a form of earnings multiple valuation). In the case of PayPal, one could consider either the Graham Formula or the DCF model as appropriate. OSV values PYPL at $24.83 using the DCF and at $38.68 using Graham.My favorite stock tool is Friedrich, partly because I spent so much time understanding its model and because it gives me a look back at ten years' worth of valuations and ratios all in one screenshot (except that there is only two years of data available on PYPL). Friedrich is also the most conservative of any stock tool that I have come across. It uses a DCF model to value stocks and presents the output in two forms. The first is a data file table and the other is a chart. The table provides a quick look at ratios, valuations and trends over the last ten years. Here is the data file table for PYPL.Source: Ask FriedrichNotice the current value for PYPL is described as ""Main Street Value"" and stands at $17.62 as of the last update on October 2nd. That is even below the OSV DCF valuation above. The difference is primarily due to Friedrich's emphasis on using FCF rather than operating cash flow. There are other differences in the valuation model, but the Friedrich model is proprietary. But either way, the stock appears to be trading above its fair value.Here is a look at the Friedrich chart. It provides a quick way to check to see if the stock is trading at a reasonable value.Source: AskFriedrichHere it becomes painfully obvious that PYPL is not a buy. As a matter of fact, it rates a sell by Friedrich, because the current price (Wall Street Price) is above the Overbought price (set 66 percent above the Main Street Price). Main Street Price is the term used by Friedrich system to denote fair value. The Oversold price is 33 percent below the Main Street Price and is considered as a bargain.Point-CounterpointBelow are articles by other Seeking Alpha contributors. I like to offer readers points of view other than my own when considering an investment. The two links below represent the opposing view, since each values PYPL above its current price. I could not find another article espousing my view of overvaluation that I would consider credible and worthy of reading. Both of these articles make compelling arguments, but neither was sufficient to sway my opinion.SummaryNo matter how I look at this stock, it appears to me to be priced above its fair market value by a significant degree. It is currently above a price where I would continue to hold it in my account. However, having said that, I should also point out that the publicly available data is sparse, making projection and valuation less precise than in the case of a company that has been publicly traded for decades. There is no doubt that the potential market for digital payments and funds transfers is enormous when measured on a global scale. PYPL is well established and continues to grow, but projecting future growth is, again, very difficult. Competitors of every size will challenge the company in the future. It operates in an industry that is ever-changing, with new potential disruptive technologies always forcing the combatants to adapt. PYPL could rip higher with new growth from many different applications on its platform, or it could be overcome by some upstart or a larger rival. High risk equals high reward when the investors is right. But it can just as easily equal a significant loss when s/he is wrong. Each investor needs to determine for themselves how much risk s/he is willing to take. This one, in my view, suggests more risk than I am willing to accept.It is more of a cautionary tale among many more to come. If I were to want to make an investment using PYPL today, I would want to play the short side by selling the stock short the next time it rose to $41, in order to take advantage of any decline during the next recession. The stock price has broken below $35 on at least five occasions in the last twelve months, the last time in June. I think the odds are good for a short-term gain on a short position within the next six months. If a recession occurs during the holding period, it could fall much more and turn into a sizable gain. Long term it may do just fine, but if a recession hits in the next year, it is my opinion that this stock will suffer as much or more than the broad market indices.Alternatively, I would buy a put option to limit my risk if I proved to be wrong. For this strategy, I like using the January 2018 contract with a strike price of $40 that one should be able to buy for about $4.50. If there is no recession between now and January 2018, there is still the possibility of the stock price retracing back down the $35, which would still provide a small profit on the position. If a recession does occur, the stock could fall by 30-50 percent, yielding a hefty return of as much as 300 percent ($1,350). But if I am wrong, I am only risking $450. For those who are more inclined to trade and looking for a decent risk/reward trade-off, this may be of interest.I believe the market, in general, to be overvalued by a significant margin, which means buying most stocks at current levels comes with far greater risk than under normal economic circumstances. You may be able to squeeze another five to ten percent out of a stock like PYPL before the next economic downturn. Each investor needs to make such decisions on their own. I prefer to hold fewer positions in stocks when valuations are so rich. I do not believe the potential reward warrants the level of risk I perceive to be attached to equity investing presently. There are very few companies I can find that offer good value and appreciation potential over the next five years.There is the argument that low interest rates and low inflation justify the higher valuations. That is true for the moment. But those conditions are temporary and will not continue forever. I expect a transition to a less accommodative economic reality over the coming few years.For those interested in my valuation articles on other companies, you may consider becoming a follower of mine.

4014048,21815,2016-10-23T04:21:00-04:00,"The shares of PayPal broke out of restistance and reached a new all-time high on heavy volume.While only meeting quarterly expectations, the company allayed some fears about competition and margin pressure, whilst increasing it's three-year outlook somewhat.Short-term the shares are overbought, so we wait for a better entry point.","After earnings news and the conference call was digested, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stormed 10% higher to an all-time high of $44.15, taking out a major resistance level in the process.At first sight, this was somewhat surprising. Indeed, when earnings came out after hours on Thursday, the stock initially tanked as the earnings only came within expectations.Usually meeting expectations is not enough for a rally, especially this quarter, it seems. In fact, the situation seemed even worse as there actually was a decline in margins. But the conference call soon put worried investors at ease by showing a better outlook.We'll give you some highlights from the Q3CC:What explains the 10% rally?While expectations where only met in the quarter, what explains the 10% share rise best is that the quarter allayed some fears that the deals with Visa and MasterCard would eat into their margins.Why is that? Well, it's that these deals would shift PayPal from debit transactions (through the ACH network, its most profitable transactions) and steer them to credit card-based transactions with lower margins.But as the company raised it's three year revenue growth outlook from 15% to 16%-17%, it also said that its margins would be stable to growing.It's not a total done deal on margins. Transaction margin actually declined from 62.3% in Q3 2015 to 58.7% in the past quarter. The company blames this on ""the mix shift in our business toward Braintree and increased provisions in our credit business, partially offset by Xoom.On the other hand, excluding the acquisition of Xoom, other operating expenses increased only 9% or approximately half the rate of revenue growth. Also, even if the deals with Visa and Mastercard eat somewhat into margins, that could very well be more than offset by increasing the volume of business.Other worries are also somewhat allayed, While there is undoubtedly a financial revolution going on, with many new fintech start-ups, for now PayPal seems to be holding its own.Rather than slowing, the company predicts slightly faster growth with stable to growing margins even in the face of tough competition and lots of new entries into the market.In terms of opportunities, the company has just 1% share of the addressable market ($100 trillion), that is, 10% of e-commerce, which is 10% of retail.There are significant opportunities with merchants. At present, they have 15M merchants signed up for the PayPal platform, but with the shift towards mobile they can power the merchant apps, as well as their mobile web and in-store payments.They are already doing that with the likes of Yandex (the leading search engine in Russia), Vodafone, America Movil (a big telecom company in Mexico and Brazil), Uber, H&M (fashion), The American Red Cross, Alibaba, Facebook and a host of others.The merchant part of their business is growing at a faster (34%, to $73B) rate than the overall business. They are in talks with many more, and given their proven track record, and their offering as a full service solution, further significant expansion can be expected (from the Q3CC):Paypal is amassing an ecosystem of partners like Visa, MasterCard (although they are not really expecting a considerable near-term boost in terms of either revenue or volume increase). There are in talks with more issuers and they just need to opt into the existing schemes.The company has good cross-selling abilities through Zoom (their international money transfer business) and Venmo (digital wallet). For instance (from Q3CC):ValuationThe stock isn't cheap. We don't think next year's guidance will be increased by a whole lot. At present, analysts on average expect $1.71 per share in earnings, so the shares are selling at 26 times next year's earnings.It's not terribly expensive either, given the 16-7% growth expectation, solid balance sheet, the increasing brand awareness, the leverage abilities of the platform and the free cash flow generation (exceeding $2.2B this year).ConclusionShort-time one can expect a little pullback as the shares are quite overbought. Also, the Q4 (traditionally their best quarter) guidance of $0.40-$0.42 is well within previous analyst expectations ($0.42), so it remains to be seen what new catalyst emerges in the near future.We wouldn't chase the shares higher (although there were plenty who did just that on Friday, volume was more than four times average).The company is delivering and allaying a considerable amount of fear about competition and margins. It has made a good case during the CC of the opportunities in front of it and how it can leverage its platform.They feel confident enough to slightly increase the company's three year outlook so we'll keep a keen eye on it and wait for a pull-back to buy.Do we have concerns? Well, PayPal is well established on-line but it remains to be seen how well PayPal is positioned when much of the brick-and-mortar retail payment system is moving to contactless payments.On the one hand, the company seems well positioned with its brand recognition, platform, network of merchants and deals with the likes of Visa and MasterCard.But there is a lot of innovation going on in this space, and surprises can't be ruled out. PayPal isn't yet so well entrenched as to be unassailable."
4014408,99986,2016-10-24T21:52:13-04:00,"Similar to Facebook, PayPal lost over 20% of its value in less than two months from the date of its IPO.The company has seen 8% earnings growth from its Q3 earnings reported last year while annual revenues grow at 15% year over year.The stock broke out to a new all-time high Friday.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) debuted its IPO last year at $37 a share, but quickly lost its footing and fell under the $30 level. For those that traded during the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) IPO, this was beginning to be somewhat reminiscent. Fortunately for PayPal investors, the stock is now at all-time highs as of Friday and is in the midst of a strong breakout. I typically do not trade IPOs or stocks that have been public for less than two years, but PayPal will be one of my exceptions. The stock has been trading in a 30% range for the past 15 months, and the breakout from these highs should be embraced, not faded. I went long PYPL at $42.35 on Friday, and believe the stock is poised for much higher prices.I am often criticized for entering stocks at new-all time highs, but this is the way that I trade. While value investors prefer to buy stocks that are cheap and ""on sale"", I prefer to do the exact opposite. Most value investors who are buying stocks that are ""cheap"" are trading the discount they are getting on the stock for a mountain of opportunity cost. While there's no question they are getting the stock at a discount, the momentum is in most cases, not in the value investors favor. This means that while they may be buying a stock that is 30% from its highs, the current trend of the stock is still down. Value investors may have to wait three to six months for the trend to change and be proven right, which I believe is a massive opportunity cost. Many value investors in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were buying the stock at $450-500 (pre-split) in 2012, as the stock was off 25% from its highs. While these purchases turned out to be very good investments long term, they came at a cost. For those who paid $500 for Apple, they had to wait until Christmas of 2013 to be up on their position. By the time value investors at $500 in Apple would see a 20% gain on their shares, it was April of 2014. This means that those buying Apple's shares in December of 2012 at a discount had to wait over 16 months to see a significant gain on their shares.There is nothing wrong with this, and I applaud value investors who bought Apple and made 20% gains on their investment and much higher since. Having said that, over the same time period, the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) alone went up 36% from 1,420 to 1,860. This means that while value investors did make 20% on their Apple investment over 16 months, they would have made nearly double this return simply buying the market.Why does this matter? One could have simply bought the S&P 500 in December of 2012 and stayed invested there until Apple made a new one-year high and gave a momentum buy signal. This signal came in May of 2014 as the stock touched $82.00 a share. Apple then went on to climb to $119 a share over the next six months. While both strategies made money, value investing significantly underperformed, while momentum investing maximized returns.To simplify this, I will show a quick example of two traders who started with $10,000 in December of 2012 to invest:Trader A started with $10,000 and sees Apple 30% off its highs and buys 138 shares at $72.00 per share. At the end of 2014, his shares are worth $114 per share and his portfolio is up 58%, valuing it at $15,800.Trader B starts with $10,000 and rather than buying Apple 30% from its highs, buys the S&P 500 as it makes new highs in January of 2013. He rides the S&P 500 until May of 2014, before cashing in his S&P 500 trade to buy Apple which has made new one-year highs. This was done as Apple provides better beta for the investor, and the stock now finally has momentum behind it. He makes 30% on his S&P 500 trade, and uses his $13,000 to buy Apple at $82.00 per share. The Apple investment quickly moves from $82.00 to $119.00, before ending 2014 at $114.00 per share. Trader B's S&P 500 trade makes 30%, and he uses this amount to compound into his next trade on Apple which makes 39%. Trader B's total return is 80.70%, and his account is valued at $18,700.I have no problem with value investors and believe they have incredible intestinal fortitude to stick with positions through drawdowns. The reason that I prefer momentum investing is that I believe it maximizes returns as winners are compounded, and there is little time wasted waiting for trends to change on investments. This is why I bought PayPal Friday at a new-all time high vs. buying Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) or Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), which sit at two-year lows.In addition to a trend following strategy, I also use fundamental analysis to supplement my trade ideas. Unfortunately in the case of PayPal, there is limited data available for my fundamental strategy. My fundamental strategy uses the ""CAN"" from William O'Neil's CANSLIM and attempts to find stocks with growing earnings that are making new highs.The CAN portion of CANSLIM stands for the following:C - Current Earnings: O'Neil pointed out the importance of choosing stocks whose earnings per share (EPS) in their most recent quarter had grown from the previous year.A - Annual Earnings: O'Neil also believed annual earnings growth to be very important. Companies being selected for investments according to O'Neil should have steady annual earnings growth over the past five years. As William stated, ""Who wants to own part of an establishment showing no growth?"". Due to this, William recommended buying stocks with annual earnings growth of at least 25%.N - New: The N in O'Neil's CANSLIM stock selection approach stood for new, which meant the company recently underwent a change of some type. Whether it be a new product, entering a new market, or a new high in price. In my application of this method, I place the most emphasis on a new high in price as this confirms my primary trading strategy.In terms of PayPal, there is no such data available, which makes this investment slightly more speculative than the majority of my positions. Having said that, we do have one quarter of current earnings data to work with. As we can see in the table below, PayPal saw earnings growth of 8% from its Q3 report in 2015 to the most recent one reported last week. From this data, we can see that the company is seeing earnings growth, which is certainly a positive. The company stated that it is expecting non-GAAP EPS of $0.40-0.42 for Q4, which would be another beat from its 2015 quarter.Source: YCharts.comWhile there is limited fundamental data to support the ""C"" and ""A"" of the CAN strategy, the ""N"" or new portion of the strategy has given us a green light as of Friday. PayPal broke out to a new three-month high on Friday, as well as a new all-time high. This is a very positive development for the stock as new highs typically beget more new highs. As we can see in the below chart, the stock broke out of its trading range with strong conviction to close the week. This was not a marginal breakout above past resistance at $41.69, but a massive one.Source: TC2000.comWhat if I am wrong on PayPal?If I am wrong on PayPal and this breakout is a false breakout, I have a stop below this level to protect me. My stops are used on a closing basis, which means that I do not care about where the price is during the day. I find this makes it much easier as I do not need to worry about what stocks are doing when the market is open. If PayPal closes below the $36.22 level, I will exit the stock on the following open. My stops are placed at levels where I believe the uptrend on the stock is potentially invalidated.The reason I chose the $36.22 level is for three reasons:1) The stock has an uptrend line in play which is made by connecting the January lows at $31 to the June lows at $34. The current position of the uptrend line comes in at roughly $37.50 on the stock. It is normal for stocks to re-test their uptrend lines in bull markets, therefore I want my stop to be below this level. This is because I do not want a routine test of the uptrend line to shake me out of my position.2) After gapping up in early July, PayPal found support three separate times at $36.50 at its gap fill level. This support has been in place for three months now, and I would like to see it hold to remain in my position. If the support does not hold, I believe the stock's trend would move to neutral and I would no longer have momentum at my back in this trade. My stop is at $36.22, which coincides with roughly a 1% break of our current support.3) The stock's 200-day moving average is at $37.94 and has not begun to turn positive. I do not like to hold stocks that are beneath their 200-day moving average, and a stop of $36.22 would represent a close more than 4% below the 200-day moving average. The 200-day moving average is my line in the sand for bull and bear markets, and I want to see the 200-day moving average hold on a closing basis.Source: TC2000.comIf all three of the above support levels are broken, my thesis for being long PayPal becomes very weak. Due to the fact that my stop has a position risk of roughly 16%, I am only using 5% of my portfolio to enter the trade. This means that if I am wrong on PayPal, my portfolio has roughly 0.8% at risk (5% portfolio sizing x 0.16 position risk). Normally, I risk 1.0-1.25% of my portfolio on all trades, but because I do not have enough fundamental data for PayPal, I consider this a more speculative position.I have shown all of my positions from my Seeking Alpha articles below since I began writing for the site. All of these stocks were bought at new three-month highs, and most are now winners. My most recent large cap positions were UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) at $144.35, and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) at $778.20 last week. Thus far, UnitedHealth Group is flat while Alphabet is up nearly 5% from my entry.Source: TC2000.comPayPal currently is in the process of a massive breakout as long as the stock can remain above past resistance of $41.69. The 200-day moving average is beginning to perk up and adding roughly a nickel per day at the current trajectory. This is a very positive sign for longs as the 200-day moving average typically provides support in bull markets. I believe PayPal to be a speculative long position at current levels, and worth a starter position for my portfolio. As long as the stock remains above $36.22 on a closing basis, I see no reason to doubt the thesis for being long this stock."
4008672,101296,2016-09-27T10:23:55-04:00,Recent agreements have been largely misunderstood.PayPal will ultimately be one of the few digital wallet winners.New management understands the long-term opportunity.,"Manole Capital ManagementThe PayPal OpportunitySeptember 2016What's in your wallet?Stealing the tagline from Capital One's popular ads… look at the credit and debit cards in your wallet. You might call them your Visa (NYSE:V) or MasterCards (NYSE:MA), but each is really a line of credit between you and a specific bank. That issuer can be JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) or any of thousands of banks.Banks feel dis-intermediated from their clients, as the vehicle you use on a daily basis is not recognized as their valuable service.A traditional wallet:If you are anything like us, you still carry around wallets like George Costanza from the hit TV show Seinfeld.Today, for everyday transactions, the plastic cards in your wallet still matter, and for many, cash and check remain a regular payment medium. With advances in smartphone technology, the traditional wallet is likely to change; however, over the next 5 to 10 years, payment apps will proliferate. Looking forward, the average consumer might put a half dozen favorite retailers' apps on their phones. Since most people do not want to clutter their beautiful iPhones with 25 to 30 different apps, some merchants will get this valuable real estate because they offer great promotions or deals.Smartphones:The modern smartphone is a remarkable invention. An all-encompassing device that fits in your pocket, it can seamlessly do all the tasks that once required separate technologies. It was only a matter of time before the payments industry began to think of better ways to utilize advancing technology and this wonderful device. The growing importance of the smartphone as the go-to computing device for every digital activity is the goal. Why not incorporate mobile payments and wallet technology into this powerful (always present) device?Phones as wallets:Technology is once again solving payment problems, and we need to recognize this change. The next change may be the most radical or impactful of all new payment advances. Many companies are attempting to use mobile wallets to eliminate the need to carry cash and plastic cards.Powerful entities are attempting to acquire space on your phone. Phone manufacturers are rolling out products with Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Pay (OTC:SSNLF), Google Pay (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Android Pay. These networks have products like Visa's Check Out, MasterCard's MasterPass and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). Banks are slowly getting involved, but many are afraid to spend millions investing in constantly changing technology. Currently, retailers have also followed suit. The Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) payment app has been wildly successful and it now represents 15% of all of its US purchases.EMV (Europay MasterCard Visa):In the US, EMV standards became effective in October of 2015. The goal was to lower counterfeit card fraud, by inserting a chip in all credit and debit cards. Still utilizing magnetic stripe technology invented in the 1950s, the US was the last remaining developed country to embrace chip technology.MasterCard reports that 88% of its US consumer credit and debit cards now have an embedded chip. On the merchant side, the point-of-sale devices need to be equipped to process chip based payments. As of today, MasterCard estimates 55% of its merchant acceptance base has enabled EMV payments at their counters; Visa estimates merchant EMV acceptance at only 30%.Liability shift:Moving forward, counterfeit fraud costs will remain as the burden of entities with inferior technology. For example, the bank does not incur counterfeit card costs if it has embedded a chip in its cards. On the flip side, the merchant does not incur counterfeit cards costs if it accepts EMV purchase transactions. The results have already been positive as Visa reports counterfeit fraud has decreased by 28% year over year. Over the last year, MasterCard stated that US counterfeit card fraud has fallen by 54%.NFC (Near-Field Communication):Most modern devices are already equipped with and incorporate NFC technology, which will ultimately lay the foundation for contactless payments. Why are many merchants choosing to wait to turn on mobile payments? Cost is one factor if terminals need to be upgraded. Some are waiting to determine which technology will ultimately win. Others are struggling with the vast array of certifications required to accept contactless payments. Merchants need to activate this capability latent in their terminals if they wish to allow for the future of mobile payments.This shift in liability should act as a catalyst for the entire digital payments industry. As merchants accept chip cards, NFC technology will ultimately get enabled. As this happens, the number of locations where digital payment transactions can occur will dramatically rise. The tipping point is coming shortly as NFC becomes the dominant technology at most point-of-sale terminals. We believe that once mobile wallets become more prevalent, we will see digital payments increase exponentially.Contactless:The success of digital and mobile wallets depends on the ability to turn traditional point-of-sales devices into contactless payment terminals, which will allow consumers simply to wave or tap their devices at the point-of-sale. Some people will feel this is less secure than traditional methods of payments. However, one could argue that requiring a fingerprint scanner to unlock the phone represents more security than historical signature-based payments. When was the last time a clerk checked the back of a plastic card for matching signatures?Marketing:With contactless payment capability, merchants could materially improve traffic and sales. Retailers could reach customers on their ever-present devices in real-time. Think of the functionality of sending a consumer an afternoon coupon for Starbucks as he walks or drives by a location. Think of the benefits to a consumer of keeping coupons or promotional offers automatically on his smartphone. Loyalty programs would be dramatically improved, as information about prior transactions and benefits would safely be stored online and on one's phone.The rapid adoption of NFC and contactless payments has been hampered by the scarcity of locations where people can use the technology - the classic chicken or egg dilemma. A positive for the industry is that several entities are pushing for change. We believe that merchants will accept higher payment costs if they can generate higher traffic and improve sales. By enabling NFC devices in their stores, merchants have a chance to significantly improve and deepen the relationship they have with their customer base. There is a real return on investment with this initiative versus the branding costs of a TV, radio or magazine advertisement.Whom do the payment networks work for?We realize it might sound odd, but Visa and MasterCard really have no relationship with consumers. While both payment brands spend billions of dollars annually on marketing and advertising, it is for the benefit of their banking partners. The payment networks have agreements with various financial institutions and attempt to get their acceptance brand on the front of that card in our wallets. The fight to get that half an inch space of real estate on the bottom right-hand side of each bank debit or credit card is intense. We believe the payment networks work for the banks.In the case of JPMorgan, some cards do not even have the Visa brand on the front. You can find that valuable Visa logo on the back, just to further emphasize - from JPMorgan's perspective - that it is their account. However, by building a brand that stands for safety, trustworthiness and widespread acceptance, the payment networks ultimately benefit.Visa and MasterCard set interchange rates, which are the fees a card issuer can earn per transaction. The crux of many of the networks' legal woes is based on this particular fact. If Visa and MasterCard set the interchange fees, that is the key determinant of a bank's card revenues.Merchant Discount Rate or MDR:The process of completing a purchase transaction may seem simple (occurring in a few seconds), but various players participate in this complicated system. It starts with a merchant and a consumer. The average US credit card transaction is $88. On average, this transaction will generate $2.50 in fees split among 3 to 4 players. The merchant discount rate (called the MDR) is the total fee that a retailer pays to accept any cards. This total fee can be broken into separate pieces, since there are multiple players involved.The bulk of these fees (roughly 70% or $1.75) go to the card issuer for accepting credit risk. This is typically the bank that has issued the card to the consumer, and is commonly referred to as credit interchange. The bank is taking on the majority of the risk, so it justifiably receives the bulk of the revenue allocation. Banks are making credit decisions on individual clients, providing a monthly line of credit. If consumers do not pay their balance in full, the bank earns interchange plus interest on the outstanding loan balance. If consumers pay their balance in full, the bank still earns interchange. The offset for this revenue typically funds reward programs, such as airline miles.The remaining 30%, or $0.75 per transaction, goes to payment networks such as Visa or MasterCard and merchant acquirers/processors such as First Data, Vantiv or Global Payments. The majority of this fee goes to the acquirers and processors for their established relationship with the merchant. The smallest percentage of the transaction goes to the payment networks. These payment entities provide the critical components of each purchase transaction. They authorize, switch, clear, settle and provide valuable tools like fraud and risk management. The behind-the-scenes payment processing gets handled by multiple players. Their job is to handle all types of payment transactions quickly and securely. While the merchant settlement process is complex, these payment players handle billions of transactions and trillions of dollars.The digital payment industry is complex and various players are involved in the processing of one purchase transaction. The ""supply chain"" is changing and various market participants are vying for their place in the process. Acquirers, processors, issuers, gateways, banks, networks and hardware and software players are involved in this complicated ecosystem.PayPal's model:PayPal (like its payment network peers) generates most of its revenue by taking a little piece of the price of every purchase processed through its platform. This ""take rate"" typically runs $0.30/transaction plus 2.9% to 3% of the purchase price. Rates can vary depending on the type of merchant, whether a card is present (in-store or online) or the ultimate funding source (credit or debit). If a purchase is similar to a traditional credit card transaction, PayPal will pass-through or pay out 2% of its gross revenue. The margins are obviously much less with these transactions. If a transaction uses PayPal's debit connection with a consumer's bank account, revenue and margins are much higher.As business continues to evolve, we have seen the primary device change from the PC to the smartphone. PayPal has adapted, but so have other players. Visa and MasterCard are developing similar online products to replicate PayPal's online presence. Once again, it is the financial institutions providing the credit that immediately benefit, but the payment networks receive the long-term rewards.Banks favor card usage because it generates revenue and income from their customers. Usage of the ACH network incurs a cost for banks in terms of lost revenue and added complexity. In the event of a chargeback or problem, the bank and card issuer receive the angry phone call, rarely PayPal.PayPal's history:To enable seamless eCommerce or online transactions, a payment middleman needed to exist. Credit and debit cards were the only mechanism to transact and PayPal was the first to truly understand the opportunity. Instead of requiring 16 digit codes, validation dates and security codes, PayPal created a bond with the end consumer. It created simple and easy buy buttons, which required only a passcode. PayPal simplified the process to conduct commerce and they garnered significant first mover advantage.In the early days, PayPal lured consumers with $10 to sign-up for an account. Early adopters signed up for PayPal and made one of two choices. They could tie a credit card to their PayPal account or they could input debit information and allow PayPal to act as a pseudo debit account. The tie-in with credit cards was costly for PayPal (i.e.: low margins), while moving funds via Automated Clearinghouse or ACH was fractions of a penny. Obviously, PayPal preferred the debit route and steered its consumers towards this type of tender.eBay:After a brief stint as a public company, PayPal was purchased by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in October of 2002 for $1.5 billion. eBay wanted to solve two key issues. The first concern was sustaining its growth. PayPal generates revenue per transaction and this predictable revenue stream benefited eBay. The other issue was getting shoppers to finalize their transactions. With its simple ""buy now"" button, eBay could lower its cart abandonment problem. eBay pushed PayPal as its preferred choice for payments, and the result was an explosion of users and volumes.Merchants:PayPal has tried and failed to take its business from online into the physical world. It signed an agreement with Home Depot (NYSE:HD) in October of 2014 to allow PayPal transactions in its stores. The goal was to allow consumers to conduct transactions by entering their phone number and a passcode at the point-of-sale terminal. This failed to get much usage and was dissolved. While PayPal has garnered significant market share of online transactions, it has had difficulty bridging the divide online and physical retailers.Another attempt at solving its physical acceptance problems was PayPal's agreement with Discover in 2012. The goal was to get PayPal merchant access at 7 million US Discover (NYSE:DFS) locations. PayPal sought to leverage Discover's payment network and merchant acceptance to improve its physical, in-store presence. First Data (FDC), one of the largest merchant acquirers, essentially prevented this deal from succeeding. This example indicates how complicated the payment process is and how difficult it is to become a globally accepted payment network.Visa and MasterCard noticed PayPal's online strength and were investing heavily to create a similar offering. The traditional payment networks were moving online, but PayPal was struggling to move downstream - back towards physical retailers.Spinning from eBay:In the summer of 2015, PayPal once again became a publicly traded company (ticker PYPL). There are many examples of companies that have spun out from parents and gone onto big success. In his book, ""You Can Be a Stock Market Genius"", Joel Greenblatt highlights how to profit from corporate spin-offs.In our opinion, PayPal needed to break away from eBay for a few key reasons. First, PayPal needed to make serious investments in its future. As part of eBay, it would need to fight and make a corporate case for such investments. Secondly, PayPal is still in its infancy as a brand. While it has been in existence for less than 20 years, PayPal has yet to reach mass adoption. While half of transactions are outside the US, most accounts are US-centric. Not only does it lack global acceptance, but PayPal's 188 million active accounts are roughly 5% to 6% the size of those of traditional card issuers. Visa and MasterCard are accepted in twice as many countries as PayPal. In addition, PayPal has 14 million global merchants, only one-third the acceptance rate of Visa and MasterCard.PayPal, like all payment networks, is built for leverage, not the balance sheet type of leverage, as PayPal has $5 billion or $4 per share of cash (and no debt). The leverage we are referring to is network scale. Once a global presence is built, the network can leverage its scale and drive margins. PayPal has invested in the network and is creating deals to build transactions and volumes. To grow its base of users, PayPal must invest in its brand and create a similar awareness as the traditional payment networks enjoy. It must be safe, secure and trustworthy. Last quarter, PayPal generated 1.4 billion transactions, up an impressive 25% year over year. In our opinion, this transaction figure is the key metric to monitor and analyze. In order to build volume, it needs to gain acceptance, not just online, but in the physical marketplace. This is our primary takeaway from PayPal's recent agreements with Visa and MasterCard.Creative Destruction:In 1942, Joseph Schumpeter discussed the term ""creative destruction"" in ""Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy"". Essentially, it reviews the theory of ""incessantly"" destroying and then creating a revolutionary and better product. Through innovations, a new organic process is created from de-constructing prior, long-standing arrangements. In modern economics, this evolutionary process ultimately frees up resources to be deployed elsewhere.Recent agreements:By its very nature, the philosophy of creative destruction treats economics as a fluid and dynamic process. The recently signed distribution agreements between PayPal and both Visa (July) and MasterCard (September) create more questions than answers. PayPal fell 7% the day of the Visa agreement and the market was quick to proclaim its prospects dire.In the press release, PayPal claimed that it ""will not encourage cardholders to link to a bank account via the ACH."" As we discussed above, the most profitable business for PayPal is its debit or ACH-linked transactions. The agreement with Visa and MasterCard provided ammunition to the bears. When PayPal's CFO John Rainey suggested that 2017 transaction expenses would increase from this funding mix shift, the market worried. The market is concerned that higher margin debit transactions will decline and PayPal will be forced into more credit card-based transactions, with their higher interchange rates. Just because PayPal provides great access and ""clear and equal payment options"" for Visa and MasterCard products does not mean that its favorite transaction will go to zero. PayPal built its history on the success on leveraging the low-cost ACH network. While it will not be at the top of the page, ACH will still be offered and used.Our thesis:Should PayPal be willing to accept lower margin card purchases as long as its transaction volume dramatically increases? We believe the trade-off is positive because these pacts will have long-term benefits for PayPal. PayPal hopes to increase its purchase volumes and physical payment market share. Also, it removes the worry that it was on a collision course with the global payment leaders. Thus, PayPal management is creatively destroying one business to further its success in another. The logic was that as long as PayPal continued to pass through the interchange for funding tied to credit cards, its margin would be permanently capped. We disagree with this thesis and believe these agreements will actually benefit all parties. On a go-forward basis, PayPal will not push ACH transactions above Visa or MasterCard card-linked accounts. It does not mean that all transactions will bypass the bank-linked (i.e.: better margins) process. PayPal will receive numerous positives for this ""creative destruction.""Increased acceptance:Quite simply, the long-term distribution agreements improve PayPal's physical point-of-sale presence. The new agreements allow PayPal to get access to any contactless point-of- sale terminal if that device has up-to-date security, encryption capabilities, and if it uses tokens for transactions. While the base of those accepting contactless payments is growing, it currently covers 5 million global merchant locations and about 1.25 million here in the US. This point is critical for PayPal's migration from online only to the in-app and in-store mobile wallet. By using Visa and MasterCard's tokenization service, PayPal will be able to significantly expand its point-of-sale presence and acceptance. We liken these deals to all the children in the sandbox agreeing to play nicely. The payment networks are agreeing to cooperate to advance digital payments, as opposed to having turf battles. We expect to see PayPal's digital wallet, powered by Visa's Digital Enablement Program or MasterCard's MasterPass security. Instead of working on complicated and bi-lateral commercial contractual deals, PayPal will leverage technology and the de-facto standards created by payment networks. In terms of ubiquity, we believe the security measures taken by Visa and MasterCard will be widely used, independent and neutral. PayPal will easily request a secure token and enable contactless in-store payments. The head of Visa's token service recently said,""it gives the merchant the ability to choose whether at the point-of-sale the consumer presents a QR code or an NFC radio signal or a BLE beacon-enabled transaction, because VDEP is agnostic.""The agreement will allow PayPal to sell these tokenized transactions to merchants at competitive rates. It can offer volume incentives and fee certainty. Finally, PayPal believes it can profitably go offline and compete with anybody at the point-of-sale.Card Issuers:Banks are always looking to build strong and lasting relationships with their customers. Card payments are daily interactions between a bank and its consumers. As consumers use their line of credit (or debit account), banks generate volume and transactional revenue, which can be in the form of plastic cards in a current wallet or in digital form in a mobile wallet.Card issuers like Bank of America, Wells Fargo, or Chase have several options. These large banks could invest significant money to create a payment app specifically for their cardholders. For example, Chase has recently launched Chase Pay and it will be available where Paymentech (its merchant acquirer/processor) has merchant relationships. In addition, card issuers rely on their designated payment networks to develop such an app. For example, a smaller bank could utilize Visa Checkout or MasterCard Masterpass on a white label basis. One last option for issuers is to vie for primary positioning on widely issued mobile wallets. This is a critical aspect for PayPal because the issuer with a primary position in the mobile wallet will succeed. The card at the top of the mobile wallet should garner the majority of future digital purchase transactions.Phone manufacturers like Apple and Samsung are device and operating system dependent, but PayPal is independent. We think it has an opportunity to become the ""Switzerland"" of the mobile wallet world. On future payment methods, issuers will have the opportunity to opt-in and become a digitized, tokenized card in a consumer's PayPal mobile wallet. For example, this would allow Bank ABC and its issued Visa or MasterCard to get utilized in a consumer's PayPal account. We like models that are open-ended and provide unlimited choice. We anticipate consumers loading any credit, debit or gift card they choose into their PayPal digital wallet. PayPal wallet holders will be able to conduct online transactions, as well as have functionality for in-store purchases. We believe this will be an inflection point for PayPal's transaction volume. We expect PayPal, Apple Pay and Samsung Pay to offer early incentives for certain issuers to get primary placement and positioning in their mobile wallets. In addition, one should expect issuers to offer promotions to cardholders for merchant specific use.Larger financial institutions should pursue all three options. Smaller banks should attempt to leverage their designated payment network and choose the last two options. There is no correct answer, but it is not too late to adapt to change. To quote hockey great Wayne Gretzky, ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."" Banks should attempt to be present in any digital checkout option and try to avoid placing bets with just one player. The end goal is to drive transaction volumes in a store, online or in an app. Smart issuers are incentivizing consumers to transact and trying to build an early lead.One might think that PayPal's success comes at the expense of another entity. Some claim that PayPal specifically damages the card issuers and hurts their interchange model. PayPal's new agreements actually could improve volumes for those card issuers willing to change and adapt. PayPal's CEO Dan Shulman stated, ""We've been in discussions with issuers. They're excited about the volume we can bring to them. This agreement removes many of the concerns issuers have about working with PayPal."" This certainly is PayPal's hope.Fees:Another benefit for PayPal is a reduction in future fees/expenses. Ever since 2013, MasterCard has instituted a fee specifically targeting PayPal. Called the ""staged digital wallet operator annual network access fee,"" it is a long-winded name for a fee directly targeting PayPal's success at using the ACH network and bypassing bank issued cards.Since the ACH is not a user-friendly platform, it can create nightmares for issuers. With their vast back-office call centers, banks are often ill-equipped to handle chargeback or payment questions from linked PayPal accounts. Banks were not receiving proper revenue contribution from transactions but were receiving an increasing level of client frustration.MasterCard's logic (since it was protecting its bank partners) was to institute a fee for transactions that bypassed its payment rails. MasterCard believed that this fee would protect its issuers and penalize PayPal for leveraging the payment network without properly paying for this access. The new MasterCard and PayPal agreement terminates the digital wallet fee.Pricing opportunity:For this equal access, PayPal will receive undisclosed volume discounts from the networks. PayPal will receive certain financial volume incentives, which should help it ultimately boost margins. These are volume discounts should grow in size with corresponding transaction growth. As volumes increase, merchants benefit as well. Merchant acquirers and processors will eventually add PayPal's brand to their acceptance offering. Over the last few years, acquirers have begun to add American Express (NYSE:AXP) to their suite of accepted cards. Merchants received economic incentives which resulted in American Express getting better retailer acceptance and volume growth. PayPal would be wise to follow this game plan.Circular benefits:Over the next few years, we expect to see PayPal grow its global merchant acceptance by negotiating separate deals with payment networks as well as with merchant acquirers and processors. A key tenet to our thesis is that PayPal's mobile wallet will become one of the few winners and options in the digital payment landscape. The circular benefits seem obvious to us. PayPal will leverage its positioning with nearly 200 million active users. As its base continues to grow, transaction volumes will improve. Volume growth will lead to higher incentive payments and allow PayPal to reap scale advantages, which will lead to higher incentives to pay out to retailers for better merchant acceptance. PayPal's CEO Dan Schulman is often quoted as saying that his company is focused on ""consumer choice."" Following the MasterCard agreement, Schulman said, ""With each partnership agreement that we sign, we further expand the ubiquity and value of the PayPal brand and improve our own economics.""Person-to-Person (called P2P) payments:According to a recent MasterCard study, over 95% of all person-to-person transactions are completed with cash or check. PayPal's long-term goal is to help consumers move money in a seamless way. A key growth initiative for PayPal is to push in person-to-person payments. Venmo was a valuable asset PayPal received in its November 2013 $800 million acquisition of Braintree. Venmo, a dominant person-to-person platform, is quite popular with millennials. This digital wallet allows consumers to send money with a simple text on their smartphone. In July 2015, following its spin from eBay, PayPal acquired Xoom.com for $890 million to further strengthen its money transfer capabilities. Both these deals clearly indicate that PayPal has a large commitment to growing its person-to-person franchise. Xoom.com has a strong presence in money transfers and has important licenses in key countries like India.The P2P payments business benefits PayPal in two ways. First, it attracts a growing demographic of active users. Secondly, it builds scale advantages and volumes. PayPal believes that generating volume and loyal customers outweighs the benefits of this segment's current profits and serves as a long-term investment and opportunity for PayPal. We are still a few years away from mass adoption, but the millennial generation is rapidly embracing mobile peer-to-peer payments. Estimates are calling for the US person-to-person market to grow from $5.6 billion in 2014 to $175 billion by 2019. Consumers continue to love convenience and embrace the vast capabilities of their increasingly powerful smartphones. We believe volumes and transactions will ultimately lead to profits for this segment. What is currently an investment and cost, will ultimately lead to earnings contributions and an increase of PayPal's overall valuation.The recent deals with Visa and MasterCard could leverage the PayPal P2P assets. Millennials, who are less likely to work with traditional banks, can easily move money via Venmo. Funds can be loaded onto a debit card or simply deducted from a checking or savings account. The combination of Visa's leading debit network plus PayPal's Venmo app is intriguing. Visa Direct is a service that enables fund transfers using a Visa debit card. The Visa partnership will allow cardholders to utilize the Visa network to make real-time transfers from a PayPal or Venmo account to their bank account (and vice versa).The MasterCard and PayPal deals highlighted some interesting statistics. The agreement requires that PayPal's wallet include digital representations of the users' registered MasterCards. PayPal can now begin to tap a deep new transaction base. We like the opportunity of marrying MasterCard's impressive US account base (164 million credit and 185 million debit cards) with PayPal's mobile wallet. This should drive point-of-sale purchases transactions using all types of MasterCard accounts.What Wall Street Is Missing:The sweeping, multi-year agreements with both Visa and MasterCard create an interesting opportunity. The market is punishing PayPal because it believes the traditional payment networks have won the battle. We believe these deals mark a thawing of a frosty relationship. Visa's CEO Charlie Scharf aptly described the agreement with PayPal as an ending of a ""frenemy"" or ""co-opetition"" relationship. Nobody ever believed these companies were friendly.PayPal's digital wallet is clearly a threat and both networks wanted access to it. PayPal wants to boost its transaction volume and now has opened massive global and physical acceptance. In addition, PayPal receives scale benefits and valuable financial incentives. Instead of battling each other, all three companies are agreeing to collaborate to advance the digital payments marketplace.With the signing of these two deals, PayPal has cemented itself as one of the digital payment winners and has proven its value in the payment ecosystem. This is why both traditional network brands chose to work with this digital payment leader. While PayPal is not perfect, we see more opportunity than risk. To become a digital payments leader, one needs to build scale and provide multiple options. PayPal is cloud-based and works across all relevant operating systems. It works online, in-app and now in stores. PayPal owns various assets including Braintree, Venmo, Paydiant, Xoom.com which take it across various platforms. Will all of these assets be wildly successful? Probably not, but a digital payment leader needs to be taking risks.PayPal has shifted its business model to driving transaction volumes. It can be online, in an app or in a physical store. It can be person-to-person or on its mobile PayPal wallet. This is a volume game and new management of PayPal understands this. The goal is to drive as many transactions across its scalable platform as possible. As a part of eBay, PayPal was the asset responsible for driving growth. Now that it is on its own, it can focus on making key long-term investments, without the fear of damaging eBay's profitability. PayPal generates excellent free cash flow of $500 million per quarter, which will allow it to make these critical investments. Management understands that to drive future growth, PayPal must grab valuable real estate in people's mobile wallet. Eventually, a loyal customer base will allow volumes to scale. Margins will rise and there will be a protected franchise, offering ubiquity and choice. It is our opinion that this is a volume game across every channel and every payment type.Valuation:Following its spin from eBay, PayPal's valuation was immediately compared to those of Visa and MasterCard. We understand this but feel it is somewhat unfair. In our opinion, both Visa and MasterCard are superior companies and business models. We understand that not all investors will make room in their portfolio for all three companies, but we have no problem concentrating our holdings in excellent, long-term growth stories. Looking at these ""Big 3,"" the most noticeable difference is operating margin. The margin structures of both Visa and MasterCard are materially higher. In the most recent quarter, Visa's operating margin was an astounding 68% while MasterCard's remain in the mid 50% range. In comparison, PayPal's operating margin was below 20%.We want to be very clear and state our real appreciation for both Visa and MasterCard's business models. They are truly wonderful businesses and the future for both is promising. We are large shareholders of both and believe the opportunities for future growth are quite promising. In the case of PayPal, we also see vast opportunities. Now independent from eBay, management can create new partnerships and make significant and necessary investments. We believe PayPal's growth will continue to be an industry leader and there are opportunities for operating margin expansion.For comparison purposes, we always like to start an examination of market capitalization and enterprise values. Visa has a market cap approaching $200 billion, MasterCard has a capitalization of roughly $110 billion, while PayPal is much smaller at $45 billion. Considering it is much smaller, PayPal should be growing much faster. All three have net cash on their balance sheet, with Visa only recently taking on debt following its acquisition of Visa Europe. In terms of Enterprise Value to EBITDA estimates, there is little variation to identify. All are roughly 12x forward EBITDA estimates. Looking at Price to Earnings or P/E estimates, we believe we can best frame the payment network players. Both American Express and Discover are card issuers and therefore accept credit risk. Both attempt to provide transparency into their opaque balance sheets, but we believe the models are fundamentally different. They are peers, but not terribly relevant for this comparison. Both American Express and Discover are struggling to grow and have been invisible in the digital payment world. Others tend to lump the payment acquirers and processors as relevant peers. We agree that these business models are also predictable and generate they recurring revenue, but they are much smaller. We prefer the ""Big 3"" of Visa, MasterCard and PayPal for this P/E comparison. In terms of valuation, Visa trades at 24x calendar 2017 estimates and the market is expecting low double-digit revenue growth and mid-teens earnings growth. With its acquisition of Visa Europe, these numbers should be attainable. MasterCard trades at 21x calendar 2017 estimates and the market expectations are for double-digit and high-teens top and bottom line growth. MasterCard is lapping some difficult comparisons (the loss of USAA) and client losses, so results should also surprise to the upside. PayPal is trading at 21x next year for mid-teens revenue growth and high-teens earnings growth. The market has more uncertainty concerning PayPal's ability to deliver. Not only does PayPal have a shorter tenure as a public company, but its recent agreements also cloud the margin expansion story.We expect PayPal to deliver earnings next year in the $1.85 per share range. Applying a low 20x forward multiple, we get to ~$45 per share. At $40 today, that implies solid upside in the low-teens range. 1st Call or Wall Street estimates are anticipating 18% growth in PayPal earnings next year. By simply rolling forward its current P/E by one year (assuming it can keep that valuation), one could expect mid-to-high teens price appreciation. In terms of next year's earnings, we are taking CFO John Rainey's words as pseudo guidance. He said, ""The deal has laid the foundation for revenue growth with more certainty in our cost structure.""We never invest with the hope that one of our companies gets acquired. That being said, PayPal has positioned itself well for future growth. If Apple, Google or another large entity struggles to gain traction with its payment offering, we would not be shocked to hear acquisition rumors. In this scenario, PayPal's unique set of assets would easily get a Visa multiple, implying a 25x forward P/E. This would imply a price target approaching $50 per share or over 25% upside.Google:One of our bigger picture questions remains. As one of the world's largest companies, when will Google deliver an interesting payment play? At the latest iPhone 7 launch presentation on September 8th, Apple claims that its Apple Pay handles 90% of all mobile wallet transactions. Google, with its Android operating system and vast array of assets (search, maps, YouTube, etc) has yet to make a dent in payments. Google's focus on Android Pay has been too limiting, as this is really viable only on those devices using its operating platform. We would like to see Google make a strategic push to embrace PayPal's independent mobile wallet; it should integrate all of its assets with PayPal and see its share of volumes lift. It may not earn the vast majority of the payment economics, but it would be integrated into the valuable data flow of purchase transactions. We believe this meshes well with Google's core strength - search.Conclusion:Once Visa finalized its deal with PayPal, MasterCard was quick to follow. PayPal is migrating from an online-only, ACH-based payment company to a fully capable digital wallet. We believe these agreements cement PayPal as one of only a few viable, independent digital wallets. It is our opinion that Visa and MasterCard benefit under these new terms. All three parties bring something to the deals. Visa and MasterCard bring global acceptance, wonderful brands, millions of consumers and their financial institution partners. PayPal brings the largest digital payments network and nearly 200 million engaged users. PayPal has a market leading digital wallet and we believe it has a great opportunity to leverage the powerful payment engines and assets of both Visa and MasterCard.With great growth prospects and a newly focused (and spun) management team, PayPal is poised to succeed. Is PayPal a cheap stock? Is it a Benjamin Graham value play? We would say ""no,"" but companies with these growth rates and prospects rarely are. If PayPal's stock continues to languish, it has the potential to become an activist target or potential take-out story. In our opinion, the recent agreements with Visa and MasterCard have created an opportunity to purchase PayPal at a slight discount. The combined cardholder base of these traditional payment networks, coupled with PayPal's attractive account base, should be powerful. Merchants are always looking for ways to drive traffic, improve sales, and lower costs. PayPal can now alter the digital payments process and shopping experience.

3994512,102076,2016-08-02T11:53:55-04:00,Short-term headwinds have deflated the stock of a company that has shown consistent and sustainable profitability and growth.Recent agreement with Visa illuminates PayPal’s values regarding volume of transactions and cost of transactions.Catalysts for future success include the strong growth of recently acquired services such as Venmo coupled with strong performances derived from PayPal’s established position in the mobile payments industry.,"Q2 Earnings ReportPayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) second quarter report was strong on paper. The company reported a 15% growth in revenue (even higher if you disregard fluctuations in currency), a 26.5% increase in free cash flow compared to a year prior, and an 11% increase in active customers. Additionally, PayPal's acquisitions, such as Venmo, have shown very strong growth. This growth has been exhibited in past quarters and are expected to be sustained through future quarters. Yet despite these factors, the stock dipped over 7% the day following its earnings report due to how investors regarded PayPal's new deal with Visa (NYSE:V).With PayPal's new agreement with Visa, it becomes necessary to examine the risk and reward tradeoffs between the increased transaction volume and increased transaction costs resulting from this deal. I believe that when considering the still expanding fintech industry, a choice to increase PayPal's total payment volume (TPV) and market share, even at the expense of higher transaction costs, is the correct path to take for long-term success. The partnership with Visa further cements PayPal as an established player in the industry and eliminates the previous fears of Visa siding with a competitor or becoming a direct competitor itself. PayPal's increased presence in the market long term will decrease the sway of merchants, lenders and banks, allowing the company to exert greater influence in negotiating transaction and other costs.That being said, those interested in PayPal in the short term should remain less optimistic. For the next quarters, there's an expectation that profits and margins will dip with the rise in transaction costs associated with consumers using funds from a credit card in place of transferring funds directly from their bank. Additionally there is the risk that those who previously used a lower transaction cost fund source, such as a bank, may be swayed to switch to their Visa card if it is more convenient. Following the dip in PayPal's stock, there has been no immediate rebound as investors recognize the impact on upcoming revenue and margins.PayPal as An OpportunityThe decline in stock price should not be solely viewed as the consequence of PayPal acquiescing to unfavorable terms of a popular and strong payment provider. Rather it should be seen as an investment for future success for it makes PayPal less vulnerable to competitors in the short term and sets up the company for a more dominant future. Let us delve into both the positive and negative drivers for PayPal as it continues its trajectory forward after its departure from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) last year.Short-Term DriversPayPay's stock price immediately dipped following the company's 2Q16 announcements. Future earnings reports will be impacted negatively as users take advantage of the higher transaction cost Visa services. At the same time however PayPal will continue to see strong growth in recently acquired divisions. Venmo's TPV was up 141% this quarter and is not near its peak for potential. Additionally PayPal as a company has been focused on keeping its services available on mobile devices and tablets as those platforms show continued growth in use. Xoom saw nearly three quarters of its transaction take place on a mobile devices.The mobile wallet and payments industry is undergoing strong growth and PayPal's established position in the industry allows it to reap a large portion of the success of the industry in the short term. In addition, PayPal is a beneficiary of merchants who seek alternative payment services from PayPal's competitors such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which have close relations with banks opposed to more independent service providers such as PayPal.Long Term DriversIn the long term, PayPal will benefit from a trend of conglomeration in the mobile payments industry. Currently filled with many competitors and startups, this industry will ultimately begin to mature as consumers begin to side with larger payment options, such as PayPal, due to accessibility and simplicity. Additionally there is expected to be greater cohesion between banks, lenders and firms going into the future.It is not insignificant to consider management's active role in improving the stock price of PayPal. In early 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to $2 billion of common stock. PayPal already has returned $300 million of this to shareholders this quarter. Management is heavily incentivized to raise the price PayPal's stock, and CEO compensation consists of 69% performance based compensation.With regard to the direction of the company, it is too early to say where PayPal will put its efforts into expanding (perhaps money lending), but its decision will play a large role in its long-term success.As an incumbent player in the digital market, PayPal has inherent competitive advantages that come into play with attracting potential customers. Although I would not say that PayPal has a definitive moat, the company benefits from, and will continue to benefit from, the network effect with regard to the appeal of its products. Additionally there is increased cohesion in PayPal's various services that will serve to strengthen the company's offerings. Newer offerings such as Venmo can be used in conjunction with traditional PayPal services in a number of mobile apps for payment. Additionally Braintree is now powering many popular services, such as Uber.Key RisksPayPal's business is not without its inherent risks. The company's mobile business is heavily impacted by physical device manufacturers and companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google, which have the power to hamper PayPal's integration into mobile devices. Furthermore, the mobile payments industry is extremely competitive with relatively few barriers currently keeping innovative start ups from making a dent in more established players' market shares. Alternatives such as startups WePay and Intuit will try to out-compete PayPal. However, as stated earlier, there will be increased incentive for consumers to gather around larger players in the industry due to their wider breadth of offerings and availability. In recent quarters, PayPal has seen success with growth and profits, and investors may have reason to be wary should PayPal's management decide to remain stagnant in its success. That being said, given the company's past of strategic acquisitions and new product offerings, I do doubt that now would be the time for it to slow down its plans for future growth.Key Takeaways"
3993714,40691,2016-07-31T04:24:15-04:00,"Venmo processed over $4 billion to person-to-person payments, roughly 140% growth from the second quarter of last year.
        Venmo added eight more applications to Pay with Venmo.
        PayPal and Venmo users with Visa debit cards linked to a bank account will also be able to move money instantly in and out of the services.","Late last month PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported its second quarter results. Shares of the online payments leader traded immediately to the downside following the announcement. Shares had traded near 2016 highs at $40 per shares heading into the quarter. Today, PayPal shares are trading at $37.24 per share, up by about 2.8% this year.In June, I wrote an article PayPal's Venmo is Winning Mobile Payments which highlighted the company's valuable Venmo application. If you are not familiar, Venmo is the leading mobile payment smartphone application for Millennials. Personally, I use Venmo each and every day. In a matter of seconds, you can use Venmo to exchange money between friends, family, and strangers. PayPal acquired Venmo through its Braintree acquisition.Mobile payments are a huge opportunity for growth for PayPal, and for Venmo. After all, eighty-seven percent of the U.S. adult population has a mobile phone, and seventy-one percent of mobile phones are smartphones. And, 39 percent of smartphone users have used their phones for mobile banking in the last year. And, sixty-seven percent of the unbanked population has access to mobile phones.Venmo takes the best features from PayPal, and makes it easy for users on the go. PayPal earnings release was one of my highly anticipated releases this season. I was waiting to see updated performance data on Venmo in the second quarter.Venmo experienced rapid growth during the second quarter. In the second quarter, Venmo processed over $4 billion to person-to-person payments, roughly 140% growth from the second quarter of last year. And, up from $3.2 billion in payment volume in the first quarter of 2016.I was excited to see that Venmo rolled out even more business facing partnerships. In the second quarter, Venmo added eight more applications including Parking Panda, Priv, Wish, Box, App Market, and Pashmark. Venmo allowed an additional 2.5 million users get access to its Pay with Venmo Pilot. In addition, management confirmed that the Pay with Venmo technology will be available to all users by the end of the year. Venmo's focus on merchant facing payments is important to the long term thesis. By adding merchants and adoption to Pay with Venmo, Venmo will become a high earning asset for the company. I predict that Pay with Venmo is going to beat Apple Pay down the road.Management reported that Venmo was the second largest driver of account growth for the company. On an overall basis, PayPal now has over 188 million active accounts.I was very excited to see the partnership between PayPal and Visa (NYSE:V). Inside of the partnership announcement, we learned that PayPal and Venmo users with Visa debit cards linked to a bank account will also be able to move money instantly in and out of the services. This is awesome news for daily Venmo users like myself.Hopefully, the Visa and PayPal partnership will expand to allow Pay with Venmo to be locations that accepts Visa contactless transactions. It would be even cooler to see the companies work together on a Bill Pay feature to include in the Venmo application.Overall, the second quarter was very positive for Venmo, and PayPal. I still believe that PayPal is the best way to invest in online and mobile payments. Specifically, PayPal's acquisition of Venmo puts the company as the leader in mobile payments. I believe that PayPal's Venmo asset is undervalued by the market, and that Venmo will appreciate dramatically in the years to come."

He claims that the company's growth has yet to hit critical mass, and that the digital payment service provider's best days may be ahead.However, PayPal's moat may not be as deep as some investors believe. Cheddar TV points out Wall Street sentiment is mostly split on the stock, and that others, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), are rapidly moving into the digital payment space and could give PYPL a run for its money.Watch the video for more of Cheddar's take:What do you think?

4008231,24491,2016-09-24T20:00:05-04:00,"PayPal continues to gain market share, growing much faster than the broader pace of e-commerce expansion.We are excited about the long-term potential of two recent deals PayPal has with major credit card processors Visa and MasterCard.It is worth noting that PayPal's business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, as well as complex, overlapping and frequently changing rules, regulations and legal interpretations.Let's take a look at the firm's investment considerations as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamA quarterly ""beat and raise"" and a new agreement with Visa (NYSE:V) weren't good enough to drive shares of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) higher after its second-quarter report July 22, but shares have since recovered to pre-second-quarter report levels. Revenue growth of 19% on a foreign-currency neutral basis and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% wasn't bad at all. Operating cash flow and free cash flow generation of $696 million (up ~12% year over year) and $495 million (up 27% year over year) in the quarter wasn't too shabby either. Through the first six months of 2016, the company has generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, better than the $740 million mark generated during the same period a year-ago. Active customer accounts advanced 11% in the quarter, and the company processed an impressive 1.4 billion transactions (up 25%) on $86 billion of volume (up 29% on an FX-neutral basis). PayPal continues to gain share, growing much faster than the broader pace of e-commerce expansion.The good news keeps coming. The e-commerce payments giant raised its full-year 2016 revenue guidance to the range of $10.75-$10.85 billion (was $10.5-$10.7 billion), and we think ongoing momentum toward the back half of the year may make such a revision conservative. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for 2016 is targeted in the range of $1.47-$1.50, tightening the previous range of $1.45-$1.50 issued in April. PayPal may be trading at 25 times current-year non-GAAP earnings, but in the context of consumer staples entities, for example, fetching similar-sized multiples in this overheated equity market on mature or slowing growth, PayPal is a relative bargain. PayPal holds a solid net cash position, with cash equivalents and investments tallying ~$6.3 billion at the end of June 2016 (or ~14% of its market capitalization).The deal with Visa seems to have investors on edge, however:While many are pointing to margin pressures at PayPal due to pressure from the Visa agreement, we expect growth potential from the deal to more than offset any profit squeeze. More importantly, however, we think it is worth noting that PayPal has expanded its relationship with MasterCard (NYSE:MA). In addition to the Visa announcement being a huge development for long-term holders, MasterCard customers will now be able to use PayPal payment services when making tap and point payments at stores as well as instantly move funds from PayPal accounts to a MasterCard debit card.The end game for PayPal may very well be a merger with one of these two credit card processors. We're keeping the position in PayPal in the Best Ideas Newsletter portfolio for the foreseeable future as we feel shares still have some room to run based on our fair value estimate, which is made available in the 'Valuation Analysis' section of this article.PayPal's Investment ConsiderationsImage source: ValuentumInvestment HighlightsBusiness QualityImage source: ValuentumEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. PayPal's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 25.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Image source: ValuentumImage source: ValuentumCash Flow AnalysisImage source: ValuentumFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. PayPal's free cash flow margin has averaged about 21.7% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At PayPal, cash flow from operations increased about 28% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 85% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think PayPal is worth $46 per share with a fair value range of $37-$55.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 14.7% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 11.2%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 21.3%, which is above PayPal's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 5.8% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For PayPal, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Image source: ValuentumImage source: ValuentumImage source: ValuentumMargin of Safety AnalysisImage source: ValuentumOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $46 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for PayPal. We think the firm is attractive below $37 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $55 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueImage source: ValuentumWe estimate PayPal's fair value at this point in time to be about $46 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of PayPal's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $63 per share in year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $46 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

In the article, I highlighted the momentum behind PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) mobile payment application Venmo. If you are not familiar, Venmo is the leading mobile payment smartphone application for Millennials. PayPal acquired Venmo through its 2012 acquisition of payments company Braintree.I've written about mobile payments for some time here at Seeking Alpha. Mobile payments is the way of the future and I find myself using Venmo at least once per day. Here are some of my favorite statistics:Mobile payments are making payments easier while helping to bank the unbanked population in the United States.In my article from July, I predicted that Venmo would be rolling out an in-store merchant facing product this year. Earlier in the year, Venmo started allowing users to use the application in other applications including Parking Panda, Priv, Wish, Box, App Market, and Pashmark. Mobile application payments are great, but not nearly the opportunity of in-store Venmo payments.As a dedicated Venmo user, I know that I would use the in-store payment feature if available. And guess what? In early September, parent company PayPal announced that it entered into a partnership with payments giant MasterCard (NYSE:MA). This deal follows a deal from July where PayPal including Venmo, partnered with Visa (NYSE:V).The MasterCard deal means that PayPal will no longer need to pay a digital-wallet fee to MasterCard. And, among other things, Venmo users can now make instant transfers with MasterCard Send, rather than waiting a few days to receive withdrawals.However, the most exciting news wasn't initially reported by major press. The most exciting news came from Quartz who was able to confirm that:This is exciting news for PayPal shareholders and Venmo users alike. While the in-store payments rollout may not be needle moving from the beginning, I believe in the long term potential of Venmo. In the second quarter, Venmo processed over $4 billion to person-to-person payments, roughly 140% growth from the second quarter of last year. And, up from $3.2 billion in payment volume in the first quarter of 2016.For reference, Venmo does not currently charge users to make P2P payments using a debit card or bank account. Venmo charges users a 3% fee when making P2P payments using a credit card. That said, as Venmo rolls out more merchant facing options monetization potential will grow. Venmo will be able to charge merchants a processing fee to accept Venmo as payment.Over the weekend I was playing around with one of my favorite tools, Google Trends. I ran a Google Trends search for the keyword ""Venmo"". Google Trends shows you the relative search interest of keywords over time. Here is the output for the keyword ""Venmo"":The picture here is pretty clear. Google search interest for the keyword ""Venmo"" is currently at 100, or an all time high.  PayPal is a long term investment in my portfolio. I believe in PayPal's core product offerings, and the long term potential of Venmo. I believe the market in underpricing the long term potential of Venmo. It is too soon to put a hard value on Venmo, but first hand I've witnessed Venmo become the leader in Millennial P2P payments."
3992453,101366,2016-07-28T00:38:57-04:00,"PayPal will now be accepted by all U.S. merchants that accept Visa payWave.
        Venmo, PayPals's peer-to-peer payment application, processed 141% more payment volume on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
        PayPal customers who link their Visa cards to their Venmo accounts will have immediate access to funds in their mobile wallets.","-by Jesse AtlasAnnounced Partnership with VisaPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported outstanding second quarter results. They beat on revenue with $2.65 billion while the street was only expecting $2.6 billion and reported in line earnings at 36 cents a share. More impressive than the revenue beat was the growth of transactions flowing through PayPal's peer-to-peer (P2P) mobile payment application Venmo. In the second quarter, PayPal saw a 28% jump on a spot basis in total payment volume to $86 billion. Venmo accounted for $3.9 billion of the total payments processed representing a 141% gain in total payment volume through Venmo since the end of the first quarter a year prior. However, the real news of the day was the announcement of PayPal's partnership with Visa (NYSE:V). Visa operates one of the most advanced payment processing networks in the world, aptly named VisaNet. The partnership opens lots of doors for PayPal because it will enable them to compete on a more even playing field with Square's (NYSE:SQ) P2P payment product Square Cash.Integration with Visa's TechnologyAccording to the announcement, PayPal will join Visa's Digital Enablement Program (VDEP). Joining VDEP will significantly increase the number of merchants that accept PayPal's digital wallet. Under the agreement, any location that accepts Visa's contactless payWave technology will now accept payment from PayPal's digital wallet. Users will simply wave their phones over the payWave reader and their accounts will be debited. There will be no additional cost to consumers or merchants who will be paying the same fees as if the consumer was paying with a traditional credit or debit card. PayPal also noted that this partnership will ""further removes the threat of any fees or Visa network rules being targeted solely at PayPal."" The deal also includes economic incentives based on payment volume and other performance metrics; PayPal did not disclose what the rewards or target numbers are.(Visa)Venmo Nixes Square Cash's AdvantagePreviously, Square Cash had one big advantage over PayPal's Venmo P2P payment product. Square Cash would automatically direct funds received through the payments application to your bank account every day without the user manually requesting it to be transferred. Now, consumers will be able to move and withdraw money from their Venmo and PayPal accounts to their banks accounts in real time by making use of a service called Visa Direct; so long as their Venmo accounts are linked to their Visa cards. This means consumers no longer have to worry about keeping money within the Venomo application or bank account because the funds will be easily accessible at any time. PayPal also made it very clear that it would not encourage Visa card holders to link a bank account via an automated clearing house.According to Square's 2016 first quarter earnings report, gross payment volume came in at just over $10 billion. That number did not include payments through Square Cash. However, I believe it is safe to assume that Square equal no more than 20% of Square's gross payments volume and is likely well under $2 billion dollars. Square also doesn't have the marketing budget that PayPal does and can't market the product as aggressively. The one advantage Square has is its popularity among small merchants who don't have the hardware to support products like Visa payWave.(Business Insider)PayPal Expands Merchant AccountsThe partnership between Visa and PayPal is also extremely valuable to merchants. Without any additional hardware or software costs, merchants can now accept another form of payment. According to PayPal's earning report, at the end of the second quarter they had 14.5 million active merchant accounts, with retail giants like IKEA. This represents ~500,000 merchants accounts added to the platform since the end of the first quarter of this year. Keep in mind that this number was released before the announcement of additional merchants now accepting PayPal wallet thanks to the VDEP agreement.Fee Worries LingerThe Royal Bank of Canada cut its 2017 earnings estimates after PayPal reported its second quarter numbers. Analysts from the bank argued that as the company moves from bank transfers to fee-based Visa transfers, PayPal's margins will experience a squeeze. An analyst from Autonomous Research, Craig Maurer, argues that the deal fee discounts won't make up for the high expense of using Visa's payment network more. PayPal realizes the higher fee's will impact their margins, but say that this is offset by the payment volume that will be generated by the deal.The Bottom LineThe Visa agreement vastly increases the number of U.S. merchants that will accept PayPal as a form of payment. With no hardware additions, merchants with a Visa payWave reader will be able to accept PayPal. Venmo continues to assert itself as the dominant P2P payment application, growing payment volume by more than 20% quarter-over-quarter basis for the last two years. This deal signals PayPal's first major move as an independent firm ready disrupt traditional payment systems but also using their networks to their advantage."
3991287,86776,2016-07-25T17:08:21-04:00,"Both companies bring network assets and consumers to the party.Visa, as the largest card network in the world, brings consumers they have in tow.PayPal, as the largest digital payments network in the world, brings 188 million active users who've developed a habit of using PayPal - and are increasing that usage.The hard part now is execution.","There's no doubt that the announcement of the Visa (NYSE:V) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) partnership shook the payments world more than a little bit last Thursday.Over the last year, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman made a point, every chance he could, to let everyone know that he was the chief of a decidedly different PayPal, post its eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) independence. That PayPal, he said, was one that embraced partnerships and consumer choice. The network that started life steering consumers to ACH, he emphasized, was now indifferent to tender type. The consumer ruled.Over that same year, Visa CEO Charlie Scharf made it perfectly clear that players in the payments sphere fell into two distinct camps: they were either with Visa or against it. Frenemy, schenemy he as much said - this co-opetition stuff doesn't reflect the reality of how the payments ecosystem and the issuer-centric network model that has been the cornerstone of the payments industry for more than 50 years operates. And since PayPal's ACH model was still alive and well - with a chunk of accounts transacting that way - Scharf made it clear that PayPal's business model was a concern.So, what generated the collective industry gasp last Thursday was the public affirmation that those two players had buried that hatchet.But, like most any big announcement in payments - and this really juicy one - it has led to many different interpretations.Some immediately remarked that the partnership will give in-store NFC payments a real boost. Analysts have expressed concerns that it will totally crater PayPal's business model (an opinion that saw its stock take more than a 9 percent hit on Friday - it ended the day down 6.75 percent). And some of the more sinister soothsayers suggest that Visa now has the benefit of having PayPal under its watchful eye as it simultaneously scales its own digital competitor, Checkout.All things that make for nice headlines and clicks, but they are observations that are also somewhat off base.They all miss the potential that both Visa and PayPal have to use the next 12 months of exclusivity of their multi-year relationship to change the dynamics of the payments landscape in the U.S., and the actions of every single player in it.If they can execute.So, here's my take on what this partnership is - and isn't.One thing's for certain: when NFC is the hammer, every in-store payments announcement is a nail.Yes, the deal with Visa and its access to Visa's token services, VDEP, is big. At the jump, it gives PayPal an easy and immediate on-ramp as a token requestor to enable contactless in-store payments where Visa contactless payments are accepted and Visa methods of payments are used.As a refresher, VDEP eliminates the bilateral contractual rigmarole that makes it hard for other contactless payments schemes that require those individual contractual negotiations to achieve commercial scale. It also sets out parameters for how token requestors and issuers will play together, including rules that forbid token requestors from imposing fees. This partnership gives issuers the chance to opt in to becoming a digitized, tokenized credential in a consumer's PayPal account for use in-store under that program. And opt-in is a whole lot easier and faster than negotiating commercial terms.Instead of getting bogged down in negotiating the Ts and Cs of a commercial agreement, the work between the issuers and PayPal is about enabling account holders to use their Visa cards in the PayPal account. Things like who owns what data (the data for any PayPal/Visa transaction will be shared exactly as if a Visa card was presented and swiped), how Visa accounts will be positioned at signup (equal positioning with ACH options) and when transacting (visible and digitized card credentials in the transaction flow) has already been negotiated. Merchants also will probably get favorable pricing as part of this deal, too, because PayPal gets negotiated economic incentives which will pass along in part - more on that later.And, yes, while VDEP surely does give PayPal the ability to check the in-store payments box and allows its app and Visa issuers who opt-in to have parity with the other in-store ""Pays"" at those places that accept NFC payments, there are a couple of big ""buts"" that offer some big clues into where in-store may be headed with this partnership.""But"" No. 1 is that VDEP, at the moment, only extends to PayPal apps running on Android phones. So that limits the in-store capability to the unknown number of Visa credentialed PayPal account holders who own Android phones capable of making an NFC payment who also walk into merchant locations with NFC. And while that number may be unknown, it's probably small and maybe even too small to get people all fired up about.Which brings me to ""but"" No. 2.Of the 2 million merchant locations that are NFC-enabled, 400k or so are vending machines. According to Visa's latest EMV stats, there are still 72 percent of merchants without EMV terminals - and that means there are still 72 percent of merchants that aren't equipped to enable NFC anytime soon. There's also no guarantee that 100 percent of the 1.2 million EMV terminals also are NFC enabled and at the places that consumers shop regularly enough to develop a digital in-store mobile payments habit.It is therefore unlikely that either party perceives the Visa/PayPal VDEP capability as the in-store NFC payments' silver bullet even though it was a nice bullet in the presser. For digital payments to play at scale and ignite, the solution must be cloud-based, cross platform/cross OS and cross-channel. I think just about everyone knows this now - or at least I hope so.More likely, VDEP is the tip of very big digital payments iceberg that could transform in-store payments in a material way. When I chatted with Visa's Global EVP and Head of Innovation last year, Jim McCarthy, at the launch of VDEP, he mentioned that VDEP was technology agnostic. In fact, he said that Visa's token service ""gives the merchant the ability to choose whether at the point of sale the consumer presents a QR code or an NFC radio signal or a BLE beacon-enabled transaction, because VDEP is agnostic in that respect.""Now that's interesting.PayPal owns Paydiant, which has its own portfolio of in-store payments technologies. And Braintree, which has put in market what Schulman described as the most ""rapidly adopted product in PayPal history"" - One Touch. VDEP's technology-agnostic, efficient issuer integration platform would seem to give the folks at PayPal and Visa the opportunity to fine tune a slick, in-store customer experience that goes well beyond subbing a tap for a swipe to unlocking new value for merchants and consumers.That's where I'm placing my bets.Investors did not like it when PayPal CFO John Rainey suggested that 2017 would deliver increased transaction expenses as a result of changes to its funding mix. PayPal's stock price ended Friday (July 22) down more than 6 percent, recovering a bit from being down more than 9 percent earlier in the day.I, though, focused on three other comments that I believe round out the story: the tail end of Rainey's comments on transaction costs, a very pointed phrase that Schulman emphasized several times in his own remarks and Scharf's own description of the deal terms.Rainey spoke of gaining ""certainty over cost control,"" Schulman said the deal with Visa eliminated the ""threat of any targeted pricing actions"" and Scharf remarked that the deal affords PayPal ""greater longer term fee certainty.""Taken together, this suggests that absent a deal, PayPal might have been facing onerous cost-side increases of another kind that could have had a material impact on the business. Eliminating that uncertainty via this partnership means that everyone can get on with the business of business - growing the digital payments footprint for consumers, issuers and merchants.Which is all about increasing transaction volume.Although details are scant, as one might expect, both Schulman and Scharf acknowledged during the earnings call that economic incentives are being extended to PayPal in exchange for increased volume.There are a few ways that the partnership is designed to drive transaction volume.There is a 12-month exclusivity period for Visa issuers to promote their own, branded digital credentials within the PayPal account. I would imagine that issuers would jump at that chance to ride the ""top of digital wallet"" with the largest digital payments player in the market, worldwide. I can also imagine that such efforts might be accompanied by some creative marketing initiatives to drive account enrollment and usage - with maybe Visa even kicking in a few bucks of its own. And since PayPal is accepted at more than 14 million merchants, all of these consumer incentives actually give consumers the opportunity to use those digital account credentials at the places they like to shop around the digital ecosystem. And giving PayPal the chance to drive usage from 29 transactions to something that's more like once a day.Those marketing activities also will be linked to a few things also stipulated as part of the agreement: PayPal agreeing to position Visa equally with ACH account options at signup, incorporating digital images of Visa cards into the payments flow so they are prominently featured as the top of wallet option, and working with issuers to help convert PayPal's Visa ACH customers to Visa debit customers should the consumer wish to make the switch.It's that last part that has everyone worried, but maybe it shouldn't.We don't really know - and PayPal does not disclose - how much of its volume in the U.S. is ACH-driven. PayPal suggests that it's not as straightforward a calculation, given the mix of P2P volume inside of its numbers. So, we don't really know how much of the PayPal volume is really a target for the switching - but it's obviously enough to have Visa concerned.But whatever that number is, now, thanks to Durbin (and it's rare that we ever say ""thanks to Durbin"") that revenue hit won't be as huge as it once might have been. There's a gap between ACH and debit, of course, but it isn't as wide as the days before Durbin. The size of that gap depends on those negotiated incentives that PayPal and Visa have worked out and what PayPal pays for ACH today.But what I take away from the ""economic incentives"" narrative is that both sides will work together to do something that should have been baked into every preceding mobile payments ignition scheme: giving issuers - and by default consumers - incentives to activate digital accounts and use them. TPV - total payments volume - after all, is the name of the game.A volume game, played by meeting and serving consumers across every channel and every payments use case they encounter.One aspect of the announcement that I think got lost in the in-store and no more tender-steering news is the additional value-add that this relationship brings to PayPal's P2P users and Visa's debit business.And the pretty big hole that it blew in the set of initiatives that banks are - and have been - undertaking to make P2P a ubiquitous reality via its own schemes.Venmo users, who sent $4 billion between people in Q2, can now get instant access to that money if they use a Visa debit product. This instant accessibility of funds also is available to PayPal P2P users.This does a few things for Visa and PayPal/Venmo.First, it provides a huge incentive for PayPal/Venmo users to attach their Visa cards to their accounts.Second, it provides Visa issuers with a new opportunity to market real-time availability of funds via this P2P capability and use it as a way to acquire and retain debit card users. Since millennials are Venmo's prime demographic, this could become crucial to competing for the millennial demographic that issuers so covet - adding even more deposit accounts to the mix for issuers and P2P volume for PayPal/Venmo.Third, it eliminates the friction and uncertainty issuers have with their current bank-driven P2P initiatives. Ubiquity is what's needed to really put teeth into P2P and make it a friction-free experience. That doesn't exist today with any of the schemes. Visa debit rails plus Venmo and PayPal can get pretty darn close.That means that, fourth, this capability also opens up a potentially whole new series of use cases for real-time payments between people and between businesses and people - from paying insurance claims, to paying contract or gig workers, to disbursing royalties using those rails.Those same use cases that the faster payments folks have been advocating that banks invest in expensive new sets of rails to support.The one unanswered question for most payments peeps is where Visa Checkout now sits in the midst of this announcement. Visa Checkout was launched just about two years ago - in July 2014 - as the replacement for V.me. Checkout shifted Visa's focus from a wallet that aggregated a variety of digital payments artifacts to just making checkout online simple and fast.When asked about Checkout on the earnings call, Scharf said that Visa Checkout is chugging right along, although he declined to offer stats on users and merchants. The last time Visa reported Checkout numbers - March 2016 - it stood at 11 million users across 16 countries and more than 250k merchants. Scharf spoke instead to the enhancements to Checkout - a streamlined user experience and new ways for issuers to be branded inside the app.There's a short-term and a long-term way of looking at Checkout's future vis-a-vis the Visa/PayPal partnership.If I'm a Visa issuer and what I really want is volume on my cards and sticky digitally transacting customers, I'm going to want to be present in a variety of digital checkout scenarios as long as I don't have to do much to get there.But what I'm going to probably do during the next 12 months of exclusivity with PayPal, though, is blasting out a series of incentives that get consumers using cards with the digital network that's already accepted widely online and in-app and very likely cooking up a cool cloud-based in-store experience. If volume is what I want online and use of my own branded digital credentials in that channel, this is probably one of my best shots at achieving that.And if I'm Visa, I'm also going to use those next 12 months to maybe even fast-track getting digital Visa credentials in as many places as PayPal and Braintree and Venmo and Xoom can get them.Using all of those next 12 months to mobilize a digital payments plan that puts some distance between Visa, its issuers and what everyone else is pursuing.So that, long term, Visa and PayPal could be well-positioned to rewire the digital payments ecosystem.Maybe that's by using the combined assets of the Visa cardholder base and 188 million PayPal account holders to help merchants capitalize on the digital payments experience in ways that have not been explored before.Maybe that's by tapping the Braintree payments veins deeply including the clever application of capabilities like Braintree Auth, which allows permission-based sharing of tokens across eCommerce endpoints, to expand acceptance and usage.Or by using the economic incentives that both sides have spoken about to extend favorable terms to merchants and incentives to cardholders to select and use Visa accounts on PayPal's digital network.Or really thinking deeply about how to improve the shopping experience by banking intelligence into the consumer's digital accounts in order to further drive adoption, usage and preference across all channels, platforms and devices.Maybe even positioning PayPal as a digital layer that connects digitized issuer-branded credentials with any platform, any shopping channel and any device enabled at those various endpoints.WHO'S CHOMPING AT THE BIT AND SHAKING IN THEIR SHOES?Your reaction, of course, depends entirely on where you play and what assets you bring to the digital payments party.Three days is a relatively short amount of time to absorb this news and 12 months a relatively short amount of time to execute, although as both sides point out, it is a ""multi-year"" partnership agreement.If you're one of the ""Pay"" players, it remains in Visa's and PayPal's interest to make their products attractive to everyone so that consumer choice can really be delivered. But both of them also have made a decision to allocate their own resources - time, people and money - to making sure that the partnership lives up to the terms of the deal and maximizes the 12-month exclusivity for Visa issuers.Those who could hurt the most beside the many smaller ""Pay"" players who will struggle to get any merchant attention now? Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung Pay (OTC:SSNLF).Apple Pay - since issuers will be given an incentive to put their muscle behind a scheme that's more widely accepted and used across a variety of shopping channels. And Samsung Pay given its very narrow user potential (just Android, then just Samsung, then just new Samsung devices) despite having a pretty slick technology. Like Apple Pay, they are device and OS dependent but unlike Apple Pay, they have a much smaller and seemingly less attractive user base to offer merchants.Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), on the other hand, could make for a very interesting partner if it take off its Android Pay hat and put on its Google Commerce hats. I can imagine lots of clever scenarios in which a Visa/PayPal and Google mash-up could drive volume to Google's various commerce platforms, including YouTube, Maps and Search.Chase (JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM)) will be an interesting one to watch. As one of Visa's largest issuers, it should be thrilled and very motivated to provide top of digital wallet status to its PayPal users. As Chase Pay, the new mobile wallet ""Pay"" to be launched later, it might face some new and unanticipated competition from the newly combined PayPal/Visa capabilities in-store and online - depending on how each partner takes that part of their offer to market.American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Discover (NYSE:DFS) - well, they've been pretty invisible in the digital world so far and this partnership has the potential to make that invisibility even more so. It also puts tremendous pressure on both of them to make a move, which could even include an acquisition of some kind or to put themselves in play to be acquired, depending.MasterCard (NYSE:MA), of course, made an announcement of its own last week when they acquired U.K. payments system VocaLink.The once bank-owned system that's a dominant player in the U.K. payments market and enables real-time/faster payments in multiple countries, including a contract to do the same here in the U.S. with The Clearing House, is a way for MasterCard to extend consumer choice via its own payments network through direct debit access. While many have suggested that MasterCard and VocaLink is simply a way for MasterCard to beef up its base in the U.K. where Visa is already quite strong, I think there may be more to it than that.When put alongside its newly enhanced MasterPass cross-channel, cross-platform and cross-device strategy unveiled two weeks ago, I think that it's a signal that MasterCard is looking to operate a global set of real-time rails that move money between people and businesses using any payment tender across any connected endpoint. The now have assembled network assets - they now need merchants and consumers to hop on board.And that's what's so interesting to me about Visa and PayPal. They each bring network assets and consumers to the party. Visa, as the largest card network in the world, brings 14k FIs and the consumers they have in tow. PayPal, as the largest digital payments network in the world, brings 188 million active users who've developed a habit of using PayPal - and are increasing that usage. PayPal also brings lots more ""dormant"" PayPal accounts that this partnership could ""wake up"" with new incentives for account holders to use them. They also have digital merchant acceptance and an engine that can enable a lot of new technology deployments on top of a powerful Visa and their network assets.But as I said earlier, everything always looks good on paper. The hard part now is execution.

3990985,91195,2016-07-24T21:37:42-04:00,"PayPal's cash flow from operating activities is steadily rising, climbing by 28 percent to $323 million in Q2 2016..Since Q2 2015, customer numbers rose by 11 percent.The partnership with Visa offers long-term fee certainty and additional growth opportunities.Acquisitions like Venmo and XOOM are complementing PayPal's service portfolio.","The payment company PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) just published their Q2 2016 results. Shortly after, the company's shares were down 7 percent. The reason for this was PayPal's announcement to work closer with the credit card provider Visa (NYSE:V). Many analysts claim that the deal gives Visa the better economics. Royal Bank of Canada even cut PayPal's 2017 earnings estimates. But was this deal really so bad? I don't think so.PayPal's financial and growth backgroundPayPal's cash flow from operating activities is steadily rising, climbing by 28 percent to $323 million in Q2 2016. Furthermore, the company is pretty profitable. CFO to sales ratio amounted 12 percent and the transaction margin is around 60 percent.Much more important is PayPal's strong customer growth and customer engagement. Since Q2 2015, customer numbers rose by 11 percent. I'm sure that PayPal will maintain this growth rate, at least for some years.In addition, PayPal managed to increase payment transactions per active account by 13 percent year-over-year. This means PayPal's customer base is growing as well as their involvement in people's everyday life. Probably, I'm one of the users who fits right into the scheme. In 2015, I used PayPal sporadically for online payments. Today, I'm using the payment service almost every day mainly because of their reworked smartphone app and the One Touch function. One Touch makes it possible to pay via one click on my devices. Maybe that's a little bit riskier than before, but the saving of time is worth it.Evaluating the partnership with VisaOne of analysts' main argument against the deal with Visa is that it might cause higher costs. I agree to that point, costs might rise. But I dare claim that PayPal can afford this due to their strong cost base. Additionally, the payment provider has now long-term fee certainty.Far more important are the additional growth opportunities through the deal. PayPal's CEO Dan Schulman said in an interview: ""We want customers to pay any way they want, and the deal with Visa allows us to move more aggressively into the store"".I'm optimistic that PayPal will increase its market share in in-store transactions significantly. The Visa deal enables PayPal users to pay ""everywhere Visa supports contactless payments.""Several brands already are accepting PayPal in-store payments, e.g. Abercrombie & Fitch, Office Depot and Foot Locker. Recently, Vodafone Italia announced to implement PayPal in their payment service Vodafone Wallet. The telecommunications provider plans to roll out PayPal payments within Vodafone Wallet across Europe.Diversification throughout the payment marketPayPal also occupies attractive niche markets with the aid of its acquisitions XOOM U.S. and Venmo. XOOM enables people from the U.S. to send money, reload phones and pay bills for their relatives all over the world.Through Venmo users could share bills and send money to their friends and relatives. In Q2 2016, Venmo processed around $4 billion in P2P payments, which means an increase of 141% year-over-year. Venmo is now available in eight more apps like Parking Panda and Wish, which will additionally boost growth.Altogether, PayPal's Q2 2016 merchant services payment volume increased by 36 percent to $71.3 billion.ConclusionIn my opinion, somewhat higher costs through the Visa deal in exchange for long-term fee certainty and additional growth opportunities are a good deal.Furthermore, PayPal strengthened their portfolio through smart acquisitions like Venmo and XOOM, which are heading for further growth and complementing the company's service portfolio."
3991425,23757,2016-07-26T08:12:45-04:00,PayPal was up 6% AH after announcing a deal with Visa but ended the day down 7%.The deal with Visa means more expenses in the short term but greater opportunity in the long run.The deal gives PayPal a leg up versus Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.If PayPal can execute and keep growing the deal makes long term strategic sense.,"On Thursday July 21st PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) released earnings for the quarter. The stock was initially up 6% after hours but ended Friday down by almost 7% with the volatility most likely due to differing opinions on the deal with Visa. So which stock reaction to the Visa (NYSE:V) news is the ""correct"" one, the 6% jump after hours or the 7% drop the next day?PayPal gave out very little in the way of concrete details regarding the deal with Visa. Perhaps the best summary of the deal comes from the earnings conference call where PayPal CEO Dan Schulman said this:On the surface the deal seems like good news. PayPal buries the hatchet with Visa and instead of having to worry about Visa as a potential competitor in the future, Paypal has Visa as an ally. Indeed, Visa's CEO Charlie Scharf had previously threatened to go after PayPal's core business. His famous line ""I've been very, very clear on this one, which is if you are a foe, you're not a friend…"" spoken at a JP Morgan Chase technology conference was a direct shot at PayPal.There seem to be two issues worrying analysts. First, PayPal's management stated that the economics of the deal with Visa are already largely reflected in PayPal's guidance (to the degree that PayPal is able to forecast). Second, PayPal's CFO stated that the company will likely see increased transaction expenses as a result of a change in funding mix. This second reason is likely the biggest cause for concern out of the two.In the past PayPal would strongly encourage users to link their PayPal account to a bank account and discourage the use of credit and debit cards. Using bank accounts allowed PayPal to process transactions via the much cheaper ACH network compared to Visa's (or any other issuers) more expensive payment processing network. Letting consumers link debit cards to PayPal and giving equal prominence to credit cards has analysts worried that PayPal's business model will crater as increased processing costs eat up profits.Another part of the deal also allows PayPal to use Visa's tokenization service which allows PayPal to be used for NFC contactless payments via mobile devices. While NFC payment solutions are the hot new thing in the payments world we are a bit skeptical of how quickly they will be adopted. Checking out via a credit card just isn't a big pain point for consumers. Yes, NFC solutions are faster but saving a few extra seconds checking out doesn't make a big change when you are spending five minutes in a checkout line. Indeed, 72% of merchants still do not support an NFC payment option and of the 2M merchants that do allow NFC payments 400,000 of those are vending machines.SummarySo what does all this mean for PayPal? Well the good news is that the deal with Visa allows PayPal to pretty much lock up the NFC market. With PayPal's huge user base it's going to be even more difficult for NFC solutions like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay, Samsung Pay, etc. to break into the payments market. It also puts the 800lb gorilla in the room, Visa, back on PayPal's side and the threat of a Visa backed competitor is now removed. It's also likely the 800lb gorilla's brother (MasterCard (NYSE:MA)) and smaller cousin (American Express (NYSE:AXP)) may do deals with PayPal as well.The downside for PayPal is the possibility that more users opt to use credit and debit cards and PayPal sees expenses rise. Conversely, the deal with Visa means increased payment volume and (likely) more user growth. It is basically now up to PayPal to execute their business and grow volume to make up more a possible increase in expenses.Should PayPal stock have been up or down on the news? Well, it depends on whether you're a short term investor or a long term investor. Short term the stock reaction makes perfect sense. More expenses and possibly lower earnings in the near future should translate into the stock dropping. If you're a long term investor we think PayPal made a smart move. They collaborated with a potential competitor and they have the ability box out a few other upstarts (Apple and Samsung). The electronic payments space is a growing market and the more PayPal can cement its place in the core of that market the better. For the long run those are all positives for the stock and the price should have risen.The fact that PayPal ended down 7% should tell you that there are simply more short term oriented market participants then there are long term ones. If your long term oriented we think PayPal still makes a good investment (we have owned and still own it). If your short term oriented the unknown of higher expenses could mean some missed earnings in the next few quarters and PayPal stock might not be a great buy."
3990895,65113,2016-07-24T01:24:28-04:00,"PayPal has seen price remain at IPO levels while free cash flow has continued to increase.The company remains a leader in the worldwide online payments industry.In spite of pressure on transaction payment charges to buyers, the company has continued to increase volume.I see PayPal as undervalued and the stock could well break $41 in the next few months.","Since PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) IPO on July 20, 2015, the stock price has more or less ebbed to and fro:We see that in the past year, PayPal overall has reverted to a mean $37 mark in spite of the invariable lows and highs. As a recently listed company, perhaps investor sentiment for PayPal is not as strong as it potentially could be. This is especially plausible when we see that the company's free cash flow has continued to rise over the past year by 23 percent, and the company has gotten cheaper on a price to free cash flow valuation basis:In this regard, I see a value opportunity for PayPal at a price of $37 and suspect that the market is significantly undervaluing the company. My opinion is not simply based on free cash flow metrics.As a company, PayPal is virtually the only one in the industry which specializes solely in worldwide online payments. While PayPal invariably faces competition from services such as Amazon Payments, Apple Pay or Google Wallet, these services form only a part of a more integrated product offering for these companies, which has meant less flexibility. For instance, Google Wallet does not allow for transfer of money to other users as the platform is strictly for merchant payments. Moreover, due to wider brand recognition and a more international base, PayPal is becoming the de facto service for online payments.Moreover, specialist companies attempting to compete with PayPal have so far been unable to achieve both the scale and brand recognition that PayPal has. For instance, Square (NYSE:SQ) has seen its operating expenses rise dramatically as it has struggled to expand to keep up with PayPal. The result has been a net loss of $77.6 million for the first six months ended 2015. Moreover, the company only controls 10% of its core market of businesses making $100,000 to $1 million in annual sales.From a competitive standpoint, I see PayPal's dominance as enduring strongly for the foreseeable future. Admittedly, the company does face a challenge in that larger companies also have leverage to negotiate lower transaction rates given that such companies bring larger volume and the cost of switching payment systems is relatively low. In this regard, bargaining power remains on the side of customers.However, as was pointed out, free cash flow as well as overall revenues for the firm continue to rise. In this regard, I am not too concerned about bargaining power in the short-term for as long as the company has the ability to increase transaction volume. Indeed, we see that in billions of US dollars, the company has managed to consistently grow transaction volume overall. This could well mean that PayPal develops a ""Walmart-like"" business model, where it can process payments with low transaction costs while increasing revenues through high volume.Source: StatistaTo conclude, I see PayPal as having a significant competitive advantage in its marketplace and anticipate that higher volume will outweigh downward pressure on transaction payments. Moreover, with price having stayed constant and free cash flow rising, I take the view that PayPal is undervalued and we could well see a break above the $41 mark in the coming months."
3992211,92456,2016-07-27T15:58:59-04:00,The most rapid rates of growth of the internet payment industry are only approaching.PayPal together with acquired Braintree is installed on 82% of websites.The leading position of PayPal is a competitive advantage.,"I want to take advantage of the current drop in prices of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares and buy them as a long-term investment. But, as is often the case, after deciding to buy, you tend to exaggerate the positive moments, and underestimate the risks. Next, I will outline the key factors that have pushed me to the decision to purchase, and hope to see some constructive feedback.Payments market as a whole and mobile payments market in particular are, in my opinion, influenced by the network effect. The demand for services, provided by PayPal, increases with every new active account. In my opinion, it is less risky to invest in such companies, taking into account their inner momentum of growth.Over past two years, the number of active PayPal accounts has been growing steadily. Moreover, the growth rate of total payment volume even tends to accelerate. But, in my opinion, this is only the beginning.As I said, the whole market PayPal is operating in is affected by the network effect, and yet, the critical mass of users is not reached. This means that the most rapid growth of the entire market is yet to come. This can be explained primarily by the fact that the preferences of consumers of financial services are changing slowly, and sometimes, it takes a generation for new trends to appear. Although I hope, we'll not have to wait for so long.The Ovum forecast on the global growth in the number of mobile payments is one of the evidences. According to Ovum's analysts, the global user base of all types of mobile payments will reach 4.8 billion by 2019, while in 2014, its estimated size was no more than 700 million.At that, the most rapid growth is expected among the users of mobile proximity payments. It is estimated that their number will grow tenfold over the next three years. It should be noted that the most rapid growth will start in 2017.Source: OvumAccording to Datanyze, PayPal and Braintree are installed as payment systems on 82% of websites. In my opinion, the growth of the global e-commerce market is still far from its plateau, and the leading position of PayPal in this segment evidences the confidence in the brand, which is a key factor for the payment system's continued growth. It is interesting to note that, according to Datanyze, two months ago, a similar share of PayPal and Braintree was only 67%.Source: DatanyzeMany analysts now point to the growing competition on the part of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Square (NYSE:SQ). This will probably reduce the profitability of PayPal but is unlikely to affect the leading positions of the company. As has been said, the market is only beginning to grow. Moreover, PayPal has already made the right investment in the acquisition of Venmo and Modest that effectively varied the range of the company's services.Now I'll tell you what worries me. At the beginning of 2016, PayPal announced a buyback program amounting to $2 billion. The company already purchased its own shares for $590 million in Q1 and $300 million in Q2, while the long-term debt balance is still zero. This means that PayPal buys back its shares at its own expense, unlike Apple that takes advantage of low rates on long term borrowed financial resources for its buyback program.It seems to me that PayPal should have spent its own funds on acquiring prospective developing companies, rather than buying back its own shares. While on the other hand, it will improve PayPal's financial performance, and independence from the borrowed adds financial flexibility to the company and reduces the likelihood of bankruptcy.ConclusionThere is a saying: In a long distance race wins not the one who runs faster, but the one who runs out first. Perhaps, in the context of financial indicators, PayPal Q2 reports fell short of expectations, but the leading position of PayPal has not changed, and the peak growth of the global payments market is still to come."
3986358,61281,2016-07-05T14:07:21-04:00,After Apple and AmEx now MasterCard is linked to a PayPal deal.Such a deal will create a significant financial player with incredible online/offline services package.Deal size and financing are expected to be major roadblocks to pass.I remain bullish on PayPal with an acquisition scenario being my secondary catalyst and TPV growth my primary catalyst.,"In recent years, the e-payment market which used to be dominated by PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been getting more and more crowded with many new players joining the market. The shift toward online shopping around the world and the increase in the GMV (""Gross Merchandise Value"") amount most retailers and e-commerce companies present each quarter made the e-payments market attractive and convinced many companies to launch an e-payment service. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and more had introduced their e-payment service in the last couple of years when the market boomed.As the market is getting bigger, more companies are looking to penetrate it while existing companies are seeking to expand their market share to generate substantial revenues. These two processes add enormous pressure on PayPal to remain competitive and not lose market share while industry giants are eyeing the payments company as a way to take over the e-payments market quickly. Beyond its brand, extensive network and incredible business, PayPal also has some very lucrative assets like Venmo, Xoom and Braintree that dominate specific niches of the market and are precious to many competitors.One of the companies that was previously mentioned as a potential buyer is Apple, which will attempt to boost its services segment revenue quickly by using its enormous reserve of unused cash. That deal would have made sense some time ago. However, with accelerated global expansion, new web capabilities, and the Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) partnership, it seems that Apple has gone in a different direction. And it is set to compete directly with PayPal for market dominance. In my opinion, an Apple-PayPal deal is not off the table.After the Apple rumor faded, American Express (NYSE:AXP) reportedly offered to acquire PayPal for $47 per share and planned to use PayPal CEO Dan Schulman's history in AmEx to enable the company to penetrate the e-payments market. While Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard control most of the payment processing in the e-payments market, American Express is hardly a significant player in that market, and such a deal would have unlocked incredible benefits for both companies. A merged AmEx-PayPal company could have improved PayPal's transaction costs (and margin), allowed AmEx to attract new businesses to its network by offering a comprehensive payment solution, offered white-label e-payments services to third parties, and more. However, the valuation of the deal together with AmEx valuation meant that AmEx needed to raise an incredible amount of funds that was almost impossible to pull off.The AmEx deal faded away a few months ago, and now a PayPal-MasterCard deal surfaces. Unlike the deal with AmEx, the benefits from the MasterCard deal are tremendous. MasterCard (together with Visa) processes most of the transactions in the e-payment market and benefits as long as the total GMV in e-commerce transactions keeps growing (assuming most of them work with both Visa and MasterCard). The merged company could push PayPal as the digital payments arm into a new market, sectors and niches to expand the availability of digital payments worldwide. Of course, PayPal will improve its transaction margin by lowering the transaction costs that PayPal traditionally transfer to MasterCard and Visa.PayPal and MasterCard could create a financial giant that could offer a comprehensive financial package for online and offline customers that could enjoy a one-stop-shop for all their transaction needs that relates to credit/debit cards transactions, in-store/in-app/online transactions, credit line, invoicing and other online services and much more. The merged company could issue a credit card that charges the PayPal account directly that will enable more customers to use their PayPal account as a bank account (PayPal already has a banking license).The new potential company could benefit from both sides of the e-commerce business - it will collect the transaction fees that PayPal collects, and it will collect the processing fees that MasterCard collects - that way, the PayPal-MasterCard company will receive fees from the buyer and the seller and actually benefit from most transactions made using a digital payment method.If this deal takes place and PayPal and MasterCard agree on the terms, there will be significant roadblocks to its completion. The size of this potential deal is expected to be massive, as PayPal is currently valued at $44B. Assuming that MasterCard will prefer a stock and cash deal to lower the amount of debt to raise, the credit card giant will still need to raise a substantial amount of debt to potentially finance the transaction. However, as we just witnessed in the EMC-Dell case, MasterCard will have to sell some assets alongside with raising debt to fund the entire deal, and that might take time and depend on regulatory approvals.It is clear that the benefits are enormous, but it is not clear how Visa will react to such a deal. I believe that a PayPal-MasterCard deal will awaken Visa and shake the status-quo in the digital payment market between MasterCard and Visa. Visa has three likely options to react that seems equally possible at this stage:To acquire a leading e-payments vendor like Square (NYSE:SQ), Stripe or Dwolla to mimic PayPal transaction and fight back with the PayPal-MasterCard merged company in every segment. To exclusively partner with Apple Pay, Samsung Pay or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger Payments to become their sole payment processor. Launch a Visa-owned digital payment service to compete with PayPal.I don't have the details behind the scenes whether MasterCard submitted a bid for PayPal or engaged the company to start a negotiation for a deal - but I believe that PayPal will not remain an independent company for a long time. I see great business opportunities for a credit card company to acquire PayPal as I presented above. However, the price might be too high to execute a deal in the current state of the markets. I remain bullish on PayPal as a long-term play in the FinTech sector. I cannot ignore the frequent rumors about a deal, and I consider a potential buyout as a secondary catalyst to my thesis when the primary catalyst is a TPV (""Total Payment Volume"") growth driven by China, Venmo, and Xoom."
3986311,68985,2016-07-05T11:22:27-04:00,"PayPal shares are trading below where they were roughly a year ago when the company was spun-out from eBay, largely reflecting, we believe, concerns about competitive, technology and regulatory risks.Two things we believe the shares do not discount are that PayPal retains a sizable lead versus Apple Pay and others and PayPal continues to innovate to stay ahead.One Touch is PayPal's ""fastest rollout"" and people used Venmo to transfer more than $1 billion in January 2016, a 250% y/y increase.PayPal has a strong incumbent advantage, we believe. As long as it continues to innovate, we believe it will continue benefiting from e-commerce growth and keep growing.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) shares are trading below where they were roughly a year ago when the company was spun-out from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), largely reflecting, we believe, concerns about competitive, technology and regulatory risks. Two things we believe the shares do not seem to discount are that PayPal retains a sizable lead versus Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and others and that PayPal continues to innovate in order to stay ahead. For example, recent PayPal new product launches include One Touch and Venmo, added through PayPal's acquisition of Braintree.Over the years, payments have become increasingly card-based for many purchases versus checks and cash. Electronic payments now are also gaining market share at a rapid pace compared to cash and checks. One reason for this is that transactions continue to shift to online and mobile, driven in part by expanding access to the internet. An estimated 438 million mobile devices in the U.S. accessed the internet in 2013, and this metric is expected to reach more than 690 million devices in 2018.Since its launch in 1998, PayPal has benefited from the trend to electronic payments. As illustrated in the chart below from Payments News, PayPal's quarterly payment volumes increased dramatically from 2001 to 2013, as e-commerce transactions grew rapidly over this period. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales grew from 1.1% at the beginning of 2001 to 7.0% by the end of 2013.Overall, global e-commerce spending as a percentage of total retail expenditures is projected to reach 9% in 2018, up from 6% in 2013, according to the eMarketer Report. Moreover, e-commerce spending is forecast to continue to increase, reflecting rising consumption among younger, internet savvy users.Online shopping using a laptop or desktop computer far outpaces transactions made using mobile devices. PayPal dominates the online payment space. People are spending more time ""window shopping"" via their mobile devices, but more than 70% of online retail purchases are still made on computers, according to Marketing Land. Among challenges to mobile shopping cited by Internet Retailer, smartphone users frequently browse in public places not conducive to completing purchases, particularly as the checkout process has been so cumbersome in the past. Mobile represents 29% of total e-commerce transactions in the U.S. and 34% globally.The mobile payment space is growing and other recent entrants such as Apple Pay and Google Pay are staking claims. PayPal has expanded to mobile, as well, which accounted for 28% of the payments PayPal processed in 2015. Although a relatively small component of TPV (total payment volume), mobile is nevertheless a key part of the retail experience because consumers use it to learn more about items or services before making a purchase. According to Nielsen, 72% of respondents surveyed indicated that they use their smartphone to research products.Over time, we believe mobile ""window shopping"" will lead to higher retail conversion rates (converting window shopping into actual sales), particularly as consumers gain confidence about the security of the payment mechanism.In-store transactions using a mobile device represents only a very small component of total retail expenditures at this time. Domestically, only 0.2% of all 2015 in-store sales used smart devices for payment, according to eMarketer, with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) representing a large percentage of that. Until recently, in-store electronic transactions had been constrained by older POS (point of sale) infrastructure that could not accept electronic payments. Fewer than 10% of POS terminals accept contactless payments at this point, according to payments research company Let's Talk Payments. However, this is changing as retailers upgrade technology and the outlook for mobile in-store use is positive.PayPal Most Established, Entrenched PlayerPayPal, launched in 1998, is significantly more established than the other companies in the space. Apple Pay, for example, debuted domestically in October of 2014 as a mobile first product and expanded into the UK, China and Singapore, with upcoming expansion into France, Hong Kong, and Switzerland planned. PayPal, by comparison, is already available in 203 markets, according to PYMNTS.com. Approximately 45% of its TPV involved an international vendor in 2015 and roughly 22% represented a cross-border transaction. PayPal is also relatively platform agnostic. It is available on iOS, Android and Windows, unlike Apple Pay, which is only available through the Apple ecosystem, or Android Pay, which is available only to Android devices.PayPal is significantly ahead of others in retailer integration, we believe, both in online and mobile. PayPal's One Touch is used by more than half of the top 500 online retailers, including Macy's (NYSE:M), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF), according to Recode. By comparison, Apple Pay is lists just over 90 retailers on its website and Android Pay lists 35.PayPal launched One Touch as a mobile product to simplify the checkout process and enable payment without having to enter payment details for each transaction. Citing comScore data, PYMNTS.com notes that with One Touch, PayPal has 87.5% conversion of shopping to actual sales, which is significantly ahead of 51.1% for Visa (NYSE:V) Checkout and 45.6% for ""all other forms"" of payment. Consumers trust PayPal to keep their personal payment data secure. According to management, One Touch is the ""fastest rollout of any product PayPal has ever had.""PayPal introduced Venmo to enable P2P money transfers and sharing. Users can share payments (think about splitting the check in a restaurant) and send money to friends. In January 2016, people used it to transfer more than $1 billion, representing a 250% year-over-year increase and 1,000% advance from January 2014, according to Newsweek. Venmo processed $7.5 billion transactions in 2015, up from $2.4 billion in 2014.Both One Touch and Venmo contributed to the 19% year-over-year growth that PayPal recorded in 1Q16. By keeping General & administrative and Sales & marketing costs in check, PayPal was also able to achieve some operating leverage on that revenue increase.Conclusion: PayPal Continues to Grow and InnovateAs long as PayPal continues to innovate organically and through M&A, we believe it will keep growing. As a much larger, more established service, PayPal is unlikely to achieve growth rates as high as new competitors. Nevertheless, as noted, PayPal remains in double-digit growth mode, with younger PayPal products such as One Touch and Venmo enjoying significantly higher growth rates and likely to contribute to PayPal's overall expansion for the foreseeable future, in our view. We believe PayPal has three distinct competitive advantages:That said, PayPal must continue to innovate to maintain user trust, as well as to deliver convenience, as we have seen with First Touch and Venmo. We believe that PayPal has a wide and sustainable lead. Unfortunately, we also believe that the overhangs will continue to weigh on the share price in the near term. We would use pullbacks to start building a position in the shares and recognize that upside might be constrained in the short term unless an attractive acquisition offer emerges."
3986356,98236,2016-07-05T13:32:50-04:00,"PayPal has been and remains the clear leader in the overall e-payment space.The company, despite its size and its ubiquity, appears to be poorly understood and hence confronts investors with a significant valuation anomaly.The shares get relatively little respect from the point of view of many valuation metrics for high growth companies.The company has been attempting to move beyond payments and into adjacent financial products and services.The company's most recent results appear to indicate that it is growing its share of the e-commerce world and that competitors are not encroaching upon its payment heartland.","PayPal-A Fintech leader that is trying to outrun its roots as a payment platformPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the better known companies in the U.S. Sometimes contributors, myself included, look for eye-catching titles to attract the attention of potential readers. But PayPal is a service in use by 81 million U.S customers. I personally do not know anyone without a PayPal account - even the technophobes amongst my acquaintance. And so, it was difficult to find some catch title to intrigue people about a service that is used by each customer once a day (28 times a month actually). It has become the default mechanism to transfer money to children, babysitters and more or less everything in between. Last quarter, the total payment volume was $81 billion, compared to $62 billion in the year earlier period adjusted for FX variations. Merchant services payment volume grew by 39%, one of the higher quarterly growth rates for that metric in recent years.PayPal became independent again on July 20, 2015, 13 years after it had been bought by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). The company has something close to 185 million active consumer accounts and it is processing payments for 14 million merchant clients. The company has been reporting very strong quarters since it has become independent and it had a strong quarter just prior to its separation from eBay.The company is almost certainly the leader in the Fintech space and by no small amount. It is now broadening its suite of applications to include risk management, data and analytics and global regulatory compliance. The company sells services to more than 10 million merchants. It has stuck its toe in the water in terms of providing lending to some of its merchant clients and stubbed its toe in supplying credit to some of its consumer customers... It basically has global coverage although that may not be considered an asset by some in these post-Brexit days and continued concerns about the global economy and FX fluctuations.And yet there exists a certain frisson about the challenges that surround the company and its ongoing transformation. The last 6 opinion changes or initiations of coverage by banks have all been negative. The mean price target is $43 for the 34 brokers making calls which would represent a 19% return from current prices. Clearly, there is a disconnect between price targets, published earnings and the real opinion of professional analysts. The shares have been relatively weak since the company announced Q1 earnings at the end of April and have lost 10% of their value since that time while the SPY is up about 1% over the same period.The frisson of concern surrounding the shares is basically concern that the company has a very ""breachable"" competitive moat and that it has a host of new competitors attempting to attack its franchise. The consensus top line growth rate is forecast to be 15%. Unlike some tech vendors, the company's growth projections by analysts do not show a falling trend. And yet the P/E for the next 12 months starting 7/1 is only 21X.And hence the valuation anomaly. Most IT companies that are profitable and are significantly profitable excluding stock-based comp. and have an expectation for 15% growth along with some margin expansion are simply not priced at 21X earnings.That is especially true given the low level but continuous chatter regarding the company's potential as a consolidation candidate. EV/S is a very reasonable 3.3X and the company generated $2.5 billion of operating cash flow and $1.8 billion of free cash flow this past year which represents free cash flow yield of almost 5%. Stock-based comp. is noticeable as it represented 13% of operating cash flow and was up 20% year on year but overall cash flow climbed by 36% year on year, driven mainly by increases in net income and lower loan losses offset to a degree by balance sheet items.I think it is fair to say that the shares belie an expectation of growth and have a significant ""fear discount."" The largest fear amongst analysts is competition and the pressures that it could have on margins. I will address that in some detail below. This article is going to be all about the risks that PayPal faces and the opportunities it has in the emerging digital commerce world.One of the areas in which competition seems to be having an impact according to some, relates to the company's reported decline of 380 bps for transaction margins. The CFO described the decline as one based on several factors. Part of the decline is a function of the company's strategy of improving its relationships with large retailers. Obviously, larger retailers will not pay the percentage fees of PayPal's smaller customers. In addition, the company's Braintree platform described earlier inevitably has a significantly higher percentage of card payments and therefore lower rates that PYPC is able to collect. CFO John Rainey, said that, ""we continue to see volume accelerate across our platform, driven in part by strong growth of our newer businesses. The mix shift to these newer businesses where we are investing puts pressure on our transaction margin, which good cost control will help offset."" While the answers overall seem reasonable enough to this writer, the share price performance these last couple of months suggests that, at the least, investors remain more than a little dubious.The call featured additional queries regarding the contraction of payment margins. In response to one such question, the CFO attempted to discuss a component of the company's strategy. ""I would remind you that's a deliberate part of our strategy as we're trying to increase the ubiquity of PayPal and allow our customers to use PayPal at larger merchants where we're going to see pressure on the take rate. Fortunately for us, we have the ability to offset that (strategy) with the operating leverage in our business. And as a management team, we're focused on our margins, our generation of free cash flow and growing EPS and not getting so focused on just one aspect of the P&L."" Being focused gross margin dollars and not gross margin expense makes more than a bit of sense to me, particularly for one of the larger companies in the space that can use its size effectively at this point.Overall, including the impact of increasing revenues from Braintree which has a lower margin business model as described below, net margins declined 70 BPS year on year. The acquisition of Zoom, which took place on July 1st, 2015, also had an impact on net margins. Zoom is still very much in an investment mode, and is anticipated to make operating losses at least until the end of this calendar year. Excluding the Zoom acquisition, the balance of the transactional revenues reported a small increase in net margins.PayPal's Competitors and PayPal's strategiesIt might be better put, who in the financial services world does PayPal not compete against? The company has multiple product and service initiatives that will lead it to compete with many traditional players across the financial services space. I won't at this point rehash some of Q1's financial statistics. It would be hard to say much more than they exceeded anyone's reasonable expectations for a company at this scale. I don't propose to investigate all of the PayPal new offerings-far too tedious, but I think just highlighting a few of them will be sufficient. I will try not to sound too cynical. I use some of these products myself, but making a payments platform look better with improved graphics and with some additional number of options to stimulate customer engagement is a bit much. I am never going to make an extra payment because the application on my phone looks more attractive. But the fact is, it seems to work and as the saying goes, the proof is in the eating. I confess, if an app is easy to use and doesn't strain my eyes that is about all I care about.One piece of the PYPL strategy is its focus on building its mobile payments offerings. It is a lifestyle thing that is really pervasive across the IT world. The company has refreshed its mobile app at what must have been great cost and effort. Another significant part of the strategy is to better integrate Venmo into the overall Pay ecosystem. Venmo is a payment tool that millennials love to use. I now have it thanks to a millennial friend. Venmo today is a tiny part of PayPal but over time it is supposed to be a premier tool for person to payment. And if you have millennial or younger kids or relations you probably know exactly what I mean. PYPC is partnering with Telcel and Claro, which are Mexican wireless service providers to enable its payment app on their devices. International may not be the most popular investment theme at the moment, but it does represent lots of potential for PayPal and its suite of mobile solutions.Venmo was acquired by Braintree in 2012. A year after that, Braintree was bought be PYPC for $860 million. Braintree now includes the e-commerce platform of Modest, another recent PayPal acquisition. Braintree offers a service that allows merchants to accept payments on-line and within the mobile application of the merchant. The solution works with most of the leading e-commerce platforms including Shopify, Bigcommerce and Magneto. The service is in the process of being expanded worldwide.Something a bit easier for me is the company's offering in the e-commerce world. The company has a set of tools and API's in beta at the moment that allows merchants to sell across all e-world venues such as social share, blogs, articles, ads within an app and basically anywhere else that might be imagined. PayPal has a partnership with Shopify which is the leading e-commerce solution for the SMB space. PayPal will now be the default payment option for Shopify customers when setting up a Shopify platform. PayPal also has what it describes as payment experiences that are built into Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger and FB Shop. I have always wondered if something is called an experience, does it lessen the burden of seeing a bank balance diminish. The most successful new product launch for PayPal has been One Touch. It makes it quicker to pay without such annoying things as interacting with people, typing passwords and billing and shipping info. It really works although just speaking personally I am not too sure how much I appreciate making the checkout experience easier is precisely the benefit for which I have been pining for some number of years.Xoom is a PayPal service that allows users to send money to, pay bills and reload phones from the US. It is far less expensive than alternative payment services since it only costs $4.99 in addition to the FX spread and the transfer is instantaneous. Xoom is growing rapidly and it is being rolled out globally. PayPal is not at its best in terms of quantifying any kind of specific revenue projections for its newer services. There are obvious reasons for that but it would be helpful to have some sense as to the degree the new services are adding meaningfully to growth. About all we know about Xoom is that 70% of its transactions took place on mobile platforms and that the number of active users rose 70% year on year.At this point Xoom is not profitable and has had a noticeable impact on overall PYPC margins. It is expensive to bring the Xoom service to more and more geos and to build out the required infrastructure. Management has said that Xoom will ""generate more significant profits in 2017."" But without detailed financials, trying to assess the potential impact that Xoom is having on margins or how much accretion potential there is from Xoom in 2017, is more or less the same as trying to ""catch a moonbeam in your hand.""It is not easy to define what percentage of revenues come from PayPal's newer services. We know that the bucket called ""other value added service"" is now 12% of the total. We know that growth rates for other value added services which include the company's credit portfolio, subscription fees, interest earned on certain PayPal customer account balances and Paydiant products was 37% last quarter. (Paydiant is a company that was acquired by PayPal for about $300 million in March of 2015. It has had modest revenues but has an industrial strength ""white box"" mobile payment system that is used by both retailers including Wal-Mart and by banks as well).But that really isn't the whole story. Some of PayPal's newer services are really included in the payments bucket. Since the company doesn't break out just how much newer products are contributing we can only guess. Last quarter transaction revenues for PayPal grew by 17% year on year - the fastest growth in some years. I think it is inevitable to conclude that the growth rate increase has been primarily driven by newer products and services coupled with their flywheel effect. How to quantify the piece of the growth in transaction revenues that relates to the company's newer initiatives is not possible without explicit management disclosure. But as suggested above, without new products, both in the payment space and in other services, the future outlook for this company would be very different than is actually the case.I think that it is relatively straightforward to suggest that for PayPal to remain a growth company it simply has to move significantly beyond its roots as a payment processor. CEO Dan Schulman's, who came to PayPal from American Express (NYSE:AXP) where he focused on the same kinds of strategy that he is bringing to PYPL, goal is to establish the company as the dominant payment system for mobile and web commerce. It would be easier for this writer and for investors if the company attempted to quantify the impact of the new initiatives on the company's growth. That isn't going to happen. But it seems reasonable to suggest that the company is doing well with the necessary initiatives to augment its business significantly beyond its roots as a payment processor.PayPal has one very obvious risk given its position as one of the leading payment providers globally. Its services can and for that matter probably are used to make payments whose ultimate beneficiaries are more than a bit questionable. The company is investing heavily in security and compliance infrastructure and seems to have avoided some of the money-laundering allegations that have been faced by many other large financial institutions on a global basis. PayPal offers a ""Credit"" offering called ""Bill Me Later."" The company ran into significant issues with the ""Bill me Later"" service for essentially extending credit illegally. Without reprising the complaint and its settlement, PayPal eventually agreed to pay a $10 million fine and to pay restitution of an additional $15 million. To an extent, the issue seemed to stem from bureaucratic policies that were not appropriately reviewed by senior management. And then, when issues arose, management didn't move to the mitigation phase fast enough. The company's compliance and regulatory expenditures really need to encompass all manner of potential abuses. It is part of what it takes to be a worldwide, leading edge payment processor.PayPal offers some credit services both to consumers and to its merchant customers. Credit is a relatively tiny part of total revenue for PayPal. The most interesting of the credit offering, at least to this writer, is the working capital offering that can be utilized by its merchant customers. Clearly the potential to extend credit to merchants who are already using one of the PayPal merchant services is very substantial and of course it serves a flywheel for the sales of additional services to the merchant-borrowers. The current statistic is that PayPal merchant borrowers spend 40% more on the company's service than those who do not borrow from the company. Unfortunately, many investors think that PayPal's credit operations which include credit for consumers as well as credit to merchants introduce an unnecessary element of risk into this company's investment profile.Revenues from credit are apparently growing somewhat more rapidly than the average for the overall PayPal business but not by so much that it is going to move the needle one way or the other. The CFO, John Rainey, commented that if credit and the rest of PayPal's business grew at rates comparable to those in 2015, it would be two decades before credit became 20-25% of revenues. I think that it is silly to waste any more electrons on a service that represents 2% of revenue.For the record, transaction and loan losses aggregated $255 million last quarter which was 10% of total revenue. That figure increased from 8% of revenues in the prior year's quarter. There doubtless was, as the CFO put it, an increase in risk pressure last quarter, but at the current loss level, the issue can be readily solved without changing growth expectations. There are many other and more significant issues that ought to concern investors.So who does PayPal compete against specifically? In no particular order some of the competitors include Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Wallet, WePay, 2CheckOut, Authorize.Net, Skrill, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) (GoPayment), ProPay (a PayPal competitor that is accepted by eBay), Click2Sell, Dwolla, ClickBank and Stripe. And of course how might one easily forget Square (NYSE:SQ), Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). These are just the most prominent of the direct alternatives. They all pose threats in terms of alternatives to PayPal. They all offer advantages and they have disadvantages. In the nature of things, most payment systems are not and never will be exclusive. Anyone who runs a small business is always going to be searching for a less expensive payment system that has specific capabilities that better suit a particular business.The best source I found for the most current market share data has been a company called Datanyze. The Datanyze data suggest that PayPal has essentially an insurmountable lead in terms of its market share and that it appears that its market share has continued to grow. According to share data current actually through July 3rd, 2016, PayPal has a 63% market share in terms of its Alexa rankings. As long as PayPal continues to add new users at the rate of 20 million+/year, I think it is premature, to say the least, to believe that the company's reign as the #1 payment processor in the digital age is coming under pressure. PayPal has suggested that it is increasing its market share in the e-commerce world. Independent statistics would seem to support that assertion.Given the size of the market and the ubiquity of payments in an e-commerce world, there are always likely to be investor concerns about competition. I haven't seen any compelling evidence that suggests that PayPal is losing market share and it well may be gaining a greater share of the consumer wallet.The competitive moat that PayPal is building is one of offering more and more services to drive customer engagement. Within its target demographic, the strategy appears to be successful.Short-term OutlookMost investors are aware, I imagine, that PayPal has advertised that Q2-2016 comparisons will show less percentage growth than the comparisons posted in Q1. Growth is expected to be about 600 bps lower this quarter than the figure last quarter because the year-earlier period included substantial onetime gains from the sale of PYPL's credit receivables and the impact of the amended Synchrony (SYE) agreement last year which were essentially 100% margin transactions. It seems reasonable to believe that the partnership that exists between Synchrony Bank and PayPal is likely to continue and that there could be additional sales of PYPL's credit card assets to Synchrony in the future.The largest single unknown with regards to the quarter is most likely any FX issues. Last quarter saw no real FX problems. It would seem that the swoon of international currencies, particularly the GBP since the Brexit vote might penalize earnings. On the other hand, analyst estimates of $.25 for the quarter are comfortably below the top end of the guidance range. There are 37 analysts who publish numbers on this name and while there are outliers to be sure, the range of published estimates is quite low.Because of the size and the ubiquity of PayPal, it is hard, I think, to enjoy any kind of informational advantage. I think that the newer product and service initiatives that I described above are likely to continue to grow at extremely high rates not altogether encompassed by company guidance. Just check with your millennial friends regarding their interest in Venmo and Xoom as proof points. I imagine the initiatives that induce consumers to use PayPal more often will continue to bear fruit. Retail sales have been somewhat strong in the US this past quarter and stronger in the demographics that use PayPal and Venmo than elsewhere.I really have no particular insight into the number of new customer adds or in the penetration this company has enjoyed in terms of new major retailers. Absent FX, I would probably handicap the PayPal short-term outlook as positive in terms of both revenues and EPS. PayPal gets 49% of its revenues outside the US and it has 56% of its customers outside of the US. And perhaps the Brexit issues, which only really impacted one week out of thirteen last quarter will not have been of the magnitude to change earnings, even at the margin. At this point, my best guess is for a small beat.The question of guidance is always one of the principle issues in terms of shorter term share price performance. At some level, this is a company whose fortunes are based in whole or in part on the health of the worldwide consumer economy. It would, I believe, not be prudent for this company to raise guidance, regardless of the potential strength of Q2 results simply given the uncertainties that seem to abound in the worldwide consumer outlook. This is a very strong business with one of the better franchises around, regardless of how much some users wish to complain about their particular experiences. But no business of this scale is going to escape unscathed from whatever worldwide economic trends turn out to be.ValuationAs I mentioned at the start of this article, so far as I can tell, the current valuation is, in whole or part, disconnected from the company's outlook. Apparently, there have been significant rumors from short sellers about the actual outlook for this company, although that being said, the short interest is a mere 3%. Also, somewhat surprising is the relatively low institutional interest at just 20%. I suppose, prospectively that indicates that there is a lot of unused buying power that is perhaps the more visible impact of the short stories than the short interest.In any event, I will use non-GAAP numbers in this bit of the article and I will use valuation indices that relate to the next 12 months. The company has an enterprise value of $38.5 billion. A reasonable revenue estimate going forward would be about $11.3 billion in revenues which is an EV/S of 3.4X. The P/E again based on non-GAAP for the next 12 months and based on an earnings estimate of about $1.68 would be a bit less than 22X. And the free cash flow yield is 4.5%.I think all of those metrics are outliers in the event that this company has a longer-term growth rate of a bit greater than 15% with some gradual but noticeable margin improvement. While I do not put much faith in longer term estimates of earnings growth, it appears that the Price to Earnings growth ratio is around or just a bit above 1.3X. Looking at companies with significantly lower expected growth rates finds Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) with a Price to Earnings growth ratio of 1.8X. IBM, at least to the published data on Yahoo, has a Price to Earnings Growth estimate of 4.26X. That is probably based on inaccurate input. IBM's earnings are expected to decline this year and to rise by 4% in 2017 to a level still below actual earnings in 2015. Checkpoint's (NYSE:CKP) Price to Earnings Growth ratio is 1.65X. The ratio for Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) is 1.2X, but of course, Cisco has very little in the way of expected earnings growth, between 4-5% over the next 2 years. So, a 1.3X ratio for a company such as this with strong growth seems like a significant value.As I wrote earlier, there are 3 basic factors that are probably weighing on valuation. One of those is the ability this company will have to innovate to the extent necessary to preserve its growth rate. Product development spending is running around 7-8% of revenues and rose by just 6% year on year. In fact, R&D showed the smallest percentage growth of any of the expense categories published by PayPal. Adding back stock-based comp. to the reported total adds another $33 million and brings the ""real"" R&D expense to about 9% of revenues. Fintech is not quite the same as IT and so trying to look at expense ratios and compare them is probably not a worthwhile exercise. I think that the company appears to be getting what it is spending and what it is getting seems to be enough to drive increased market share and to drive product develop allowing PYPL to enter adjacent markets.The second biggest risk that people seem to write about relates to competition. I have written what I can above and do not see the need to reprise that. There are plenty of competitors and some of them are large and successful. PayPal competes in a large and growing market space and it would be quite surprising if it didn't have capable competitors. But market share data from what is apparently the most reliable source in this space suggests that PayPal is gaining customers, the company's revenue growth suggests that it is gaining market share in the broadly defined e-commerce market and there doesn't appear to be some kind of killer innovation or some dysfunctional pricing that ought to cause concern. I do not regard competition as a reason for not investing in this name.And then there is credit risk. The company at this time has $4.2 billion of loan and interest receivables which is 14% of the company's assets. It has $6.3 billion in cash and equivalents. I just do not quite understand what the real risk of asset losses is supposed to be. A company such as PayPal is always subject to risks. New products may not find traction. A competitor like Apple or Google might decide to buy market share. Someone may design a cheaper and more flexible payment paradigm. But credit risk - well if the world melts down and no one pays back anything then this company would have some credit risk although it has more cash than loans receivable. Credit risk does just not seem quite reasonable as an explanation for not owning these shares.Summing Up!It is rare to see what is essentially a large cap growth company on-sale in a period during which its operating metrics are improving substantially. The valuation for PayPal is a significant anomaly in the opinion of this writer and investors would seem likely to do well from the current anomaly."
3989142,61281,2016-07-18T12:15:20-04:00,"New chatter that Visa will acquire PayPal surfaced last week.Both companies will report on Thursday, and speculations of a potential merger dominate social media.Investors should not overlook an adverse scenario that could send stock prices down.Sharp volatility is expected, so investors should be careful buying into this earnings release.","In an earlier article about PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), I gave a quick overview of the previous acquisition rumors and briefly analyzed the rumor of a MasterCard deal. The benefits from a PayPal-MasterCard deal are significant for both companies as it creates a huge financial service provider that provides customers a one-stop-shop service for all their transaction needs that relate to credit card transactions, in-store/in-app/online transactions, credit like, invoicing, and other online services. Also, the merged company will be able to collect PayPal's transaction fees and the credit company's processing fees and benefit from both sides of the e-commerce business.After PayPal was already linked with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), AmEx (NYSE:AXP), and of course MasterCard (NYSE:MA), a new rumor of potential acquisition started to roll that Visa (NYSE:V) will take over PayPal. Fueled by the rally in stock price (slightly trimmed in Friday), speculations about a potential deal with Visa dominated the social media chat about PayPal the previous week. The new Visa-PayPal chatter surprised me for three main reasons: the size of such a potential deal, regulatory challenges, and the Visa CEO's threats to go after PayPal.The first reason is very much straight forward: PayPal is currently trading around $40 per share, which reflects a $48B market cap for the company and a significant amount to the fund. Even if the deal is in shares and cash, Visa will need to raise a massive amount of funds, which might not be an easy task as we witnessed in the Dell-EMC deal. However, in case Visa acquires PayPal, it will not be for $48B or $50B; it will be for much more than $50B to reflect even a modest premium assuming talks started a few months ago.In case the talks did start a few months ago, Visa CEO's comments in the JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) tech conference are viewed in a very different way. Charlie Scharf said in that conference: ""We'd love to figure out a different model with them where it's consumer choice first whether or not disintermediating. If we can figure that out with them, great. We'll think of them more as a partner. They need to do things differently in order to do that. The other door is where we go full steam and compete with them in ways that people have never seen before. Because you've never seen us go target PayPal in the marketplace in any meaningful way.""This aggressive word choice seemed, at first, a real threat to PayPal to stop encouraging their users to transfer from a credit card-based account to an ACH-based account. A shift of a user to an ACH-based account means that Visa will not collect any transaction fees from the user's future transactions, and PayPal will increase transaction margin as ACH transactions have no fees. This is a dual game that PayPal plays with the credit card companies (Visa and MasterCard equally), and it seemed to me, at first, an honest emotional response to this ambiguous relationship with PayPal.Now, if we read Mr. Scharf's comment again, keeping in mind that Visa theoretically negotiated deal terms with PayPal at the same time, it seems like a move of one of the negotiating parties to put more pressure on the other side. CEO Scharf theoretically sent a message to Dan Schulman, saying that Visa could go after PayPal with massive power if PayPal refuses the deal terms.The dry facts show that something is going on - PayPal moved its earnings call to July 21 adjacent to Visa; journalists looking for answers from PayPal were ignored, and the options volume for July and August, above calls with strikes above $40, surged. It seems that unlike previous rumors, this one might materialize, and the related parties (PayPal and Visa) will address the deal terms on Thursday. Last week, many investors published posts on social media, stating their newly-opened options position to capture the potential PayPal-Visa deal upside. As a long-term investor who has held PayPal since the spin-off, I believe that investors should not overlook a scenario in which PayPal and Visa do not announce a merger but rather another dramatic change that will have a negative impact on stock prices, such as discontinuing their partnership or some other extreme scenario.It is clear that PayPal stock will move sharply this week amid the earnings release and merger rumors. Both short-term and long-term investors should prepare and adjust their portfolios for the merger (upside) or altered partnership deal (downside) scenarios - ignoring the possibility of these events might be a devastating mistake no matter how the stock moves."

3984370,20330,2016-06-26T02:54:01-04:00,"PayPal posted a solid earnings per share of $.30 in the first quarter which represented a growth of 43% year-on-year.It is not considered a bank under US law, but its European subsidiary is considered as such under Luxembourg law.Its 2015 prudential and liquidity banking-related ratios seem be pretty solid, even if it were to be considered a bank.","Digital payments processor PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has had a pretty good year. First quarter earnings per share of $.30 grew by 43% year on year. Annual results were even more impressive, since 2015 earnings per share of $1.00 increased by almost 200% from 2014 values of $.34.However, all was not well last year. PayPal had to shell out $25 million as sanctions imposed by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau because of misleading advertising and mishandling of credit disputes. It was alleged that PayPal had signed up consumers for its online credit program, Bill Me Later without their permission. As well, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will initiate Apple Pay integrated into the Safari Mac web browser. It is unclear how this will impact on PayPal. But the sanctions imposed last year should send up some warning signals about PayPal's future, since, while it is not a bank, as determined by the FDIC, it is still subject to the same forces washing over the banking sector.The question is whether PayPal's strong situation depends on how one classifies it. Does it matter what we call it? I think it does.Strong 2015 results based on growth in fundamentals.Since PayPal was spun off from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), its stock market performance has been relatively decent, as the following graph shows. On average, the stock posted a return of 7.5% over the period.Source:finance.yahoo.comOn other news, PayPal posted other positives in its 2015 annual report, from 2014 values. Base revenues for PayPal originate from transaction fees charged to consumers and merchants. Gains and losses are also recognized in these base revenues. The other revenues include revenues derived from PayPal's credit loans, as well as interest earned on PayPal's customer account balances (more on that later). The following table highlights some very strong trends in PayPal between 2014 and 2015 in both kinds of transactions. It should be noted that for PayPal, ""TPV"" or ""Total payment volume"" represents a base line for its revenues. Net revenues increased by 15% between 2014 and 2015. Looking at the decomposition of the increase in revenues, one notes that one of the important drivers is an increase in the number of payment transactions-indicating PayPal users were using their accounts more actively.Source: PayPal's 2015 results.And yet, and yet, what about its banking ratios?PayPal has been deemed not to be a bank, by the FDIC, but rather a ""deposit broker"" in a 2008 ruling. A ""deposit broker"", is defined, by the FDIC as any institution which is engaged in ""placing deposits"" belonging to others at a depository institution. Section 29 of the FDI act requires any institution that accepts brokered deposits to be sufficiently capitalized. PayPal holds its customer deposits in a corporate bank account that pays interest. For instance, deposit funds owed to customers was reported at $12.2 billion, or 82% of total liabilities. Loans and interest receivable, presumably from the placement of said deposits totaled $4.2 billion, or a 34% ratio of funds deposited. In the U.S., PayPal is licensed as a ""money transmitter"" and is under state regulations, but in Europe, PayPal Europe is subject to regulations as a bank in Luxembourg. Thus, it is worthwhile examining some banking ratios for PayPal, or more specifically the change in such ratios. The efficiency ratio, unchanged at 84% is quite high. On the other hand, problem loans, defined as loans with a FICO score less than 680, constitute only 4% of the total loan portfolio, which means that PayPal can skate on thin capitalization. One can't quite calculate PayPal's Tier 1 capital, but the ratio of capital to short-term assets is adequate at 66%. Its return on assets declined 12% from 2014 values of 37%. And its proportion of liquid assets to total assets declined by 11% from 2014 values of 80%. On the whole, even if PayPal were to be considered a bank, it seems to be adequately capitalized, and its ratios seem sound.PayPal's adventure with Bitcoin provides a cautionary twist to its future prospects.On the whole, despite myself, I found that PayPal seems to be looking to the future on relatively solid ground. The fact that its prudential ratios seem to be good means that if ever it were to be considered a bank, it could get away with this designation probably better than some real banks. However, one other consideration that future investors should consider is a future partnership that PayPal has launched with Coinbase, a bitcoin exchange. So far, PayPal users can cash in on any bitcoin balances from Coinbase into their PayPal account but not the reverse.However, such a venture might increase the risk of cyber-attacks to PayPal. Finally, as the recent experience with Brexit, PayPal, which lost $37 million last year in currency translation effects may be more sensitive to currency exposure than the average bank. These two factors should be taken into account by any investor interested in cashing in on PayPal."

At the time, Venmo was a relatively unknown mobile application and asset for parent company PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). In the article, I argued Venmo's ease of use and rapid adoption would give the application huge advantage over Dwolla, Square, and others. Since then, Venmo's users, usage, and value have increased dramatically. In this short article, I want to provide some updates and reconfirm why I believe PayPal, and Venmo, are the best vehicle for exposure to mobile payments.Why Mobile Payments?Here are a few of my favorite stats from the Federal Reserve:Smartphone adoption has paved the way for mobile payments. Unbanked and underbanked consumers are in dramatic need for financial services. And, consumers are adopting technology faster than ever. Cash is no longer king. Venmo is now king among Millennials.Venmo Users and UsageVenmo has surged in popularity among Millennials and college students. In last quarter's conference call, Daniel Schulman, CEO of PayPal, gave us some updated usage data. Schulman reported that Venmo processed nearly $3.2 billion in payment volume in Q1, up over 150% from last year. And, Schulman stated that Venmo is ""on track to expand to more merchants and open the service to our full Venmo customer base in the second half of this year.""On a personal note, I dug into my personal Venmo usage statistics. On average, I use Venmo 1.8 times per day to cover everything from cable bills to rent, to beers, to lunch. Venmo has made it virtually impossible for its competitors to create a sticky mobile payments application. Venmo's adoption and social presence has created a huge barrier to entry for oncoming competition.Venmo Opens the Door for MerchantsWhen I wrote my last article, Venmo was only available for consumers. In July 2015, I wrote:In January of 2016, Venmo launched a merchant facing product as I predicted. It made it possible for app developers to integrate Venmo payment functionality into their mobile applications.From the start, Venmo made it possible to order food and even purchase event tickets. Since then, it has even released a Developer API for app developers!The integration makes it easy for consumers to pay app developers. And, Venmo stands to take a cut from every single transaction. Even large companies like Papa John's are accepting Venmo payments. As described on the Venmo Developer API website, Papa John's uses Venmo's deep integration to help their customers split pizzas like pros. Once you buy pizza and snacks for your crew, you can connect to Venmo, select your friends and request money from them as you checkout.Venmo's FutureVenmo's payment volume and user base will continue to expand with little marketing from parent company PayPal. Venmo has replaced cash for me, and most of my peers.What we should really watch is merchant adoption in brick-and-mortar retail stores. Venmo is already on its way into mobile applications. But soon, I bet we will begin seeing Venmo is traditional retailers too. I bet that Venmo will begin competing directly with Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL).ConclusionVenmo has come an extremely long way over the last year. It is hard to quantify the long-term value of Venmo inside of PayPal's portfolio. That said, Venmo and PayPal are the best vehicles for exposure to the mobile payment revolution. And, Venmo and PayPal offer exposure to the unbanked and underbanked thesis.I am remaining long PayPal stock as I believe PayPal is uniquely positioned as a technology focused financial services company."
3981601,26861,2016-06-13T08:58:30-04:00,"PayPal is coming up on its one-year IPO anniversary; during this time period, the stock has traded with an over 40 percent differential between the high and low.PayPal's net revenues are estimated to surpass MasterCard during 2017; long-term net revenue growth could eventually pass Visa as well.Despite strong top-line performance, the company will not be able to replicate the same margin of profitability as MasterCard and Visa.However, the potential to grow volume, transactions and net revenues remains in the company's favor and an initial position will be considered this week.","Action: Initiate PositionPayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) as many already know was spun-off from eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY). Much has been written regarding PayPal's potential from a more technical perspective including recent acquisitions of Braintree, Venmo and Xoom. Additionally, PayPal operates a similar model as MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) in that transaction fees are applied where each entity's networks and/or platforms are relied upon.To this point, for desktop and mobile device purchases, any of these payment options as depicted above and more for credit card companies can be utilized. For merchant in-store purchases, PayPal has not become as integrated, but the company is striving towards improving this.From this perspective, the name of the game is volume of transactions. Visa provides a competitive picture for total volume and total transactions. Based upon the information above, PayPal ranks fourth behind Visa, MasterCard and American Express (NYSE:AXP) for total volume and total transactions. PayPal witnessed roughly $300 billion in total payment volume (TPV) on a trailing twelve-month (TTM) period as of the first quarter and witnessed 5.2 billion total transactions.This places PayPal ahead of JCB International and Discover Financial Services (NYSE:DFS), DiscoverDiners Club. Total transactions for PayPal were up nearly 25 percent year-over-year and on a TTM basis, while TPV was up 23 percent. As American Express's total volume and total transactions grew by 7 and 5 percent respectively during the previous fiscal year, PayPal has a legitimate shot at becoming the third highest company by total transactions over the next couple of years. For TPV, this may take longer over the next 7 to 10 years. This type of volume and transaction growth is important as a driver for net revenues, and the primary reason why the company may not surpass Visa and MasterCard anytime soon for volume and transactions, but has a chance for net revenues.From this point I would like to remind investors of the past when MasterCard actually went public. This occurred all the way back in May 2006. At that time, the company generated nearly $3.3 billion in net revenue and was growing around 15 percent per year or so. It was not until 2007 that the company's profit margin really began to take off near the 30 percent level.From here the stock returned over 2,000 percent over the course of ten years. This is truly one of the best investments one could have made over the previous decade. Back then, MasterCard also only sported a $5 billion market capitalization. From this quick review we can gather a couple of factors for PayPal. First the company is not cheap as it sports a $40 billion enterprise value. Second, the company's profit margins are not the same when it comes to Visa and MasterCard.But to be fair, PayPal's net revenues are three times that of MasterCard's, so from a business lifecycle perspective, PayPal is more mature. The intrigue with PayPal is that the company was created for web-based payments. The evolution of the credit card payment system with merchants and the like has been built out over decades. Like most things related and/or dependent on the Internet, growth occurs much more rapidly. PayPal's success, however, has occurred during a similar timeframe as MasterCard, and based upon current scale, while still debatable, the current valuation is justified being much higher than MasterCard when considering net revenues.The other important component and core driver for investments is earnings growth. For MasterCard, the company was able to reduce their percentage of general and administrative and advertising and marketing costs relative to net revenues by an astounding 1,500 and 2,100 basis points between 2006 and 2013. This reduced these two line items' costs as a percent of net revenues from 45 to 30 percent and 31 to 10 percent respectively.To this point, PayPal's business structure is simply more costly as the company needs to have expense line items for transactions, transaction and loan losses, customer support and operations and product development. Sales and marketing and general and administrative costs are low at 10 and 6 percent respectively. But all the other costs add up leading to the company's current 14 percent margin; 17 percent when considering an adjusted basis.By comparison, PayPal will most likely not be able to witness the phenomenal growth in profit margins similar to MasterCard and/or Visa. So the rapid rate of growth over the next decade will be nowhere close to MasterCard, but if PayPal is able to grow its net revenues by an average 9 percent per year and improve its adjusted net income margin near the 20 percent level, an average return of 10 percent per year is not unreasonable, placing the company around a $100 billion enterprise value.The current stock price of $36.77/share is 23 percent above the low and 16 percent below the high. The current valuation is dependent upon whether one uses analyst estimates which rely upon adjusted earnings or GAAP diluted EPS. Based on non-GAAP adjusted earnings for 2017, PayPal trades about 20 times earnings. Using GAAP diluted EPS, this equates to around 25 times earnings. MasterCard and Visa trade 23 and 25 times 2017 analyst earnings estimates. From this perspective, PayPal does not seem to be trading at a premium versus its peers, but is not a steal at the moment either.PayPal is strongly positioned to compete moving forward as evidenced by total volume and transactions versus the company's peers. The broader markets have remained volatile throughout 2016 with last week ending on a sour note. The potential for PayPal to return 10 percent per year based upon the current valuation is cause for consideration to initiate a position within the Lean Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LLGP). Any substantial weakness during the upcoming week with the stock price declining to the low $30s would be an ideal opportunity; regardless a position will be considered."

The company's Indian phone share is currently pegged around 2%. Tim Cook recently trumpeted the Indian market's long-term potential during a talk with Jim Cramer.WSJ: Bids for ""core"" Yahoo expected to come in at $2B-$3B, less than previously-expected $4B-$8B - For some reason, companies are cautious about bidding on a fragmented web media empire that has guided for ex-TAC revenue to drop to $3.4B-$3.6B this year from 2015's $4.1B and 2014's $4.4B, and operating income to drop to $150M-$250M from 2015's $342M and 2014's $755M. As the WSJ observes, companies could be low-balling their bids a bit in the initial rounds. Verizon (NYSE:VZ), which appears to have dreams of pairing Yahoo with AOL and other online media assets to create an ad rival to Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), is said to remain the front-runner.With Yahoo having closed on Thursday with a $35.1B market cap, the figures provided in the WSJ's report are a fresh reminder that Yahoo's 384M-share Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stake (current pre-tax value of $30.1B) still has the biggest impact on its shares.Google will build its own VR headset, bring Android apps to Chrome OS in September - After unveiling its Daydream VR platform on Wednesday - it features headsets powered by compatible Android phones, supports a handheld controller, and is much more advanced than Google's (GOOG, GOOGL) current Cardboard VR platform - Google says it'll sell its own Daydream headset, thus competing with OEM partners such as Samsung, Xiaomi, HTC and Huawei. The company predicts hundreds of millions of phones will be Daydream-compatible in a couple of years, and hopes this will allow Daydream to turn into a mass-market platform.Meanwhile, Google says the Play Store (and with it, the store's Android apps) will be available on Chrome OS devices in September, and that it's working with OEMs to launch Chromebooks supporting Google Play out of the box. Exec Kan Liu: ""You're going to be able to get onto your Chromebook and have all your favorite Android apps, games, and media content.""It'll take some time for developers that wrote Android apps meant for handheld touch-only devices to optimize them for cheap non-touch PCs - not all Chromebooks fit this description, but most of them do - sporting keyboards and mice/trackpads. And of course, developers have to feel Chrome OS is important enough to justify the effort. But it's easy to see how Android's huge app ecosystem can boost Chrome OS' appeal to both consumers and businesses, as well as enable PC/tablet hybrids. As SA contributor Mark Hibben has observed, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) can't be thrilled about Google's efforts.Microsoft is prepping a ""Bing Concierge Bot"" that will compete with Google Assistant - A day after Google revealed a ""conversational"" assistant service (known as Google Assistant, accessible via both voice and a messaging app), ZDNet uncovered a Microsoft job posting indicating the company is prepping ""a highly intelligent productivity agent that communicates with the user over a conversation platform, such as Skype, Messenger, SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc."" The agent ""runs errands on behalf of the user, by automatically completing tasks.""Plenty of competition exists: In addition to Google Assistant, there's Apple's Siri, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa, and Facebook's M assistant for Messenger (still in beta), which combines human and AI-based assistant services. Microsoft can leverage its investments in Bing and Cortana, as well as its recently-launched Bot Framework, which lets third-party developer build Microsoft-hosted chatbot services for messaging apps.Separately, Microsoft has partnered with Sohu's (NASDAQ:SOHU) Sogou search unit (#3 in the Chinese market) to have Bing deliver English-language results on two vertical Sogou search services.Applied Materials surges on strong results/guidance; display and flash memory orders jump - The chip equipment giant's orders rose 52% Q/Q and 37% Y/Y in FQ2 to $3.45B, thanks in large part to a near-6x Y/Y increase in display equipment orders to $700M. CEO Gary Dickerson: ""In the display area, customers are moving to OLED, particularly in mobile, and that increases our total available market by a factor of three."" Apple has been widely rumored to be planning to launch iPhones sporting OLEDs in 2017.Also: 3D NAND flash memory investments led Applied's (NASDAQ:AMAT) flash-related orders to more than double Y/Y, and allowed total chip equipment orders to rise 15% to $1.97B in spite of weak foundry and DRAM-related orders. And solar segment orders (weak for a while) saw some improvement, more than doubling to $108M.Applied's numbers are an apparent positive for chip equipment peers such as Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), KLA-Tencor (NASDAQ:KLAC), ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) and Axcelis (NASDAQ:ACLS). They might also be some positive read-through for OLED materials and IP provider Universal Display (NASDAQ:OLED) and for industrial laser supplier Coherent (NASDAQ:COHR), which has strong OLED exposure.Brocade slumps after issuing weak FQ3 guidance, blames weak storage demand - In case you needed another datapoint indicating enterprise storage demand is weak - see also EMC and NetApp's recent numbers - Brocade (NASDAQ:BRCD) provided it. Thanks to weak storage networking (""SAN"") hardware demand, Brocade (issued an April quarter warning two weeks ago) is guiding for revenue to be down 6% Y/Y in FQ3 (the July quarter) at the midpoint of its range, not counting the impact of the pending Ruckus Wireless (NYSE:RKUS) acquisition. On the bright side, IP networking hardware revenue is expected to rebound in FQ3, and the Ruckus deal will lower Brocade's exposure to a SAN market pressured both by industry weakness and adoption of alternative storage architectures.Samsung Pay will work with Alipay - With Alipay a colossal force in the Chinese online payments market - it claims 450M registered Chinese users, and is only rivaled in China by Tencent's (OTCPK:TCEHY) WeChat Pay - it makes a lot of sense for Samsung Pay (enables in-store mobile payments, including via traditional magnetic stripe point-of-sale terminals) to partner with Alipay. There isn't yet a similar integration deal for Apple Pay.Uber tests a self-driving car in Pittsburgh - Uber's (NYSE:UBER) car, a modified Ford Fusion, is both collecting mapping data and ""testing its self-driving capabilities."" It relies on radar, laser scanners and high-res cameras, and follows an R&D partnership with Carnegie Mellon. Uber proclaims it thinks self-driving cars will eventually ""mean less congestion, more affordable and accessible transportation, and far fewer lives lost in car accidents.""They could also, of course, lower the ride-sharing leader's dependence on human drivers. The volumes of real-world driving data Uber has collected could help it successfully deploy a fleet of autonomous vehicles over the long run, whether those cars use Uber's own self-driving technology or that of third parties such as Google and incumbent automakers. There's speculation Apple's $1B investment in top Chinese ride-sharing provider Didi Chuxing was done in part to strengthen its autonomous driving efforts, particularly given China's embrace of the technology. Rival Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) has a self-driving car partnership with GM.Uber's self-driving car prototypeServiceNow expands into cloud customer service software, takes on Oracle and Salesforce - ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has become a top player in the cloud IT service management (""ITSM"") software space via cloud-based offerings that have taken share from on-premise software from the likes of HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA), and has gradually expanded into the broader IT operations management (""ITOM"") software space. It's now taking on customer service software incumbents such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) with a product differentiated by creating a closed-loop process that covers both engaging with customers (as traditional apps do) and resolving issues via collaboration with engineers, field service workers and others. A ServiceNow VP: ""It's a $9 billion market where no traditional vendor has 20 percent of the market.""Notable Tech Commentary And ReportsPayPal argues it can address over $100T worth of transactions - ""We're about a $10 billion business going after a $100 trillion market. It order to do that, we need to change our value proposition,"" said PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) CEO Dan Schulman at his company's analyst day. Worth noting: PayPal's 2015 payment volume was actually $81.5B (+23% Y/Y), from which the company derived $2.6B in revenue (+17%).Regardless, PayPal still only accounts for a small portion of the non-cash transaction activity of its average user. The online payments giant argues it can benefit from a ""flywheel effect"" in which greater consumer reliance on PayPal's services strengthens its merchant ties and vice versa. It's looking to up-sell merchants on services such as loyalty programs, in-store purchases and financing, while boosting consumer usage via its mobile-friendly One Touch checkout option (lets consumers avoid having to re-enter their login, billing and shipping info). Apple Pay, Stripe (used for payments within Facebook and Twitter's apps) and others also provide fairly painless approaches to paying on smartphones/tablets.Deutsche: iPhone prices are often much higher overseas - Among other things, Deutsche found an iPhone 6 costs (relative to the U.S.) 56% more in Brazil, 31% more in India, 22% more in France and Germany and 16% more in China. Local taxes and tariffs tend to be the biggest culprit. The figures provide some additional context to Apple's efforts to move downmarket by launching the iPhone SE (starts at $399 in the U.S.) and trying to sell used iPhones in emerging markets.Prices for the same iPhone 6 model in various marketsIDC: Chromebook sales top Mac sales in U.S. for first time - With IDC having estimated Q1 U.S. Mac shipments totaled 1.77M (+5.6% Y/Y and good for a 13% unit share), the firm's comments might mean Chromebook shipments were around 2M (unit share around 15%?). One big caveat: Macs are still likely well ahead of Chromebooks in terms of U.S. revenue, given Apple had a calendar Q1 Mac ASP of $1,266 and most Chromebooks are sub-$300 devices.IDC's remarks do, however, show how Chromebooks have been grabbing share from low-end Windows devices, thanks to a strong position in the education (K-12) vertical. And the September arrival of Android apps on Chrome OS could provide a fresh boost.Pew: Only 15% of Americans have used ride-hailing apps and only 11% have used home-sharing services - Uber was valued at $62.5B in its latest funding round and Airbnb (AIRB) at $25.5B. But Pew Research's survey data suggests the vast majority of Americans have never used either. Those investing in the companies at current valuations are clearly betting on much higher long-term penetration rates, both in the U.S. and elsewhere.Also of interest: Pew found only 64% of those who use a ride-hailing service daily or weekly own a personal vehicle, compared with 78% of those who use one less frequently or not at all.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3987422,101696,2016-07-11T01:15:49-04:00,"PayPal has a dominant position within the industry with high barriers to entry.High levels of consumer recognition breeds trust and should improve adoption rates.Positioning throughout the payment value chain should help retain consumer funds within the PayPal ecosystem, increasing usage rates.","IntroductionIn our recent article, ""Brexit Could Be The Savior Of The U.S. Consumer"", we argued in favor of the future of consumer stocks, at least in the short term. Within the space, one of our preferred names is PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). PayPal has grown from being a mere button at the checkout of online retail platforms to a full-service financial provider. Its high levels of consumer recognition breads trust and should increase adoption rates, in our view, while its presence facilitating a variety of consumer payment needs should drive revenue and earnings growth.Brand RecognitionPayPal has been around since 1999, almost as long as the internet has been in consumer homes. Over that time, consumers have grown used to having and utilizing the service as a standard part of an e-commerce transaction. This was in no small way helped by the company's association with eBay in the formative years of e-commerce during the early 2000s. Having outpaced its parent in terms of earnings growth and split from eBay, we believe PayPal carries with it the brand recognition and first-mover advantage within the space. Shortly after its split from eBay, PayPal was recognized as one of the world's most valuable brands; while during its first Investor Day, management noted that the company had been voted the 3rd most recognizable financial services brand in the UK and the 3rd most recognizable brand OVERALL in Australia. We believe this high level of recognition breeds a sense of trust among consumers, leaving them disposed to increasing usage of the platform as the number of merchants and methods of accessing funds increases. We believe this is reflected in the 11% year-on-year (YoY) increase in customer accounts in Q1/16 and the 26% YoY increase in Total Payment Value processed by the company.Presence through the value chainCritical to PayPal successfully reaching its goal of increasing usage from 2-3 times per month to weekly and, ultimately, daily is facilitating the platform's use in a variety of situations, not just on e-commerce checkouts. To this end, the company has made several key acquisitions in recent years, namely Braintree ($800 million in 2013), Venmo ($26.2 million in 2012) and Paydiant ($280 million in 2015). As the graphic below illustrates, PayPal is offering users a great number of ways to deposit and subsequently utilize funds on the platform. Partnering with banks to allow cash withdraws from ATMs, retailers to allow deposits onto a PayPal account, and facilitating mobile point-of-sale transactions greatly improves the functionality of the service. This, in turn, should feed through to high Total Payment Value and, by extension, profitability.First-Mover AdvantageAs outlined above, PayPal benefits from high levels of consumer recognition, inherently breeding a sense of trust (consumers will be reluctant to leave their financial security in the hands of untrustworthy companies or people). Coupled with the extensions the company has made to its distribution network, we believe this should translate to high levels of customer loyalty. Although switching costs to competitors are low, these same rivals do not have the equivalent reach of PayPal, nor the name recognition. As such, we believe a consumer would need to have an exceptionally poor service experience with the company to motivate them to swap exclusively to competitors - for example, of the magnitude of a security breach. Moreover, the regulatory requirements to operate in 203 markets in over 100 currencies, although not insurmountable, pose a significant impediment for competitors, requiring substantial time and investment, but already completed by PayPal.Attractiveness to MerchantsWhen a merchant is deciding which payment methods to accept, they will naturally be drawn to those which will appeal to the widest audience. We see PayPal as the obvious choice in this regard, given its wider brand recognition and high trustworthy reputation. PayPal is now accepted in over 200 countries around the world - again, the regulatory hurdles that must be overcome to achieve this should not be underestimated, and add a key barrier to entry for competitors. The substantial issue for merchants trying to sell online can be consumers browsing for products online, but not transacting online. Instead, a consumer may find the item online and then shop in-store. This creates two key issues from the sellers perspective, namely:A substantial reason for the low conversion of online shopping to online sale has been the advent of mobiles and touchscreens. Conversion rates tend to be substantially lower for smartphones and tablets versus desktop because of the relative ease of inputting information using a keyboard versus small touchscreens on mobile devices. Inputting delivery address, card data, etc. on a small touchscreen is exceptionally cumbersome and puts shoppers off. In tests, PayPal has discovered that inputting this data on a mobile device takes over 2 minutes, on average, and over 1 minute on a laptop/PC. To address the issue, the company has released ""OneTouch"", which does exactly what it sounds like and allows users to complete the same transaction in 11 seconds. PayPal executives demonstrated the claim during the recent Investor Day. We believe this convenience should substantially increase conversion rates on mobile devices - an essential progression given the rise of the mobile device versus declines in PC sales.Conclusion and ValuationThe stock is trading at just 12x 2017 Bloomberg consensus EV/EBITDA, exceptionally cheap, in our view, given that EBITDA is expected to grow 17% in the year, with ample room to outperform given the secular shift to mobile and online commerce. We view PayPal's first-mover, dominant position within the industry, coupled with its high levels of consumer recognition, trust and loyalty, as well as the high regulatory and technological barriers to entry as being key drivers of earnings in the future."

PayPal is dedicated to its ""New Money"" vision through a wide range of payment solutions including PayPal, PayPal Credit, Venmo, Braintree and Xoom products. PayPal's payments platform enables consumers, merchants, friends and family to access and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform, through any device and eventually in any context.Recommendation: I believe that PYPL is the best way to invest in the growth of mobile payments and mobile commerce over the coming years. PayPal has all of the attributes of a long-term winner in the $563 billion global mobile payments market - first-mover advantage, significant scale of its two-sided network, timely acquisitions that would now be much more expensive to replicate, and a brand name with customer trust (something very important considering the sensitive nature of online payments and fraud concerns).Since its spin-off, the stock price has come under pressure, which can be attributed to the three prevailing perception gaps on the market in terms of competition, growth sustainability and margin of safety. In my opinion, PayPal has diversified away from big competitors and is becoming a ""mobile commerce platform"" that differentiates itself from its ""mobile payment"" peers. Because of this misperception, I believe investors are missing several hidden opportunities.INVESTMENT THESISRISKS TO THESISCATALYSTSINDUSTRY OVERVIEWThe global mobile payments industry has rapidly grown, with a CARG from 2011-2017 exceeding 38%, driven by a significant shift from e-commerce to mobile commerce. The 2015 PayPal's research in conjunction with Ipsos shows that mobile commerce growth outpaced e-commerce growth 3-to-1, CAGR from 2013-2016 42% and 13% respectively.In the US, the mobile transaction share grows from 27% to 31% in 4Q2014 vs. 3Q2015 for average retailers, and from 35% to 44% for top quartile retailers. Comparing with Asia (~50%) and the UK (46%), the US has plenty of room to grow. Forrester forecasts that, by 2020, Mobile commerce will have grown to account for over 50% of all digital transactions globally. Source: Criteo's 3Q15 & 4Q14 State of Mobile Commerce ReportImpact on PYPL: PYPL is the biggest beneficiary from the increasing penetration of mobile payments and the shift to mobile commerce, not only because of its current mobile payments capabilities but also its leading position in the next generation of mobile commerce namely contextual commerce.INVESTMENT THESIS1. PayPal is a collection of attractive assets, and its growth is accelerating through its diversified assets including Braintree, Venmo and XoomBraintree was founded in 2007. It possesses leading tokenization technology and one-stop payment capabilities for both mobile apps and websites. Braintree has been PayPal's best asset since its acquisition in 2013. Braintree's technology fueled PayPal's One-Touch and itself serves those merchants from sharing economy and ""in-app"" economy.One-Touch simplified the checking-out process and allows consumers to pay with One-Touch across different devices and merchants. One-Touch is PayPal's innovation at its core, and so far has been adopted by 21 million users with 4.9 billion payments in 2015. According to a study by comStore, One-Touch sets PayPal apart from other competitors with a conversion rate as high as 87.5% compared to 51.1% for Visa (NYSE:V) Checkout, and 45.6% for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA).Braintree itself remains a growth engine that cards on file and authorized payments volume grow at 111% and 119% y/y respectively. The growth is attributed to the new economy (such as OpenTable, Uber (NYSE:UBER), Airbnb (AIRB), LivingSocial, Rovio, HotelTonight, Pinterest) as well as its unparalleled tokenization technology. After Braintree became part of PayPal, it is essentially dedicated to enable seamless payment transactions, and thus remains at the heart of many notable companies' mobile offerings, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger's in-app Uber requests, and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) in-app payments. Based on my estimation, Braintree will contribute nearly one-third revenue by 2018.Venmo and Xoom are P2P payment solutions for friends, families and worldwide. With the kickoff of Venmo monetization (2.1B out of 16.5B mobile payments), we expect to see a less-dilutive take rate from Venmo in the future. When 10M merchants accept ""Pay with Venmo"" by the end of 2016, Venmo will be a ""full-scale"" mobile wallet. If Venmo's growth rate is sustainable, and consumers have 20% Venmo balance is spent with merchants, by 2018, Venmo's revenue contribution will be as material as 14% of PayPal's total revenue.XOOM represents an enormous cross-order P2P market that PayPal tapped in recently. XOOM is a leading digital operator in the global remittances market, serving 1.6 million users in 30 markets and 31,000 payout locations. XOOM enables customers to send money internationally, typically charging $5 to $10 depending on the size of the exchange, as well as pocketing the difference in the exchange rates it sets. Considering PayPal's 180 million users across 200 markets vs. Xoom's 1.6 million users in 30 markets, the cross-selling opportunities are indeed compelling. With Xoom scaling up on the PayPal platform, you won't be surprised when PayPal offers consumers a button ""Pay with Xoom.""Impact on PYPL: Regardless of what business PayPal acquires or invests, from Venmo, Xoom, the latest announced Acorns ($30M micro-investing App) and a lot more in its pipeline, PayPal's consistent core strategy is to acquire digital native businesses at a reasonable price, ramp up users quickly, execute through business integration and finally monetize from the merchant's side. With PayPal's extremely strong two-sided network, this strategy is consistently viable.2. PayPal is transitioning to a mobile commerce platform - however, the market is discounting it in a super crowded payments universe, which indicates a wide margin of safetyPayPal is currently trading in line with its payments peers such as Visa and MasterCard. However, its unique position in enabling mobile commerce and its leading the way in contextual commerce deserves a higher premium. Contextual commerce in my view is the potentially game-changing idea that merchants can eventually implement purchase opportunities anywhere and consumers can buy anywhere anytime. This is essentially seamless commerce.Braintree has been an early mover since it powered Pinterest's buyable button. In December 2015, Braintree, Facebook Messenger, and Uber had another nice try that allowed users to book an Uber ride via Facebook messenger. This stands for only a particular example of contextual commerce. However, the implications are crucial: first, Braintree is the enabler of contextual commerce as it fulfills the seamless payment transactions at the backend; second, social media providers are into contextual commerce, and Braintree will be able to expand in the B2B markets through partnerships with all the future contextual commerce pioneers.Besides working in the background, with PayPal acquiring Modest (building Apps, integrating Apps, buy-button into Apps, order management), PayPal now has the end-to-end capabilities to power its industry first contextual commerce platform and attract more and more e-tailors.In order to visualize the future effect of contextual commerce, let's take a step back thinking about PayPal's 10 million merchants and 180 million consumers. Mobile makes technology universal, and contextual commerce is making commerce universal by connecting every consumer and every merchant in various contexts. That said, PayPal's contextual commerce is as big as 10 million merchants multiplied by 179 million consumers. On top of this massive network, Braintree and Modest will be exceptionally transformative for PayPal's future.Impact to PYPL: The market doubts the sustainability of PayPal's double-digit growth by narrowing PayPal's battlefield down to payments; however, the future growth will be instead driven by the secular growth of mobile commerce. As a strategic partner that enables seamless transaction in any app, from any device and on any platform, PayPal will benefit from all its business partners' endeavors towards contextual commerce.3. PayPal, on top of its strong two-sided network, is ramping up its ecosystem that will grow its bottom line through funding-mix improvementPayments is a hard business. For example, Square (NYSE:SQ) currently has 45% Credit (funding cost 300bps) and 55% Debit (funding cost 80bps) mix, which leads to a 64.8% transaction cost. PayPal's economics look better that it has nearly 2x of Square's transaction margin, which PayPal is not satisfied with. Instead, PayPal has an awesome game plan to make Payments a more profitable business. The past years, PayPal worked as a strong business consolidator (acquired Modest, XOOM, Paydiant, Braintree & Venmo, Bill Me Later etc.) hoping to enable money movement and money management across the globe. This is essentially the innovative way for PayPal doing its Payments business, because with the expansion of PayPal's ecosystem, PayPal can significantly improve its funding mix through an increasing funding within PayPal.In the following table, I simulated the future funding mix of PayPal, assuming its diverse portfolio (such as Venmo, PayPal Credit) is able to change the funding mix. The conclusion is, with the expansion of PayPal's ecosystem, the future transaction margin is expected to increase by 119bps or 270bps, which will possibly turn around the take rate's downward trend. (Please note the calculation of the take rate did not take Braintree's and Venmo's dilutive effect into account. The numbers may not represent the accurate forecast of the future take rate. However, the transaction margin increase is significant.)Impact on PYPL: Take rate going down has been an increasing concern for investors, which is unavoidable with PayPal's strategy tilt to larger merchants with strong bargaining power and its focus on ramping up users without immediate monetization. However, with a stronger and stronger PayPal ecosystem being established, I expect PayPal's take rate will reverse.KEY ASSUMPTIONS AND VALUATIONTo value PYPL, I used the blended valuation of a five-year DCF with 15x EV/EBITDA exit multiple and 25x P/E on CY:17 estimates. Different assumptions have been applied in three cases in the following table.CONCLUSIONIn a nutshell, PayPal is not only a market leader in payments, but also a platform that has become an early mover and consolidator in the future global ""mobile commerce."" Given its strong balance sheet ($6 Bn in cash), PayPal will have the flexibility to acquire more businesses to further expand its capacities in mobile payments and mobile commerce. I see that the attributes PayPal possesses give it the capability to become the long-term leader in the space. I expect PayPal to present a very positive financial performance for 1Q2016 that is convincing to investors followed by an impressive stock price upside.(Editors' Note: This is a republication of an entry in the Sohn Investment Idea Contest.

Hasan AbidThe payment landscape is evolving rapidly as more people are adopting mobile devices, owing to which digitization of money is on the rise. Individuals, above all, are looking for trusted payment solutions and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in this regard stands out. In my last article (read it here) on PayPal, I discussed numerous factors behind the success of this ever-growing payments platform and why so many merchants and consumers globally are drawn to PayPal. These factors include ease of access, reliability and higher conversion rates. Keeping those qualitative considerations in mind, this time I look at PayPal from a valuation perspective.Sporting a rich forward P/E multiple of 21.3x vs. the average P/E of 16.8x for the credit services industry, PayPal doesn't look cheap on a relative basis. Some would argue that the shares are almost priced for perfection considering the company's TTM P/E of 33.9x, which implies that, assuming price remains unchanged, the market is expecting a ~59% increase in earnings. These are high expectations, even though PayPal has a history of beating analysts' EPS estimates.(Source: Yahoo Finance)So is PayPal worth buying? To answer this question, I value PayPal's stock using a five-year DCF model, modeling for 2.5% terminal FCF growth rate. My model uses WACC, calculated using CAPM, as the discount rate.I forecast PayPal's consolidated net revenue in a slightly unconventional way. My projections are based on the somewhat obvious notion that growth in Total Payment Volume (TPV) is the best predictor for growth in total revenue. Indeed, growth in TPV is conducive to growth in transaction revenue which constitutes nearly 88% of PayPal's net revenue.As a starting point, I have plotted TPV against net revenue for quarterly data available from 2014 onwards.(Source: Company's 10-Q filings, graph made by author using Eviews)Below is another chart depicting the y/y change in TPV and net revenue.(Source: Company's 10-Q filings)Now to pin down an approximate relationship between net revenue and TPV, I regress the y/y change in net revenue on y/y change in TPV for Q1 2015 to Q1 2016. The precise equation between the two variables can be seen in the chart below. This equation, while far from being an authoritative predictive tool, can still be used to make reasonably good forecasts. I'll explain how it works:So say if in a particular quarter (or year) TPV grows year-over-year by 15%, then according to my equation y/y revenue growth will be: (0.4231 × 0.15 + 0.068) × 100 = ~13%. To demonstrate that it can actually do a good job of predicting the growth in net revenue, I'll walk you through two examples. In 2014, the y/y growth in net revenue was 19%, while as per my equation it should have been ~18%, based on that year's y/y TPV growth of 26%. So the difference is not too big. As for 2015, a y/y TPV growth rate of 20% yielded a perfect estimate of ~15% y/y increase in net revenue.(Source: Company's 10-Q filings, author's calculations)(Source: Investor Relations)Going forward I expect PayPal's TPV to keep growing, albeit not at an increasing rate. Braintree, being an all-in-one mobile payment solution, should drive mobile payment volume and attract more merchants. With the addition of more merchants, PayPal should become a more valuable payments platform. Venmo, the popular and rapidly expanding peer-to-peer payments app, is yet another catalyst that will help PayPal's top line immensely. PayPal is yet to fully unlock Venmo's potential as the P2P economy is still growing and has great growth prospects. Plus, Venmo is particularly attractive for millennials who like the app's compatibility with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).(Source: Investor Relations)For fiscal 2016, I project PayPal's TPV y/y growth to be 22%, just in line with the average of the growth experienced in the last two years, but nonetheless higher than the y/y growth achieved in fiscal 2015. One of the reasons I'm expecting TPV growth to be higher this year than last year is because of the successful integration of Xoom. Xoom is an innovator in remittances and should expand to 13 countries this year including Nigeria and Slovakia, which will help PayPal expand not only its global footprint but also its mobile business.For fiscal 2017, I estimate TPV y/y growth to be 20% and beyond that I anticipate the annual growth rate of TPV to slow down to 15%. Using the equation discussed earlier, we have the following y/y revenue growth rates:Hence my revenue projections are:(All figures in millions)Historically PayPal's EBITDA margin has stayed in the range of 20-23%. For the period 2016-20, I assume EBITDA margin running close to 27%, slightly above this historical range primarily because volume driven expenses are offset by leverage in other operating expenses. Other projections for my model, including projections of D&A, capital expenditures and net working capital have been made in line with historical data.According to the calculations shown above, we get PayPal's market value of equity equal to ~$50 billion in the ""mid"" scenario by subtracting the market value of debt ($0 in this case) and adding back cash and investments to enterprise value. Dividing this figure by the diluted shares outstanding, we get a fair value of $40.93, representing an upside of 9.1% from the closing price on 20th May 2016.ConclusionAlthough PayPal's stock may not look too cheap on a relative basis, I firmly believe that at present it is undervalued and worth buying. On a slightly cautious note, my model certainly has its limitations because it relies on past data. In the future, the relationship between PayPal's TPV and net revenues could change if a significantly higher portion of TPV is generated by large merchants or if there's a considerable rise in person-to-person transactions from Venmo. In coming years, PayPal also must revamp its developer tools and improve ease of implementation to extend its competitive advantage in the online payment space. In any case, I remain bullish on PayPal because this is a company moving in the right direction and one that has a unique business model along with very good risk management policies."
3982538,25218,2016-06-16T15:36:44-04:00,It has been almost a year since PayPal split from eBay.The share price has gone nowhere over the last year.Competition is increasing and PayPal needs to do something other than buy back stock.,"It has been almost one year since PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) was freed from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and everyone [including myself] had the feeling that with the strong growth that PayPal had, the share price would increase. However, that has not been the case as shares have PayPal have gone nowhere over the last year, which leads to the question of where is the share price appreciation?Chart from Google FinanceBuybacksEarlier this year, PayPal instituted a $2 billion share repurchase program and in the most recent quarter, it was noted that they purchased 17 million shares at an average of $35/share, which totals $595 million. Over the last twelve months, PayPal has generated $2.08 billion in free cash flow according to Gurufocus financials. Simply put, PayPal is using almost all of its free cash flows for share repurchases, which given the competitive landscape I will touch on below shows this might not be the best time to repurchase shares.With the current price of the stock at $36.84, buying a bunch of stock at $35 seems like a good idea, however, by using those funds for buybacks, PayPal is risking that the competition catches them.CompetitionJust yesterday, an article by IBD, noted that at its WWDC, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled they would have Apple Pay available on Safari mobile browser, an Apple Pay option for Mac users, which would compete with PayPal and Square Cash (NYSE:SQ) peer-to-peer money transfers through its iMessaging App , which competes with PayPal's Venmo.Then there could be competition from PayPal's frenemy, Visa (NYSE:V). At a recent technology and media conference the CEO of Visa made the following statements. Simply put Visa drives a lot of business to Visa however, the CEO went on to basically say that unless the model changes, PayPal will become more of an enemy than a friend. The key takeaway from the following second quote is that if Visa wanted to, they could compete with PayPal on a large scale, which would be a serious threat to PayPal.""PayPal's historic model on the one hand 50% of the volume isACH, the other 50% is general purpose cards of which were half of it. So they drive a lot of business our way that supposedly the friend part of it. The foe part is where they then use historically those transactions to do everything they can to get those to ACH where we and our clients get disintermediated from the transaction the entire experience and it causes tremendous customer service problems for the bank specifically."" [CEO Quote from technology & media conference transcript]""We'd love to figure out a different model with them where it's consumer choice first where they are not disintermediating, if we can figure that out with them great we'll think of them more as a partner they need to do things differently in order to do that. The other door is where we go full steam and compete with them in ways that people have never seen before because you've never seen us go target PayPal in the marketplace in any meaningful way."" [CEO Quote from technology & media conference transcript]Xoom AcquisitionI was not impressed with the Xoom deal because they paid $890 million for a business that only generated $177 million in revenues in the 12 months prior to the acquisition. In addition, Xoom is unprofitable and has lower margins than PayPal has. As much as i am not a fan of buybacks for PayPal, I would have rather them used the $890 million for buybacks instead of purchasing a money losing, low margin business. With the Xoom acquisition there is some political risk as well, if Donald Trump were to win the election and his plan of potentially stopping remittances from individuals in the United States to Mexico were to gain traction, which would have an impact on PayPal and Xoom.What can PayPal do to increase the share price?PayPal has two options to increase the share price. The first option is to stop tip toeing around Visa, either make a move to build their relationship with Visa or go after them 100%. Being their frenemy has not helped the share price of over the last year and with ever-increasing competition, PayPal needs to make a decision on this matter. Visa already owns a stake in Square as well as competing payments company Stripe (STRIP). This shows that Visa has the potential take on PayPal through its stakes and partnerships with Square & Stripe as well as their own Visa Checkout option.Chart linkThe second option PayPal has is to acquire other prominent payments providers given the company has $6.4 billion in cash and no debt. If you look at the chart above, you can see that PayPal & Braintree, which is owned by PayPal, dominate the market. However, as Stripe and others have grown they have taken share from PayPal, this is where PayPal with its cash hoard could have an opportunity to gain market lost market share. To me the most appealing acquisition target would be Stripe because of its market share and the customers they have.In a Fortune article last July, Stripe raised funding at a $5 billion valuation, which even if that valuation is doubled for an acquisition by PayPal, with $6.4 billion in cash and strong free cash flow generation, PayPal could afford to purchase Stripe. Also noted in the article, was the fact that Stripe was a preferred partner on Apple Pay and does the buy buttons for Pinterest (PINIT), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). In addition, Stripe made a deal with Alipay, which is the largest digital wallet company in China, which is a huge opportunity for Stripe and could be for PayPal as well if they were to acquire Stripe.Closing ThoughtsIn closing, while I am currently long PayPal, I see numerous competitive forces arising that will lead to PayPal losing more market share if they do not do something about it. If PayPal does not make a move and stands pat with their current strategy using free cash flow for buybacks instead of fending off serious competition, then I will most likely dump shares of PayPal sometime in the future.Disclaimer: See here."

Although I believe the stock market is headed for a bumpy ride, this company should continue to find success for many years.Trust Your InstinctsAs investors, many times we worry too much about certain ratios, the underlying value and hype around a company. Yet, we forget that investing can be simpler than we think. One of the first books I read for investing was Peter Lynch's ""Beating the Street"". Two statements from this book that had an impact on me still hold true today. The first was Peter stating that accountants and mathematicians aren't the richest people in the world, thus investing shouldn't be based solely on financials. The second was Peter expressing industry dominance and how a company that controls their industry is usually a safe bet. I should've remembered these statements years ago when I was skeptical about investing a large sum of money in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Was it overvalued at the time at $150 a share? Yes, it was. But instead of trusting my instincts to invest in Amazon, I sought council from an experienced and successful friend who suggested staying away from Amazon. Unfortunately, I did not invest and missed out on a great opportunity. From this experience, I learned a great lesson as an investor: trust your instincts. That is why I am bullish on PayPal and believe this is a great time to buy. To make things simple, this company has a great business model and has a clear path to keeping it's position in this industry. Global growth potential for PayPal is great, and will only become better as time goes on. PayPal will continue to lead the way for safer transactions and will shape the way the world handles money. This company also has some great partnerships and has market penetration in multiple countries.Industry Dominance and GrowthPayPal has a brand unlike any other in its industry. Not only is PayPal considered a safer method for online money transfers, but it can be used for virtually any transaction. Amazon had noticed the success PayPal achieved, thus ending the use of PayPal in the Amazon marketplace. Yet, this was when PayPal was still combined with Amazon's competitor eBay. Now that these two have split from one another, there is potential for a future partnership with Amazon. But, even if PayPal never strikes a deal with Amazon, they still have a partnership with Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). These are steps PayPal has taken to grow their business globally and it is assuring to see them open a new door of opportunity when another one closed. I didn't find it shocking to see that PayPal has over 60% of market dominance, with the next competitor being ""Stripe"" (a company I have never heard of prior to researching this industry). That is the kind of influence PayPal has over it's consumers. It holds such a command in it's industry that it makes you question, ""Who is the other guy?"". With a solid track record of beating earnings, its hard to imagine why they wouldn't be the industry leader. First quarter results for PayPal were very strong with revenue up 19% and net income increased 43% to 365 million. As an established brand, their customer base continues to grow, with an additional 4.5 million active customers added in Q1 2016 and 185 million active users overall. Although these numbers are impressive, they have yet to scratch the surface of available users globally. Recently, PayPal has partnered with Vodafone, allowing them to penetrate the mobile side of their business in Europe, which will lead to significant growth. PayPal also offers financing for large purchases and is so widely used around the world, that stores use PayPal for all their transactions. With continued outreach to merchants, PayPal added 14 million to their platform within the first quarter alone. This global outreach reflects PayPal's P/E ratio, which is 36.04. I believe this ratio is fine considering there is substantial growth within the company and industry as a whole.The 50MA chart above is showing signs of an upwards trend and supports a bullish tone.VenmoAs a college student, I can assure you that Venmo is the go to app for online transactions among millennials. Once millennials are hooked on a certain app, there is little chance they will abandon the current software for a new one. There are only a handful of students I personally know that do not use Venmo, which is due only to security fears. Yet, most of those who were fearful have made the transition to use Venmo. Millennials would rather use their smartphone than carry cash and it is a real trend I have noticed. There is no charge for these transactions and it uses a social platform to make money transfers ""fun"". I've met landlords that are using Venmo to accept rent from students, which means this isn't just a millennial fad, this has potential to be used by established businesses as well. This application is able to reach all demographics through its simplicity. After showing my mother Venmo, she has taken a liking to the app and uses it regularly. This personal experience matters because for the most part, I am an exception to the stereotype of that fits millennials. I am a millennial that dislikes social media and uses it on occasion. Yet, I have to say, I do love to use Venmo for multiple transactions. The increasing use of Venmo is evident in PayPal's Q1 2016 report, which shows that Venmo processed $3.2 billion total payment volume, up 154% YOY. It's safe to say that this purchase by PayPal has paid off and will continue to add value to their company. Trust your instincts, and think long term because this company has potential to be a great long term buy for investors."

When it says jump, processors ask how high. But it doesn't run the whole waterfront. Automated Clearing House, or ACH, transactions don't go through the Visa-led payment and debit networks.ACH is also cheaper for consumers who don't have to pay Visa processing fees, so PayPal has long encouraged people to recharge their PayPal accounts directly with ACH transactions. Scharf does not like this, and says that if PayPal doesn't start offering ""consumer choice whether or not disintermediating,"" then Visa could ""go full steam and compete with them in ways that people have never seen before.""Cut through the passive-aggressiveness and Visa is signaling that its networks are hungry for the market PayPal has created. ACH is PayPal's price advantage, and how it gives consumers and small merchants a good deal. If a merchant goes through the Visa system, they may get just 97.5 cents on the dollar, depending on their credit rating. If they go through PayPal, they get nearly 100 cents, and they don't have to go through a credit check to get that deal.What could Visa do in response? It could do things that make competitive sense, like offering discounts on more secure payment methods, like fingerprint technology or chip-and-pin, where loss ratios are lower. It could get more aggressive in e-commerce, telling merchants they can take Visa Checkout or PayPal, but not both. Or it could create its own version of PayPal.None of these moves, by themselves, is going to impact a company with $9.2 billion in revenue, growing at 15% per year. But they could have a chilling effect on the stock, which is currently valued at about 35 times earnings, against about 30 for Visa.Since coming out of the umbrella of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) last July, PayPal has been a so-so performer in the market, delivering a gain of 5.5% on equity, but no dividends. Visa is up 16%, and the stock even yields 1.7% at current prices, and some of the processors that link to it have done even better.It's the pressure of those processors, like Vantiv (VNTV), for new revenue streams that are going to be driving Visa's decisions, not its stance toward PayPal and ACH. Those processors are very, very hungry."

It is true that from a value perspective, a current PE of 34 and an estimated PE of 25 aren't exactly cheap. Still, I can't help to think that investors are not pricing correctly the new consumer shopping trends, PayPal's leadership in those markets, the company's track record, nor the possibility of being once again a takeover target.Growing MarketA multi-country study shows that online commerce is expected to grow by 13% compounded annually while mobile commerce is expected to increase by 42% compounded annually over the coming years on average.Source: PayPal Investor PresentationI'm certain that nobody doubts this trend will ""grow on"" for years as millennials grow up and increase their consumer spending, as baby boomers get used to this new way of shopping, as international trade taxes shrink or disappear (coming soon the US and EU trade agreement), as deliveries become faster and as mobile devices get even more widespread and used in payments.PayPal is the Market LeaderPayPal is the most widely accepted payment method for online sales (both domestically & cross border):Source: PayPal Investor PresentationIt accepts payments in 100 currencies and it allows to hold cash balances in 26 currencies. It's available both on a browser or on a mobile device. It's a well trusted brand. It's safe, convenient, easy and super quick to use. In fact, PayPal matches all the attributes you look for in a payment method and it comes with little surprise that it was the 41st most visited website in the world with over 19 million daily visits in 2015.PayPal FundamentalsDuring the first quarter PayPal grew in all fronts (revenue, number of users, transactions per user, number of transactions and mobile payments) when compared with the same quarter in 2015. Given the market trends we just saw, it will continue to post strong growth in the years to come:Source: PayPal Earnings PresentationThe bottom line results also came out better with an EPS growth in the first 3 months of 28% from a year ago to $0.37.During the first 3 months, it added powerful new merchants such as Air France, Crate and Barrel, Fresh Direct, Panera Bread, Sephora and Woolworths in Australia and extended its partnership with Alibaba to include new countries and additional merchants, ending the quarter with over 14 million active merchant accounts.On the technology front, there are a lot of exciting things happening, such as the ongoing Venmo's roll out, the new PayPal app (even simpler and more user friendly), the One Touch expansion to additional 121 markets and the partnership with Vodafone in Europe that will allow clients to fund payments with their smartphones at Visa contactless terminals using the Vodafone Wallet.Add to all these a light capital structure, a defensive profile, no debt (it actually ended the first quarter with $6.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments after generating $738 million of operating cash flow and $605 million of free cash flow in those 3 months), great margins (operating margins above 20% in the first quarter) and it's difficult not be excited about this company and at the same time very disappointed with the stock price behavior during the first 10 months.Takeover CandidateEither by itself, or as part of a bigger entity, the future looks promising for PayPal.Yes, I know, PayPal just got divorced from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), why should it rush into a new marriage? I'm not saying it would be the best path for PayPal, I actually think the company's independence is a strength and it's good for business because by remaining agnostic PayPal can work with all market players without suspicion: both with Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) or with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Still, there's no doubt that this success hasn't passed unnoticed to the major tech companies and there are certainly several candidates that wouldn't mind taking this bride to the alter.In fact, seeing from the number of similar services that are popping up across the board, from Apple Pay, to Android Pay, Samsung Pay (OTC:SSNLF) (OTC:SSNNF) or even Walmart Pay (NYSE:WMT) there's no doubt that some major players are interested in this market. But even for these big companies, developing from scratch such a widespread and accepted payment method will not only be a big investment as it will take a lot of time. Given that companies like Apple or Google have the necessary resources, wouldn't it be easier and perhaps more profitable for them to buy the market Leader before their competitor does so?In SummaryI'm disappointed with the stock return over these first few months. Still, I'm convinced that if PayPal continues delivering strong growth (and as we've seen there are several reasons for this to happen), sooner than later the company will unlock its true value.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The five reasons for PayPal's monopoly being unstable follow.Customer BaseWe already touched on this, but the customer base hates PayPal. A Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search for terms such as ""hate PayPal"" or ""PayPal sucks"" brings up tens of thousands of websites. A single question on Quora.com on PayPal began with two sentences but ended with over a dozen unique horror stories in dealing with PayPal. The question was:Anecdotes and answers come from buyers and sellers, and include comments such as:Clearly, the power PayPal wields over its clients is frightening, especially to entrepreneurs running their businesses through this platform. As a former copywriter, I've dealt with seemingly countless entrepreneurs, and I've never met one who preferred PayPal. On the contrary, many have gone out of their way to avoid PayPal all together.I also take payments through PayPal, and while I've never personally experienced any problems, I do have many around me who have problems.The last point is a particular weak point of PayPal, as it allows scammers who realize that PayPal does not refund money on digital products to make big promises and then not deliver.But anecdotes aside, one can make the argument that any big company has its fans and haters. Still, my relatively unscientific survey around the web shows that PayPal is not a loved company by any means. This is a major flaw to PayPal's monopoly.Should a competitor rise up against PayPal, many clients will switch boats. However, long-time sellers who have dealt with PayPal will find the transition difficult, as many platforms seamlessly integrate PayPal. Examples include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, the largest cloud service provider.Many PayPal users might feel ""stuck"" using PayPal. But this integration would be the only thing keeping them aboard - it's certainly not brand loyalty. Should a competitor make an alternative that is also easily integrated to the major web services, PayPal will be in danger.ScalabilityA competitor to PayPal will find it easy to scale. Pretty much any online Payment processor can go international at launch. We've seen similar scalability with Bitcoin processors and Google Wallet. It's just that these platforms did not take off for obvious reasons (difficulty of use for the former and lack of support for the latter).EntryEntry to the market would not be difficult. The main barrier to entry would be the funds upfront to acquire customers. Indeed, PayPal itself entered the market as a lean startup.To generate its customer base, PayPal gave cash incentives to its early adaptors. Once off the ground, PayPal became the only widespread choice for sending money through the Internet. Grabbing the plurality market share early, PayPal established its monopoly.A competitor would only need to mimic PayPal's game plan. After all, the blueprint is already written in the history of PayPal itself. Should anyone decide to take on this task, success is more of an inevitability than an uncertainty.ControlPayPal's control over its fees and margins are tighter than that of banks. If you have no other choice, you must accept the wide foreign exchange rates and high transaction fees. For a competitor, PayPal's fees are simply an upper limit.Should a competitor come in and offer lower fees and more reasonable forex rates to its customers, it can still hold significant margins. PayPal's EBITDA margin sits at 23% - double that of non-Japanese banks. A competitor can arrive in the market with competitive prices and still have a bank-like EBITDA margin.Another possibility is charging a flat rate, similar to how American Express (NYSE:AXP) disrupted the credit card market. There are many possibilities for a competitor to enter the market and still retain a large amount of control over its margins.NeedThere is a definite need for a competitor to PayPal in the industry. For one, PayPal has kicked out enough online retailers and self-employed people working remotely to where an alternative would be seen as a godsend. But also many of the current PayPal users are not happy about the fees and forex rates.The online marketplace would be happy to see some competition. And that competition would likely gain a large following at the outset, provided they can prove that they will be around for a while and have enough reach.ConclusionAlthough PayPal is a relatively new stock, the company itself is not new. PayPal has been a household name among those engaging in online commerce for over a decade. Many PayPal investors likely have experience with using PayPal or know the history and integration of the company well enough to see it as the clear market leader of online payments.And this is why I write this article: PayPal's monopoly - the one thing keeping it afloat - is fragile. Some investors might see the monopoly as permanent - it is not. Others might support PayPal because of the support received by Peter Thiel, who no longer makes decisions for the company.At any rate, despite being the clear market leader, PayPal has been trading at consolidation since its IPO. This is not the sign of a growing company. While the margins and customer base are stable, a competitor could easily throw a monkey wrench into the system.With no dividends and trading at consolidation, PayPal is not a clear buy. Instead, both investors and those on the sideline should realize that this is a sideways trending stock on a monopoly that has no immediate threats. We should employ sideways options strategies to benefit from this stock, while keeping a watchful eye on the industry, on the lookout for potential competitors.In the meantime, here's our play, based on a price target of $40 in July:Learn more about options at damonverial.com.Learn More about EarningsMy Exploiting Earnings premium subscription is now live, here on Seeking Alpha.

3925126,67313,2016-02-24T13:13:24-05:00,PYPL is partnering with AMX and VOD in mobile payment.Exposure to 700m subs is attractive. Ongoing investment in mobile app and services could drive user engagement and retention.Remain bullish on PYPL.,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) recently revealed new carrier partnerships and market expansion plans at the Mobile World Congress in what I believe are positive catalysts for the company's future expansion plans. In short, PYPL has teamed up with select carriers to integrate the payment platform into the telecom providers' phones, beginning with parts of Europe and Latin America.PYPL also announced that it will support near field communication available for Vodafone customers in Spain. With a combined subscriber base of ~740m, PYPL is looking to position itself against its bigger rivals such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). By focusing on Latin America and parts of Europe where its rivals are less penetrated, PYPL is looking to gain a dominant presence in those regions of the world. I remain bullish on PYPL given the company's attractive growth outlook in mobile payment.The recent revamp of its mobile app underscores my bullish view in that I believe the company is positioning itself ahead of the larger rivals in terms of O2O and M-commerce in services (i.e. food order). Judging by the trajectory of Asian mobile payment apps such as Alipay and Wepay, I would not be surprised to see PYPL taking a similar approach in driving its ecosystem.PYPL's decision to work with the carriers is a natural progression for the company to move beyond its traditional business model of processing payments over the website. Given how fast mobile payment is evolving, the nascent nature of the market and the lack of a clear leader in parts of the world (particularly Americas and Europe), PYPL has a fair chance to become a dominant player in the less penetrated regions of the world.Through its partnership with Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) and America Movil (NYSE:AMX), PYPL's customers could use their Android smartphones to make touch-less payments at Visa terminals in Spain, Mexico, and Brazil combined have an estimated 740m subs. Additionally, PYPL will also expand its presence in Africa through its Xoom money transfer business by allowing users to send money to M-Pesa users in Kenya.As a reminder, M-Pesa is the dominant mobile payment platform in Africa launched by Vodafone in 2007. The platform currently serves close to 25m users in 11 countries across Africa, Middle East and parts of Europe.From PYPL's perspective, partnership with carriers ensures a broad distribution platform for its mobile app. Although not immediately clear, I suspect that both Vodafone and America Movil will have PYPL's app preinstalled on their mobile phones. Additional marketing from PYPL on educating the convenience of the PYPL app in both retail locations and mobile could drive incremental adoption among the users.Although simple payments at the cash register or money transfer are the first level of payment, PYPL's integration of services such as food ordering could greatly expand its appeal to the consumers given the greater convenience over on-demand services.From the operators' perspective, their incentive in working with PYPL is to gain exposure to the mobile payment trend and potentially generate via revenue share agreement once there is greater clarity on the revenue profile. One revenue stream involves customer billing in which the purchase of digital content via PYPL can be added to the customer's bill for convenience. Once the customer pays off the bill, the portion that is paid via PYPL gets split between the carriers and PYPL.In short, the new mobile carrier partnerships are consistent with PYPL's strategy of expanding beyond payment processing over websites. A similar agreement with either AT&T (NYSE:T) or Verizon (NYSE:VZ) in North America could potentially be another catalyst for the stock."
3920336,67313,2016-02-23T11:25:41-05:00,PYPL overhauled its mobile app to make it more user friendly so it can compete against larger players such as AAPL and Android.Positive direction in embedding local services and wealth management into the app.Remain bullish on PYPL for its pace of innovation.,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) just did a massive overhaul of its mobile app, representing the first time in history that the company has rebuilt its app from scratch. I think it is a significant step for the payment company to position itself competitively against Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Android Pay (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). With the recent design overhaul, PYPL is focused on offering a more extensible framework that allows the app to add new features in the coming month that could extend across mobile e-commerce, mobile payment and P2P transfer.With a simplified and integrated mobile app experience, PYPL's app could potentially become Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) Alipay and Tencent's (OTCPK:TCEHY) WePay, which have seen tremendous success in China. I remain bullish on PYPL given its pace of innovation. While AAPL Pay and Android pay simply allow users to store accounts and pay at offline locations, PYPL's expansion into mobile e-commerce can be considered as a differentiated service offering that may lead to long-term customer acquisition and retention.PYPL's decision to overhaul its mobile app originated from feedback gathered from over 8,000 customer service reps. The most noticeable area that was revamped was the user experience in which PYPL's new app features a cleaner, more modern color scheme, iconography, fonts, and layout with simplified user navigation. The smooth browsing that allows users to quickly view their account balance, jump into their account or view their recent activity with just a tap within the app is an improvement relative to many bank-owned mobile apps and this is one key differentiation PYPL is able to achieve, in my view.Other features include expanded support for Android fingerprint authentication, separation of account activity by pending and completed transactions and the ability to add credit cards from other countries, but I think the most attractive feature is its ability to allow the users to order and pay for food delivery through the PYPL app. This is essentially the O2O service that is commonplace across China and widely used by companies such as BABA, Tencent and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). To my knowledge, PYPL is one of a few mobile apps that have tied service and payment on one platform and I would not be surprised to see PYPL partner with other merchants such as hairstylists, grocery stores, pharmacies and even QSR chains.Besides mobile payment, another focus PYPL has is on money management. Once again, this is essentially the same thing that Chinese mobile apps from BABA, Tencent and BIDU are doing. In a nutshell, the Chinese internet companies sell money-market funds to the users on their mobile payment app and interest earned is accumulated daily. The increased wealth effect encourages spending, and in this case, PYPL could see increased usage of its mobile app on food orders or other services. So far, PYPL is only focused on budget and goal setting but I expect the services will eventually be expanded.In short, I remain bullish on PYPL and its growth outlook in the mobile payment space. Although AAPL and Android are popular options, I think the market may not give PYPL enough credit given how advanced its mobile app is relative to others.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3970623,101535,2016-05-03T11:51:53-04:00,"Outstanding Q1 report last week.Earnings will accelerate going forward.PayPal trades with a large premium, but it's justified.","PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) digital and mobile payment platform provides an easier and safer way to make transactions between consumers and merchants. PayPal is used by businesses of all sizes and in both online and offline. PayPal is present in 203 different markets where merchants and consumers can use its different products such as PayPal Here, PayPal Credit, Xoom, Venmo and Braintree.While there is intense competition from such companies as Square (NYSE:SQ), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Alphabet GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the transformation from cash transactions to electronic/mobile and brand loyalty outweighs the majority of the risks since the addressable market is expanding rapidly.Brief overview of the last 15 yearsPayPal was first introduced as an email payment service between people in the late 1990s. They went public in 2002, but just after six months of trading it was acquired by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for $1.5 billion. In 2002, Paypal had 17.6 million users with $5.2 billion in total payment volume (TPV). In the next few years it expanded to 55 markets and in 2006 introduced text message payments. In 2006, users had increased to 37.6 million and TPV to $37.7 billion. At the height of the financial crisis in 2008, PayPal kept on growing, expanding to 190 markets and introduced the first mobile payment app for the iPhone. A year later it published social payment application Venmo, which is still growing rapidly today. Two years later users had grown to 94.4 million and TPV to $92 billion. In 2012, PayPal increased their presence in offline transactions with PayPal Here. Now merchants were able to use a significantly cheaper alternative to traditional cashier equipments such as IBM's (NYSE:IBM). In recent years PayPal acquired three important new companies Braintree, Paydiant and Xoom, expanded to 203 markets and rebranded Bill Me Later to PayPal Credit. Today PayPal has 184 million active users, TPV of $282 billion and market capitalization of $46 billion.Earnings accerelatingAfter the spin off, independent PayPal has increased thr growth rate and especially earnings. Looking at the growth metrics, they have been able to accelerate growth in every single one. User growth has increased from 10% to 11%, TPV has increased from 20% to 29%, revenue has increased from 14% to 19% and earnings per share from 28% to 43%. I expect that the growth will continue at similar levels going forward.Source: PayPal IR. GAAP figures growth rate YoY in percentages after the spin off.One metric that has decreased is transaction margins, however it's around the industry average of 60%. Even when they are growing revenue close to 20% they have managed to keep their expenses and losses flat.Source: PayPal 10-K. Transaction margin figures left, rest on the right.ValuationIn the first quarter report, PayPal reiterated their guidance for 2016. They are expecting revenue to grow 16% to 19% or $10.5 to 10.7 billion and earnings per share in non-GAAP to be at $1.45 to $1.50. PayPal is trading at $39 a share this morning, so the forward price to earnings ratio sets at around 26. Considering the GAAP earnings it would be around 35. Clearly a large premium to the overall market and it reflects the earnings potential and the Street's expectations for PayPal.These figures are for reference to how would the financials look if PayPal keeps growing at the similar pace. It's unlikely that revenue will keep growing at a 20% annual rate for the next five years, but more like 15% or slightly less. However I'm confident that PayPal is able to grow earnings at a way more rapid pace.PayPal's balance sheet is rock solid. In Q1/16 they had $4.8 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1.6 billion in long-term investments. They are debt free and generated $1.8 billion in free cash flow in FY2015. With financial strength they are able to fund any future growth projects (R&D or M&A) easily without the need for debt unless it's a big one.PayPal announced a $2 billion share repurchase program in the Q4 report to spend some of that idle cash. They bought 17 million shares in Q1 at an average price of $35, so there's still 70% left or $1.4 billion. I'm also curious about the possibility that PayPal would start to distribute some of the earnings as dividends in the next five years. Average payout ratio for payment services companies is around 20% meaning that in 2020 they could potentially distribute around 50 cents per share. It would yield around 1.2% and wouldn't be a income investors top choice but a great way to attract larger investor base. I'm a big fan of companies that return value to shareholders in both repurchasing the stock and in dividend form, but it's unusual for growth companies.ConclusionsThe way we pay for our products and services have and will continue to change. It's PayPal's mission to provide us the means to have the easiest and safest way to make the transactions. I use PayPal weekly and have owned the stock after the spin off. Currently it's one of my top picks for the next decade. It's currently trading at a significant premium to the overall market but for a good reason. If there's a pull back on the stock I will be adding."
3963059,90695,2016-04-04T16:18:32-04:00,"With its recent run-up, PayPal's valuation has become stretched.Going forward, Apple Pay could be a headwind for PayPal.Venmo's growth has been incredible and the ""Pay with Venmo"" button is a natural fit for Facebook's platform.","One of the reasons why I enjoy writing for Seeking Alpha is that I can share my young perspective to an interested audience. I think (and hope) my young perspective is of value to older investors, and perhaps sheds light on overlooked or misunderstood aspects of companies.PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a company I think I can share a good deal of insight and opinion about. If you saw PayPal's Super Bowl advertisement, you know that the company is targeting Millenials such as myself.I like PayPal from the perspective of both a user and investor. I wrote about it in a previous article, but I feel the need to write another because the stock hasn't moved much since my last publication, but some of the fundamentals have.There is a new headwind that has surfaced since the publication of my piece, but I think the narrative remains the same: you should be a long-term holder of PayPal.A New HeadwindA relatively new headwind for PayPal comes from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which said that it plans on launching Apple Pay on mobile sites via its Safari browser. This poses a threat to PayPal because the online payments company handled $20 billion worth of mobile transactions in 2015, roughly one-fourth of the company's total volume. It's true that PayPal's Braintree processes some in-app Apple Pay purchases, but PayPal's profit margin is higher when it processes payments from PYPL's accounts.The other side of the coin is that if PayPal can keep mobile volume strong in the wake of Apple Pay, it shows the strength and stickiness of its product. In other words, if Apple can't create an alternative to PayPal - one, I might add, that already comes with the user's phone - then who can disrupt the space?ValuationThough PayPal is expected to grow earnings by 14% and 20% in 2016 and 2017, respectively, the se-based company trades at a steep 31 times earnings. For perspective, MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V) trade at 26 and 27 times earnings, respectively.At 31 times, PayPal fetches a valuation close to that of its all-time richest, signaling that potential upside could be limited. A premium valuation also means that investors are paying for promise and execution by management. Though PayPal's management delivered strong numbers in the previous quarter, it may be tough for it to keep investors happy going forward because the expectations are so high.A Holy Grail: VenmoPayPal's fastest growing services is Venmo. In my eyes, its potential is enormous. For those unfamiliar with Venmo, consider it a digital wallet with a social component. It replaces traditional payment methods (cash, check, and credit cards) with simple paperless digital payments. It is designed to make it easy for users to share payments with friends and people in close geographical proximity. Venmo makes it easy to pay for things like cabs, the rent or dinner. A few taps replace searching for spare change or writing a check. Not surprisingly, the service is very popular among college students.Since PayPal acquired Braintree, then the owner of Venmo, it has been looking for a way to monetize the digital wallet service. This solution did not come until recently, when Venmo announced they will offer merchants the ability to include a ""Pay with Venmo"" button for payments. This button gives businesses the ability to offer customers an easy form of payment, and Venmo takes a cut of the transaction. The ""Pay with Venmo"" button is doubly good for Venmo because it gives users another reason to stick with the service.Many merchants have already opted for the ""Pay with PayPal"" button, so their adoption of a ""Pay with Venmo"" button is likely. Plus, the demand is there. According to a survey from Tech.co, 95% of Venmo users said that they would use the ""Pay with Venmo"" option.Source: Tech.coCompanies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Snapchat (CHAT) have tried to implement payment services similar to Venmo. Facebook implemented a feature into Messenger that allows users to link a card with their profile and send money to friends via a message. Snapchat has a service called Snapcash, which operates in a similar manner. On paper, these services sound like noteworthy competitors to Venmo. However, in reality, these services haven't taken off.Meanwhile, Venmo has been growing at unearthly clips. The company processed a record $1 billion in January, more than 2.5 times more volume than January of 2015, and better than 10 times more volume than January of 2014.This sparks the question, why haven't Facebook and Snapchat been able to popularize their payment services? As Venmo's growth shows, there is a large demand for ""social payment"" services, so what gives?In my opinion, the reason is that people simply don't associate Facebook and Snapchat with transferring money (and why should they?). Also, trust has not been developed between the user and these social media companies, so they are hesitant about using them to transfer funds to friends.I attribute much of PayPal's and Venmo's success to their ability to build trust with their users. I cited PayPal's mission statement in my first article about the company, and I'll quote it again here because it is so integral to their success.The company's mission statement has been the same since its inception, and it's a leading reason why consumers trust the service so much. In 2001, the company wrote: ""Breaches of our customers' privacy and our security measures (...) could diminish severely consumer confidence in and use of our product."" Therefore, PayPal is committed to ensuring the safety of its product for all customers and for years down the road.The trust factor is the leading reason why payment processing from social media companies does not pose a large threat to PayPal. But, while there is not much potential for payment processing from social media companies, I believe there is a place for payment processing on social media platforms.In my previous article, I told a personal anecdote about my experience selling shoes with the help of Facebook groups. I recommended that readers listen to what CEO Mark Zuckerberg had to say about these groups, saying that his remarks could be good for PayPal.On Facebook's Q4 conference call, Mr. Zuckerberg said that for the first time, more than 1 billion people used Facebook groups in a single month. More than 50 million small businesses now use pages on Facebook, and these pages generate more than 2.5 billion comments per month. Facebook has integrated a marketplace feature that allows users to see the price of products, but in order to purchase them, they need to send money via Facebook or use a service like PayPal.Now, imagine if users could purchase items right from their timeline via a ""Pay with PayPal"" or ""Pay with Venmo"" button. Such a feature would be a huge convenience for customers and would fill the void of trust between the Facebook user and the payment processing platform.In ShortWith its recent run-up in price, PayPal's valuation has advanced to a level higher than the valuations of both Visa and MasterCard. This heightened valuation comes at a time in which many believe that Apple Pay will begin to pose a large threat to PayPal, so this headwind will need to be monitored over the coming quarters. If Apple Pay can't compete with PayPal, though, then I don't think any product can.Moreover, Venmo has shown great growth and has great potential going forward. The main reason for Venmo's success is its ability to build trust with users. This is the component lacking from Facebook and Snapchat's alternatives to Venmo, which is why they don't pose a large threat to the service in the long run.Lastly, it will be hard for Venmo to keep growing at its current clip unless it can integrate its ""Pay with Venmo"" feature into Facebook. It may seem farfetched to speculate such an integration, but it could be a key driver of growth for Venmo going forward. If it happens, I think the sky's the limit."
3975461,64693,2016-05-16T18:07:32-04:00,"PayPal has not only managed to expand its customer base, but has also successfully deepened customer engagement.PayPal's One Touch, in addition to the company’s credit services, has helped reduce cart abandonment rate. This, in turn, has attracted more merchants to PayPal.Mobile payments will drive PayPal's earnings in the long run.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the biggest players in the credit services industry. In the last three years, the company has expanded its payment solution capabilities immensely, offering PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo and Xoom products, owing to which it has successfully attracted an increasing number of merchants and consumers. Today PayPal stands out as the leading global payments platform.PayPal's total revenues are composed of transaction revenues and revenues derived from other value-added services. The latter accounts for only~12% of PayPal's consolidated net revenue, so the overwhelming emphasis is on growing transaction revenues.PayPal's strategy for expanding transaction revenues is simple. Based on the volume of activity processed through its payments platform, PayPal charges a net fee to its customers. So in order to maximize transaction revenues, PayPal has to boost total payment volume (""TPV""), i.e. the value of payments completed through its payment platforms. TPV obviously is driven by acquiring more customers and deepening 'customer engagement' or the number of transactions made per customer. Remarkably, PayPal has managed to do both.PayPal ended Q1 fiscal 2016 with no less than 184 million active accounts. This figure has grown both sequentially and year-over-year every quarter since Q1 2010. Despite the vigorous customer acquisition, PayPal's payment transactions per active account have risen steadily to 28.4 million this quarter from 24.5 million in Q4 2014. This represents, on average, an astounding increase of 0.78 million per quarter. Consequently, PayPal's TPV has ballooned to over $81 billion, a growth of 45% since the first quarter of 2014 and evidenced in the third chart below:(Source: Statista)(Source: Company's Quarterly Results)(Source: Statista)So, qualitatively, what's driving PayPal's earnings? As far as engagement is concerned, PayPal's One Touch is proving to be a game changer. One Touch makes the checkout experience extremely convenient for merchants and consumers, by relieving them of the trouble of entering password or shipping information. Thus, PayPal has radically reduced cart abandonment with One Touch. Compared to the multi-step Visa (NYSE:V) checkout, PayPal has a ~36% higher conversion rate. This is one of the major reasons why merchants all over the world are becoming increasingly reliant on One Touch. With One Touch now available to merchants in 144 markets, PayPal expects some 2 million additional merchants to switch to this service by the end of 2016.Credit is another factor that has helped PayPal reduce cart abandonment rate. PayPal's capacity to process credit transactions has been greatly enhanced, following the acquisition of Braintree. Currently credit stands at nearly 2% of TPV, which I consider very reasonable. Admittedly, credit does have a negative impact on transaction margins, but that is something that PayPal can afford. Credit remains a great way to attract consumers and what's of paramount importance is that credit consumers generally spend more than regular consumers. An increase in the number of consumers, furthermore, draws more merchants; hence PayPal's investments in credit products are fully justified.(Source: Statista)Looking ahead, I believe PayPal's ability to strengthen its position in the digital payment space will be the key to its growth prospects in the long run. Mobile Payments sector is growing rapidly and by 2019, global mobile payment transaction volume is forecasted to climb to $1.08 trillion. This certainly is a great opportunity for PayPal, but make no mistake - competition in the mobile payments arena is stiffening by the day. Both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are making great strides by investing in innovative in-store solutions. Apple is striving to make Apple Pay as ubiquitous as possible, while Google's Android Pay is aggressively adding users in the U.S. In spite of the intensifying competition, PayPal's first-mover advantage and initiatives to drive mobile payment transactions make me fairly confident about the company's prospects.The chart below shows that mobile payments are quickly becoming a very important component of PayPal's TPV, an indication of the fact that PayPal is effectively capitalizing on the trend toward paying on mobile. This year, to keep up with competition, PayPal overhauled its mobile app to add a number of customer-centric features like allowing users to add credit cards issued from countries other than the U.S. The shrewdest move, though, was the addition of in-store features like 'order ahead.' These efforts demonstrate that PayPal wants more of its TPV to come from mobile and this, in my view, is exactly what will happen. In one year, I won't be surprised to see one-third of PayPal's TPV being driven by mobile.(Source: Statista)ConclusionAll in all, PayPal is nicely poised to deal with future challenges in an ever-evolving digital payment space. This is a company that must not be ignored or underestimated with numerous competitive strengths and a healthy balance sheet. Sporting a TTM P/E multiple of 36x but a forward P/E of 22x, PayPal is trading at a premium to investment alternatives within the industry but the company's high growth prospects make its valuation palatable and justified."
3966607,97896,2016-04-20T12:20:12-04:00,PayPal downgraded by analysts at Compass Point.Management looks to improve efficiency and cost structure.PayPal looks to invest in its mobile platform.,"PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been a great business that has outperformed since its spin off from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) last year. PayPal management has made it clear that they will be cutting costs and improving its mobile platform, while striving for improving its earnings going forward. Now that PayPal has spun off, there are excellent opportunities present for management to drive efficiencies and improve margins, while investing in a superior mobile payment platform that looks to give its users the greatest user experience possible. While PayPal faces tough competition in Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google Wallet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), it appears that PayPal is planning to offer a solution that is different from its uprising competitors, as PayPal CFO John Rainey stated that ""PayPal is truly different, we are the only company in the world that is 100% focused on digital payments. And perhaps more importantly, what is unique to us is that we are technology and device and operating system agnostic.""PayPal downgraded by analysts at Compass PointPayPal stock was recently downgraded by analysts at Compass Point as they rated PayPal at neutral from its initial buy rating, while dropping the target price by a dollar from $41 to $40. Analysts stated that they were not impressed by PayPal's choice to buy money transfer company XOOM for $890 million in 2015. Compass Point also stated the ""company's continued focus on acquisitions in a seller's market"" implies that they're concerned that PayPal will continue paying premium prices for potential acquisitions going forward. I believe the downgrade concerns are overblown, however. With PayPal having a PEG ratio of 2.5, the stock is very expensive, given its growth potential that will soon be very competitive with tech companies jumping into the payments industry. PayPal does have fantastic free cash flow, as it created $1.8 billion in free cash flow in 2015. PayPal currently has a value-to-FCF ratio of 24, which is quite expensive given the current price of the stock. Compass Point raises some legitimate concerns in its latest downgrade investors should do their homework and consider if they are willing to pay a premium for such a stock that will be facing headwinds from competition in the near future.Management looks to improve efficiency and cost structurePayPal's CFO made it very clear that the management team intends to focus on efficiency as well as implementing a new cost structure. CFO John Rainey stated at the KBW symposium that ""pricing is a lever that has virtually been untapped for PayPal for decades, and it is a true value driver."" This sounds like PayPal is planning to play around with the pricing until they find a sweet spot that will give them the highest return while still being competitive. He realizes that the company could increase revenue and drive value by lowering prices in certain areas, while increasing prices in other areas, where PayPal has more pricing power. The CFO spoke about improving efficiency in variable expense and volume related spending, such that the merchant may benefit from lower costs to use the service. PayPal also planned on reducing its customer service costs by allowing work from home, which saves PayPal vast amounts of office space and allows their customer service representatives to live a more flexible life and potentially allow for a higher quality of service. PayPal's CFO realizes that there's potential for PayPal to unlock value now that it is spun off from eBay. I believe PayPal will continue to improve its operational efficiency, which will increase margins and deliver steadily higher earnings over the long term.PayPal looks to invest in its mobile platformThe improvement of PayPal's mobile platform will be what gives PayPal the edge over competitors as it combines online and in-store payment solutions. PayPal's most recent acquisition, pay processor Braintree, will integrate into PayPal and will give the ability for a consumer to check out quickly on third-party websites. As CFO Rainey stated, ""PayPal is the only company in the world 100% focused on digital payments."" Apple Pay on the other hand is a convenient way of paying in a store as 15% of mobile devices are iPhones, but for those who don't have an iPhone, PayPal will be the safe choice of payment by merchants. PayPal currently has over 180 million customers that have the ability to make payments easily through their mobile app, which appears to be more versatile than payment solutions which depend on the device being used at checkout.ConclusionPayPal looks to be a very solid digital payment processor. Going forward, it can be expected that management will drive its bottom line by increasing efficiency in its operations and optimizing its pricing strategy, which is something it was unable to do as a part of eBay. Currently, the stock trades at a 39.3 P/E, which is quite expensive considering the industry average is 17.3. I would wait for a pullback in the price of PayPal's stock before considering initiating a position. There may be issues regarding the premiums paid for PayPal's acquisitions, but it appears that PayPal is determined to invest in their mobile platform in order to gain the upper hand on competition."
3914686,64283,2016-02-21T22:53:25-05:00,The global mobile payment landscape is rapidly evolving.Venmo is viral by design to effectively leverage this changing landscape.We believe that Venmo could become PayPal's most valuable and lucrative asset moving forward.,"Venmo's Monetization BeginsOne of the key takeaways from PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) earnings call on January 29th is its initiative to ""begin trials allowing Venmo customers to pay with Venmo at selected PayPal merchants.""This was a well-timed decision as Venmo has been well received by consumers. This can be seen from Venmo's high growth rate as of Q3 2015. For instance, in the last 12 months alone, the volume processed by Venmo increased by 200% y/y from $700 million in Q3 2014 to $2.1 billion in Q3 2015.Making Venmo ""one of the fastest growing apps in the world and likely one of the top 10 apps in the U.S. by volume,"" according to PayPal Holdings, Inc.'s CEO Dan Schulman during the company's Q3 2015 earnings conference call.We believe that the monetization of Venmo will be a huge success. In addition, monetizing Venmo will add more value to Venmo users as the portfolio of usage for Venmo will expand, and it will also allow PayPal to begin monetizing what we think could be its most valuable asset in the future.Why Value Is HiddenVenmo's potential has not been observed because:It is always difficult to value all businesses in diversified companies. As a result, the market ends up discounting conglomerate stocks. This is why PayPal's spin-off from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) was a great idea.But in spite of the spin-off, Venmo has always been a small segment of other businesses. This has made it hard for the market to see its value.For instance, in 2009, the co-founders Iqram magdon-Ismail and Andrew Kortina released a beta version of Venmo and the app only became publicly available in 2012. But within 5 months, Braintree purchased Venmo for $26.2 million. At the time of the purchase, Venmo was said to have been growing at 30% per month. Also, it claimed that Venmo was handling 10 million payments per month and was expected to process $250 million by the end of 2012.However, in 2013, Braintree decided to cash out for $800 million sale to then eBay Inc.'s PayPal. At the time of the purchase, Braintree was seeing $12 billion in payments annually with over $4 billion of those payments on mobile.Furthermore, another reason why Venmo's valuation has been hidden is because the company has never been effectively monetized - until now. We believe that starting this year, that is going to change. And it is going to change for the better.Venmo's business approach is different because it is focused on attracting consumers first before going to businesses.This idea works because businesses go where people are, but people do not always go where businesses are. Venmo focused on basic human interactions - the easiest way to pay your friends. Anyone who has had the frustration of figuring out how to split a bill or borrow or lend money to a friend far or near appreciates the significance of Venmo the very first time you learn of it.Ideally Venmo's 200% y/y growth rate with the backing of PayPal would make it one of the most favorite and most valuable apps, but recently unicorns have earned themselves a bad name. And Venmo is not an exception.Catalysts To Venmo's SuccessWe have to acknowledge that the mobile landscape is changing and it is tilting towards mobile payments. It is well known that consumers are shifting to mobile usage. Mobile digital media time is significantly higher compared to any connected device.But this changing landscape favors Venmo for numerous reasons:The increase in cyber attacks has been a problem for many firms, but a great opportunity for cyber security firms.But there is another seemingly benign yet critical aspect of cyber security we have not yet considered - trust. The rise of cyber security cases create mistrust for technology. This mistrust is detrimental for start-ups especially those that handle people's bank account details.This mistrust creates resistance to adopt new technology. This is what separates Venmo. It is an app of friends of friends. You can choose to highlight transactions with friends and others can see them on their news feed. This creates an instant level of trust that other apps will not be able to match. This is more than just a cycle of friends, it is a cycle of trust.This cycle of trust is an invaluable asset that Venmo has and that many copycats will have a hard time imitating.Venmo's competitors such as Square focus on convincing businesses that its product is the best and expect consumers to simply adapt to the change. Venmo's approach is different. It tries to convince consumers that it has a great, user friendly and trustworthy product, and expects businesses to follow consumers.We think Venmo's approach is the future of mobile payments. Businesses are more likely to follow consumers and not vice versa. Think about concepts that were based on this mantra. Founders thought about the best way to add value to consumers and once they effectively added value to consumers and consumers kept using their product, they could then monetize their ideas. Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) initial value proposition was to connect friends and families, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) wanted to democratize information and eBay wanted to even the playing field between big and small businesses. All these ideas where value based. Venmo offers that. It makes payments between friends and colleagues easier, intuitive and faster.We think this is one of the attributes that will make Venmo's monetization efforts very successful.ConclusionThe global mobile payment landscape is evolving rapidly. There is mass adoption of mobile devices and the digitization of money. According to Statista, the global mobile payment volume is expected to grow by 140% from $450 billion in 2015 to $1.08 trillion by 2019. Venmo's market is undoubtedly lucrative. There are many factors that will make Venmo's monetization a success:Venmo is viral by design. Its core competence is its ability to harness and apply the same social media connections that have made Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp viral, but in mobile payments. We think, if implemented correctly and not completely integrated with PayPal, Venmo's monetization is a start of something great."
3858366,98716,2016-02-02T22:53:53-05:00,"Technology upgrade deserves exponential growth, and Braintree is the engine.Payments is a hard business, but PayPal has an awesome core strategy (to be) proven by Venmo, XOOM and its next target.PayPal is a strategic partner of social media providers, business services and e-tailers in shaping the future of commerce, namely contextual commerce – a lot of trendy games to play.","On January 28, 2016 PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) reported a strong fourth quarter and posed even stronger prospects. Witnessing PayPal's accelerated growth, upgraded value proposition and $2 billion share repurchase plan, the market reacted moving ~15% upward so far. PayPal's continually gaining share to some extent addressed investors' concern on competition, proved its capability of being a winner in payments. However, whether double-digit growth is sustainable might be a question mark for many investors given Venmo monetization being slow, taking rate coming down, etc. In my opinion, PayPal is a sophisticated player knowing how to play the hard payments business, a thoughtful leader utilizing its first-mover advantage beyond payments, as well as an experienced business consolidator capable to execute through and create synergies. In short term, I see a further upside with PayPal's execution becoming visible or substantiated over time. Meanwhile, in a world of ""mobile making technology universal and shaping the future of commerce,"" PayPal is your best long-term play. My investment thesis points are as follows:1. Technology upgrade deserves exponential growth, and Braintree is the engine.Braintree was founded in 2007. It possesses leading tokenization technology and one-stop payment capabilities for both mobile apps and websites, providing various services including merchant account, payment gateway, recurring billing, credit card storage, PCI compliance solutions, as well as international payments. Working towards its mission of ""connecting the world and empowering people through payments,"" so far Braintree has supported payments in 130 currencies across 40 countries.Braintree has been PayPal's best asset since acquisition in 2013. Braintree's technology fueled PayPal's One-Touch and itself serves those merchants from sharing economy and ""in-app"" economy. Looking at the future of One-Touch and Braintree's merchant services, you will find ""Braintree as the engine"" pretty much self explanatory.One-Touch is PayPal's innovation at its core, and so far has been adopted by 15 million users and enabled in over 30 countries. The next step is to expand to 100 countries within the next 6 months. One-Touch simplified the checking-out process and allows consumers to pay with One-Touch across different devices and merchants. When consumers activate One-Touch, cart-abandonment rate will be significantly reduced and conversion rate will be increased. In the following table, I made a conservative assumption that One-Touch in 2016 will drive 500bps incremental growth in payment transactions per active accounts over 2015. Given its current user adoption rate below 10%, this estimation is very realistic. In consequence, One-Touch is expected to drive 560-1480 bps incremental growth in 2016 TPV.Source: Company FilingsBraintree's growth has been impressive; in the fourth quarter, cards on file grew 111% y/y, authorized payments volume grew 119% y/y, which is not a surprise, as Braintree's clients are OpenTable, Uber (NYSE:UBER), Airbnb (AIRB), LivingSocial, Rovio, HotelTonight, Pinterest (PINIT), etc., all growing at a CAGR of 200% or 300%.Source: Company FilingsSource: InternetTokenization is a popular technology with a few other players on the market, such as Stripe, Apple Pay, and Samsung Pay etc. However, Braintree is able to distinguish itself from all the other competitors and remain as the top choice of large merchants, as it is device agnostic, accepts PayPal and Venmo, and supports seamless payments (in-app payment vs. redirected to a new page for payment, Braintree vs. Stripe). In 2014, Braintree announced its merchant base doubled. Although PayPal did not disclose the exact number of Braintree's merchants in 2015, the expansion should be impressively positive.Braintree's In-App Payment, Source: InternetStripe Payment, Source: InternetMeanwhile, PayPal has signed a strategic agreement with First Data (FDC) to enable the acceptance of PayPal's tokenized payments in-store by First Data's acquiring clients and businesses. This is an important step forward in driving availability of PayPal at the point-of-sale, which has been very much concerned by the market. First Data, the largest U.S. merchant processor with approximately 40% market share, is expected to be PayPal's strong partner that can bring at-the-POS users to PayPal.To quantify Braintree's contribution to PayPal, I should first estimate Braintree's effective take rate. Because Braintree provides both full stack payment and gateway payment (with a much lower take rate), its overall take rate is lower than PayPal's. Because PayPal did not disclose the breakdown of Braintree, the best way to estimate it is to base on the y/y take rate decrease (assuming the decrease is due to Braintree only, Venmo is ignored as it is still small) to calculate the implied take rate of Braintree. Assuming PayPal would have been able to maintain its flat take rate as 3.31% in 2014 (excluding Braintree's dilutive effect), the revenue dilution in 2015 vs. 2014 is attributed to the incremental transaction volume of Braintree. I can get the implied take rate of Braintree as 0.54%. This number is close to what Braintree disclosed in 2014 (payment volume $23 billion and revenue $122 million, revenue yield is equal to 0.53%).Braintree's Take Rate Estimation, Source: Company FilingsBased on the above take rate of Braintree as 0.54%, I calculated the revenue contribution of Braintree in the following table. My first assumption is that Braintree transaction volume is growing with incremental 2000bps y/y because of the fast growth of its existing merchants and the future expansion of its merchant base. The implied Braintree's take rate remains as flat as 0.54%, and PayPal's revenue growth is as steady as 17%. In this way, Braintree is expected to contribute nearly one-third revenue by 2018.Braintree's Revenue Forecast2. Payments is a hard business, but PayPal has an awesome game plan (to be) proven by Venmo, XOOM and its next targetPayments is a hard business, for example, Square (NYSE:SQ) currently has 45% credit (funding cost 300bps) and 55% debit (funding cost 80bps) mix, which leads to 64.8% transaction cost. PayPal's economics look better that it has a nearly 2x of Square's transaction margin, which PayPal is not satisfied with. Instead PayPal has an awesome game plan to make payments a more profitable business. The past years, PayPal worked as a strong business consolidator (acquired Modest, XOOM, Paydiant, Braintree & Venmo, Bill Me Later etc.) in hoping to enable money movement and money management on the globe. This is essentially the innovative way for PayPal doing payments business, because with the expansion of PayPal's ecosystem, it can significantly improve its funding mix through an increasing funding within itself.In the following table, I simulated the future funding mix of PayPal, assuming its diverse portfolio (such as Venmo, PayPal Credit) is able to change the funding mix. The conclusion is, with the expansion of PayPal's ecosystem, the future transaction margin is expected to increase by 119bps or 270bps, which will possibly turn around the take rate's downward trend. (Please note the calculation of take rate did not take Braintree's and Venmo's dilutive effect into account, the numbers may not represent the accurate forecast of the future take rate. However, the transaction margin increase is significant.)PayPal's Funding Mix, Source: Company FilingsSource: Company FilingsThis is definitely a game worth playing, as exactly what PayPal has been doing. In a nutshell, PayPal's core strategy is to acquire a new business at a reasonable price, ramp up users by leveraging its scale, providing easily accessible service to consumers, and finally monetize from the merchant side. Venmo's success has proved this a viable strategy. From 2013 to 2015, Venmo's payment volume grew from $521 million to $7500 million with a CAGR of 143%. This viable strategy enabled Venmo's monetization at the right timing and the right side. Since Q4 2015, PayPal launched ""Pay with Venmo"" for selected online merchants. With new features (pay with Venmo in mobile or in store) being released this February, I expect a substantial amount of Venmo balance to be converted to non-dilutive TPV in 2016.Venmo's Revenue ForecastXOOM is the next demonstration of PayPal's core strategy. XOOM is a leading digital operator in the global remittances market, serving 1.6 million users in 30 markets and 31,000 payout locations. XOOM enables customers to send money internationally, typically charging $5 to $10 depending on the size of the exchange, as well as pocketing the difference in the exchange rates it sets.XOOM will soon be integrated into PayPal's platform, from where PayPal will have more than one way to ramp up users. First, Xoom Bill Pay, a cutting edge technology platform that transforms cross-border bill payments, allows people to pay bills or their beloved ones' bills online. Currently, Xoom cross-border Bill Pay has reached Mexico, Guatemala, EI Salvador, Nicaragua and the Dominican Republic. It has the potential to become a popular service for all domestic and cross-border users. Second, Xoom ACH money transfer, powered by Xoom's best-in-class ACH fund management capability, provides immediate transfer at the lowest cost. Both Xoom Bill Pay and ACH money transfer are good businesses that previously were limited within 30 markets and 1.6 million users, and now it can potentially reach PayPal's 200 markets and 179 million users. You may not know when the synergy will be substantiated. However, you won't be surprised some day when PayPal offers consumers a button ""Pay with Xoom"" after its scaling-up.3. PayPal is a strategic partner of social media providers, business services and e-tailers in shaping the future of commerce, namely contextual commerce - a lot of trendy games to playOrder a Uber Ride via FB Messenger, Source: Internet""Contextual commerce"" is the potentially game-changing idea that allows merchants to seamlessly implement purchase opportunities into everyday activities and natural environments. In other words, people can buy anything, anytime, anywhere, with the click of a button. Fitness Tracker ""buys"" sports drinks. Recipe website prompts purchase of key ingredient. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) reminds you to buy a birthday gift for your friend.Braintree has been an early mover in this area, as it powered Pinterest's buyable button. In December 2015, Braintree, Facebook Messenger and Uber had another nice try that allowed users to book Uber ride via Facebook messenger - a particular example of contextual commerce. However, the implications are crucial: first, Braintree is the enabler of contextual commerce as it fulfills the seamless payment transactions at the backend; second, social media providers are into contextual commerce, and Braintree will be able to expand in the B2B markets through partnerships with all the future contextual commerce pioneers.Moreover, besides working in the background, with Modest's expertise (building apps, integrating apps, buy-button into apps, order management, etc.) in contextual commerce, Braintree now has the end-to-end capabilities to power PayPal's industry first contextual commerce platform and attract more and more e-tailors. Braintree so far served payments for many of Bigcommerce's 90,000 merchants, and it obviously has the ability to bring some of them to PayPal's mobile commerce platform.In order to visualize the future effect of contextual commerce, let's take a step back thinking about PayPal's 10 million merchants and 179 million consumers. Mobile makes technology universal, and contextual commerce is making commerce universal by connecting every consumer and every merchant in various contexts. That said, PayPal's contextual commerce is as big as 10 million merchants multiplied 179 million consumers. On top of this massive network, Braintree and Modest will be exceptionally transformative for PayPal's future.ConclusionIn summary, I think PayPal has all the attributes of being a long-term leader in Payments, and also a growing giant in mobile commerce. Everything is there, the assets, the innovation, the network, the vision, etc., it just has to take some time to execute through. I expect PayPal to be a best long-term play."

(NASDAQ: PYPL) is a global leading technology platform which facilitates digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants. PayPal's technology connects with financial institutions around the world and allows customers to collect payments using a wide range of payment methods regardless of where the merchant is located.The business split from parent company eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in July of 2015 and has embarked on an independent journey of strategic acquisitions and growth strategies. The solo journey appears to be positioning PayPal towards a promising future.The Revenue-Generating Business ModelBesides the core PayPal business, additional services under the company's umbrella include PayPal Credit, Venmo, BrainTree, and it's latest acquisition, Xoom, which I'll elaborate more later on.PayPal makes money primary by charging fees per each customer transaction that happens within the payment platform. Its secondary stream of income comes from other value-added services available to the PayPal user - think PayPal Credit - where clients that qualify are able to obtain loans from PayPal directly.A key metric of profitability for PayPal is Transaction Payment Volume, or TPV. TPVs include the net transaction fees that are charged to consumers and merchants. Added value services include revenue derived from interest and fees that are earned on PayPal Credit Loans receivable portfolio, as mentioned, in addition to subscription fees to selected services, as well as revenue share earned through partnerships.Total Payment Volume, or TPV, for fiscal 2014 was $235 billion, a 26% year-over-year increase in comparison to fiscal 2013. Payment transactions in 2014 totaled $4 billion, a 22% growth from 2014. As of end of fiscal 2014, PayPal had over 162 million active consumer accounts. Overall, the business had strong momentum within important metrics across the board.SourceSince its split from eBay, PayPal's standalone profitability has been growing exponentially. During the most recent earnings report, for third quarter 2015 total TPV grew 27% year over year to $70 billion, on a foreign exchange neutral basis. The company also continued to increase their market share within the mobile payment space processing 345 million transactions, a year-over-year increase of 38% and counting.Outlook for full fiscal 2015 includes 15%-18% growth in net revenue. GAAP earning per diluted share are expected to be in the range of $0.94-$0.98.Xoom AcquisitionIn July of 2015, PayPal made the official announcement that it would acquire XOOM (NASDAQ: XOOM), a digital money transfer provider. By the time of the acquisition, Xoom had grown to be a leader in international money transfer, which enables customers in the U.S to send money and pay bills for family and friends around the world in a secure, fast, and cost-effective way. Transactions can be made seamlessly through a mobile phone, tablet, or computer.The cost of the acquisition was $25 per share, or $890 million, paid in cash. As per PayPal's president and CEO Dan Schulmam, the acquisition is perfectly aligned with PayPal's goals of democratizing the management and movement of money around the world. As per Schulman:The acquisition has positioned PayPal as a notable leader in this space becoming a serious threat to long-time players in the money transfer industry including MoneyGram (NASDAQ: MGI) and Western Union (NYSE: WU).Xoom's acquisition will help accelerate PayPal's entry in to the $60 billion global remittance market adding additional services in to the technology platform. The amplification of services offered by PayPal to its customers will also help strengthen the relationship they have with the platform and create a more powerful network effect. Not only can PayPal users get paid throughout the platform but they'll also have access to a series of additional services that can be completed from anywhere in the word and from any type of device.Valuation and CompetitorsPaypal is a strong player within a very interesting space. The business is not only competing against other payment processing platforms including the traditional Visa (NYSE: V) and Mastercard (NYSE: MA) of the world, but with more recent developments including Google Wallet (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), and even Square (NYSE: SQ). In addition, as previously noted, the recent Xoom acquisition also adds MoneyGram and Western Union to the mix.Taking a closer look at PayPal's valuation, many will argue the stock is overvalued. As of the time of this report, PayPal's P/E stands at 39.6 times earnings with a forward P/E of 24.9. However, a side-by-side comparison seem to show valuation is right at par with several of its top competitors:Source: Data adapted from Yahoo! FinanceWe have to keep in mind that when it comes to businesses in the technology space, valuation multiples tend to stand higher than average, especially when compared with the S&P 500, for instance. Higher multiples are often times a testament of the market's expectations regarding future performance.PayPal's competitive advantage stands with the business being a well-diversified platform that offers an array of services to consumers and merchants that complement each other effectively. From allowing customers to receive payments or send out payments to the option to secure loans or send money to people around the world, the differentiation is quite strong.Future OutlookDan Schulman, President and CEO of PayPal, trusts that the company is right at the forefront of the future of payment transactions:As per the most recent annual report, PayPal's strategies for growth include the following:Something to keep a very close eye on and which will likely play a pivotal role in PayPal's future growth is the fast-growing entrepreneurship, small business, and freelance culture that is transforming the way we do work.As per a study by the Small Business Association, the 28 million small businesses in America currently account for 54% of all U.S sales, a trend which is showing no signs of slowing down. Furthermore, a recent article in Fast Company indicated that, as per the bureau of statistics, 15.5 million people in the U.S were self-employed as of May of 2015.Additional studies also indicate that by the year 2020, 40% of the American workforce, or 60 million people, will be working for themselves. Because of these growing trends, businesses and merchants will be looking for ways to seamlessly pay and/or get paid for their work. Although there is competition, it looks that, as of right now, PayPal has a strong leadership status and is working to strengthen that as years go by. If the business continues to grow as it has, continues strengthening the brand, and making strategic acquisitions, PayPal is on track to benefit greatly from this new freelance culture.Final ThoughtsPayPal is a company to keep an eye on not only for 2016, but for many years going forward. As previously outlined, this business is becoming a strong leader when it comes to the way people get paid and manage money around the world. If the trend in entrepreneurship and small businesses continues to grow at the pace it has been, PayPal should benefit from the growth in transactions and we should see this reflected not only within the company's bottom line of more revenue, profits, and transaction growth but also within its stock price."
3853526,22148,2016-02-01T14:44:48-05:00,"PayPal reported a solid Q4 as the payments company makes progress in the split from eBay.The company offers a compelling valuation considering the fast growth rate.Despite the recent rally, the stock still offers a relative bargain.","When reviewing the results of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) in comparison to MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V), one will find it difficult to understand the valuation scenario. The small, faster-growing payments provider actually has the cheaper valuation of the group.The company split from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) going on seven months now, but the stock price has traded mostly down from the split level. The Q4 results though suggest the future trajectory of the stock might finally change for the good. The stock recently bounced off $31 for the second time in the last few months.Value PropositionThe strange part of the situation is that both MasterCard and Visa are seeing slowing growth. The market views both payment networks in the lens of a global economy switching from paper money to plastic and digital transactions. The valuations are stretched, especially in the case of Visa that will take a margin hit from acquiring Visa Europe.While the market is hot for MasterCard and Visa with a willingness to pay multiples of up to 2x growth rates, the market is rewarding the faster growth rate of PayPal in a tepid manner. Considering the latter grew Q4 non-GAAP earnings by 27%, the forward PE multiple of only 20 is far below the growth rate.The following table highlights the value proposition of PayPal in comparison to the payments giants:Mobile And Social FutureThe separation from eBay brings an inflection point on the payments provider originally tied to payment transactions on that platform. While total payments growth for Q4 was only 23%, the non-eBay merchant business grew by 36%. These numbers don't even include the impact from currency.Possibly more important, the mobile and social portions of the business are surging. For the quarter, eBay had flat volumes.PayPal saw mobile payments volume surge 45% to $20 billion. Mobile now accounts for roughly 25% of total payment volumes (TPV). The social platform, Venmo, surged 174% to a TPV of $2.5 billion.Part of the surging volume is due to deeper engagement from existing customers. On average, customers processed three more transactions in Q4 over last year.TakeawayThe business model of PayPal isn't exactly the same as Visa or MasterCard, but no reason exists to pay an equal or premium valuation for the giants in the sector. The recommendation is to use the tepid price action in PayPal to buy the cheap stock alongside the company that launched a $2 billion stock buyback."

PayPal IPOCarl Icahn turned out to be right – PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are not better together, at least if you’re PayPal.As an independent company now with its own management, strategy and ability to make decisions as a payments enabler – not the payments arm of an online merchant – PayPal is now free to pursue its agenda of powering the digital financial services ecosystem on a global scale.With nearly 180 million account holders in 203 countries, growing mobile volume, and a nice bank account with which to make strategic acquisitions or investments, in 2015 PayPal began to put to work a number of the acquisitions and assets that it acquired over the years: Bill Me Later, Braintree, Venmo and Xoom, to name but a few.For example, PayPal is using those capabilities to create sticky relationships with retailers large and small by being their “go to” for enabling transactional credit for its customers, working capital to grow their businesses, cross-border commerce without the acceptance hassle and one-touch commerce for their customers without having to do much to enable it.It’s expanding its efforts to enable payments between people, including remittances, and businesses, including bill payment. It wants to be the powering platform for embedded payments wherever commerce happens to take consumers and businesses, which we saw PayPal do last year on social networks like Pinterest (PINIT) (4 out of the 5 retailers on Pinterest use PayPal to power their payment capabilities) and Braintree do for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Messenger’s Uber (NYSE:UBER) payments capabilities. They’ve expanded merchant acceptance online and are experimenting with ways to mash up “buy buttons” and in-store payments, including schemes that do that inside of a merchant’s mobile app.PayPal also wants to serve as a digital banking alternative for those who lack access to existing financial services channels or satisfaction with those who may have banking relationships intact.All, of course, in the name of giving its users more places and reasons to use their PayPal accounts.In 2015, PayPal also proved wrong all the pundits who were convinced that PayPal would be an early and visible casualty of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay and confirmed the advantages of growing up digital in a world in which retail payments and financial services is now catching up with where PayPal started its journey – commerce in a digital world.Over the last several years, we’ve seen commerce slowly move from physical to online, and more rapidly from online to mobile – with the lines blurring a lot between those worlds.In 2016, we’ll see those lines blur even further – and even faster – as end points proliferate to include any place where a consumer with an app and payments credentials can be connected to an Internet-enabled commerce experience. And, in those contextual environments, there are and will emerge a variety of players who want to dominate this new commerce ecosystem. It will be interesting to see where those lines – and allegiances — are drawn.2. EMV Became A Reality In The U.S.I wrote in 2014 that the Target (NYSE:TGT) breach was the Black Swan that swam into payments that year. Absent that event, EMV was a global standard that was anything but certain in the U.S. But not for any failure to appreciate the value of or need for a global payments standard, but because merchants, in particular, didn’t see the value of investing in new point of sale systems when EMV was about authenticating a consumer using a plastic card in a world going digital.Once the Target breach happened though, it was game over.No CEO of a big retailer wanted to be “the next Target.” And even though everyone, including the networks, said that EMV wouldn’t have prevented the Target breach, it didn’t matter. The EMV train left the station and gained a huge head of steam in 2015 in the face of the liability shift which took place on Oct. 1, 2015.But as we turn the page to 2016, there remains a ton of progress to be made.Not surprisingly, issuers have been quick to issue new cards with chips – the liability shift favors issuers who put chip cards in the hands of the consumer at the expense of merchants without EMV terminals. Estimates suggest that of the 1.2 billion cards in circulation in the U.S., about 400 million now have chips.Merchants, on the other hand, still seem reluctant and even schizophrenic with respect to EMV.Of the 12 million merchant terminals in the U.S., about 550,000 are said to be EMV-enabled. Lots of large merchants say they’ll get around to it, but haven’t yet. Others have installed EMV terminals but haven’t turned them on, some who didn’t want the new and slower experience to interfere with the holiday shopping season. Still others are focused on securing their online channels since that is where the fraud will move as it has in every other country EMV has been implemented. And, because that’s where their businesses are headed, too.Other merchant categories, like restaurants and QSRs in particular, are quietly thumbing their noses at EMV entirely in favor of investing in better mobile experiences for their customers (like mobile order ahead and pay at the table functionality). SMBs (retail and services) are too focused on running their businesses and don’t seem to care that much – they think rightly or wrongly that they’re too small to be impacted. A recent survey of SMBs that we did with Sage Payments suggests that 64 percent say they have no plans to deploy EMV.All of which, of course, has implications for the fate of NFC. No EMV terminals means no NFC. And even EMV terminals don’t automatically mean that NFC will be enabled. And, without mobile payments volume from NFC-enabled mobile payments schemes, merchants won’t feel compelled to either invest or enable.In 2016, we’ll watch merchants take stock of their own situations, take the lessons on board from those who have implemented EMV, and prioritize the investments in new technologies that help them both protect themselves and their consumers from fraud while future-proofing their businesses. We’ll watch to see if the EMV consumer experience prompts consumers to embrace mobile or issuers to invest in dual interface cards to entice tapping and not dipping. All merchants will eventually have EMV terminals. The unknown is whether merchants will accelerate their terminal refresh cycles because of EMV or whether they’ll accelerate their investments in new POS environments because they want to reinvent the point of sale experience entirely which also means away from plastic cards.One place to watch for that is how merchants invest in 2016 to get their most loyal customers to use mobile apps for shopping and buying, including for making in-store purchases. Loyal customers drive a big chunk of merchant sales and persuading consumers to use mobile apps instead of plastic cards in the store could be a high priority for many reasons. Investments in new point of sale software and consumer incentives to move to mobile could trump investments in new point of sale hardware.3. Cyberattacks Change The Game Of Digital IdentityThe pace of EMV implementation in the U.S. notwithstanding, the relentless drumbeat of hacks and breaches that monopolized the news cycle in 2015 has only intensified the debate across the ecosystem about the best way to keep consumer data safe and access to that data secure.It was evident in 2015 that cybercriminals were becoming increasingly sophisticated and part of very well-organized businesses. They had the tools and the smarts to find and then exploit every last weak link to be found in our systems. Consumers became numb over the reports of merchants and businesses being hacked – and if their own card hadn’t been replaced at least once, just about every consumer knew at least someone whose card had been.But as serious a threat as card hacks are, consumers have been trained over the years that they are protected from a serious downside, even if their debit card is compromised. Card hacks are a nuisance to consumers, but they are protected 100 percent from catastrophic financial loss.That’s not the case when personal data is compromised, as we saw in 2015 with the hack of the government’s Office of Personal Management, and health insurer, Anthem. That put a whole new spin on the downside of having a cyber crook steal a consumer’s identity, including their fingerprints, for their own nefarious purposes. This creates more than a little bit of uneasiness in a world in which data and commerce opportunities will become more – and not less – distributed across a variety of places, connected endpoints and databases.And in a world in which the security protocols that are being tightened in one area – monitoring goods that enter the country, for example – require that consumers give up more and more information in order to prove that they aren’t bad guys.I ordered something online over the holidays from a seller in the U.K. Thanks to the fact that I was dealing with a seller enabled for cross-border commerce, payment was easy. Getting the goods into the country wasn’t. In order to clear customs, I had to fill out a form that asked for every piece of sensitive data a cyber crook would ever want: name, address, DOB, and SSN. If I wanted my stuff, I had no choice but to give it up. If Fed Ex gets hacked, I’m hosed, along with everyone else who’s filled out a similar form.So, the healthy dialogue that began in 2015 and will no doubt continue in 2016 is how to protect against the unlawful access to the sensitive personal data that is now – or soon will be – everywhere. But making it secure is only one part of the equation. Making it interoperable is another important yet challenging requirement.4. Apple Pay Stays In The BasementTim Cook said that 2015 was to be the “Year of Apple (AAPL) Pay” and that it was. But perhaps for reasons different than those Cook had originally hoped.As I’ve written multiple times, Apple Pay’s adoption has been hurt by a fundamental ignition flaw that plagued it from Day 1: it constrained both sides of its platform by imposing hardware and software requirements on merchants and consumers. That kept it from getting the critical mass it needed to give merchants or consumers an incentive to adopt and use.As our survey results reveal, consumers didn’t buy their new iPhones to use them for payment (only 3 percent and the very last reason that people said motivated them to buy a new iPhone). And Apple had absolutely no control over merchants installing terminals with contactless capabilities – they either had them or they didn’t and they either would or would not install them at some point in the future.That also makes Apple Pay stuck right now in sort of a mobile payments purgatory – usage at about 5 percent of all eligible users –meaning those who have the right iPhones who use Apple Pay when they shop at merchants with NFC-enabled terminals. That turns out to be something like .022 percent of all retail sales – not exactly enough to get anyone excited about or jump through hoops to enable Apple Pay at the physical point of sale.And, that’s been pretty much the steady state of Apple over the last year. Not surprisingly, a couple of things happened in 2015 as a result.First, the competition became emboldened. Keep in mind that Apple Pay was supposed to be the death knell of anyone with existing mobile payments ambitions, and/or future dreams of them. Their lack of traction combined with Apple Pay’s business model, which takes a slice of issuer transaction fees, has given competitors the moxie to say to both issuers and consumers and merchants “why not give us a shot?”Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) Pay advertises that it’s accepted everywhere and available on slick and slim new handsets. Android Pay is positioning itself as a platform for commerce. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Wallet is available on iOS. Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) both launched “express” tokenization schemes, making it easier for consumers to provision issuer’s cards in Android Pay and Samsung Wallets.And speaking of the card networks, they’ve begun to expand the acceptance of their own buy buttons, too – recognizing that the fastest way to a consumer’s digital commerce heart isn’t via an in-store mobile payments scheme but by making shopping online in any digital medium easier. They understand that the name of the game is acquiring consumers – since that’s what brings merchants sales — and as fast and friction-free as possible.Apple Pay can only do so much at this point. It’s put all of its cards on a consumer/merchant hardware-driven/operating systems based play. On the one hand, who can blame them? We’ve written before that Apple customers are affluent and control about two-thirds of the spend in the U.S. But that spend can only translate to merchant sales if consumers can use Apple Pay at merchants.That’s the big rub now.The only way that Apple can acquire more consumers is to keep selling new iPhones. And convincing consumers that Apple Pay is worth using everywhere they shop.That’s the other big rub.Apple is going to have to put some of their own money behind that if they want that to happen. It’s tough to get merchants to go to bat for Apple today unless they think that they’re going to get lots of customers. Remember last year this time when all you saw on TV were commercials for Apple Pay? Those were subsidized by the issuers. It’s unlikely that Apple can go to that well again since all issuers have to show for that investment is a big hole in their marketing budget.Apple Pay is rumored to be contemplating its own P2P play in an effort to get more of its current iPhone 6/6S customers to use Apple Pay, but powering that will require a partner.Which might be the something to watch in 2016.American Express and Apple have been like two peas in a pod as “Apple Pay has expanded around the world.” In fact working with American Express is the only way that Apple Pay really has expanded around the world since in many countries it’s the only issuer willing to play ball and pony up basis points on transaction fees. Which, of course, raises its own set of problems with merchants who don’t like paying more to accept Amex cards.It might be fun to watch what Apple and American Express (NYSE:AXP) do together in 2016. They sort of both need each other but for different reasons. It’s a sure bet that American Express likely can’t wait for 2015 to be over – the year it saw its market cap lose about $27 billion. And, in 2014, before Apple Pay launched, I said that Apple, with its affluent customer base, could become the American Express of payments. With a market cap of $68 billion now, and a chance in acquisition philosophy, who knows, maybe Apple could make that happen.And, they’d still have about $150 billion in the bank …5. Walmart Gets Into Payments – And MCX Makes What Could Be Its Final Gasps Walmart’s (NYSE:WMT) announcement of Walmart Pay in December suggested two things: MCX is pretty close to dead and Walmart values sales more than it does saving money on interchange fees.Walmart, of course, didn’t say that it wouldn’t support MCX; in fact, they politely said they would continue to do so. But let’s face it, if MCX were killing it in Columbus, there’d be no reason to even think about any other mobile payments scheme. And with the news of Target possibly exploring its own mobile wallet – well, it might be time to stick a fork in the MCX experiment.The launch of Walmart Pay also suggested that Walmart believed that the fastest way to getting mobile phones to be used as payments proxies in stores was to channel the payments and shopping habits that consumers had perfected on those phones. Which was to replicate the experience of shopping on Walmart.com.Sort of.Walmart Pay’s mobile payments innovation is to essentially enable a Walmart.com customer to enable a transaction at the physical point of sale, using a QR code and a scanner that already exists at checkout counters in their stores.Not to mention the 22 million people every month that comScore says use Walmart.com in a Walmart store.That’s a pretty big installed base to tap into, along with acceptance at all of its 4,000+ stores in the U.S. and the prospect of converting a few of the more than 100 million people who walk into one of those stores each week.2015 hasn’t exactly been one of Walmart’s best years.It, like many other brick and mortar merchants, suffered at the hands of online merchants. And one in particular: Amazon. In October, Walmart warned the market that its profits wouldn’t come in as promised as a result of investments in digital initiatives. That news caused Walmart’s stock to suffer its steepest decline in 27 years, wiping out $21 billion in market cap. The irony, of course, to those sitting in Bentonville, is that this decline was precipitated on news related to profits – a concept that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has managed to skirt over the last 20 years without taking much of a hit from investors.Walmart says that it will have just about all of its stores equipped to accommodate Walmart Pay by the first half of 2016. With more than $36 million in sales every hour taking place at a Walmart store, and 90 percent of the American consuming public within 20 minutes of one, that will be an interesting piece of the commerce pie to watch move to digital, as it happens right inside of a physical Walmart store.Talk about blurring the lines.Walmart Pay starts its mobile payments life in a very unique and very unusual starting way: it has control of both sides of its platform – consumers and merchants. That’s a huge advantage. But it still doesn’t mean that it’s game over. Walmart Pay, like every other mobile payments player, still has its work cut out for it to get its platform ignited.Walmart’s customers are unique. Many of them use EBT cards to buy groceries and those can’t be put into a Walmart Pay app (yet). A lot of Walmart’s customers still pay cash. So, starting with a scheme that tapped into the Walmart.com customers who consult the app inside the store is a pretty savvy starting point. Convincing those users to use the app to shop in store and more of them to get on board is Walmart’s focus in 2016 and what to watch for.As well as the Chase (NYSE:JPM) Pay launch later in the year.With MCX gasping for air these days, and Chase Pay pinning its hopes on MCX as a “launch partner” it might be time for Chase Pay to call an audible.Speaking of which, next week, I’ll share my 6 in ’16: the 6 trends that I believe will reshape the game that the payments and commerce players will play next year. If you want some hints as to where I might be headed, check out my 2015 Payments By The Letter – the 26 concepts that defined payments in 2015.Until then, all the best for a happy, healthy and prosperous 2016, with whatever ritual you use to welcome in a new year!Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3790976,98716,2016-01-05T12:44:00-05:00,"PayPal is a collection of attractive assets, and it is just now launching ways to make money from some of its best assets, including Braintree, Modest and Venmo.Significant cross-sell opportunity of the newly acquired Xoom into PayPal’s 173M user base.The expansion of PayPal’s credit products (the company’s fastest growing segment).I expect the 12-month price target at $50.9 (40.7% upside) and three-year price target at $78 (115% upside).","I believe that PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is the best way to invest in the emerging growth of mobile payments and mobile commerce over the next few years. When looking at the competitive landscape, PayPal has all of the attributes of a winner in this $563 billion global mobile payment market - first-mover advantage, significant scale vs. peers, timely acquisitions that would now be much more expensive to replicate, a critical mass of users, and a brand name with customer trust (something very important considering the sensitive nature of online payments and fraud concerns).The stock has come under pressure as investors have become increasingly concerned about competition (Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Square (NYSE:SQ), etc.). I believe that these concerns are overblown. Through acquisitions and organic innovation PayPal has diversified away from big competitors and has become a ""mobile commerce platform"" that differentiates itself from ""mobile payment"" peers. Because of this misconception, I believe investors are overlooking several hidden opportunities in the stock including:These company-specific thesis points are in addition to the secular growth story in mobile commerce. I believe that much of the company-specific story and significant asset value is not represented in the current stock price. PYPL is currently trading at 13.8x EBITDA on my CY 2016 estimates. My 12-month target price of $50.90, representing 40.7% upside, is based on blended valuation of a five-year DCF and 14.1x EBITDA on CY 2016 estimates. I believe there is even more value (three-year price target is $78, 115% upside) when looking over the long term as I expect PayPal to be a winner in the mobile commerce industry.Business OverviewPayPal was founded in 1998, acquired by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2002, and became an independent publicly traded company on 17th July 2015. It's a global payments platform with 173 million active customer accounts in 203 markets.PayPal was originally an online payments leader, and in recent years, it has transformed to a mobile-first company through acquiring Braintree (mobile payment full-stack processor), Venmo (P2P), Paydiant (in-store mobile payment) and through organic innovation. Overall, PayPal aims to enable money management and movement anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform and through any device. It therefore has created an ecosystem that incorporates all the following products and services.Payments is a crowded marketplace, in which PayPal faces fierce competition from multiple parties, including giant companies possessing unparalleled mobile or platform resources such as Apple, Google and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), e-commerce players who own payments service namely Amazon, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), as well as fast-growing start-ups such as Stripe and Square.Industry OverviewThe global mobile payments industry has rapidly grown, with a CARG from CY 2011-2017 exceeding 38% (Source: Statisca 2015). I see mutual development between mobile payments and mobile commerce. Mobile payments such as PayPal, Apple Pay and Android Pay make mobile commerce easier, while the shift from E-commerce to M-commerce remains a major driver of mobile payments growth. PayPal's 2015 research in conjunction with Ipsos shows that M-commerce growth outpaced E-commerce growth 3-to-1, CAGR from CY 2013 to 2016 42% and 13%, respectively.In the US, the mobile transaction share grew from 27% to 31% in 4Q2014 vs. 3Q2015 for average retailers, and from 35% to 44% for top quartile retailers (Source: Statisca 2015). Comparing with Asia (~50%) and UK (46%), the US has plenty of room to grow.In the U.S. holiday season so far, 36% of online sales came from mobile, up nearly one-third from 2014. Even Walmart.com saw 70% traffic from mobile. Forrester forecasts that, by 2020, M-commerce will have grown to account for over 50% of all digital transactions globally.Source: Criteo's 3Q2015 & 4Q2014 State of Mobile Commerce ReportPayPal is the biggest beneficiary from the shift to M-commerce, not only because of its current mobile payments capabilities but also its leading position in the next generation of M-commerce - contextual commerce.Contextual commerce leverages new technologies, notably mobile, apps, commerce, payments and social media, that enable customers to make purchases and payments wherever they happen to be online (such as the ""buy-now"" button featured on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Pinterest), not just on a merchant website.Investment Thesis No. 1: PayPal is a collection of attractive assets, and PayPal is just now launching ways to make money from some of its best assets, including Braintree, Modest and Venmo.PayPal has been delivering compelling results in mobile payments under its ""Mobile First"" strategy. In 3Q2015, PayPal's mobile payment has increased 42% and accounted for 24% of PayPal's TPV, about $16.5 billion. With the shift from E-commerce to M-commerce and the emerging transformation to contextual commerce, we expect in 2016 that due to acquisitions, PayPal TPV will grow faster than expected in two ways:Braintree is one of the best assets that PayPal has acquired. It fueled PayPal's One-Touch innovation and serves merchants such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Airbnb (AIRB). It has grown impressively - Braintree cards on file went up 116% in 3Q2015 vs. 3Q2014. Braintree payment volume from 2013 to 2015 has doubled year over year, exceeding $50 billion in 2015.Braintree will be growing even faster as it's the enabler of contextual commerce. Specifically, it facilitates transactions seamlessly via its tokenization services between consumers and merchants without re-entering payment information, switching between different apps or worrying about security. The experience with Braintree is just like having a card on file, then making commerce happen anywhere. Modest, in contrast, possesses contextual expertise with order management, helping merchants build apps, integrating shops into other apps, or adding buy buttons into channel-based marketing efforts while selling on third-party sites or marketplaces. By integrating Braintree and Modest, PayPal is now able to serve as an end-to-end mobile commerce platform, bringing more e-tailers to its platform.In December 2015, the first ""supergroup"" from payments and commerce: PayPal (via Braintree), Uber and Facebook (via Messenger) announced ""Uber via Facebook."" Facebook users can now order and pay for an Uber ride via Messenger. Braintree is the backend power to underpin the transaction with its tokenization services.If Facebook and Braintree were to extend their relationship further, we would likely see a blossoming of on-demand services inside Messenger. As consumer demand continues to drive the instant and on-demand economy, contextual commerce experiences will arise everywhere - from social media platforms to email - and Braintree's tokenization will be foundational to enable and support this. With what Braintree can bring to the table, I expect an extremely rapid growth of Braintree that drives both PayPal TPV and revenue upside.The last asset I would like to discuss is Venmo (P2P payment with social media features). With the kickoff of Venmo monetization (2.1B out of 16.5B mobile payments), we expect to see a less-dilutive take rate from Venmo in the future. When 10M merchants accept ""Pay with Venmo"" by the end of 2016, Venmo will be a ""full-scale"" mobile wallet. In three months (ending September 30th, 2015), Venmo's transaction volume grew 201% Y/Y. If the growth rate is sustainable in the next two years, and consumers with Venmo spent 20% with merchants, the Venmo payment to merchants will reach $5 billion (accounts for 1.6% TPV) in 2016, and $12 billion (accounts for 5% TPV) in 2017. By then Venmo's revenue contribution will be material.Investment Thesis No. 2: Cross-sell opportunity of Xoom (1M users) to PayPal's 173M users.Xoom is a leader in international remittances that operates in 30 markets and 31,000 payout locations with 1.38M active users. Xoom enables customers to send money to friends and family across the world. The acquisition of Xoom solidifies PayPal's entry into the remittance market and helps diversify the company's existing business lines. The international remittance market is promising as US capital outflows will grow at 10%, and China and India are two of the fastest capital inflow countries.Although PayPal management expected the acquisition of Xoom to be slightly dilutive to its non-GAAP earnings per share for 2016, being part of PayPal, Xoom can leverage PayPal's 173M user base for cross selling. The average transaction principal for Xoom is $487.42, in contrast PayPal's transaction principal of $57.99 (""PayPal Unleashed; Initiating Coverage With Outperform Rating"" by William Blair, October 5th, 2015). Therefore we expect a significant cross-sell opportunity for mobile savvy users to a new size payment. Below we assume Xoom can initially cross sell to 1.5% of the 69M U.S. PayPal users in addition to Xoom's own user base growing at 15% CAGR. With these assumptions, Xoom's revenue growth y/y will be impressive.Xoom Revenue (in millions) forecast - 1.5% cross-selling to 69M PayPal US usersOur base case only considers Xoom's cross-sell to PayPal's U.S. user base. Eventually, all the synergies will be substantiated.Investment Thesis No. 3: The expansion of PayPal's credit products (company's fastest-growing segment).PayPal Credit, formerly named Bill Me Later, was acquired in 2008 and renamed in 2014. PayPal Working Capital was launched in 2013, providing loans to small businesses. Currently, the net revenue from PayPal's credit products (according to the 10-Q, the growth of ""Other Value added services"" are primarily due to the growth of credit products) is growing faster than PayPal's transaction revenue.As stated in the 10-Q, 2% TPV ($1.4 billion) was funded by PayPal Credit, and PayPal's Working Capital loans for small businesses has lent over $1 billion to 50,000 small businesses in 2015.Considering PayPal's ample cash resources (PayPal's present source of funding) and its actively seeking of third-party funding sources, credit products will contribute to a larger and larger portion of revenues.The growth of credit products will lead to the following benefits for PayPal:In China, the Ali micro-loan (similar to PayPal working capital) amount in 2014 was over $32 billion, and the percentage of JD IOU (similar to PayPal Credit) vs. total sales revenues in 2015 went up by 500% Y/Y. Likewise, in the US, this area is well worth exploring by PayPal.Credit products are offered to PayPal's existing users and are attractive to both merchants and consumers. The offering of credit products will set PayPal apart from the other competitors and achieve a higher TPV growth.In 3Q2015, PYPL's transaction expense increased by 21% due to an unfavorable funding mix. The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than funding from bank accounts or internal sources such as PayPal account balance or PayPal Credit. Therefore, with the growth of PayPal Credit, we expect an improved funding mix in 2016.Valuation:1. 12-month price targetPYPL trades at a discount to its competitors MA and V. Given PYPL's growth in mobile payments and mobile commerce, I expect PYPL to command higher multiples over its peers in the FinTech sector.The blended valuation of a five-year DCF and 14.1x EBITDA on CY 2016 estimates have been applied to valuate PYPL in three cases. The key assumptions for valuation include Braintree growth, Xoom growth and cross-sell opportunity, Venmo monetization rate, PayPal TPV growth and credit products growth. Based on a blend valuation of free cash flow (10.1% yield) and EV/EBITDA (14.1x), we get a 12-month price target range of $40.2 to $62.3 (11.4-72% upside).2. Three-year price targetIn my opinion, PYPL has the potential to become a mobile payments and mobile commerce leader in the long term and trade at 30x forward P/E. Based on my forecasts of 2019, the three-year price target will be around $78, representing 115% upside.Risk:Conclusion:Overall, PayPal is not only a market leader in payments, but also a platform that has become an early mover and consolidator in the future global ""mobile commerce."" Given its strong balance sheet ($6 billion in cash), PayPal will have the flexibility to acquire more businesses to further expand its capacities in mobile payments and mobile commerce. I see that the attributes PayPal possess give it the capability to become the long-term leader in the space. I expect PayPal presents a very positive financial performance for 4Q2015 so as to address the concerns on the market, followed by impressive stock price upside."
3592836,46261,2015-10-23T10:22:43-04:00,"There are several strong synergies for both PayPal and American Express in a mutual merger or close cooperation.Activist investors in both companies could serve as a catalyst, but too many famous investors in the companies (Icahn, ValueAct, Buffett) may complicate negotiations.Any potential cooperation of the two companies, or a merger, whether together or separately, is my pure speculation and I have no knowledge of any such plans.Both PayPal and American Express are attractive long-term investments, and I am long both, with PayPal being a higher-conviction bet.PayPal has excellent organic growth and many future growth drivers, which makes it an attractive long-term investment, even as a standalone company.","I've been a long-time PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) user and have been eagerly awaiting the spinoff in order to buy into PayPal. Following the recent pullback toward $33.50, I finally pulled the trigger and plan to hold for a long time as I believe PayPal has a bright future and solid growth ahead, priced at a reasonable multiple given the growth I expect. However, several factors lead me to believe American Express (NYSE:AXP) could realize synergies and value for its shareholders, which makes it an attractive investment, as well. My personal opinion is there is some probability that both companies will merge - either together or each independently. However, this opinion is based solely on my analysis and conclusions. I have not seen any rumors or speculations of such moves. However, American Express' disappointing earnings results could increase pressure to consider broad array of options.PayPal has a solid position and a very strong brand in the fast-growing and quickly evolving space of online and mobile payments. In addition to current growth, multiple new expansion avenues open for PayPal as a standalone company now. The creation of the quick and easy-to-use one-click payment button One Touch from mobile to online in April this year is one example where future expansion will focus. Potential deals with non-eBay e-commerce providers, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and potential for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) sites and in-app purchases combined with PayPal's strong past relationships with merchants give PayPal a strong growth opportunity to expand. So far, over half of the Internet Retailer 500 and hundreds of thousands of merchants have enabled One Touch. And that's within months of the service's operations and with One Touch being launched in less than 20 countries, with many more to come. PayPal clearly realizes the importance of instant checkout, and keeping and expanding the wide-moat networking effect it already has.A recent acceptance of U.S. online gambling transactions is another example of the new opportunities being monetized. So for me, PayPal is an excellent long-term growth stock, and while I would love to buy it cheaper, I don't think a company of this caliber will offer much better entry prices. The recent upgrade by a respected Stifel analyst two days ago put a semi-strong floor under the stock price, unless the broad market outright tanks.American Express merger or cooperation would strengthen PayPal's ecosystem and boost total margins kept within the ecosystemHere is why I think it makes sense for both PayPal and American Express to merge with each other, or at least cooperate very intensely, preferably with at least some stock cross-ownership to secure the long-term mutual cooperation and perhaps even some exclusivity or special benefits.One: Integration of the card network and issuing bank under one ecosystemPayPal doesn't issue credit or debit cards and doesn't own a credit card network; it doesn't process credit card transactions such as Visa (NYSE:V) or MasterCard (NYSE:MA) do. So it has to pay transaction fees to card-processing networks and card issuers (the merchant banks), as well as the acquiring banks. American Express and Discover (NYSE:DFS) are both a card network and issuing bank.So, through integration with American Express (or Discover), PayPal would take all of American Express's fees and some of MasterCard and Visa's fees, as well as the issuing and acquiring banks' fees, if PayPal issues and processes the cards themselves. American Express's function as an issuing and acquiring bank enables Amex to have a much more integrated three-way card processing system, as opposed to the traditional five-party processing system that most competitors do due to not serving as an issuing and acquiring bank. PayPal's acquisition of American Express would give it access to this streamlined process and combine it with a cutting-edge digital payment platform. PayPal would become a mighty competitor with a possibility for a closed payment ecosystem. This could be somewhat similar to what Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is doing in mobile phones/PCs, e-commerce and mobile commerce.Two: Cross-selling synergies both waysBranded PayPal cards would greatly complement PayPal's current ecosystem, as it would make PayPal usage even more convenient and useful to current PayPal users. A physical PayPal-branded card would strengthen PayPal's already wildly popular online brand also offline. Card rewards program would further hook PayPal customers into the ecosystem and make it less desirable to switch online payments to a competitor whenever possible (wherever PayPal is accepted as one of the payment methods).PayPal could also cross-sell its services to the current large and arguably very affluent group of U.S. and international Amex card users. Amex's top-notch loyalty rewards program would provide an excellent service for PayPal's customers, enticing them to be more loyal and perhaps increase their share of spending through a PayPal account.Similarly, American Express would benefit from cross-selling its cards to a younger, more tech-savvy group of PayPal users, who may switch from their current card provider to American Express or even use a loyalty rewards card for the first time.Three: Rejuvenation of American ExpressLet's face it: American Express is a 20th century company with 20th century corporate thinking as far as I can judge, and mostly 20th century customers. The company desperately needs to reinvent itself, otherwise it will quickly lose relevance, margins and sales. It definitely needs to branch out to the online and mobile world, rapidly embrace new technology and cutting-edge solutions that resonate with the millennials and also cut expenses and make processes more efficient, in order to survive and start building a new group of core users that will become affluent customers and drive Amex's profits in the decades to come.Amex's digital payments attempts (for example, the recent Express checkout one-touch digital buy button attempts and the Apple app) show this is not the company's natural area where it would excel and be an industry leader and innovator. It would take several years to build and master the technology that PayPal already has and PayPal will continue evolving, so in three years, it will be yet more ahead of American Express. I believe Amex doesn't have several years to get this digital payments solution right. It's a ruthless land-grab time and whoever grabs the customer today with the best digital one-click/one-touch buy button and hooks them into their ecosystem, will own that customer (and arguably also the merchant!) for a lifetime.Arguably, American Express has lost a very strong manager highly skilled in this 21st century technology area, when Dan Shulman left for a company no other than PayPal. So, reconnecting with Dan Shulman through an alliance or merger would arguably help American Express regain top talent in the digital 21st century area. So it is worth exploring Dan Schulman's skills and implications in more detail.Four: Dan Schulman, CEO of PayPal, came from American ExpressClearly, Dan Schulman knows American Express very well. He understands how exactly PayPal could either build the same or similar systems that American Express has in order to achieve the synergies described in point one regarding the integration of credit card network, processing and issuance. However, I believe American Express is very reasonably valued, given its unique technology and a large customer base, as well as its merchant and industry connections, especially for a strategic acquirer such as PayPal that could fully exploit the synergies while delivering growth drivers to Amex, which it sorely lacks.So one option is to buy ready-made, tried-and-tested technologies and processes that American Express has for less than 10x trailing FCF, with the bonus in the form of a vast database of customers and industry and merchant business relations, which are extremely lucrative for PayPal. I believe this is the fast and efficient solution and should be pursued. The fact that PayPal has a larger market cap doesn't bother me, as the combination can be either financed with debt (healthy leverage would improve already solid ROE of such an investment for PayPal and its shareholders), or it can really be a merger of equals as opposed to a takeover.Dan Schulman also knows the key decision-makers at American Express and he could help make sure the cooperation or an outright merger happens, that the integration runs smoothly and that the synergies are really delivered in this merger, as opposed to many other company combinations.Five: Dan Schulman has a unique combination of experience needed to build a massively successful global digital payment platformDan Schulman has a very unique combination of experience from several related industries that could help him forge very powerful alliances and realize tremendous synergies by building a strongly integrated system. His experience encompasses the mobile and online payment systems, banking experience from American Express, mobile and prepaid payment experience and general telco experience from Virgin Mobile and Sprint (NYSE:S).This experience gives him a tremendous advantage in combining the background from mobile technology, payments, telco and financial services, which will be needed to build a strong integrated digital payments platform/network. For me, the CEO's expertise is a hedge for me in case PayPal doesn't merge with American Express or is not sold to another company. With his experience, I am confident PayPal will do extremely well even as a stand-alone company, and this is one of the rare cases that I actually think it is reasonable to assign higher growth expectation than what the currently visible growth drivers promise. I believe there will be unexpected synergies, new partnerships and new revenue streams as PayPal continues to rapidly evolve into a cutting-edge global digital payment platform and invent new ways to monetize the platform and networking effect.Also, PayPal, being much stronger in the digital payments and 21st century technology, such as big data, could help Amex monetize its valuable data about its customers and connect it with an e-commerce or other digital platform to monetize it through a robust big data solution. Spending patterns and targeted recommendations or ads come to mind. But there are many other synergies not described. I am sure readers can come up with many, and they may come up with several reasons in which this tie-up wouldn't make sense.Potential catalysts?Carl Icahn may not be done realizing value from PayPalAfter getting his way with the eBay-PayPal spinoff, I believe there are still long-term opportunities to realize more value from PayPal, either through PayPal being acquired or through a merger of PayPal with another company. I suggest American Express, but there are other options, as well.With ValueAct as an American Express shareholder, value will be realized, sooner or laterValueAct recently announced it purchased a less-than-5% stake at American Express. So far, this is not said to be a core active target, but the fund mentioned it would ""considers pursuing shareholder-friendly changes."" So, while it may take a year or two, I believe ValueAct's stake in American Express will be accompanied by steps to realize shareholder value eventually. It is possible that ValueAct will tread lightly due to a large stake that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) holds in American Express and the fact that it is considered a core position for Berkshire. However, if the proposed transactions or changes make long-term sense for Berkshire, ValueAct could have a strong supporter on the board.ValueAct would have owned both PayPal and American Express stakes, were it not for IcahnWhat is very interesting is that ValueAct had a stake in eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), as well. But it sold quickly at a gain following the stock pop after Carl Icahn's stake disclosure. So, were it not for Carl Icahn, ValueAct would now probably have owned a stake at both PayPal and American Express. At different times, ValueAct had access to each of the two companies and was willing to invest in each. While these may have been independent bets, my own opinion (not based on any official information) is that, if I were ValueAct, I would try to realize mutual synergies between the two companies. For my speculation to happen, ValueAct would have to cooperate with Carl Icahn and also with Berkshire Hathaway. This could be a win-win situation for all of them. A recent drop in prices of both companies could provide a good entry point, if ValueAct decided to get a new stake in PayPal again.Interestingly, Buffett recently praised Chenault (American Express's CEO) as being ""sensational."" Berkshire owns almost 15% of the company and considers the investment to be held ""permanently."" I cannot really imagine an AXP deal without Berkshire's consent, so this realization of value will likely take some time.RisksOf course there are many risks to the thesis that PayPal and American Express will be able to realize synergies through a merger or otherwise, and prosper and adapt to a highly competitive digital payments space. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple among others are trying to build their own payment ecosystems, which could leave PayPal and American Express vulnerable if left out completely in the future. The combination of three large and strong investors/activists (ValueAct, Berkshire and Carl Icahn) can actually complicate any merger talks. This may be a ""too much of a good thing"" situation.Valuation and investment implicationsMy conclusion is that PayPal is a very attractive company and investment. I would rank it as a great company at a good price, trading at a 22x forward P/E and a P/FCF below 20x. Given the double-digit FCF growth rates I expect in the foreseeable future, the price is reasonable but not great. However, the recent pullback provides a decent entry point for the long run.American Express is also attractively priced, trading below 10x FCF, especially for a strategic investor who can realize one of the many synergy opportunities available. Therefore, I am long PayPal (with high conviction and a large position) and I am also long American Express (with smaller conviction and a smaller position because of the lack of organic growth drivers if synergies are not realized.) PayPal is an excellent GARP investment, even if it remains a standalone company.I don't know whether the two companies will actually merge with each other, or if they will pursue their independent value realization paths, possibly through separate mergers of their own. This is all my speculation. I am not aware of any official information or even rumors supporting my speculation. However, with the synergies potential in both of them, combined with very strong activist players in each, I am confident that sooner or later, value will be realized for shareholders."
3621656,75175,2015-10-29T15:57:01-04:00,"PayPal's stock dropped due to a slight miss on Q3 revenue.This is unwarranted based on the company's strong fundamentals, improving margins, and diversified growth strategy.PYPL's revenue, EPS, margins, and net income all improved during Q3.The company also announced plans to monetize its popular Venmo app, a potentially huge source of new revenue.PayPal has positioned itself well for long-term success, and investors should ignore superficial selloff noise.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) released its Q3 results on Wednesday, reporting revenues of $2.3 billion on 15% year-over-year growth, along with 28% EPS growth and a 15% improvement in operating margins.The result? Just over 1% downside, as of Thursday's final hour of trading. The primary cause? Revenue that came in just $10 million shy of the analyst consensus ($2.26 billion reported versus $2.27 billion expected) and a marginal drop in PayPal's take-rate.Going beyond the top-line metrics however, PayPal is well positioned to outpace the overall payments industry moving forward, and is laying the groundwork for long-term success. Given its strong customer base, plans to diversify revenue, solid fundamentals and growing cash reserves, there's no reason for investors to buy into the sell-side noise over a supposedly ""mixed"" quarter.Strong FundamentalsA look at almost any metric from PayPal's Q3 results shows how strange it is to call the company's latest quarter ""disappointing."" The company posted improvements in nearly every metric, including revenue (up 15% year over year), EPS (up 28% year over year), and operating margins (up 15% year over year).Its improvement in operating margins is particularly notable, as PayPal operates on a global scale and managed to keep expenses in check despite continued expansion efforts and foreign exchange headwinds. It also highlights a key difference between PayPal and many of its peers - it actually makes money. While Square (NYSE:SQ) (whose IPO is forthcoming) recently updated its Q3 financials to show a $54 million net loss and First Data (FDC) posted Q3 net losses of $126 million, PayPal had a net income of $377 million (up from $288 million year over year). That's a significant accomplishment in a crowded, low-margin industry.Perhaps most importantly, PayPal expanded its market share during Q3 and grew mobile payments. Total payment volume rose faster than the industry average while mobile payments grew by 38%. As consumers (and in particular, affluent consumers) continue to shift toward mobile-first, PayPal's efforts to position itself as a mobile leader are beginning to show returns.Q4 Tailwind From eBayAlthough PayPal and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are now separate companies, their fortunes are still intertwined. This is particularly true for PayPal, as a significant portion of its revenue comes from eBay merchandise sales. That's a liability in the long term, and one that PYPL's management is working to actively limit by expanding its customer base and revenue streams. Right now however, it's a positive.When the two companies separated, eBay agreed to route 80% of its gross merchandise sales through PayPal for the next five years (essentially preserving the relationship as it existed before the split). That's relevant for PayPal investors because eBay not only beat Q3 expectations, but revised its Q4 growth estimates upward from $2.275 billion to $2.325 billion. Due to their arrangement, growth in eBay revenue also equals growth for PayPal.Powered by strong eBay revenue, PayPal should have no trouble beating Q4 estimates on its next release.Diversified Revenue StreamsAlthough the company's main product is its eponymous PayPal service, it has steadily acquired a roster of other products. Of these, the popular digital wallet app Venmo is the best known. It's also PayPal's best weapon against recent payment entrants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Square. One of the most intriguing pieces of news to come out of PayPal's Q3 earnings call was its plan to monetize Venmo. Starting in the near future, Venmo users will be able to use the app to pay for goods or services anywhere PayPal is accepted. Given that Venmo processed just over $2 billion in payments during Q3 (and saw growth of 200%), there is significant potential here.Outside of pure payment processing, PayPal has also seen success with its PayPal Credit loan program in which it lends credit (from its balance sheet) to small merchants and then collects it through PayPal transactions. While the service is still in the early stages and the company has yet to break out specific numbers (such as repayment rate, etc.), it's a smart initiative that could help solidify its relationship with merchants. It also provides an additional revenue stream outside of traditional payment processing. As the industry prepares for a potential slowdown in the coming year, additional services will take on greater importance. Developing such services now gives PayPal a first-mover advantage. This is an area investors should watch closely going forward.ConclusionPayPal has strong fundamentals, an expanding customer base, and multiple avenues for future growth (including Venmo and PayPal Credit). Taking into account eBay's improved forward guidance and PayPal's beat on most Q3 metrics, the recent selloff is perplexing and unwarranted. For investors willing to look beyond simple hit-or-miss headlines, PayPal is a smart purchase and a solid long-term bet."
3747386,79155,2015-12-10T11:28:18-05:00,I have severe doubts regarding PayPal's Venmo monetization project.Payment networks suffer from a chicken and egg problem.Mobile payment is not the answer for Venmo monetization.,"PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is on a tear after being spun off from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in July. Because it's now a separate company, its financials and disclosures can be examined more thoroughly. Just recently, it released its 3Q report for 2015. Something in it caught my eye. PayPal's management will start a Venmo monetization pilot in 4Q 2015. Select Venmo customers will be able to pay PayPal merchants with Venmo.Venmo is one of PayPal's most interesting subdivisions. For the younger generation, it's certainly the most popular PayPal product. The Venmo mobile app processed $2.1 billion in the third quarter of 2015 alone.On October 29th, 2015, Jim Swanson wrote an article entitled ""Venmo Monetization Means PayPal Is a Buy"" for Benzinga. Some financial analysts - Tarkan, for example, at Compass Point - are now beginning to jump on the bandwagon of Venmo monetization. And it's certainly true that if PayPal can successfully monetize a portion of the billions that Venmo processes, then PayPal has a bright future.But I'm a dissenter. I have doubts that PayPal will be able to successfully monetize Venmo as a payment method. There are two chicken and egg problems.Chicken and Egg: The MerchantWhat PayPal is trying to do with Venmo is expand its payment ecosystem into the booming mobile payment market. To be successful, Venmo first needs to address the classic payment chicken and egg problem. How can Venmo convince more merchants to sign up and accept Venmo/PayPal payments when not many customers are using Venmo to pay? How can Venmo convince customers to pay with Venmo?On the merchant side, it may seem as if Venmo has solved the problem by tapping into PayPal's existing merchant base and acquiring a sizeable customer base through a separate function. A large number of people download and use Venmo to pay back friends and acquaintances. However, for Venmo to benefit PayPal, Venmo would have to convince new merchants to switch to the PayPal/Venmo network. It's unlikely that Venmo will be able to do so without being able to show new merchants a preexisting user base.New merchants who don't already accept PayPal will be reluctant to adopt Venmo, independent of the establishment of a preexisting user base, because, for one thing, they already have complicated and expensive processing systems in place and have made due without PayPal. Everyone with a phone already has a card. Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Discover (NYSE:DFS) and American Express (NYSE:AXP) are firmly entrenched as defaults for payment. The value proposition of further spending and complicating payment systems is not compelling under those circumstances. In addition, absent a substantial pre-existing user base, if a merchant does not accept Venmo, he faces little danger of losing a sale. The competition would, in all likelihood, have no advantage over him. On the other hand, if a merchant already accepts PayPal, Venmo offers no additional benefit for PayPal on the merchant end. The merchant would use PayPal - Venmo adds nothing to what he already has.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay has tried to overcome the merchant adoption problem detailed above through sheer numbers and superior tactics. It streamlined its system to integrate into the issuers (the banks) as well as the merchants to create a more complete payment chain. And, because there are so many iPhones in the US, the preexisting user base statistic is more compelling. Even with these advantages, Apple Pay is seeing only limited success.PayPal has none of Apple's advantages.The only compelling value proposition that Venmo can offer merchants is lower processing fees. If the processing fees are low enough, and perhaps other sweeteners of some sort are added, Venmo might be able to convince merchants to enlist. That's sounds good in theory, but what does it look like in practice? Dwolla, a payment startup in Iowa, is trying to offering lower fees, and it's failing. In addition - and this may seem strange - lower processing fees can make it harder to convince users to pay through Venmo.Merchant adoption is a problem that Venmo does not have a clear answer to.Chicken and Egg: The ConsumerWhy should a customer pay with Venmo? The app is firmly ingrained in the user's mind as a way to bypass the inconvenience of checks and cash when paying back friends. The popularity of Venmo comes from the fact that people's friends cannot accept a card.But payment for merchant purchases is a completely different story. ""Convenience"" isn't a good answer to the question why a customer would want to pay with Venmo. A truly streamlined experience, the kind that Apple Pay offers, could provide the sort of convenience that would convince some customers to switch. But PayPal is not Apple, and Venmo is not Apple Pay. People don't mind using cards online.The only solution I see for PayPal is to offer above market rewards for payment through Venmo. If there is a strong financial incentive, in the form of rewards or discounts attached to Venmo mobile payment, and if the incentive is retained for a sufficiently long period of time, a critical mass of users might be reached.But that strategy probably won't work. If Venmo offers lower processing fees, their margins are at a competitive disadvantage. How, in that case, could Venmo offer better-than-market-standard rewards? They can't have it both ways, yet it must have it both ways.A Final QuestionIs PayPal monetizing Venmo to expand Venmo? Or are they monetizing Venmo to extract a financial benefit from the product?If monetization through merchant payments is PayPal's way of expanding Venmo's ecosystem, there is a small possibility of success. Venmo could offer lower processing fees on the merchant side and then bleed money by offering competitive rewards to customers. This strategy will be extremely taxing on PayPal's financial wallet, but over time Venmo might be able to build a proper payment network through merchant and customer adoption. However, the likelihood of success is slim. Payment networks are extraordinarily hard to build. The time it would take to build the network would probably come close to bleeding PayPal dry.If PayPal hopes to monetize Venmo through mobile payment for the purpose of actually generating money, then the plan is doomed from the start. For the reasons detailed above, mobile payment is not a viable way for PayPal to tap into Venmo's potential as a money generating asset.The only chance of success on the horizon is that of two paragraphs back: PayPal playing the long game and being willing to hemorrhage large quantities of money. But the chances of that are even more remote in light of the fact that PayPal is now an independent company that is publicly traded. It's doubtful that shareholders will be pleased with a cash heavy gamble that has little chance of success.ConclusionOne final possibility not aired above deserves consideration. PayPal may be thinking of using Venmo as a payment processor for debit/credit transactions run through it. Because Venmo is already popular among teenagers and young adults, PayPal may be trying to leverage their debit/credit payments with Venmo as a processor. This scenario, however, also runs into the same chicken and egg problems posed above, only with a more severe emphasis on the merchant end. There is no good reason why a merchant would switch to Venmo as a processor.In conclusion, don't buy into the Venmo hype - not now, anyway. As companies all eventually realize, successful monetization is tricky. PayPal may be able to figure out a successful monetization scheme for Venmo in the future. But mobile merchant payments is not the answer."
3540926,22148,2015-09-30T15:38:49-04:00,The recent split from eBay has PayPal trading at closing lows near $30.The digital payment processor trades at an attraction valuation multiple with solid growth opportunities.The upcoming Q3 earnings release and Square IPO provide catalysts for buying PayPal.,"The initial view of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) trading at a valuation of $38 billion and a forward PE of 21x estimates is that the stock isn't cheap. The digital payments processor was recently spun out of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) allowing the company to escape from the struggling online ecommerce business.PayPal isn't getting any love in the public markets with the stock trading towards a closing low near $30. With all of the financial stocks struggling in the current volatile market environment, does the recent dip provide a long-term buying opportunity?Payment ProcessorsSome investors struggling with the initial value of PayPal at a valuation in excess of eBay should consider the other payment processors. Both Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA) trade far in excess of the valuation of PayPal.Worth noting is that MasterCard had a similar valuation back in 2011 before the surge to over $100 billion now. In a similar situation, the process of going public freed up the payments processor to focus on growth initiatives.The value is most notable in that PayPal trades at a similar PE multiple though has higher growth potential. In addition, the newly public company has the ability to initiate growth opportunities and efficiencies that were constrained as part of a bigger company.As an example, PayPal is forecast to grow revenues in excess of 15% this year versus only 9% for Visa.The upcoming IPO of Square could provide a spark for PayPal. Seeing the speculation that the private payments firm is worth in excess of the previous funding at $6 billion will attract investors back to PayPal.Major Hiccup Down The RoadThe major hiccup in the payments industry is the potential that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay or the general success of startups like Square eventually lowers fees the industry participants can charge. Both Visa and MasterCard garner insane operating margins above 50%. In the case of PayPal, it grabs a take rate of 3.43% now. In essence, the company takes over 3.4% of net payment volumes.The interesting part of the story is that PayPal only has a 0.96% expense rate and a low 0.30% loss ratio leading to an incredible margin rate of 63.2%.Those type of margins attract new competition and that is the biggest threat to the growth and valuation story. Imagine a business gaining traction by offering a 2.5% take rate that still offers 50% margins.TakeawayWith growth opportunities from acquisitions like Xoom (in the works), Braintree, and Venmo, PayPal is positioned to outgrow the payment process leaders like Visa and MasterCard. The stock offers an appealing avenue to play the shift of money to digital methods across the globe with the deal to purchase Xoom.The upcoming Q3 earnings release provides a major point of emphasis as the initial release after an IPO or separation can provide surprises to the public markets. The recommendation is to start building a position on the dips and to use any hiccups around the Q2 report on October 28 to finalize a position for long-term growth."
3626176,25120,2015-10-30T11:54:47-04:00,"PayPal reported its first quarterly earnings report as a standalone business.While payments volumes keep increasing at a healthy pace, PayPal has seen a lot of pressure on its take rate.Current growth rates, great growth prospects and a strong balance sheet are all factors which create appeal.That being said, shares trade at 30 times earnings after backing out cash holdings which translates into elevated valuation multiples.While shares have lot of upside if growth continues for years to come, I am worried about the impact of continued pressure on take rates.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) released its first quarterly earnings report after the company has been spun-off from its parent company eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).The promise of a very strong balance sheet, a bright future and current growth has created a lot of optimism surrounding the shares. That being said, the share price performance has been quite disappointing since the moment of the spin-off. Ever since, shares have moved down from the $40 mark towards the $30-$35 region.While this correction has improved the appeal, I refrain from taking a position at current levels. Even as the multiples are not outrageous, given the market leading position and rapid growth, I am worried about potential for increased competition going forwards.Pretty Solid GrowthPayPal reported pretty solid third quarter results if you ask me, at least from a growth perspective. The key total payment volumes were up by 20% to more than $69.7 billion, as the strong dollar hurt growth by some 7%.Growth has been driven though a combination of customer growth and those customers getting more active, partially offset by a lower transaction size. The company claims that the constant currency growth of 27% in enabled payment volumes indicates that it is gaining market share. Unfortunately, PayPal did not quantify these share gains, nor did it provide a source to back up these numbers.The number of customer accounts was up 10% on an annual basis to 173 million users. The total number of transactions rose by 25% to 1.22 billion, indicating that customers have gotten more active. At the moment, an average customers is making 7 transactions a quarter, peanuts compared to the activity levels on an average bank or card account. This increase in activity and the strong dollar has weighted on the average transaction size which dropped by roughly $11 to $57 per transaction.The continued growth of online payments has been a key driver behind this grown as well as increased mobile adoption. The trouble is that this does not translate one-on-one into revenue growth.Revenues were up by 14% to $2.26 billion as PayPal's ¨take rate¨ has fallen by 15 basis points year-over year. Worse, these take rates fell by 16 basis points on a sequential basis, as the pace of this decline in take rates is scaring off some investors. That being said, the take rate still amounts to 3.24% of the enabled payment volumes which makes it somewhat expensive to wire large sums of money through PayPal.Margins Are Slowly ImprovingThe good news is that the business has managed to improve its margins despite the pressure on take rates. Operating margins came in at $330 million, translating into GAAP margins of 14.6%. This marks a 80 basis point improvement compared to the year before as increased scale allowed the company to effectively leverage sales &amp; marketing as well as product development costs.While these margins are appealing, I do think that they are not very large in relation to the 3.24% take rate. This suggests that the company´s costs are equivalent to roughly 85% of the take rate, or 275 basis points of the enabled payment volumes.GAAP earnings are somewhat inflated thanks to a one-time gain of $20 million as well as a very low effective tax rate of 14%. The reported net earnings of $301 million, or $0.25 per share on a GAAP basis, are therefore somewhat overstated. Excluding the one-time gain and assuming a 25% tax rate, earnings would have come in around $250 million.The closely watched non-GAAP profits came in at $0.31 as the discrepancy with GAAP earnings is largely related to stock-based compensation expenses.Premium Valuation, Very Strong Financial PositionAs outlined above, PayPal is on track to post GAAP earnings of roughly $1.2 billion a year, equivalent to roughly $1.00 per share with 1.23 billion shares outstanding. This includes the very low tax rate which implies that net earnings could face headwinds if the tax bill of the company would increase into the future.The other point of attention is the balance sheet which is simply very strong. The company holds $6.7 billion in cash, equivalents and other monetary investments. The balance sheet is very ¨clean¨ in other respects although PayPal has a very modest credit program to SMEs through which it is incurring modest credit risk.With the company holding cash balances of roughly $5 per share, and the shares trading at around the $35 mark, operating assets are valued at $30 per share. Given that GAAP earnings are likely to come in at roughly $1.00 per share on an annualized basis, the 30 times earnings multiple looks quite steep. This is certainly the case if the company might face a higher tax rate into the future.Management Remains OptimisticCEO Dan Schulman cites two key secular trends from which the company continues to benefit as the entire financial service industry is changing. Both the increased adoption of mobile payments and increase in digital payments are drivers of continued growth.The PayPal platform is no longer just about peer-to-peer payments but is rapidly broadening its solutions. Customers can pay for purchases at an ever increasing range of merchants as the company signed Macy´s, Shell and America Movil as new clients during the quarter.While Schulman has been very pleased with the momentum, there are some concerns. One primary concern is the drop in the quarterly ¨take¨ rate as the fourth quarter earnings guidance looks soft as well. The company anticipates GAAP earnings of $0.24 to $0.28 in the current seasonally stronger quarter, compared to earnings of $0.25 per share reported in the third quarter.Looking At The PotentialLet´s assume that PayPal can continue to grow enabled payment volumes for 20% until the year of 2025. While I realize that this might be an optimistic scenario, enabled payment volumes could grow to $1.5-$2 trillion under such a scenario. While this is and looks like a huge amount, it remains relatively small compared to enabled payment volumes reported by today´s industry leaders.I assume that take rates will fall from 3.24% at the moment to 1-2% of enabled volumes in 2025. This could potentially translate into annual revenues of $15 billion to $40 billion. Leverage of the cost base should allow the company to potential double operating margins to 30%, translating into after-tax profits of $3 to $8 billion a year.If I apply a market multiple of 18 times earnings and add $10 billion in cash holdings, PayPal might be worth anywhere between $64 and $154 billion at the time. This implies that shares might be worth anywhere between $50 and $125 per share by 2025.While this looks very optimistic, such a scenario translates into potential capital gains of 4-14% per year. This just illustrates the wide range of potential outcomes as it should be said that these calculations do not allow for potential share repurchases or dividend payments.How realistic is a $15-$40 billion revenue estimate by 2025? Lets look at the current leaders in the payment industry. MasterCard (NYSE:MA) generated revenues of $9.5 billion in 2014 and very fat operating margins of +50%. It is involved in processing nearly $5 trillion in annual payments although the difference in the ¨nature¨ of the business implies that MasterCard´s take rate is substantially lower.Visa (NYSE:V) reports similar ratios as it generates roughly $14 billion in sales on the back of over $7 trillion in annual payments, supporting even higher operating margins. It should be stressed that both companies trade at roughly 12-14 times annual sales.Given the much higher margins being reported by both MasterCard and Visa, direct comparisons in terms of revenues are pretty meaningless as the business model between these players and PayPal is structurally different. What should potentially provide comfort to investors is that these two companies have traded at premium earnings multiples of 30 times thanks to growth and superior franchise.Abundant Risks Continue To Make Me CautiousPayPal is in essence a market leader with a very strong balance sheet, trading at 30 times earnings at a time when it is growing revenues by 15-20% a year.As outlined in the scenario above, shares offer compelling upside if enabled payment volumes continue to grow at a rapid pace for years to come, and take rate compression is limited towards 2%. The trouble is that I find take rates of that kind still reasonably high for simple payment volumes as a range of established players and start-ups are all looking to gain share in the market.With take rates being under severe pressure this quarter, I think that a 2% take rate by 2025 is still optimistic. Increased competition from both tech-savvy start-ups and established players with large financial resources make that PayPal´s growth journey could become difficult. That being said, I have been positively surprised by the likes of Visa and MasterCard in recent years, always finding them too expensive to invest in.In either case, shares are still far removed from offering compelling upside as I see no margin of safety at current levels. To create compelling upside, I would at maximum be willing to pay 20-25 times earnings, translating into a targeted entry point of $25-$30 per share."
3691626,22148,2015-11-17T09:34:36-05:00,"PayPal is making strides to improve leverage after the split from eBay.Apple Pay, along with other payment options, are viable threats that are likely to cause volatility in the stock.The stock trades at an attractive valuation compared to the potential for digital payment growth that includes emergent mobile and P2P.","The interesting part of the PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) story is the digital payments provider has a business similar in size to MasterCard (NYSE:MA). The payments network provider is generally seen as a bigger company due to the market valuation of nearly $110 billion, but both companies are on pace to soon pass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion.My previous research recommended starting a position in PayPal during the late September dip. The question is whether investors should continue loading up with the stock after a rally over $35 and after reporting mixed Q3 results.Operating Expense LeverageThe split from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) provides the opportunity for PayPal to grow the business and fine tune operating expenses to improve margins that wasn't always a focus under eBay. In the last quarter, PayPal grew operating margins by 200 basis points to 20%. The number pales in comparison to MasterCard that generates margins in excess of 50%.As a strong example of the leverage in the business now, normal operating expenses that don't include transaction costs and losses only grew 7% with a large portion of those higher expenses due to more general and administration expenses after the split. The number trailed the reported revenue growth rate of 15% and currency neutral growth of 19%.The drive to control expenses improves the incentive to invest in the stock considering the strong growth initiatives. PayPal continues to grow both the number of active accounts along with the transactions per active customer. The market is increasingly moving to digital payments with the shift towards mobile and P2P payments providing solid growth for the digital payments provider.Mobile payments volumes continue to accelerate with 38% growth during Q3 to 345 million transactions. The Venmo P2P payments product grew total payments volume by 200% YoY to $2.1 billion.Apple Pay ThreatAs a note, the fears over Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) entering the P2P payments space via Apple Pay is a concern. The product reportedly will compete against Venmo, but the key point is the product only contributes a fraction of the $70 billion in payments volumes processed by PayPal and zero revenue at this point.Analysts are even mixed on the potential impact of Apple Pay. Gener Munster of Piper Jaffray sees a bigger concern of the service being incorporated into mobile browser payments by 2017. PayPal currently obtains roughly 24% of payment volumes from mobile though only 50% of that is estimated from iOS devices.Other analysts like Citigroup's Ashwin Shirvaikar feel the threat of Apple Pay is overstated due to likely issues with payments to non-iOS services amongst other potential stumbling blocks for Apple. The vast adoption of Venmo and a device-agnostic approach provides an advantage that Apple will find difficult to surpass.TakeawayWith all of the positive trends, PayPal trades at an elevated valuation of 23x 2016 EPS estimates. The key though is that PayPal generated 31% EPS growth in Q3. The company is riding the trend towards digital payments via mobile and deserves the high valuations due to consistent growth in customers and transactions.The company will face numerous threats from other entrants into the payments sector, but investing in the market expert at a reasonable price is generally the best option. The recommendation remains to buy the stock on dips caused by market fears while PayPal continues improving operations after the split from eBay."
3484956,64913,2015-09-02T12:09:14-04:00,"The numbers indicate that PayPal has the potential to become both a growth stock and value investment.On June 30, 2015, PayPal was holding almost as much money in the bank as the much larger Visa.Visa reported having $4.722 billion in cash and short-term investments, while PayPal reported a figure of $4.408 billion.The numbers clearly show that PayPal has almost as much cash on hand as some larger payment processing organizations.PayPal reported a revenue growth rate of 15.83% on June 30, 2015, and its new subsidiary, Xoom, reported a growth rate of 16.27% on the same day.","One often overlooked piece of data from quarterly financial reports provides proof that PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) is a classic value investment-a value investment that has tremendous potential for continued long-term growth.That number is cash and short-term investments, which are sometimes referred to by the slang terms ""money in the bank"" and ""cash on hand."" On June 30, 2015, PayPal reported having $4.408 billion in cash and short-term investments.This cash makes PayPal a classic value investment because it gives the payment processor a lot of float. The float is what allows PayPal to grow its ecosystem and hopefully generate even cash and float.The float gives PayPal the ability to make strategic acquisitions such as the purchase of money transfer service Xoom (NASDAQ: XOOM) and expand its operations without taking on too much debt. It also allows PayPal to enter potentially lucrative new areas of business such as lending and social media payments solutions.PayPal's Cash on Hand Rivals Credit Card CompaniesThe amount of PayPal's cash and short-term investments is reminiscent of one of the most popular classic value investments: credit card companies. One reason why classic value investors such as Warren Buffett love credit card processors is that they are flush with cash.On June 30, 2015, PayPal was holding almost as much money in the bank as the much larger Visa (NYSE: V). Visa reported having $4.722 billion in cash and short-term investments, while PayPal reported a figure of $4.408 billion. PayPal's cash on hand was also approaching that of MasterCard (NYSE: MA), which reported having $5.077 billion in the bank on June 30, 2015.This is quite extraordinary because PayPal had a market cap of just $41.34 billion and an enterprise value of $38.35 billion on September 1, 2015. In contrast, MasterCard had a market capitalization of $102.35 billion and an enterprise value of $101.02 billion, and Visa reached a market cap of $153.54 billion and an enterprise value of $151.92 billion the same day.The numbers clearly show that PayPal has almost as much cash on hand as some larger payment processing organizations, although it is still dwarfed by American Express (NYSE: AXP), which reported having $21.07 billion in the bank on June 30, 2015. PayPal also lags behind Discover Financial (NYSE: DFS), which had $10.6 billion in cash and short-term investments on June 30, 2015. Discover achieved a market cap of $22.55 billion and an enterprise value of $37.6 billion on September 1, 2015.Is PayPal the American Express for the 21st Century?The cash and short-term investments numbers also raise an intriguing possibility-that PayPal's cash could someday rival that of Discover or even American Express. PayPal, after all, does have some similarities to Amex and Discover. Like them, it provides a data-driven proprietary payment processing solution, and it seems to be growing fast.It reported a revenue growth rate of 15.83% on June 30, 2015, and its new subsidiary, Xoom, reported a growth rate of 16.27% on the same day. In contrast, American Express reported a negative growth rate of -4.02%, Discover reported a growth rate of .14% and MasterCard reported a growth rate of .93%.So not only is PayPal rivaling established payment solutions in cash but it is growing faster than they are. Some of the numbers PayPal itself reported seem to confirm these conclusions. For example, the number of active PayPal accounts increased by 11% between first quarter 2014 and first quarter 2015, while the number of payments per account increased by 9% in the same period. The volume of payments PayPal reported also increased by 22% between first quarter 2014 and first quarter 2015. During 2014 PayPal's overall payment volume increased by 26%, and its revenue grew by 19% while international revenue grew by 52%. Mobile payment volume grew by 68% to $46 billion.Some of PayPal's subsidiaries were growing at an even faster rate. The number of credit and debit cards on file at commercial payment processor Braintree grew by 128% to 129 million between first quarter 2014 and first quarter 2015. The volume of payments at social media money sharing solution Venmo grew by 299% during the same timeframe.If this level of growth were to continue for another 10 years, it is not hard to see PayPal rivaling Discover or even American Express in payment volume. That could give PayPal the kind of cash on hand seen at those companies and an incredible amount of float.The numbers indicate that PayPal has the potential to become both a growth stock and a value investment. It has the characteristics of both, which makes this company a good long-term investment because it has proven that it can grow its business and make money at the same time."
3539406,34421,2015-09-30T08:47:43-04:00,"PayPal was spun off from eBay in July to focus exclusively on growth in the global payments industry.Its large base of consumers and merchants gives it the critical mass to scale up new growth opportunities quickly in mobile payments.With no debt and $6.6 billion in cash, PYPL has a strong balance sheet to support both organic growth initiatives and acquisitions.Given the stock’s current valuation at 25.9 times projected 2015 non-GAAP earnings and 21.6 times 2016 earnings, I anticipate that it will deliver an annualized return of about 9%.","In the fall of 2014, with prompting from Carl Icahn, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) decided to spin-off PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), its payments business, to shareholders. The spinoff was completed on July 17, 2015. Each eBay shareholder received one share of PayPal for every eBay share owned. By taking this action, eBay's board decided to give independence to both PayPal and eBay's Marketplace so that they will be able to focus their resources solely on their own growth opportunities and avoid being left behind as their industries evolve.Superior Growth Potential in Mobile. In PayPal's case, most of the opportunities for growth are concentrated around mobile payments. By some estimates, transaction volume in mobile payments will grow 40% per year to the end of the decade. Earlier this year, Gartner predicted that mobile payments will account for 50% of all e-commerce payment volume by 2017, up from about 22% currently.A number of companies are vying for leadership in this nascent market. Large technology firms that focus on mobile, either through the manufacture of handsets (like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF)) or operating systems (Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android), are pursuing opportunities in mobile payments aggressively. Start-ups, like Square, Stripe and LoopPay, among others, are also contending for their slice of the pie.Many firms are being affected by the shift towards mobile payments. Consequently, they have an interest in how the industry evolves and may choose to pursue opportunities as they develop. These include the credit card companies (American Express (NYSE:AXP), Capital One (NYSE:COF), Discover (NYSE:DFS), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) and Visa (NYSE:V)), the credit card processors (including major money center banks, like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC)), specialty processors like Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and a host of smaller firms, and payments companies, like Western Union (NYSE:WU).For each competitor, the growth opportunity depends to a great extent on how they define their target market. Despite the projected rapid growth in mobile payments, the entire payments industry will continue to grow at a pace that is in line with a broad aggregate metric, such as consumer spending or GDP. Most of the growth in mobile payments, therefore, will replace existing payment methods, either at the cash register or online. Mobile may be key to the operating strategies of certain specialty retailers, like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), and especially for those that are targeting younger, tech savvy consumers (e.g. millennials).The greatest opportunity for companies focusing on mobile payments will probably come from getting consumers who currently pay with cash or credit cards to switch payments to their mobile phones. Yet, Gartner and others suggest that mass retailers may be the last to fully embrace the technology because the in-store experience still drives customer purchases.While a narrow definition of the market might appear to offer the greatest growth opportunities, a definition that is too narrow also presents challenges. Square started off by focusing on its mobile wallet, but has since expanded its product line-up to include payment processing, point-of-sale systems, invoicing and even payroll. Obviously, the market for digital wallets did not present a sufficient opportunity by itself for Square to build its business.PayPal's Position. PayPal is uniquely positioned to benefit from the continuing growth in digital payments, which includes mobile. The company currently acts as a middleman between consumers and merchants on the one hand, and credit card companies on the other. It allows customers to pay for their online purchases using their existing credit cards without having to enter their credit card information (i.e. card number, expiration date, CVV, name, address, etc.) on each merchant's website. It also offers protection to consumers against defective merchandise. For this service, PayPal receives a fee from merchants of about 1%.By keeping the credit card information with PayPal and avoiding spreading it around online, consumers are able in theory to reduce the risk that their personal information will be stolen. PayPal is therefore seen by consumers as a safer way to pay for online purchases. This has been especially important in marketplaces like eBay, where many consumers may be reluctant to disclose their personal information to ""mom-and-pop"" merchants. Accordingly, PayPal has for years been a leading trusted brand in digital wallets. It has also been listed among the top 20 trusted brands overall in countries outside the U.S., such as the U.K.The hacking of major retailers, like Target (NYSE:TGT), Neiman Marcus (NMG), Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and Home Depot (NYSE:HD), has prompted the credit card industry to require banks to issue new cards with EMV chips. Merchants are required to accept these new cards by October 1, 2015 or else assume the risk of fraudulent transactions. Security breaches may raise the appeal of PayPal's services, but the credit card industry's solution is expected to address most of the problem, at least for in-store purchases. It is not clear (to me, at least) whether and how this switch to new credit card technology will affect PayPal's efforts to sign up major retailers.Besides its digital wallet, PayPal offers credit directly to consumers (and therefore in competition with credit card companies). For many years, it has offered consumers the ability to make large purchases and pay for them over a 12-month period with no interest charges. Formerly known as ""Bill Me Later,"" this service is now called PayPal Credit.eBay acquired PayPal in October 2002 to help expand its online auctions business as well as pursue growth opportunities in the global payments market. In 2014, transaction revenues generated from customers and merchants on eBay's Marketplace accounted for 29% of PayPal's total revenues, down from 32% in 2013. eBay will likely continue to be PayPal's most important customer for some time, but PayPal has been seeking to diversify its customer base for many years, a process that has begun to accelerate with recent acquisitions.Positioned for growth. With the separation, PayPal is well positioned for growth. The company begins again as an independent company with a strong balance sheet that has no debt and $6.6 billion in cash and investments. It therefore has the financial heft to pursue growth organically and through acquisitions.PayPal has sufficient scale in the digital payments business to compete successfully against the likes of Apple and Google, while still retaining the nimbleness of a smaller company to pursue new growth opportunities. At the latest quarter end (in June), it had 169 million active customer accounts and served more than 10 million merchants. Over the 12 months ended June 30, its customers generated 4.4 billion purchase transactions worth $254.7 billion. That works out to 2.3 transactions per active user per month at an average price of just under $59. A large base of active users and substantial transaction volumes give PayPal a sufficiently large audience to support quick rollouts of internally generated or acquired services.With recent acquisitions and the projected rapid growth in mobile payments, PayPal sees its addressable market expanding from $2.5 trillion in annual total purchase volume to $25.0 trillion. Besides the expected growth in mobile, PayPal's addressable market is benefiting from the emergence and expansion of new growth segments such as money transfer, peer-to-peer lending, peer-to-peer payments and new forms of small business lending, such as crowdsourcing.Acquisitions. In recent years, PayPal has expanded its offerings through acquisitions. These acquisitions have supported and expanded its product and service offerings, especially in mobile. Besides its own branded payments platform, PayPal wants to become the sole payments processor for merchants, giving them access to all forms of payment, including credit cards, and the emerging mobile platforms of competitors such as Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay. PayPal also offers gateway products, like its Payflow Payment Gateway that link a merchant's website directly to the merchant's payment processing network and give the merchant the ability to accept payments through PayPal.In 2013, PayPal acquired Braintree to strengthen its position in mobile payments. Braintree offers a payments platform for merchants who deliver their services primarily through mobile apps. It has client-side and server-side software developer kits that allow the merchants to customize their own payment applications. It also offers gateways that connect the merchant's website to the merchant's payment processor. All Braintree gateways now offer PayPal as a payment option.Braintree also gives PayPal the ""One Touch"" technology that allows retailers to offer customers the ability to use PayPal for their purchases with a single click or tap (after they have registered their preference with the merchant). This eliminates the need to click or tap through several screens to complete the checkout process. Less friction may lead to improved yields. One Touch is now available to merchants in fourteen countries besides the United States.Along with the Braintree acquisition, PayPal acquired Venmo, a leader in peer-to-peer money transfer applications. Venmo allows friends and family to transfer money to each other's Venmo accounts and also to their bank accounts with mobile devices. This is currently a free service. While Venmo benefits from the float, it is not clear whether that is sufficient to make the service profitable or whether PayPal has plans to charge a fee for the service or expand its capabilities (for example, to allow for direct payments to merchants) in the future.Braintree was a key acquisition for PayPal because it broadened the company's product offerings in mobile, which is the key driver of growth within the payments industry. It raised the company's appeal with traditional merchants seeking to expand their mobile offerings and added a new class of mobile-centric merchants to its roster. The acquisition increases PayPal's appeal with younger consumers (i.e. millennials), who are likewise mobile-centric.Braintree also gives PayPal a foothold in the money transfer business, a segment of the payments industry that has excellent growth potential. Given its already significant market presence, PayPal was able to scale up Braintree's business quickly by offering Braintree's products and services to its existing merchant base after closing the acquisition.The Braintree acquisition demonstrates the many avenues for growth at PayPal. Its strong existing presence in online payments and new product offerings in mobile enhance its appeal with large retailers, a key target market segment for PayPal. Approximately 45% of PayPal's total payment volume (TPV) came from large merchants, like Home Depot and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), in the first half of 2015, up from 36% in all of 2012.In April 2015, PayPal acquired Paydiant, Inc., which allows merchants and banks to create their own branded wallets for mobile in-store payments, rewards programs and coupons. The acquisition price was $285 million.Also in April 2015, the company acquired CyActive Security, Ltd, a technology firm that predicts how malware will develop. The acquisition is intended to beef up PayPal's ability to assess cybersecurity risks and protect users, both merchants and consumers, of its payments platform. The price of this acquisition has not been disclosed.In July 2015, PayPal announced that it had agreed to acquire Xoom (NASDAQ:XOOM), a leader in the digital consumer-to-consumer money transfer business. Xoom allows consumers, mostly U.S. immigrants, to send money to friends and relatives in their country of origin. The company offers money transfers to 39 countries, including the top four receivers of money transfers: India, China, the Philippines and Mexico. Customers can transfer money directly to recipients' bank accounts or send cash directly to their homes or third-party locations. They can also pay bills directly on behalf of their recipients.The acquisition of Xoom builds on PayPal's acquisition of Venmo to expand its capabilities and presence in the money transfer business. The purchase price of $25 per share works out to an enterprise value of $890 million. For the 12 months ended June 30, 2015, Xoom had net revenues of $174 million and estimated EBITDA (excluding a $30.8 million charge for a loss on email fraud) of about $17 million. PayPal expects to close the acquisition by the end of the year and says that it will be dilutive to EPS in 2016.Operating Metrics. Although PayPal already operates at a large scale, it still has significant momentum, which will support its future growth. Its rate of growth in membership has been slowing, but transaction volume is still rising at a 20%+ annual clip.The company's active members increased by 11.2% to 169 million in the first half of 2015. That compares with growth of 13.3% in 2014 and 16.3% in 2013.Yet, the number of transactions was up 23.6% to 2.28 billion in the 2015 first half, better than the gains of 21.6% in all of 2014 and 22.5% in all of 2013. Thus, transactions per active account increased 10.7% from 12.2 in the first half of 2014 to 13.5 in the comparable 2015 period. That compares with average annual gains in transactions per account of 6.3% from 2012 to 2014.Active users make 2.3 transactions per month on average with PayPal. Management's admittedly ambitious goal is to lift average transaction volume per user to 2-3 per week.The combined increases in active users and transactions per user has helped to sustain solid double-digit growth in total payment volume (TPV). TPV increased 26.4% to $234.6 billion in 2014, faster than the 23.7% rise in 2013; but year-over-year growth and volume slowed to 18.2% and $130.5 billion, respectively, in the 2015 first half. Along with the slower rate of increase in active users, the slower growth in TPV was driven by a dip in average dollar value of a transaction from $59.75 in 2014 to $57.14 in 2015.This looks like a blip, because TPV per transaction had risen steadily in the preceding years. The change may be a function of mix (i.e. mobile TPV per transaction is probably lower than online) or probably the negative impact of currency. We will have to watch to see how this metric progresses in the quarters ahead to assess the implication for PayPal's future revenues and operating income.International Operations. Surprisingly (to me, at least), PayPal has consistently derived a little more than 50% of its revenues from outside the U.S. The international component of revenues is down slightly so far in 2015, but still above 50%, due to currency headwinds. U.K. is by far PayPal's largest international market, accounting for about 14% of revenues.Cross border transactions represent 24% of total payment volume. The acquisition of Xoom will add further to PayPal's international exposure. PayPal's international presence is a great benefit and source of future growth, but it exposes the company to downside risks from currency fluctuations (which it tries to mitigate through hedging) and to geopolitical events and potential declines in global economic activity and international trade.Operating Initiatives. In July, management reported that PayPal is two-thirds of the way through a three-year program to upgrade its back-end infrastructure. Through this initiative, it is upgrading its networks and data centers. The company expects to speed up transaction processing time by 50%.PayPal now boasts one of the largest and most agile software development shops on the planet. Through it, the company hopes to innovate more quickly and integrate acquisitions more effectively.In January, eBay's Board announced a restructuring initiative to streamline the organization. It said that it would reduce its workforce by 2,400 positions. I recall hearing somewhere that PayPal would reduce its own workforce by about 1,000 positions, but I have been unable to confirm that figure in any published report. The company recorded a restructuring charge of $49 million in the first quarter to cover the costs associated with this effort.At the end of 2014, PayPal had a workforce of 15,800, including 9,100 in the U.S. A reduction of 1,000 would equate to 6.3% of the total workforce. While this seems like a reasonable figure and should help to reduce operating costs, it is not clear how a reduction of that magnitude squares with the goal of continuing to grow transaction volume and revenues at a 20%+ clip. It is entirely possible that the streamlining of back office operations discussed above helped pave the way for this workforce cut without compromising the company's growth potential. However, if it has not done so already, management should explain how the workforce reduction relates to its future growth plans.Recent Financial Results. In 2014, PayPal grew revenues by 19.3% to $8.0 billion and operating income by 16.2% to $1.26 billion. Net currency effects reduced revenue growth by about 50 basis points. PayPal's transaction expense rate (i.e. transaction costs as a percent of TPV) declined from 0.99% in 2013 to 0.92% in 2014, mostly as a result of the growth in TPV from large merchants, who are less costly to serve. This decline was more than offset by higher sales and marketing, product development and general & administrative costs, all of which was due to strategic initiatives to grow the business, upgrade the company's technology platform and prepare for the separation from eBay. The company also incurred modestly higher loan losses on its PayPal credit portfolio2014 GAAP net income declined from $955 million to $419 million or by an estimated $0.40 per share to $0.33, due entirely to the recognition of $650 million of deferred income tax on accumulated earnings outside of the U.S., as required by accounting rules as a result of the spinoff. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding this extraordinary deferred tax charge as well as the cost of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and costs associated with restructuring and the separation, EPS improved from an estimated $0.90 in 2013 to $1.06 in 2014.In the 2015 first half, revenues increased by 15% to $4.4 billion, as a result of growth in active customers and transactions per customer, partially offset by the lower average TPV per transaction. Operating income increased 11.1% to $720 million. Foreign currency headwinds reduced revenues by $166 million, net of hedging. The FX neutral revenue growth rate was therefore 19.3%, which is roughly on par with the increase in revenues in 2014. Yet, currency also reduced operating expenses by $159 million; so the net impact of currency on operating income was essentially a wash. As far as I can tell, the company did not disclose the impact of currency on interim 2014 results.PayPal's transaction expense rate was essentially flat, but transaction expense as a percent of revenue increased by 40 basis points, because revenues as a percent of TPV declined. The cost of servicing large merchants is lower, but those large merchants also apparently pay less on a per transaction basis. Loan losses increased again, but costs associated with growth initiatives and the spinoff were not as much of a drag as in the second half of 2014. The company also booked $49 million in restructuring costs.2015 first half GAAP net income improved from a loss of $101 million to a profit of $560 million or from ($0.08) to $0.46 on a per share basis. Last year's interim results were impacted by the aforementioned foreign deferred income tax catch-up charge. On a non-GAAP basis, 2015 first half EPS improved from $0.56 to $0.63.Free Cash Flow. The company defines free cash flow as cash from operating activities minus purchases of property & equipment. According to that definition, PayPal's free cash flow improved steadily from $1.0 billion in 2012 to $1.6 billion in 2013 and then to $1.7 billion in 2014. So far, in 2015, free cash flow has been flat, which is consistent with management's guidance of $1.6-$1.8 billion for full-year 2015.A broader definition of free cash flow, which includes all investing activities, except for changes in investments (which are akin to cash) and changes in notes and receivables from affiliates (which seem more like financings) produces a lower free cash flow number, equal to about half of free cash flow using the company's definition. Even so, this alternative free cash flow measure does show improved performance in the three-year period ended December 31, 2014 and in the 2015 interim period.Liquidity and Capital. As noted, PayPal has no outstanding debt and $6.6 billion of cash. The company will spend $900 million in cash to acquire Xoom later this year. In May 2015, the company sold a $700 million credit loans receivable portfolio to investors. PayPal has also agreed to buy back (or arrange for others to buy back) the remaining outstanding balance of a loan portfolio with current outstandings of the $1.5 billion loan from Synchrony Financial, and the recent consumer finance spin-off from GE Capital, which is expected to close in October 2016.2015 Guidance and 2016 Projections. Management has indicated that going forward, it will only provide guidance for the full year and not for individual quarters. It will adjust its full year guidance based upon quarterly results as the year progresses.For 2015, management's guidance is as follows:This chart was included in management's slide deck for the company's 2015 second quarter results. It is no surprise, therefore, that the consensus EPS estimate (and my estimate) for 2015 is $1.25. I project revenues of $9.15 billion, up 14% from 2014, GAAP operating income of $1.45 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $1.57 billion. The non-GAAP EPS estimate of $1.25 represents growth of 17.9% over estimated 2014 non-GAAP EPS of $1.06. On a GAAP basis, my 2015 estimate anticipates net income of $1.21 billion and EPS of $0.96.For 2016, I project revenues of $10.8 billion, up 18% (assuming no headwind from currency), a 33.0% increase in GAAP operating income to $1.93 billion (which works out to a 200 basis point improvement in GAAP operating margin to 17.8%), non-GAAP earnings of $1.89 billion and EPS of $1.49, which is also consistent with the consensus estimate.Valuation. At the current price of $32.25 (Sept. 28), PYPL is trading at 25.9 times projected 2015 non-GAAP EPS of $1.25 and 21.6 times projected 2016 Non-GAAP EPS of $1.49.PayPal currently has no outstanding debt and $6.6 billion of cash. Assuming that $5 Billion of that cash is not required to run the business, PYPL's share price, net of cash, is $28.14. Deducting $0.07 per share from forward earnings to account for the assumed earnings on the $5 billion in cash (at a rate of 2% pre-tax), its forward non-GAAP P/E multiples for 2015 and 2016 are each about a point lower at 25.0 and 20.5, respectively.If, as assumed in my projections, PayPal can deliver two years of 20% EPS growth (from the end of 2015) before its business begins to mature, its stock would deliver annualized returns of just under 9%. My valuation model reduces projected non-GAAP EPS by $0.07 annually for the assumed investment returns on the $5 billion of excess cash. The terminal value multiple is 20, down from 25 currently. The terminal value (or projected share price) of $38.27 equals projected adjusted non-GAAP EPS of $1.71 times 20 plus the $4 in cash.Potential upside from my projected 2017 share price of $38.27 would require future EPS growth in excess of 20% and/or a terminal valuation multiple greater than 20."
3496156,79155,2015-09-08T15:12:53-04:00,Venmo's value to PayPal is questionable.First reason: Venmo's business model has structural cost issues that need to be resolved.Second reason: Venmo lacks a viable monetization scheme.Third reason: P2P payment is fast becoming a crowded market.Conclusion: PayPal should sell Venmo while the market is hot.,"IntroductionPayPal now has its own ticker on the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:PYPL). Because its destiny is no longer in the hands of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), PayPal investors need to take a closer look at where PayPal is and where it is going. The place to begin is with a close look at its portfolio. And it should start with its best-known unit: Venmo.Venmo has generated a lot of hype in the last few years. Acquisition of the company was one of the main factors behind PayPal's $800 million acquisition of Braintree in 2013. A recent article on Seeking Alpha describes Venmo as ""PayPal's Hidden Jewel."" Bloomberg was even more enthusiastic. Last year it ran an article with the headline ""Mobile Payment Startup Venmo Is Killing Cash."" But don't let Venmo kill your cash - the ""jewel"" is paste. In this article I will explain why.Venmo has positioned itself at the crossroads between social networking and payment processing. People use Venmo to pay back their friends. Person A links a credit card, debit card or bank account to their Venmo account and can then send money to a Venmo account of Person B. Person B can withdraw the money, depositing it in his/her bank account. Payments made through Venmo are published onto a social feed similar to Facebook. People usually attach few comments or titles to their payments.If a debit card or bank account is used to pay, there is no fee. If a credit card is used, there is a 3% fee (Venmo also charges a small fee for ""non-major"" debit cards. It's possible that Venmo has reached agreements with the large banks to eliminate the issuing fee. That, however, does not eliminate the network fee that every branded debit card charges.)Below is a picture of the Venmo process.First Reason: Venmo's Business ModelSo how does Venmo make money? Currently, it doesn't. In fact, it probably loses money.Because the P2P market is extremely competitive, Venmo prices its fees to cost. In practice, this results in small losses for many if not all credit card and debit card payments. This is because Venmo is largely dependent on the payment infrastructure already in place.When Person A pays Person B through Venmo, unless there are funds already present in Person A's Venmo account, the funds are transferred to Venmo through the Visa (NYSE:V), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Discover (NYSE:DFS) or American Express (NYSE:AXP) payment network. In the existing structure, these payment networks take a small slice of the fee. So do the issuing banks (the bank that gave the card to Person A). That means by the time Venmo receives the payment from Person A, it has to remit a certain percentage of the transaction to the payment network and the issuing bank. Venmo absorbs these costs. It has to if it is to make good on its claim that Venmo is ""free"" for its end-users. So A sends $100 to B, B receives $100 even though along the way Venmo ""gave away"" part of the $100 it initially received. In other words, Venmo pays the processing, issuing and acquiring costs so that B receives the full $100. The basic business model is essentially loss accumulating.To put it in simpler terms, if someone funds his or her Venmo account with a debit or credit card, the payment networks see that transfer of funds as a payment. All payments are subject to a complicated pricing schedule determined by the individual payment network (ex. Visa). Because Venmo wants this service to be free for their end user, they take on the payment processing fee. This is costly.Venmo also is vulnerable to chargeback fraud. If Person A pays Person B, Person B can withdraw the funds from his account to his bank account, and Person A can then initiate a chargeback. Because the funds of Person B are out of Venmo's control once Person B withdraws the funds to his bank account, Venmo will have to refund the chargeback to Person A out of its own pocket.Venmo does not have control over the chargeback rules for funds moving in and out of the Venmo network. The payment networks created the chargeback system to protect their users. Because the users are customers of the payment network, chargeback rules are built with a consumer bias. If Person A challenges Venmo, the payment networks will most likely side with Person A. These networks can reverse the funds out of Venmo back to Person A. The issue is that Venmo sometimes cannot get the funds out of Person B that Person A sent. This is because if Person B cashes out, the funds are moved through the ACH network. ACH chargebacks are decided by the banks. It is possible for the bank of Person B to not give back Venmo the funds unless Person B authorizes it. This is because Person B is the customer of the bank rather than Venmo. If Person B's bank refuses to return the funds back to Venmo, Venmo will just have to take the loss.Chargebacks are complicated and take a great deal of effort to challenge. Most large companies just take on the losses. However, because Venmo moves funds dollar for dollar, Venmo is in a very vulnerable position. If chargeback fraud occurs on a large scale, then Venmo could very quickly get bogged down in losses.Interestingly enough, chargeback fraud is something that Venmo has kept quiet on. This is probably due to the fact that they do not want to draw attention to it. This vulnerability is something that exists because of a hole in the whole payment industry. Venmo cannot fix it by itself.It's also odd that few publications make a comment on this vulnerability. This is most likely due to the fact that chargeback fraud is complicated and difficult to explain. Few people outside of the payment industry understand the chargeback process.Because Venmo piggybacks on existing payment networks, it is subject to the same problems and vulnerabilities that plague existing merchants. The only way it can reduce losses due to fee burdens and chargeback fraud is to run their payments through the ACH network. However, the ACH network in the US takes several days to clear payments. Will consumers be content to wait several days for funds to clear into their Venmo account? Years ago the answer might have been yes. Today the answer is probably no. That is why Venmo is currently originating the vast majority of its funds through traditional, well-established but costly payment networks.In short, Venmo's current business model has a cost structure that depends on Venmo's (and PayPal's) cash-stuffed pockets. There's no revenue stream in place and costs balloon with volume.Second Reason. So How Does Venmo Plan to Make Money?Venmo has been surprisingly vague on its plans to actually turn a profit. That's because the options are few and none of them look promising.Venmo will most likely never make money from P2P payments. The market is too competitive and there are too many free options for customers to ever pay for transferring money to friends. It is the general consensus that Venmo is focused on growing a user base and building a payment network on top of the user base.By building a business payment processing system on their network, Venmo could charge processing costs to the merchants and cut out middlemen like Visa and MasterCard. Venmo has been experimenting with this option for a while. Small merchants (e.g., cafes, food trucks) are the ideal customers for this kind of network. Lower processing costs are something every business wants. However, this monetization method is not viable.On the merchant side the value proposition - lower processing fees - is clear. However, what the value proposition is for the consumer is not clear. Why should I pay with Venmo when I could pay with my debit card or credit card? Dwolla, a startup based in Iowa, is currently facing exactly this problem. Until the consumer is presented with a clear value proposition, it is unlikely that Venmo will be able to build a payment network independent of Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express.In addition, Venmo users have no incentive to keep funds in their Venmo account. Withdrawing funds to their bank account makes more sense than letting them sit idle in a Venmo account. And if customers have no incentive to leave funds in their Venmo account, Venmo will end up processing debit card and credit card fees if it processes payments for merchants.And there is an additional drawback: because there is no incentive for users to keep funds in a Venmo account, fractional banking is not a possible income stream.In short, Venmo needs a viable monetization scheme other than a payment network idea, but none is on the horizon.Third Reason. CompetitionWith every passing day there are more players in the payment market. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Square, SnapChat, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) and recently Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have all recently introduced products in the same market space. Even PayPal accounts have a P2P function. Unfortunately for Venmo, the new players have major advantages that Venmo doesn't. Google has cash. Square has a separate income stream. And Facebook has cash, a separate income stream and enough legacy data to be able to penalize users for chargebacks.Of the players just mentioned, the most threatening is obviously Facebook. People can now send and receive money through Facebook Messenger. And even though Facebook does not yet support credit cards, it is ideally positioned to effectively mix social and payments. It has a huge user base dedicated to social media and a Mount Everest of cash to cover debit card and credit card processing fees. Venmo vs. Facebook is not David vs. Goliath. It's David vs. the World. Facebook has enormously more social users, a vastly more developed feed and an ocean of cash compared to Venmo's wading pool. Finally, if Facebook were to lay down relatively stiff requirements for account holders to utilize P2P payments, they could drastically cut down on chargeback fraud by penalizing users who abuse the system. Because users upload large amounts of data into their Facebook accounts, they are more likely to be honest.Conclusion. What Should Be Done?Such is the case against Venmo. What should PayPal do? The answer is: Use the current hype surrounding Venmo to its advantage and sell it while the air is still hot. In fact, PayPal should fan the flames if possible by emphasizing the fact that Venmo has a large number of users. Turn the users into cash. For a publicly traded company, that makes eminent sense. A publicly traded company is beholden to its shareholders and that means focusing on revenue and profit. Potential buyers include Google (Google Wallet is a flop) and SnapChat. SnapChat in particular has a large war chest.All of that said, Venmo is a fantastic product, and one I use daily. So do countless other consumers. But the focus here isn't the consumer but its value for its parent company, PayPal. For PayPal, Venmo may not be worth all the hype."
3526886,79475,2015-09-22T14:11:06-04:00,PayPal holds a dominant position in the rapidly growing e-commerce and mobile payment processing industries.PayPal is pursuing many avenues for growth and strategic opportunities for international expansion.Competitor comparison and discounted growth analyses allow us to find fair value for PayPal.,"­PayPal and the Payment IndustryThe online payment industry is a complex and rapidly changing environment continually plagued by new players, but with plenty of room for future growth. By now, most investors are familiar with PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL), the premier payment portal for both on and offline transactions. Seldom will online shoppers go to an e-commerce site and not see a PayPal logo at checkout. Though PayPal is a dominant money transfer and payment processing player, it is not without its competition.The first two of these competitors - the 'stuck' group, as I call them - are Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) and AliPay from Alibaba (NYSE: BABA). Both services offer a suite of products similar to PayPal that includes e-commerce, lending, bill pay, and capital for businesses large and small. However, both of these companies face a similar issue - adoption outside of their typical realm is difficult.Amazon can hardly get its 'Pay With Amazon' button on other e-commerce retail sites, as no retailer realistically wants to put a reminder of arguably their biggest competitor on the last step of the checkout. Alipay, similar to its e-commerce parent Alibaba, is a dominant force in the Chinese marketplace, but cannot escape the cultural suction that links it invariably to China and the Asian markets.PayPal, on the other hand, has a more trusted brand name in the space, which is pivotal for cross-border expansion. Its acquisition of Xoom, an international payment platform, has helped enable PayPal to increase its cross-border trade total payment volume by 23% in 2014. While these two players continue to try and push their way out of their current circles, they have found themselves tripping over the very circumstances that led to their initial growth.The second two of these payment competitors - the 'low adoption' group - are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) Pay and Android Pay from Google (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL). Though Apple has used its leverage to forge relationships with major retailers, it is facing heavy resistance from adoption by consumers. Android Pay, which launched on Sept. 10th, will likely face similar issues, as it tries to replace the already failed Google Wallet. These platforms face headwinds mainly due to the mainstream adoption of the NFC technology that powers them. However, once this technology becomes widely used and available, it will not be difficult for PayPal to leverage both its 165 million+ user base and 10 million+ merchant base to install its own version of this virtual wallet to be used in a manner similar to its current services.Where Will PayPal's Growth Come From?Prior to the recent split, PayPal was eBay's (NASDAQ: EBAY) main growth driver, and post split eBay is expected to take an $8 billion/year revenue hit. So what was fueling this revenue growth? Well, looking at the numbers, we can see PayPal had over 13% user account growth in 2014, 25% total payment volume growth, and 41% mobile transaction growth. Free to grow further outside of the parent company and to increase business with eBay competitors and move into areas such as online gambling, I am fully expecting these numbers to maintain double-digit growth for the coming quarters.I expect user growth and payment volume growth to remain steady, as PayPal begins to broaden its use cross-border, in larger retail stores, and in mobile payments through its acquisitions of Xoom, Braintree, and Venmo. Venmo, the mobile money transfer platform, has seen astounding adoption, particularly with the millennial generation. Over the past few years, Venmo has seen consistent quarterly growth rates between 30%-60%. As with any company, its growth will slow as it reaches saturation, but that point is still a long way off in this environment of rapid mobile-payment growth.LetsTalkPayments.comLastly, I believe PayPal has plenty of room to grow in the SMB and P2P lending spaces. Companies such as Lending Club (NYSE: LC) have shown this business can be extremely profitable and it is a space largely untapped by PayPal, but one that would complement its current services very nicely. P2P lending would allow many users who already have a PayPal balance to leverage that balance for capital growth, while PayPal, in its usual fashion, makes a small percentage of the transaction.ValuationTwo of the top metrics I look for in the age of the Silicon-Valley software companies is great cash flow and low debt. Due to the nature of the business, the low capex requirements should enable the health of both of these two metrics and seeing a disparity in these numbers often makes me think twice about an investment. However, PayPal is a company that certainly sits with a great cash position of approximately $4.5 billion, as well as an incredibly low debt of about $100 million. Its cash flow is also phenomenal, with $1.7 billion in FCF in 2014 and a nominal 8-10% of revenues used for capital expenditures.While these metrics may show that PayPal has a healthy balance sheet, one must compare PayPal to other companies in the industry in order to gauge its value. Comparing PayPal's valuation to its peers can be difficult, however, as the competitors mentioned above are not pure-play financial transaction companies. While comparing PayPal to its credit-based financial peers may not be a perfect comparison, it is the best option and will give us a fair look at valuations for the industry.While its price/earnings may seem high, looking instead at the more telling metric of Enterprise/EBITDA and the other metrics above show that PayPal looks relatively fairly valued compared to its peers. However, as we like to have a fair margin of safety in all investments, we will calculate our target buy price using a discounted growth rate.*2014 EPS is an EBT figure, as actual EPS was .34 due to a large tax expenseLooking at the two charts above, we can see that PayPal has had an average revenue growth of 19.06% Y/Y and an average operating cash flow growth of 19.37% Y/Y over the last few years. Likewise, we can see that EPS growth and future estimates average to a 17.60% Y/Y growth rate.Given the reasons above and consistencies with revenue and operating cash flow growth, we can assume PayPal will continue its 17.60% Y/Y EPS growth. However, because we are calculating our margin of safety, we will calculate PayPal's fair value using a 13% Y/Y EPS growth. This calculation gives us approximately 26% margin of safety on future growth. With 13% Y/Y EPS growth, PayPal will earn $1.03/share, $1.16/share and $1.31/share in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Applying the average P/E of the four competitors above (20) gives PayPal a value of $26.20 based on 2017 earnings and given a 26% margin of safety. Applying the average P/E of just Visa (NYSE: V) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA)(27.92), the two higher growth companies, gives a value of $36.58. Personally, I would prefer to apply the P/E of 20 with a slight premium for growth. Applying a P/E of 22 gives a buy price of $28.82 based on 2017 EPS estimates with a 26% margin of safety.PayPal's dominant spot atop the payment industry and its various channels for growth make it an enticing company to own. Though it could be considered fairly valued at current levels (~$33/share), I would suggest waiting to buy PayPal at $28.82. Buying at this price would allow for a significant margin of safety and reduction of risk for loss of principal in the event that PayPal fails to meet expectations. However, it also allows for a 26% return over the next two years should PayPal continue to perform and maintain its top-notch execution and growth."
3423096,40691,2015-08-10T12:35:28-04:00,Payments is an exciting industry for investment.PayPal's recent spinoff is an opportunity for investors.Square's rummored IPO is finally on its way.PayPal is a better investment than Square.,"By now we are all aware that the largest online payments company, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), hit the public markets this July. The long awaited spinoff from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) gives investors the opportunity to invest in a pure play online payment company. I've loved payment technology companies for some time and I invested in PayPal during the week before the official spinoff. Shortly following PayPal's split from eBay, PayPal's competitor Square was again in the news. It is being reported the Square has confidentially filed for and IPO.Square's IPO has been rumored for some time now, but it looks like we will finally see the company hit the public markets sometime later this year. Perhaps the overwhelming market support for PayPal's IPO convinced Square executives that the time was now. Who knows?All I know is the electronic payments industry is incredibly interesting and bound to grow in the decades to come. But which is the best investment vehicle to play the electronic payment tsunami? Square or PayPal or someone else? In this article I would like to explore the investment thesis behind both PayPal and Square. I'd even like to highlight the potential synergies to be had between the two companies.Why payments?Why not.Once upon a time, brick and mortar stores were the only way to purchase goods. But today, electronic payments are taking over. According to CreditCards.com, online e-commerce sales have nearly doubled from 2008 to 2014. Moreover, Forrester Research estimates shoppers will spend $370 billion online (including Web shopping on their phones) by 2017, up from $262 billion in 2013. I bet nearly everyone reading this article has bought something online recently.And, as we are becoming an increasingly mobile society, online and mobile payments are a great thesis. Mobile phones has increasingly become tools that allow consumers to access banking, payments, and shopping. According to the Federal Reserve's 2015 Consumers and Mobile Financial Services Report, 71% of the U.S. adult population has a smartphone. And,22% of all mobile phone owners have reported making a mobile payment in the last year. Up 17% from 2013!What is PayPal?I first experienced PayPal through eBay. PayPal is an online payment processor, escrow provider, lender, and an online bank account. But at the heart of it, PayPal is an online payment processor. eBay bought PayPal back in 2002 for $1.4 billion following the crash of the dot com bubble. PayPal soon become the most popular payment method on eBay, and eBay would eventually make PayPal the required payment method for most purchases.Since the acquisition by eBay, PayPal conquered the online payment gateway game. If you've ever built an e-commerce website or accepted payments online, you know that PayPal makes it extremely easy to connect. PayPal's focus on simple integration helped the company build its impressive network of over 10 million merchants accepting PayPal. Today, the company has over 170 million users. PayPal has truly built and solidified a two sided market.Alongside its core online payments business, PayPal has a mobile payments application, owns Braintree, and owns Venmo.How does PayPal make money?PayPal makes money off their merchants. PayPal is free for consumers. PayPal charges their merchants about 2.9% off the top for processing customer payments. Just last quarter, PayPal generated $66 billion in total payment volume with a resulting $2.3 billion in revenue. PayPal has other sources of revenue too. PayPal's now offers credit and financing products too.PayPal is doing excellent.For as long as I can remember, PayPal was the primary investment thesis for investing in eBay. On eBay's second quarter conference call last month, PayPal CEO Dan Schulman was very positive. Dan believes that it is an exciting time for PayPal, and I think so too.Two quarters ago, Schulman outlined four metrics that best measure the growth and health of PayPal. They are our topline revenue growth, the scale of PayPal's customer base, the engagement of that base as shown by transactions per active account, and free cash flow.Here are just a few of the positives from last quarter:PayPal is hitting the nail on the head and the company's momentum is exciting. According to the company, PayPal is growing at nearly double the rate of the payments industry. I believe the spin off from eBay will allow PayPal to accelerate growth by signing new and exciting clients such as Amazon.Analysts are bullish too. Out of the 17 analyst firms currently covering the company, there are 9 ""strong buy"" and 2 ""buy"" recommendations. Overall, analysts have a 12-month consensus price target of $45 per share. At current levels, analysts are predicting shares of the company to rise by 15% over the next year.What is Square?Square does one thing and they do it well. Payments. Square offers a wide variety of payment processing services and equipment. Square offers everything from POS systems, to online payment processing, to smartphone POS systems. I first heard of Square back a couple years ago when I saw one of the company's white iPhone card swipers at a flea market. Since then, the company has expanded its product offerings to include e-commerce, employee management, timekeeping, invoicing, and even small business financing.Since the company's founding in 2009, Square has raised over $590 million in 9 rounds from many of the world's top investment banks, venture capital funds, and even Richard Branson. It is being reported by Bloomberg News that Square has filed to go public via the Jumpstart Our Business Startups, or JOBS, Act, which lets companies with annual revenue of less than $1 billion file their documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission privately. Note: Square has not confirmed these reports.How does Square make money?In a recent MarketWatch article it has been reported that Square is losing quite a bit of cash. Sam Hamadeh, Chief Executive of PrivCo, which provides data and research on private companies, was quoted in saying that Square lost money on about $900 million in revenue in 2014, before its fees to banks and other partners.Like PayPal, Square is paid a percentage of each transaction processed on their platform. However, unlike major credit card companies and PayPal, Square does not charge an up-front flat fee just for making a transaction. The no flat fee benefit goes a long way in attracting small merchants with low priced goods.It is too soon to tell what Square's finances look like. The company, again, would not comment on the speculation.Square vs. PayPalWhen Square hits the public markets some investors will be choosing between PayPal and Square. Frankly, PayPal is the much better investment. PayPal's dominance online is tough to beat. And Square's losses, pricing model, and the uncertainty behind Square's management make Square a risky bet.I plan on keeping my investment in PayPal, I'm not selling for Square any time soon.Square with PayPal?As mentioned above, it is no secret that Square has had a for sale sign outside for some time now. Perhaps Square's investors and executives believe the public markets would put the company in a better position to be acquired. Could PayPal acquire Square? Maybe. I wouldn't ever suggest buying a company on the hope of a buyout. And especially not a company with as many variables as Square. But, if PayPal were to acquire Square they could instantly strengthen their POS exposure. I'm not sure how interested PayPal is in hardware and POS, but there is no doubting that the acquisition of Square would give PayPal a little more diversity.ConclusionIt is an exciting time for online and electronic payments. The recent spin off of PayPal presents an opportunity for investors to get exposure to an excellent pure play payments company. PayPal is hitting on all cylinders and don't expect growth to slow down anytime soon.If you are thinking about waiting for the Square IPO, keep your eye out for more financial data and clarity into the company's management going forward. Even after the Square IPO, I plan to keep my capital invested in PayPal as I believe the company is in a much better position to grow, innovate, and offer returns for shareholders."
3341915,25120,2015-07-22T11:09:37-04:00,PayPal's separation has finally taken place.The price action in PYPL and EBAY reveals the payment company has outgrown the traditional marketplace business.While the growth opportunities are enormous I am worried about competition and ¨price¨ risks amidst an elevated valuation.,"A much anticipated separation has finally taken place as PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has been separated from its parent company eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). While investors now have the opportunity to invest in a pure play payment business, I think the run-up in eBay's share price in anticipation of the separation leaves little potential for investors to enter a position in the payment business.While growth opportunities are large I have concerns. The biggest risk is not competition which could take away market share, but rather competition having a negative impact on ¨pricing¨. I believe that PayPal's fat ¨take¨ rates are not sustainable in the future.A Look At The Market PotentialDan Schulman is the CEO of the new PayPal in its crucial next stage of growth as a standalone business. After the company has become a dominant internet pay platform, the next challenge to overcome is successful adoption of mobile payments and the offline merchant business.Over the past decade PayPal has grown rapidly as it processed $235 billion in payment volumes in 2014, which was sufficient to generate $8 billion in sales. Roughly 20% of these payment volumes have been generated through mobile payments, as over 169 million customers now have an account with PayPal. The importance of mobile payments is increasingly rapidly as mobile transaction grew at a rate of 41% in the first quarter of 2015. This shows that mobile growth is roughly double the rate of the total business.While $235 billion is a sizable amount, PayPal states that it targets a $2.5 trillion e-commerce market. If this estimate is accurate, PayPal enables roughly 10% of the total payment volumes already. The real appeal is visible if one adds the total payment volumes for both online and offline shops which amounts to an estimated $25 trillion per year.This includes traditional services like money transfers but includes peer-to-peer and platform based lending as well. Based on these estimates, PayPal has just a 1% market share which leaves plenty of room for further growth in the coming years. This is even as Google Wallet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL) are actively working on their payment products.A Look At The Payment BusinessPayPal's revenue growth is pretty much based out of three components. This is the growth in the number of accounts, the actual payment volumes and the take rate. All of these three items see distinctive trends.At the end of the second quarter, PayPal had 169 million users which marks an 11% increase compared to last year. These users become increasingly more active as the number of payments rose by 27% to 1.08 billion transactions. The average transaction size fell to roughly $60, with total payment volumes increasing by 20% to nearly $66 billion.While this looks very appealing, and this is certainly the case, PayPal is seeing structural pressure on the ¨take rate¨. This rate fell by 10 basis points compared to last year. PayPal's revenues now amount to 3.43% of the enabled payment volumes. This is a revealing number as it shows how large PayPal's ¨cut¨ is.Often separated businesses or spin-offs, are saddled with debt by the parent company but this is certainly not the case with PayPal. The company will start its standalone corporate adventure with $6 billion in cash and no debt outstanding.The business is expected to grow sales by 15-18% in constant currency terms this year. This is in line with the long term target which calls for 15% growth. Non-GAAP margins are seen at 20-21%.The Standalone ValuationPayPal has grown to a business with $8.5 billion in sales on a trailing basis. The business is well diversified with 50% of sales coming from abroad. This means that the reported 16% growth rate in second quarter revenues was impacted by the strong dollar which shaved off 3% from the growth numbers.With the separation, PayPal will see some dissynergies as well which are estimated at 4-5% of sales. This means that non-GAAP margins are now targeted at 20-21%. Based on the current revenue base, non-GAAP profits could come in around $1.7 billion which is equivalent to the free cash flow outlook.The 1.22 billion shares of PayPal are now trading at $41 per share, valuing the company at $50 billion. After subtracting $6 billion net in cash, operating assets are valued at $44 billion which is equivalent of 5.2 times trailing revenues. The company has guided for low tax rates of 20% which combined with further growth in 2015 gives PayPal confidence to guide for full year earnings of $1.23 to $1.27 per share. This still implies a steep 30 times non-GAAP earnings multiple at the midpoint of the guidance.Competing ValuationApple Pay and Google Wallet are still small initiatives and these companies do not split out the financial results for these small standalone businesses.Other large payment providers and enablers include card companies such as Visa (NYSE:V), American Express (NYSE:AXP) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). While these business models are not the same, as these companies generally take much more credit risk, they can provide some insights into the valuation. For example, Visa enabled $1.75 trillion in payments in the second quarter, at a rate of +$7 trillion per year. With revenues coming in at $3.4 billion for the quarter, Visa's ¨take rate¨ is just 0.20% which compares to PayPal's rate of close to 3.5%.Visa's $170 billion valuation values the company at a high 13 times revenue multiple of $13 billion. This multiple exceeds the 5 times sales multiple for PayPal despite a much slower pace of growth. This can be explained by the fact that Visa's operating margins of roughly 60% are triple those of PayPal. Visa trades around 30 times earnings which coincidentally is similar to PayPal's multiple.Similar metrics apply to MasterCard. This business processed 11.0 billion transactions in its first quarter with a value of $1.06 trillion. Quarterly revenues of $2.23 billion result in a ¨take rate¨ of 0.21%, similar to Visa.A Potential Growth Case For 2025Let's for simplicity assume that PayPal is able to grow enabled payment volumes by 20% per year until 2025. In this case the enabled payment volumes could increase from a current $235 billion to roughly $1.5 trillion.This 20% growth rate seems feasible. Looking back 5 years in time, enabled payment volumes have risen from $72 billion in 2009 to $235 billion now, growing at a rate of 26% per year. Payment revenues came in at $2.80 billion in 2009, suggesting a ¨take rate¨ of 3.9% in that year. This rate has steadily fallen to 3.4% at current times. I believe that further reductions in PayPal's cut is needed in order to induce continued growth and wider adoption, certainly in the ¨offline¨ world.If I envision take rates of 2% by 2025, which is still a factor of 10 higher compared to payments enabled by card processors, revenues could increase to $30 billion. This means that a 20% enabled payment volume growth, translates into projected 13% annual revenue growth after taking into account the compression in the take rate.This is still a rather optimistic scenario in my eyes as competition could hurt these margins in my opinion. After all, a 2% rate would make it difficult to compete with traditional payment forms, especially in the offline world. Why would a $100 grocery bill be paid with PayPal if that costs $2 per transaction, while cash handling charges come in lower than that?With operating margins now coming in at 20%, I am willing to attach a generous 30% operating margin potential to the 2025 scenario. This means that margins will expand on the back of spectacular topline payment growth, only partially offset by lower take rates. In such a scenario operating profits could top $9 billion, translating into $7 billion in after-tax profits. This could justify a valuation of roughly $150 billion, three times the current valuation at roughly $50 billion.If this scenario turns out to become reality, investors could see potential returns of 11-12% per year. While these are decent returns, I think that the growth path is full of risks. In case ¨take rates¨ would come in at just 1%, revenues would ¨only¨ grow to $15 billion. In such an adverse scenario it will be an achievement to maintain current margins of 20%. This could result in after-tax earnings of roughly $2.5 billion which could support the current $50 billion valuation. This change in underlying assumptions would wipe out all potential capital gains in such a scenario.Final RemarksPayPal looks very appealing if you look at the huge opportunities, the consistent payment growth rates of roughly 20%, and dominant position. Besides the competition from the largest companies in the world I see another major risk. That is of course the ¨take rate¨ of PayPal which still comes in at 3.5%. This is a heavy charge and reminds me a bit about the hype surrounding cloud-based subscription margins until Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) started to very aggressively price its services.The same applies for PayPal in my opinion. While the $25 trillion opportunity seems huge, consumers and merchants are happy to continue to use cards or even cash with take rates coming in above 3%. While I expect that growth will continue, mass adoption will not take place until rates come down significantly, potentially pressuring margins.I feel that the market might be underestimating those risks, making me cautious on the prospects for now after PayPal has risen by a factor of 30 times since 2002. Based on these circumstances I have a cautious stance towards a potential investment. At current times I am not considering to take the ¨opportunity¨ to invest in the standalone PayPal business."
3355205,70385,2015-07-24T12:17:52-04:00,"PayPal is a viable, independently strong payment platform that can maintain solid growth.Four recent acquisitions give PayPal the latest mobile payment and transfer capabilities.PayPal can now work with large e-commerce sites like Amazon and Alibaba to expand its huge transaction volumes.","PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) has assembled an impressive team of mobile payment big hitters in preparation for its spin off and listing in July. Before the spin-off, parent company eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) acquired four companies with various mobile payment capabilities that would be bundled together with PayPal when the two companies split.It's my belief that the combination of these four gives PayPal depth and scale to immediately move into several new markets, and establish itself as a key service provider.President and CEO Dan Schulman said in a company release: Listing on July 20, PayPal Holdings started its first day on the Nasdaq with a market cap of 46.97 billion and a share price of $40.47 at the close. EBay closed the Friday before at $66.29, and after the split it ended the day at $28.57, actually up 2.4% for the day. If you were an eBay shareholder who had new PayPal shares distributed to you from the spin-off, the combination of the two stocks gave you a 4.1% gain for the day.Back in February, I told readers they should buy eBay shares well in advance of the spin-off to get additional return as latecomers wanting PayPal shares will buy up eBay. Those who did got a 17% gain based on Friday's close.PayPal's four businesses give it all the tech and mobile payment tools it needs. With this kind of firepower, I'd say the competition had better watch out for an unleashed PayPal.First, there's Venmo, a licensed money transmitter and authorized delegate of PayPal. The app allows mobile users to transfer money person-to-person as well as make payments with your bank account, debit card, your Venmo balance and even credit card (there is a service fee for credit cards).In the first quarter this year, Venmo already processed $1.6 billion in transactions, up more than triple the volume it did in Q1 2014. It's a widely popular app that competes with other apps like Square Cash, Apple Pay and Google Wallet. PayPal plans to have Venmo tied into the PayPal merchant marketplace by the early part of 2016.With Venmo, PayPal can offer the convenience of all the regular online payment methods through a mobile app plus allow users peer-to-peer money transfers. That's an important step to be seen as an all-in-one payment solution since Twitter and Facebook's Messenger app already offer P2P transfers.Next, Braintree gives PayPal the ability to help businesses set up online payment systems. With one-touch purchases, users can sign in and complete transactions easily, offering PayPal as well as other payment methods. Both online and bricks-and-mortar vendors get a simple but effective payment platform with PayPal prominently displayed to drive the brand and revenues.The advantage for PayPal here is that PayPal's brand name is well known among vendors and online purchasers, so with that connection businesses will be more open to Braintree being their payments service provider. After that, the vendors will usually stick with the service because it is too difficult and inconvenient to keep switching payment platformsPayPal acquired Xoom, a leading digital remittance company, at the beginning of July to expand into this new market. The traditional money remittance business, which market leader Western Union (NYSE:WU) is famous for, is as CEO Schulman said ""firmly ripe for disruption"".The $600 billion remittance market is especially big in countries where traditional banking and even internet banking is difficult to use. In developing countries, people may not have PCs, but most likely they have a mobile phone. Xoom can link up money senders and receivers through simple PayPal transactions.Through Xoom, PayPal enters this big market as a major player rather than starting out from scratch at the bottom. Customers will be more likely to remit money through a familiar service like PayPal, so that will drive transaction volumes.Lastly, there is Paydiant, a cloud based white label mobile wallet platform. PayPal bought the company last March. Paydiant licenses its transaction services to businesses, which then can create their own branded mobile wallet apps. One big client is MCX, a consortium of big-box retailers headed by Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT). These and other large-scale retailers can now offer the same services as Apple Pay and other third-party mobile wallets.Paydiant gives PayPal direct access to the huge purchase volumes of major retailers like Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy. Similar to how the big credit card companies make money on transactions, PayPal may not make a lot from each transaction, but it can with millions of transactions every day coming through by way of the major retailers.As you can see, these four subsidiaries open up new payments markets and avenues to work with major retailers where PayPal didn't have access to before. PayPal's next steps are to now link up more with other online retailers, the biggest being Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), that it couldn't up to now because of its connection with eBay.Amazon would be interested to have one of the most accepted, easiest payment platforms on its site to satisfy customers and drive sales. PayPal revenues would get a boost from the increased transaction volumes. That's a win-win situation. PayPal could make a similar deal with Alibaba. PayPal is definitely untethered to choose its new trade partners.These potentially huge transaction volumes will set PayPal up as an even stronger player in the payments market and add to the company's bottom line. Its four subsidiaries cover the latest mobile payment and transfer features and expand PayPal's addressable market.This is why I said earlier PayPal's competitors should be watching out for PayPal. PayPal can move on such a large scale that the newer yet smaller payment companies themselves aren't able toAs a stock, PayPal has very attractive growth prospects for penetrating its domestic market further, as well as to expand internationally. This is one stock that should go into investor watchlists from day one of listing."
3339325,86776,2015-07-20T13:21:44-04:00,"Back in 2007, PayPal was about 25 percent of eBay’s total revenues.Last week — and the last time that both would report as a single company – PayPal was just about half of eBay’s reported revenues.The competitors that I’d pop to the top of PayPal’s worry list aren’t Apple and Google and their “Pay” schemes, but Amazon and Alipay.","Much has been made of the merchant-friendliness (or unfriendliness) of all of the payments schemes in market today – plastic or digital, PayPal included. Merchants have been said to push back on new payments schemes because they cost too much or they don’t deliver access to enough of the right data or they cede control of the consumer relationship. At the end of the day, the payments scheme that merchants find most merchant-friendly is the one that brings customers through their doors because it’s how consumers want to pay them.Of course, merchants push back when presented with new ways to pay. It’s often non-trivial to enable something new – big merchants have lot of things to integrate with and small merchants have constrained resources.Today, when merchants push back on new things, it’s often because they’re not convinced that there’s enough consumer demand if they go to the trouble of changing their systems to accommodate it.That’s why, today, offline, the dominant payments scheme is still the network-branded plastic card.Of course, Apple Pay and Android Pay are betting that there will be enough EMV and NFC terminal refreshes to drive usage of their payment schemes longer term. And if that was all that had to happen, maybe in a couple of years, they might be right. But, there’d also have to be enough consumers with enough of the right devices using them at those stores to tip the engagement and frequency scales.That’s where one has to step back and map the next three to five years carefully to see how the consumer’s use of the device that every single one of them have all over the world – mobile phones and apps and access to the Internet – can enable a different offline experience – by doing it via an online experience.Will the economics of how these schemes come together influence that? On some level, but only because it will have to support and incent consumers to use it and use it consistently. Access to data will enable a variety of new business models that can better link the economics of the experience to the likelihood of conversion.And completion among all of these players will likely intensify as new initiatives emerge to embed payments in a host of financial services and commerce experiences, loyalty and incentive schemes are designed and launched, new merchant relationships are formed and more retail acceptance is pursued. And as a more consistent payments experience is designed that helps consumers move with ease across all of the channels they use to shop and buy today.And as I hinted at earlier, some interesting mashups form that could turn the notion of merchant-friendly as we are thinking of it today, on its head.Of course, payments is a highly competitive space these days and aside from the card networks (for now) no one really has it made in the shade. Payments and financial services is a scale business that takes time – and money – to develop. And change that requires consumers and merchants to buy in. And while mobile and the cloud have given innovators more opportunities to create options that could change merchant and consumer behavior, most of them won’t since they’ll never get to scale.So, that’s why — the harsh reality of being a public company and reporting results to Wall Street every 90 days notwithstanding — I don’t think that “Day 1” of PayPal as an independent payments company has them starting off behind the proverbial payments eight ball. In fact, the issue is whether they can use their newfound independence to increase their lead and keep everyone else way back as it has so far.You’ve heard my views on PayPal. Now here’s how a few executives — including one executive who used to run strategy for PayPal, the CEO of a partner company and a couple of competitors — in the payments business see it.And, of course, we’ll have PayPal at our Retail Reinvention summit in Chicago in two weeks to talk about all of this and more in one of their first public appearances since becoming a public company."
3458686,90935,2015-08-22T14:26:16-04:00,"P2P lending and Paypal Credit make sense on paper, but there are clues indicating that the company lacks basic know-how to succeed on them.Adding lending operations could depress valuation unless specific financial data is provided to investors.Current price provide a good entry point for investors willing to benefit from a high growth payment processor.","Introduction:On its investor presentation, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) makes clear to investors that it is willing to pursue other opportunities in the financial sector apart from payment processing.Among those options, there are two that worry me a lot since the seem to be built around a company weakness: P2P lending and small and medium business lending (SMB).My worries are based on two premises:PayPal needs to stay away from P2P Lending and Commercial BankingI agree that the company has a first mover advantage on the mobile wallet sector and needs to capitalize it. It just seems crazy that the company desires to do that by trying to add commercial banking to its service array.PayPal is an indubitable champion on payment processing. Therefore, P2P payments as well as money transfers are a natural match and will certainly add lots of value to shareholders.Trying to rewire the complete merchant experience is a noble cause. But is seems unnatural considering they are trying to do that building over a weakness. I believe any business should focus on its strengths while trying to manage weaknesses. PayPal seems to be ding the opposite onP2P Lending and SMB.Both business depend heavily on risk management. If you do not manage your risk well by lending only to customers that will pay their debts, you will start having high rates of delinquencies. It does not makes sense to try to build those business while you are miserable at managing your own delinquencies.According to 2Q2015, if PayPal was a bank, it would be a source of worry for the system due to its high delinquency rate over assets. One of the easiest ways to prove that, is by comparing the total amount of accounts past due regarding its total receivables.The former calculation adds to a 10.01% of accounts that are past due. Please note that the company classifies as current any debt that is between 1 to 30 days past due; which is not acceptable for a regular commercial bank to do.Things get spookier if you look at delinquencies over 60 days. Usually,those delinquencies are very hard to recover and with over $166 million, they represent 5.37% of all receivables.I understand that they are trying to emulate what Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) are doing with some of its affiliates. But there is a fact they seem to be overlooking:both companies were property of banks and credit issuers. Therefore, several banking know-how was transferred to them for several years and that is what has helped them manage the risks they sometimes incur.Being such a bad sport on the way receivables are managed makes me wonder if the company will be able to handle markets as P2P lending and small and medium business lending.Even though P2P lending does not imply credit risk for the company, the business model includes helping investors to recover delinquencies. Being unsuccessful on that arena will decrease PayPal's prestige. Eroding brand reputation while being famed for being the site in which investors suffer the biggest delinquencies on P2P lending is never a good idea.IMHO, the risk of devaluing your brand is not worth the 2% or 3% per transaction they might gross by pursuing this opportunity.In order to pursue SMB lending, the company has expressed it's desire to use OPM (other people´s money) or its current balance sheet. With a delinquency rate around 10%, PayPal would need to charge rates similar to what is seen on emerging markets in order to obtain a decent ROE.Assuming that 2.5% of receivables go all the way to trash and pass the 180 day mark, you would need to charge customers with rates similar to some credit cards.Financial cost from delinquencies: 2.56%,Financial cost of PayPal Credit bonds: 3%Current ROE (annualized 2Q205):8.79%Estimated financing cost: 6.048%I do not want to be pessimistic, but please consider that the former number does not include profits. Lending at that rate would imply that the company cannot provide a greater ROE on other ventures that seem easier to accomplish.I understand that acquisitions are a way to include the know-how the company is lacking, but I do not understand pursuing that option from a shareholder value standpoint.PayPal Credit could hurt valuation efforts.One of the biggest complaints investors had with Ebay and PayPal was having two different business under one parent company. Sadly, it seems they are not willing to learn from past experience and desire to mix two companies that are valued and priced completely different.Source: table compiled with finance.yahoo.com informationOn the former table one can see that PayPal's current valuation is closer to a payment processor. As well, it is clear that the banking business trades at much lower multiples.I really do not understand why mixing a low P/E , P/B business with a high P/E, P/B business. It just doesn't make any sense. Aside from that, I do not remember banks having gross profits over 50% as payment processors do. Therefore, Pay Pal credit is an inefficient allocation of capital considering other opportunities available for the company on the landscape. Pursuing that option will have two outputs:Whatever the case, they would be mixing two diverse business under one umbrella. There are smarter ways to participate on the lending business than trying to play bank with shareholders money. One example would be developing an alliance with a bank. Under such agreement PayPal would receive a referral fee, while all the risk remains in the bank's belly.How much is PayPal worth?Considering that PayPal has not embraced such foolish capital allocations as P2P lending and PayPal Credit, I am assessing its value as a payment processor.Company is currently growing at a 25% y/y rate. That is twice to what Visa and Mastercard are growing. In fact, PayPal is earning more money per transaction than them. As Visa and Mastercard charge around 1% percent for each transaction, PayPal charges 2.9%. This provides the company with a handsome profit over what is charged by its suppliers.Considering that hefty differential, I believe a 50% premium on P/E for the payment processing industry could be suitable the company. Current average for both companies is 30.35 P/E, therefore, PayPal could fetch a 45.53 P/E multiple.A 45.5 P/E figure would mean PayPal trading at $41.89 (8% upside). That number could be easily reached if growth remains as aggressive as it has been on former years.IMHO, this ""leader of the industry + aggressive growth"" combination seems appealing for consolidated companies that are willing to enter the industry or increase its online footprint. I believe the most natural fit for a takeover (if that eventually happens) would be from another payment processor.Note: As of today, not a single company has expressed interest on buying PayPal, it only seems feasible from my point of view.Conclusion:I do not like the fact that management is trying to capitalize on one of its weaknesses. Even though, I will start to add PayPal to my portfolio as long as the company remains growing on its core business.As the behavior of delinquencies on receivables represent a critical know-how that the company needs to achieve in order to succeed, I will be underweight on this ticker until I believe management is able to play bank successfully.Once that happens, I will make PayPal one of my biggest holdings as there is huge growth ahead in the online payment processing industryAlso, I am certain that there are several companies that see a natural fit when considering to acquire PayPal. Should that happen, investors could earn a great premium on its investment."
3342555,65803,2015-07-22T13:38:18-04:00,"The company has an extremely wide moat in mobile payments, which is of great value to potential acquirers.Although pricey, acquiring PayPal means the acquirer would have access to hundreds of millions of users and a dominant position in mobile payments.Apple, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, or American Express are most likely to acquire PayPal.","IntroductionPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) was recently spun off from Ebay (NASDAQ:EBAY), and for the first time in over 13 years, both the public market, and companies will be able to own a stake in the mobile payments behemoth. I firmly believe that PayPal will become a major target for acquisition by companies who are heavily pushing into the mobile payment space. Of the many firms that are developing their own mobile payment solutions, the primary companies with enough cash to acquire PayPal are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and American Express (NYSE:AXP). This article will lay out why acquiring PayPal makes logical sense for each of these companies, and how the acquisition would fit into their game plans.Whereas Ebay has been an underperformer recently, PayPal continues to grow impressively and has accounted for much of Ebay's growth over the past several years. Notably, PayPal recently eclipsed Ebay's core marketplace business prior to the spinoff.But that isn't all. PayPal is forecasting 15% + revenue growth over the medium term, while Ebay's core marketplace continues to grow at a mere 3-5% annually in revenue. From any acquirer's standpoint, a PayPal acquisition means buying in to a business that has robust growth, and would place the firm at the top of the leaderboard in the competitive digital wallet space. Not to mention, PayPal is closing in on 170 million active users.In a June 2014 study, PayPal was far ahead of any other digital wallet firm's solution in terms of usage (note: the following graph excludes Apple Pay, which has yet to demonstrate much usage around Apple's user base. In fact, almost 80% of iPhone users with access to Apple Pay have never used it.).Theses:AppleIn some ways, Apple seems like it really doesn't need to acquire PayPal, and is unlikely to do so altogether. The company already has an installed base of its Apple Pay solution across every iPhone 6, iPad Air 2, iPad Mini 3, and Apple Watch, and this infrastructure will only increase by millions of devices each quarter. On top of this, Apple has partnered with the major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, and American Express) as well as with a large amount of banks to support its mobile payments efforts.Source: AppleThis gives it the greatest level of overall depth into mobile payments out of the other potential acquirers, further pegging the question of why acquire PayPal. For Apple, it is all about competition. I think that dominating mobile payments could be the next big step in delivering a crushing blow to Android, achieved through maximizing the mobile utility made available through the Apple ecosystem. Simultaneously, Apple has also had difficulty with adoption of its Apple Pay system among consumers, so integrating Apple Pay with PayPal and having the two in Apple's portfolio would almost inevitably lead to much higher adoption of Apple's own platform.We also can't ignore the pink elephant that lies in the amount of cash Apple has. With over $200 billion, Apple is in the best financial position to acquire PayPal, seeing that an acquirer would likely have to pay a sizeable premium to the $50 billion market cap PayPal currently has. For every other acquirer, they would either have to issue a meaningful amount of stock and/or utilize the majority of their cash position. With this in mind, however, Apple has demonstrated strict discipline regarding acquisitions, with management seeming to prefer unlocking shareholder value through share repurchases and dividends.GoogleGoogle could greatly benefit from acquiring PayPal for many of the same reasons Apple could. Google's Android Pay and Google Wallet platforms trail Apple in the depth of financial institutions covered. For Google, a PayPal acquisition would be largely driven by a push for Android to be more competitive with the Apple ecosystem. Google has over $60 billion in cash, and has been far more aggressive than Apple with acquisitions, and has historically had a very diversified pipeline of product and service offerings (in comparison to Apple). In fact, Google has spent a total of nearly $25 billion over the course of its lifetime, acquiring 170 companies.Android beats iOS in terms of volume, and due to the low priced offerings available within the Android ecosystem, this trend is unlikely to change in the medium term. With the volume oriented approach Android took to the smartphone industry, Google could leverage the sheer (growing) mass of Android users that have access to Android Pay/Google Wallet alongside PayPal to produce an impact that could very easily place Google far ahead of Apple in the mobile payments space.It is also worth noting an interesting competitive dynamic between Apple and Google that raises the likelihood of a PayPal acquisition from either end. This is the dynamic of service offering, where one company introduces a product or service and the other feels compelled to develop or acquire its own to stay competitive. For example, Google Play and Google Photos are responses to Apple's iCloud platform. Something that demonstrates Google's degree of seriousness regarding staying competitive with Apple was its planned $14.1 billion acquisition of Spotify that came very close to closing but was then called off. This would have been the largest acquisition Google has ever made, with its Motorolla purchase in 2011 setting the company back $12.5 billion.Google may not have as much cash as Apple, but they certainly have the track record of pursuing large acquisitions. To be fair, Google's new CFO Ruth Porat seems to be very serious about keeping costs under control (predominantly by reducing operating expenses through hiring less people), so PayPal's more than 13,000 employees may clash with what Porat hinted at during Google's most recent conference call. You can read about this shift in Google's strategy in a recent article I published, here.FacebookAn acquisition of PayPal makes a ton of sense for Facebook, because of the billions of users they have across each of the platforms they own. With over 1.45 billion people on its primary Facebook platform, 700 million people using WhatsApp, 500 million people on messenger, and 300 million on Instagram, Facebook's platforms have the most impressive people infrastructure on the planet. Mobile payments is an arena that is naturally of great interest to Facebook, as the company doesn't really face a chicken and egg problem.Each social network (or communication derivative) Facebook owns has already experienced the wondrous power of the network effect, so adding in a mobile payment solution is extremely easy. The challenging part, however, is always adoption, and that is where an acquisition of PayPal could be just what Facebook needs. Apple and Google would have to wait a rather long time to match the capabilities in mobile payments Facebook has, since Apple and Android Pay currently require phones that either run the newest OS or have near field communication (NFC) technology.Facebook is no stranger to acquisitions, and in fact has made the single largest acquisition out of the five likely PayPal acquirers. The company's $11 billion war chest of cash is growing quickly and is a good starting point for making another large acquisition. After paying $19 billion for WhatsApp in 2014, Facebook showed that it was willing to bet big on future growth. When asked what his strategy was regarding monetizing WhatsApp, Zuckerberg responded:The type of strategy Zuckerberg gravitates toward makes an acquisition of PayPal seem to fit even more with his end game plan. Scale and grow users explosively, and then build a network of product and service offerings around that infrastructure. Indeed, PayPal fits into the Zuckerberg playbook quite well.AlibabaThe Chinese e-commerce giant could very possibly be an acquirer of PayPal, mostly to serve as a horizontal consolidation move that would extend the scope of Alipay to a more international scale. Alibaba has had massive success with Alipay in China, effectively dominating the third party online payment market with nearly 50% market share.Alipay has over 350 million registered accounts, more than double that of PayPal. What Alipay lacks, however, is international presence. Sure, PayPal looks relatively small in comparison to Alipay, but it definitely has the international breadth Alipay could associate itself with to penetrate non-Chinese markets.Alibaba has over $20 billion in cash, and arguably has the poorest financial discipline out of the other potential acquirers listed in this article. Sorry Jack Ma, but buying 50% of a Chinese soccer team for nearly $200 million isn't exactly the shrewdest capital allocation. Nonetheless, Alibaba invests heavily across many tech companies, leading many late stage venture rounds in private companies such as Snapchat, Lyft, Jet, and Didi Kuaidi. PayPal seems like a great fit for what Alibaba's objectives with Alipay are, but it will likely take greater financial discipline from management's end to go through with the acquisition due to how large of an undertaking it would be for the company.American ExpressLastly, American Express could be a logical acquirer of PayPal. It seems as though more and more places are no longer taking American Express, and although the company is the largest credit card firm in the world, explosive growth from Visa and Mastercard has recently put the company on the semi-defensive. All of the major credit card companies are pushing heavily into the digital wallet space, and realize that tangible credit cards will eventually become obsolete in much of the developed world.A bold acquisition of PayPal from American Express achieves twofold: 1) greatly boost growth especially in mobile, and 2) prevent Visa, Mastercard, or any other competitor from gaining even more traction. Granted, Visa and Mastercard have $6 billion and $7 billion in cash respectively, which is miniscule in comparison to American Express's $27 billion, but Visa and Mastercard are growing their cash piles quickly and it won't be long before they are in a financial position strong enough (they probably already are) to acquire PayPal.Out of all the potential acquirers, American Express faces the most near term uncertainty in its core payment business, as competition is becoming fiercer by the day. Acquiring PayPal might be just what American Express needs to reassess its dominance over its payment rivals. In fact, due to the conditions American Express is in, I'd argue that it is the most likely company to acquire PayPal.ConclusionPayPal's re-entrance into public markets makes it a key acquisition prospect for Apple, Google, Facebook, Alibaba, and American Express. The company's strengths uniquely play into each of the acquirer's strategy, and although the price tag of $50 billion is pricey, the deep moat and growth opportunities PayPal brings to the table justifies paying the premium for the company depending on the acquirer's position. PayPal's management isn't be overly enthusiastic about the company being acquired anytime soon, as after all, it just broke free from Ebay. Regardless, PayPal is an extremely attractive company to many potential suitors, and will eventually be acquired."
3336985,80285,2015-07-20T01:43:52-04:00,"Three reasons to sell eBay and buy PayPal.EBAY's growth in recent years has primarily been driven by PayPal's growth.EBAY taken alone is a mature company relying on 'legacy' assets.PayPal is a leader in its field, EBAY is no longer a top online marketplace.PayPal has far more potential on its own, EBAY is likely to face a slow decline.","While numerous analysts have chimed in on PayPal's (NASDAQ:PYPL) spinoff from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), we look at some simple, straightforward statistics to deduce why investors should avoid holding eBay shares and to accumulate PayPal.Disparity In Growth Rates(Source: SEC Filings)Comparing revenue growth between the Marketplaces and Payments segments, the latter's growth has been consistently higher, and surpassed Marketplaces revenue in the previous quarter. We observe a similar trend in terms of segment operating income.As observed, the gap has been rapidly narrowing over the years, reflecting PayPal's stronger potential.This disparity is significant when you consider the compounding effect over a longer period of time. It becomes clear that PayPal has far more potential for growth, and thus has contributed far more to the value of the combined company. However, the guidance from Ebay has said PayPal shares would start trading at 55% of the value of the combined company, which seems like a low estimate when we consider these figures.PayPal Has Superior Market PositionThe disparity in growth can be attributed to the fact that PayPal is a market leader in the online payments industry, while EBAY is no longer a market leader in E-commerce.Over the years, PayPal has actively pursued horizontal integration through acquiring smaller, fast-growing companies such as Braintree, and more recently, Xoom (NASDAQ:XOOM). Back in 2013, Braintree handled payments processing for an array of well-known start-ups such as Airbnb, Uber, Github and many others. Acquisitions such as these have enabled PayPal to establish lucrative relationships and continue their dominance in the online payments space. Similarly, their acquisition of Uber added more functionality to their platform, allowing users to make quick, easy and cheap remittances.A quick glance at this graphic here reveals that despite smaller and more flexible competitors such as Square and Stripe, PayPal still maintains its dominance in terms of reach, volume and its suite of features. Although Apple Pay presents a headwind for PayPal, they are in a strong position to withstand the challenge given the ubiquity of their platform and large user/enterprise base.eBay Lacks Competitive AdvantageOn the other hand, EBAY has become too reliant on its legacy assets. Amazon's onslaught in the US e-commerce market, along with the growth of smaller niche competitors like Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) makes eBay's platform seem increasingly outdated. Over a decade ago, eBay was the place for online shopping, with a wide array of both commercial goods as well as personalised, niche listings. Currently, Amazon is far ahead in terms of sales of general commercial goods, with higher traffic, more volume and more listings. As this infographic shows, Amazon dominates eBay with far more active users (244M vs 155M), higher traffic in terms of unique and recurring visits, as well as a greater number of listings. In that context, eBay's status slowly shifted in consumer's minds toward becoming more of a marketplace for personalized, used, vintage or niche hobby goods. However, with the tremendous growth of Etsy, sellers and buyers looking to transact for creative, vintage and artistic products.Essentially, eBay has been forced to retreat from several categories as competitors have taken market share and stumped its growth. This is well reflected in its stagnating revenues and income. Soon, eBay may become the ""backyard sales"" site, with its only foothold being in the auctions market for collectibles and unusual goods. This would undoubtedly shrink sales, with other competitors gaining a greater advantage over time.ConclusionA simply breakdown shows that eBay's shares should be assigned a far lower multiple after trading begins tomorrow. The prevailing trends suggest PayPal will continue to grow and prosper while eBay will face a slow decline. Hence, shareholders should consider divesting their remaining eBay shares to buy PayPal, if they wish to be invested in either. There is little doubt that PayPal will have greater flexibility and freedom to innovate as a standalone company, which will boost its growth prospects, whereas eBay would continue its slow-motion downward spiral.A final word of caution: at $44 Billion, PayPal seems a tad pricey for conservative value investors - the margin of safety is thin if any. SA Contributor Mike Gordon wrote an article detailing a valuation of PayPal. It's worth a read just to get a sense of the final values produced by the inputs used."
3342245,40691,2015-07-21T12:43:34-04:00,PayPal's Venmo offers excellent exposure to mobile payments.Venmo has built a monopoly to stay.Venmo is incredibly efficient and easy to use.,"Everyone's favorite online payment company, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), once again hit the public markets this week. Following a highly publicized spinoff from eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), PayPal shares traded higher by 5% on the first day of trading Monday, valuing the company at $50 billion. We all know PayPal for their exceptionally easy to use online payments product. Today, seemingly every online e-commerce website accepts PayPal.But in this article I would like to highlight a lesser known jewel inside of PayPal's portfolio. PayPal owns a newer mobile payments company called Venmo. Investors have been looking for exposure to the mobile payments industry for some time now. I myself have invested in the mobile payments thesis. With the growth of smartphone technology, mobile payments are an obvious area for growth. However, up until the last year, the mobile payments space has been very fragmented. I believe the mobile payments space is becoming less fragmented with Venmo's success. In this article I would like to highlight just another reason why I like PayPal as a long-term investment.What is Venmo?If you are unfamiliar with Venmo you may be a little put off by the name. But let me tell you, ""Venmo"" has become a verb within my social spheres. Venmo is a mobile payments company that operates through a mobile smartphone application. The company was founded in 2009 as a way to easily transfer money for small goods. In 2012, Braintree acquired Venmo for $26.2 million. In 2013, PayPal acquired Braintree for $800 million.Virtually everyone I know and meet now has Venmo. In short, Venmo works much like a mobile bank account. To get started, all you need to do is download the mobile application and enter in your debit or credit card information. From there, you can link your bank account much like you do with PayPal. From there, you can link your Venmo account to your Facebook account. Instantly, Venmo adds your Facebook friends to a Venmo contacts book.Source: VenmoFor example, if I go out to dinner with a friend and the bill is $20 for the both of us, I can ""Venmo"" my friend $10 to cover my half. Immediately, $10 is charged to my debit card. And immediately, my friend receives $10 to his Venmo account. Then, my friend can keep the $10 within his Venmo bank account. Or, he can withdraw the $10 directly to his bank account. Within 24 hours, usually the next morning, my friend will have that $10 directly deposited into his bank account.In full disclosure, I love Venmo. Venmo makes sending and accepting money from friends and peers instant and easy. The market has embraced Venmo, and the company has asserted itself as the go-to mobile payment application. Frankly, I've never heard of anyone asking to send or accept a payment via any other provider. Venmo does a great job embracing social circles. The application even has a stream to show the payments made between your friends. Once your social circle is inside Venmo, you don't/can't leave.How does Venmo make money?Venmo probably doesn't make that much money today. That being said, Venmo is just starting to get the ball rolling. Much like PayPal, Venmo charges 2.9% for payment sent via credit card. That is the only fee I've ever paid for using Venmo.How could Venmo make money in the future?Venmo could eventually offer a merchant facing product. Venmo could eventually collect payment processing fees from merchant clients. I've actually heard of merchants accepting Venmo payments. But today, it doesn't look like Venmo supports a sophisticated merchant payment processing system. But when that day comes, Venmo could make money off processing payments for merchants.Venmo could even get into the lending business. We've seen PayPal have success with their Bill Me Later feature. Perhaps Venmo could even offer lines of credit or a bill-me-later feature to its customers.On the other side of the equation, in the future, Venmo could likely make money off of its deposits much like a bank. I routinely hold a couple hundred dollars in my Venmo account. Venmo could likely earn interest off customer deposits. And since the company doesn't pay interest on customer deposits, we are looking at very low costs.Venmo's CompetitionVenmo, like every other company, has competition. I would consider Square Cash and Dwolla to be the two competitors I've experienced first hand.Square Cash works much like Venmo. But despite offering free money for signing up, Square Cash hasn't really caught on. I haven't heard anyone ever ask to ""Square"" Up.Dwolla has been on the market for a few years now. I first experienced Dwolla during my time in Iowa. Outside the Midwest I haven't seen anyone use Dwolla for payments. Dwolla is a bit clunky and the delays are tough to swallow.ConclusionMobile payments have been a hot topic for years now. Up until PayPal's spinoff this week, investing in a pure play mobile payments company has been difficult. I've invested in PayPal for exposure to online and mobile payments. I believe PayPal's Venmo application will continue to dominate the mobile payments industry. Venmo has built a monopoly in my social circles. I don't see myself or my peers switching outside of the Venmo sphere of influence anytime soon. Mobile payments platforms have faced the classic two sided market problem. Deep penetration into my social sphere has made Venmo the only option for mobile payments.An investment in PayPal buys exposure to the best play on mobile payments. While the profits may not be substantial today, the profits will come. Mobility is here to stay. Venmo is the hidden jewel within the greater PayPal portfolio."
3325615,73185,2015-07-14T18:24:56-04:00,"A spinoff from eBay on Friday, July 17 will allow PayPal to more freely pursue forward-looking acquisitions.The rapid growth and widespread use of Venmo among a younger audience will promote brand trust and recognition.PayPal to be a major player in emerging mobile payment market.Xoom to compete with Western Union for future global remittance market share.","PayPal (Pending:PYPL) is set to spin off from parent company eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) on Friday, July 17, and operate as its own standalone company. With PayPal's operations no longer tied to the slowing eBay segments, we feel the door will be fully opened to many future opportunities in the thriving e-commerce industry for PYPL. The company has proven to execute on acquisitions in the past, such as Venmo, and we expect this trend to continue. A strong balance sheet and confirmation of an aggressive approach to acquisitions from management and CEO Dan Schulman promises substantial growth to come.The successful and timely acquisition of Braintree in September 2013 brings optimism to the newly acquired global remittance company Xoom (NASDAQ:XOOM), as well as the prospect of future additions. Venmo's expansive growth in 2014 reveals managements ability to recognize and act upon growth opportunities early.eBay's acquisition of Braintree and Venmo, Braintree's mobile payments solution, will prove crucial moving forward as its social integration with finance strategically appeals to a younger audience. Although the actual amount of dollars transferred on transactions from this service remains subdued for that reason, it's the relationship the brand is building that we feel is of more importance. We feel a growing and younger user base, not transaction amounts and sales, is more indicative of opportunities for growth in all digital PayPal segments moving forward.This chart from Business Insider supports PayPal's growth from operations and acquisitions outside of eBay. While we expect a steady stream of revenue from eBay to continue, it is the opportunities outside of the parent company that offer the most upside.Mobile payments look set to be the future, or at least an integral part of point of sale transactions. The industry is off to a rather slow start as many consumers likely don't yet feel comfortable to be among the first to cash out with their mobile devices at the register. For this reason, we feel competitors like Apple Pay and Android Pay will actually help as catalysts in unlocking the multi-billion dollar industry.Available on Google Play and the App Store, Paypal Mobile Pay will have the chance to compete on nearly all phones for share of the mobile pay market. And with Venmo, Paypal looks to be among the early leaders in this industry, especially in the college market. With management's emphasis on building trust and transparency with no things like hidden fees, we believe many younger to middle age users will seamlessly transition between any of Paypal's offered services. Though Apple Pay and Android Pay will likely capture a large part of the mobile pay market given its mobile dominance, just 5% of the projected near $100 billion mobile pay market would roughly double Paypal's current revenues.On a side note - it will be interesting to see how Papa John's payment experiment directly with the mobile app Venmo is received. Papa John's new ""PayShare"" allows consumers to pay directly with their Venmo credentials. In a society seemingly always looking for the next social fad, Venmo's entrance into point of sale transactions should not yet be overlooked.As with Venmo, Xoom confirms management's active search for strategic acquisitions best suited for changing market conditions. We believe its largest competitor Western Union (NYSE:WU) will lose a large part if its market share to Xoom in the coming years. We feel Western Union's higher rates and physical customer-facing centers will soon be out dated and put Xoom ahead of the curve as they continue to optimize their margins in the digital sector. Paypal's established and trusted brand name will help many make the initial switch to the newly acquired company, while cheaper fees for almost every transfer will retain the new customers."

PayPal is the most trusted mobile payment solution in the United Kingdom; a survey by the Forrester research firm found that 43% of British consumers with iPhones would trust a PayPal digital wallet, but only 27% would trust Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay, and just 32% would trust Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). It should be noted that Apple Pay is not yet available in the UK, although Apple is expected to roll out the service there later this month.Brits actually placed more confidence in PayPal than in banks and credit card networks. Only 40% of those surveyed by Forrester said they would trust a mobile wallet provided by a bank or a credit card company.PayPal's own statistics also indicate a high level of trust in the company. PayPal customers made 11.5 million payments a day during the fourth quarter of 2014, leading to a total of 1.06 billion transactions. PayPal's Total Payment Volume in the fourth quarter of 2014 was 27% higher than for the same period in 2013. PayPal's Braintree payment solutions subsidiary had 104 million credit and debit cards on file in the fourth quarter of 2014, a 22% increase over 2013.Sorry, Apple, PayPal Is Winning the Mobile Digital Wallet WarThe same statistics show something else: PayPal has positioned itself to dominate the mobile digital wallet business with strategic acquisitions. PayPal processed $46 billion in mobile payments in Fourth Quarter 2014, a 68% increase over 2013. Around 25% of all payments made on PayPal in 2014 were made on digital devices.PayPal's app-based payment solution, Venmo, also showed substantial growth; in Fourth Quarter 2014, Venmo's payment volume was 29% higher than in Fourth Quarter 2013. Although the amount of money moved through Venmo is still rather modest, in 2014 the Total Payment Volume for Venmo was $2.4 billion.Venmo entered PayPal's stable of payment solutions when it acquired Braintree Inc. in 2012 for $26.2 billion. What's truly interesting is that Venmo is only one of Braintree's many capabilities. Braintree is so versatile that it could be PayPal's secret weapon in the digital payments wars.How Apple Pay Boosts PayPalBraintree provides a solution that allows businesses to process payments made with PayPal, Bitcoin, Venmo, Apple Pay, Android Pay, Google Pay and credit and debit cards. That means PayPal is in a position to profit from the popularity of Apple Pay and the many other payment solutions that could soon be coming our way.Braintree is poised for growth because of all the new digital payment solutions appearing. Several such solutions are already on the horizon, according to news reports. American Express (NYSE:AXP) is planning to roll out its answer to Apple Pay, Amex Express Checkout, Re/code reported. A consortium of British banks and retailers is planning to launch an Apple Pay competitor called Zapp in October, Forbes reported. The Merchant Customer Exchange, or MCX, a consortium of companies that includes America's four largest retailers (Wal-Mart, Kroger, Costco and Target) is working on a payment app called Current C.PayPal is well-positioned to take advantage of all these new digital wallets with Payidant, which it acquired in March for $280 million. Payidant licenses a technology that lets retailers take digital wallet payments through their own apps. Payidant is what allows customers at some retailers to use Apple Pay to make payments even though the store's cash registers do not yet accept the app.This means that the growing popularity of Apple Pay will only boost PayPal. Not only will it process Apple Pay payments through Braintree and Payidant but the popularity of Apple Pay will drive the acceptance of other online payment solutions, which Braintree and Payidant will also process. PayPal is poised to grow with or without its strong brand.This makes PayPal much like some of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) subsidiaries, such as McLane. It provides the infrastructure that makes other companies work. McLane operates a network of distribution centers and trucks that supplies 45,000 retail locations with everything from chewing gum to beer. Just as Berkshire profits from retail sales without owning the store, PayPal will make money regardless of whose solution you are using.PayPal's Next Generation AcquisitionsPayPal is also creating an infrastructure to provide international payments. It purchased the online transfer service Xoom Corp (NASDAQ:XOOM) for $890 million. Xoom allows people in countries like the United States to transfer money directly to people in developing countries like El Salvador online for a small fee.Like some of PayPal's other acquisitions, Xoom has experienced a lot of growth. The transfer company reported a year to year revenue growth rate of 23.6% on March 31, 2015, according to data from yCharts. In contrast, Xoom's two main competitors, Western Union (NYSE:WU) and MoneyGram International (NASDAQ:MGI), reported falling rates of revenue growth. Western Union reported a revenue growth rate of -2.21% on March 31, 2015, and MoneyGram reported a rate of -11.8% on the same day.Even economic crises like the one in Greece could create more demand for some of PayPal's solutions. The Greek government effectively blocked almost all transfers of money outside the country from bank accounts, NBC News reported. That action forced PayPal to shut down its digital wallets in the country, but it could drive customers to some of PayPal's other solutions.The banking restrictions could force Greeks to turn to old-fashioned money transfers to get money from relatives abroad, which could help Xoom. After all, Xoom allows you to send money abroad without standing in the line at the grocery store.It has increased interest in Bitcoin in Greece, Reuters reported. Thanos Marinos, the founder of Greece's only Bitcoin exchange, BTCGreece, told the news service that his customer base grew by 400% in May and June. Greeks are turning to Bitcoin because they are afraid the Euros in their bank account could be exchanged for worthless drachmas (Greece's defunct currency) if their nation leaves the Eurozone.Naturally, increased use of Bitcoin could increase the number of transactions PayPal processes. Bitcoin is a logical fit with PayPal because at some point, people will need to purchase goods and services with the crypto-currency in the real world.PayPal is not only a strong value investment; it has a very bright future. If you are looking for a technology stock that could be around and growing for a long time, check out PayPal."

In the president's letter to future stockholders in PayPal's Form 10 filing, about 162 million active customer accounts processed payments on the platform. PayPal also saw their total payment volume increase by 26% over the last 12 months. These numbers are a result of an increase in demand and also a network effect that PayPal built by being one of the earliest companies to allow online users to transfer money. This network effect, along with a growing brand name, should continue to give PayPal the opportunity to compound earnings for a long time.SpinoffeBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has decided that it will spin off shares of PayPal to existing shareholders in order to better position the company for success going forward. On a recent CNBC interview, eBay CEO John Donahoe said that spinning off PayPal from eBay will give PayPal focus, strategic flexibility and an ability to move quickly and decisively in response to the accelerating change in the online payment industry. PayPal began trading on a when issued basis, but any transaction before then won't settle until the close of July 17. Each eBay shareholder will receive one share of PayPal common stock for every share of eBay common stock.ManagementDan Schulman, formerly the President of the Enterprise Growth Group at American Express (NYSE:AXP), is the President of PayPal. Dan is 57-years-old and was born in Newark, NJ. He attended Middlebury College where he received his Bachelors in Economics and NYU Business School where he received his MBA. Dan has been a member of the board of directors of Symantec since 2000, and was selected as chairman of the board in 2013. Other positions he held are Advisor at Greycroft Partners LLC, President of Prepaid Group at Sprint Corporation (NYSE:S), and founding Chief Executive Officer of Virgin Mobile. He also received the New Jersey Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award and was named FierceWireless' Top 25 Most Powerful People in the global wireless industry.Judging from his bio, Dan looks to be an ideal fit for the job due to his experience working at one of the largest global payment companies, American Express, where he was responsible for developing its mobile and online payment services strategy. In his letter to future PayPal stockholders, he wrote, ""our stockholder value proposition is simple. We strive to provide superior returns to PayPal stockholders by maintaining our leadership position in the payment industry and investing in the growth of our newly standalone company."" While the mention of adding shareholder value is very encouraging, it is too soon to give him credit for this, and shareholders will have to wait and see if this ends up happening.Financial HealthPayPal is very healthy from a financial perspective. eBay's debt-to-equity ratio hasn't exceeded 25%, so I don't see them unloading a bunch of debt onto PayPal during the spinoff. Also, PayPal's long-term liabilities for 2014 were $386 million or about 5% of total equity. This is very low and isn't concerning at the moment for potential shareholders.Relative ValuationSource: Data provided by MorningstarNote: Market Caps are at the close of the market on 7/13/15 and ratios are based on financial data at 2014 fiscal year end.*Market cap estimated based on the shares trading on a ""when issued"" basis.**Visa is on a September fiscal year.What's most notable about PayPal compared to its peers is the high P/E ratio and low net income. Net income was $778 million in 2012, $955 million in 2013 and $419 million in 2014. The large decrease has been described in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of their Form 10 as primarily the result of an increase in income tax expense of $713 million that resulted from the recognition of deferred tax liabilities. These deferred tax liabilities relate to undistributed foreign earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries of 2013 and prior years. PayPal says that they recorded non-GAAP net income of $1.3 billion in 2014, which would give PayPal a P/E ratio of 34. Although 34 is still pretty high, it is much more reasonable than the P/E multiple of 105 and likely reflects PayPal's future growth assumptions.In addition to the price-to-earnings ratio, P/S and P/B ratios for PayPal are trading higher than industry peers but not as much as MasterCard and Visa. MasterCard and Visa look way overvalued on a P/S ratio, and MasterCard looks way overvalued on a P/B valuation. If we adjust for the large tax expense in PayPal's GAAP earnings, GAAP net income would have been $1,103 million, resulting in a P/E ratio of 40. This adjustment is based on PayPal's disclosure about their GAAP effective tax rates for 2012 and 2013. The GAAP effective tax rate for 2012 was 13% and the effective tax rate for 2013 was 12%, so I took the average of these two years. So 2014 GAAP income before taxes of $1.261 billion and the 12.5% effective tax rate results in adjusted GAAP net income of $1.103 billion. Overall, the adjusted P/E of 40 is too high for my liking.Discounted Free Cash Flow ValuationI like to use free cash flow to estimate the value of a company because it represents the cash that the company earns after deducting the expenditures to maintain the business and it adjusts for non-cash charges that can skew net income. PayPal has great potential to be a consistent capital compounder because it doesn't require large expenditures to maintain the software they use to run their business as opposed to a telecom company which requires large expenditures to build or maintain its networks. Capital expenditures in 2014 were only 6.1% ($491M/$8,025M) of revenue. PayPal defines their free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, including the investment in software. What follows is a discounted free cash flow model to try and derive what the intrinsic value of this company is. I assumed the growth rate for the next five years is 13% and the terminal value growth rate is 2.3%. The five-year growth rate is based on PayPal's three-year average of 13% return on equity (2014 ROE was adjusted by using the 12.5% effective tax rate discussed above) and the 2.3% TV growth rate was based on the 10-year US Treasury bond at the close of the market on 7/09/15. The 10% discount rate isn't based on a WACC and is arbitrary.Free Cash Flow: 2014 - $1,7282013 - $1,6022012 - $1,054Price/TTM FCF = 25 ($44B/$1.728B)DCF Model:Growth Rate: 13%Discount Rate: 10%10 yr Treasury: 2.3%Total Discounted FCF: $9,373.15MTerminal Value FCF: $3,256.95MMultiple: 13 (equal to 1/(.10-.023)Terminal Value: $42,298.10MDiscount Rate: .62Discounted TV: $26,263.79MTotal Discounted Value: $35,636.94MPrice:$44,000MMargin of Safety: NoneBased on the assumptions above, the total value of PayPal is about $8.5 billion overvalued based on the estimated trading value of $44 billion. The multiple of 13 is a pretty low multiple in my opinion to pay for a consistent capital compounder which PayPal has the potential to be. If I use a multiple of 20 in the above scenario, the total value would come out to $49.78 billion. This would result in a margin of safety of 11.5%. In the chart below, I listed some other scenarios based on the five-year discounted free cash flow model.ConclusionThe characteristics of PayPal's business model make this company a very attractive candidate for investment. Their numbers have been pretty consistent, despite the drop in 2014 net income due to the tax expense, and they have provided lots of free cash flow for eBay shareholders over the past three years. Also, their total payment volume growth has grown 26% year over year as of Q4 2014. I estimated a value of this company at $35 billion using a 13% growth rate for FCF for five years, a 2.3% terminal growth rate, and a discount rate of 10%. At the $44 billion trading price, this company looks to be overvalued, but the multiple I used was only 13. Companies that consistently earn positive free cash flow and require little cap ex to maintain their business will normally get a higher multiple. If investors are willing to pay up for this company, they may find the $44 billion price attractive. I don't see myself paying $44 billion, but I would be willing to buy between $35 billion to $40 billion if it gets there.Since PayPal shares will be spun off to eBay shareholders, this can be a big catalyst for investors. Companies that are spun off tend to go down in price once they are spun off. This is usually the result of portfolio managers receiving shares of a company that they aren't familiar with or because they aren't allowed to hold the company due to reasons that have no relation to the fundamentals of the business. For example, eBay is a part of the S&P 500, but I don't see anything mentioning that PayPal will be a part of the S&P 500 once it is spun off. Therefore, all the exchange traded fund managers will be forced to sell PayPal once it is spun off for no reason other than they aren't allowed to hold companies that aren't part of the S&P 500 index. This can be a big catalyst for investors that are interested in owning PayPal."

At first, the company was giddy. Then, after a series of daily declines, the company finally found some footing.eBay's (NASDAQ:EBAY) spinoff of PayPal is more aptly seen as PayPal's spinoff of eBay. It's only logical, seeing as PayPal's out-of-the-gate market cap of $45 billion is roughly 30% higher than eBay's market cap of $34 billion.The true spinoff-ee aside, the two companies are keeping close relations. eBay and PayPal have vowed to better protect buyers by continuing to share information regarding transactions. The bottom line is that after their breakup, eBay and PayPal are still friends.And this is important.

PayPal is a company with a huge presence in online payments, and one that has separated itself from the major credit card companies.It's also a company that teenagers - and parents, too - seem to trust. The company's mission statement has been the same since its inception, and it's a leading reason why consumers trust the service so much. In 2001, the company wrote: ""Breaches of our customers' privacy and our security measures [...] could diminish severely consumer confidence in and use of our product."" Therefore, PayPal is committed to ensuring the safety of its product for all customers and for years down the road. This is why I feel comfortable having my Seeking Alpha compensation sent to my PayPal account.A Telling AnecdoteI used to buy and resell Nike (NYSE:NKE) shoes. My main transaction platform was actually Facebook (NASDAQ:FB); there are a plethora of groups dedicated to buying and selling sneakers. I speak from experience when I say the following two things: (1) not a single person in any of the groups was above the age of 30, and (2) not a single transaction was completed with Western Union (NYSE:WU) or a credit card. They were made with trusty-'ol PayPal.While I understand that the niche groups on Facebook account for a measly portion of PayPal's sales, I'm interested in hearing what Facebook has to say about the commerce features it has added, such as the one pictured above. If the company has good things to say about them, this can only help PayPal. It would be a true testament to the way young consumers are paying for things, and support the thesis that PayPal is a modern form of payment that appeals to the younger generation. While it isn't a reason to buy PayPal right then and there, I'd definitely listen to what Facebook has to say.Moreover, the transactions that are processed by PayPal are almost instantaneous. It is reassuring for many to know that the money they were supposed to receive is, indeed, in their account. It allows them to, perhaps, send a package a day earlier. On that note, one aspect that coincides with eBay's buyer protection program is PayPal's customer support. PayPal is committed to ensuring the fairness of commerce. If a buyer claims that he or she did not receive the item he or she purchased, PayPal almost always sides with the buyer, and makes sure that he or she is reimbursed.ValuationSeeing as PayPal isn't a credit card, I don't think it's fair to compare the company to the likes of Visa (NYSE:V) and MasterCard (NYSE:MA). That said, PayPal has become credit-card-esque by offering loans (""working capital"") that have a similar appeal to the loans offered by Visa and MasterCard.The pen name ""working capital"" is a testament to PayPal's millennial appeal. To be a student in college with a mound of preexisting loans, the last thing one would want is to take out another one. While I'm not suggesting that PayPal is attempting to trick people into using its service under a misnomer, I do think that this service typifies the company's penetration of the younger generation. There's something cool about ""working capital,"" and something scary about a ""loan.""It's actually quite a brilliant plan. PayPal takes a fixed, customer-determined percentage of sales per day until the loan is paid back. Per the video on PayPal's investor relations page, there are no late fees, no periodic interest and no hidden fees. There is no credit approval required, and you pay off your loan as you get paid.Again, while I don't think it's extremely fair to compare PayPal to Visa and MasterCard, the three are analogous enough to make one. From a price to earnings perspective, PayPal is trading at 25.5x 2017 earnings, Visa is priced at 21x 2017 earnings and MasterCard sits at roughly 19.5x 2017 earnings.It is clear that based on the companies' prices to earnings, PayPal is the most expensive. However, most analysts are bullish on the name. Something must be missing.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Looking out to the year ahead, PayPal has the most promising earnings growth. The following metrics are all derived from the mean earnings estimates for the respective companies.First up is Visa, whose 2016 earnings are expected to grow by 16%. Next is MasterCard, which has estimated earnings growth of 19% in 2016. Then there's PayPal, whose 2016 earnings are expected to grow by 20%.Whether a company with a comparatively high P/E but higher growth is a buy is not up to me. I am long PYPL because I understand the company's appeal to the younger generation. You may find teenagers annoying, but don't use them as an excuse not to profit. I think the recent pullback represents an opportunity to buy PayPal at a bargain."

PayPal expects to fund the transaction with cash and expects the deal to close by Q4. This transaction expands PayPal's services in the international markets given Xoom's presence in Brazil, China, Philippines, India and Mexico. Although Xoom will operate as a standalone entity, PayPal will likely cross-sell Xoom's services to its customers in the US (~68m or so). I see this to be a strategic and accretive acquisition given the ramp up of mobile payments from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which could eventually become a threat to PayPal's future growth as they expand their payment services. I remain bullish on PayPal.PayPal implication: For PayPal's 165m worldwide users, the acquisition of Xoom will give them more options to send and receive money using Xoom's services on both mobile devices and PCs. PayPal is already in 190 countries but Xoom will help PayPal expand into additional 37 countries such as the Philippines, China and Brazil, all of which are key mobile payment markets in the long-term. More important, this acquisition simplifies money transfers on a global scale, making it affordable to many people around the world. From an economic perspective, this will no doubt pressure existing economics and drive industry consolidation as subscale money transfer agents cannot compete against those with a larger scale. Finally, from a defensive point of view, this solidifies PayPal's position in the mobile payment and money transfer space as it will eventually cross paths with Google Wallet and Apple Pay in the future.Western Union (NYSE:WU) implication: PayPal's acquisition of Xoom puts WU in a tough spot as a leading global player in the money transfer market. Although WU is highly convenient, it is also the most expensive from a service point of view and customers are becoming price sensitive on money transfers as the business becomes more transparent and commoditized. This challenges WU's market position and its global scale. I expect PayPal/Xoom to scale its own network globally to challenge WU's position and provide transparent pricing for the consumers. This will ultimately drive down industry pricing and pressure WU's existing economic model.Moneygram International (NASDAQ:MGI) implication: Similar to WU, MGI is also susceptible to disruption from low-cost leaders. Recall last year that WMT selected Ria to offer domestic white label services that led to a 37% decline in its US business. PayPal/Xoom could have a similar effect on MGI and it is likely that MGI may be hit the hardest given its smaller scale relative to WU. So what is the future for MGI? Industry consolidation may be the best alternative and the current 5.5x EBITDA is actually very attractive. The issue is that the business has been on the sale block many times before without any deals reached. If any deal is likely to be reached, it would have to wait until 1Q16 when its WMT contract (22% of its revenue) expires. Until then, potential buyers could get a better picture of its financials and leverage before making any meaningful acquisition."

We must create an outline of price activity for eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) as the coming split takes place. I admit a relative/conservative take on IPOs in general, and believe a safe window of investment considerations can be made for each investor to ponder.PayPal has been granted a very high 17% company growth rate for next year. For this reason, PayPal's spinoff will possibly share some resemblance to post-IPO price surge - just like Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) IPO.PayPal's introductory stock charts could possibly provide a series of massive green candlesticks that will inevitably reach exhaustion and a radical downturn, due to day trader sell-off. The technical environment in this break-out period will yield great trades, or great devastation for late buyers.Long-term investors, with no intention of flipping their trades, will probably do best to buy PayPal immediately on spinoff morning - or to wait past the introductory period altogether. Buying later, after surge confirmation takes root, could lead to buying just as the turnaround starts to happen.IPO ConundrumThe fact is, IPO frequently have a high plateau at the beginning, which then collapses for a while, hits a bottom, remains there, and finally begins to build again. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was a prime example how a prized IPO faltered.However, PayPal makes money today, and Facebook's revenue during IPO was still in question overall. This is why I would brace for an Alibaba-style opening for PayPal. Over-excitement will lead to tumult. For longer term investors, great pain comes from buying a position that goes deeply upside down multiple times over a month. If the PayPal ticker skyrockets, investors who are in-the-money will start dumping shares.eBay's Stock: Not as Good as PayPal?eBay has just recently released growth projections for both eBay and PayPal. eBay gave itself a 0% to 5% growth projection for both of the next two years, 2016 and 2017. Comparatively, PayPal was given a 17% growth projection.Those who invest in eBay today have been invested in PayPal all along. When the golden goose that is PayPal is removed from eBay, even huge eBay fans will have to decide where their money should go.eBay's stock has performed well, but in 2013, the company was declaring 13% growth. It was also denying a PayPal spin off. Today, eBay is declaring its growth to be 0% to 5% - so the old stock motion does not translate to eBay, post spin-off.As investors, we must ask ourselves one simple question:Anyone who answers that question directly sees the potential for a sizeable cross-section of eBay investors to possibly dump its stock in favor of PayPal. This is not to negate eBay - it just follows the most likely route of attention.For this reason, I project that while PayPal's stock will possibly bubble upward for a while, eBay's stock might suffer a period of unnatural setback - as 7% to 10% of eBay stockholders transfer the majority of their shares to PayPal exclusively (I feel this is a conservative estimate). Simply put, long-term buyers, and mega-investors buy stocks they are comfortable with. The comfort here goes to PayPal, in terms of future growth.This situation might create an opportunity for any initial eBay inflation period to provide decent short opportunities. I don't really recommend it, though. eBay is still a great buying environment in many ways, and the market isn't going to spontaneously forget that. Also, valid pricing of these stocks could buttress eBay stock for a smoother-than-expected introduction into its solo careereBay's Stock Won't DieeBay's stock won't die, possibly far from it. Its stock will just begin to catch some retail price motion, removed from the benefits of the financial-style growth that came from PayPal. It's possible that eBay will become a player's stock, with more volatility introduced. PayPal may carry the reliable upward growth that its stock carries today.IPO Trauma WarningLet's look at a very recent example of IPO whiplash, from the company called Box (NYSE:BOX).This IPO was praised widely, and bellowed by Jim Cramer as an excellent buy. The way the IPO played out was actually quite treacherous to many. BOX wasn't necessarily a bad investment at face value, but the price action could have whipped someone's head off.As the future of BOX stock played out after IPO, we see that questions of growth through profit walls can cause stagnation of the stock.However, eBay has profits, makes sales, and money is there. So, a comparison to BOX is unfair. However, seeing the BOX IPO can help in two ways:Again, BOX's trajectories are not going to be identical to either eBay or PayPal. These comparisons just offer weights placed upon linear projections - based on market dynamics. I don't think eBay's stock will plummet, or sag forever by today's measure. I do think that compared to PayPal, eBay will look like the lesser half.For the reasons mentioned, for conservative medium-term or long-term investors, it might be best to avoid eBay's stock for the spinoff phase this month. I suggest taking smart positions in PayPal, and if extreme runaway candlesticks form, then you might have waited too long to step in, until price action settles.IPOs or spin-offs like this are huge baiting grounds for very active daily traders. A fortune could be made by playing the momentary surges and crashes that surround the introductory period. A fortune could also be easily lost. For investors who can't resist getting into one of these stocks on the split, PayPal is the obvious winner.The Fundamental IssueFor traders who investigate company valuation vs. stock price carefully, it all comes down to valuation. If the right valuations are assigned, then both eBay and PayPal could be great plays, theoretically. I think for this instance, raw valuations are out the window, and that crowd hype over PayPal will play the dominate role, and this will create a partial vacuum for eBay to be temporarily lost within. Play at your own risk!(This article is based on technical observations and fair judgment of IPO/spinoff volatility considerations. This advice is for investors who want some loose technical insight. These are not absolutions, or declared predictions. I believe these are fair-minded conservative projections)."
3300345,61281,2015-07-02T14:13:02-04:00,"PayPal spin-off record date set for next week; investors should get ready to execute their strategy.In an earlier article, I presented my spin-off arbitrage investment thesis that is based on the expected outflow of cash from EBAY to PYPL.In this article, I show that sharp swings in the ‘when-issued’ market can materialize in this case and could yield significant returns.","Last week, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) set the official dates for the PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) spin-off in an announcement that caught some investors unprepared when the company set the record date for two weeks after the announcement, on July 8. In an earlier article, I described a spin-off arbitrage investment strategy to the PayPal spin-off that could yield substantial gains for investors. That article was published at the end of May, and, since then, we had some spin-offs that took place in June that could indicate how the market treats spin-offs these days. Of course, none of the recent spin-offs have the same unique characteristics of the long-awaited PayPal spin-off, but they can serve as a good indicator of the market reaction to the spin-off wave.Before I present previous examples and explain how I believe the PYPL spin-off will react, I want to present my views on spin-off investment/trading strategies. Investors should remember spin-offs differ from one another in a number of ways:The examples I want to present are three examples from June of Baxter International (NYSE:BAX), Masco (NYSE:MAS) and Integra LifeSciences (NASDAQ:IART) as well as two older examples of Agilent and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE):As I mentioned above, the June spin-offs might not be comparable to a PayPal spin-off, but they can serve as a good indicator to see how the 'when-issued' market reacted to spin-offs lately. Each spin-off had a different length of 'when-issued' market, a different distribution ratio, and a different spin-off reason; however, all of them yielded a double digit return for one side of the spin-off and a negative return for the other end of the spin-off.As shown in chart 1 below, BAX.wi (BAX 'when-issued') yielded a 14% return in the 'when-issued' market while the stock spun-off division BXLT.wi yielded a negative 7% return. An investor holding 100 units pre-distribution and choosing a long-short strategy could have produced a 10% upside from the 'when-issued' market in only two weeks. A leveraged position could have yielded a much higher return.In the June spin-offs of Masco and Integra, the position should have been different. Had investors shorted the mother company and held the spun-off shares long, they would have yielded 19% and 26% of the long positions respectively and 5% and 1% in the short position. Of course, leveraged positions would have increased the returns significantly.As shown in Chart 2 below, in the Agilent/Keystone case, both stocks rose in the ""when-issued"" market and yielded a 6% return each for a long position during a two-week period.Expedia/TripAdvisor was a case similar to MAS and IART, where the mother company declined in the ""when-issued"" market while the spun-off share rose, and long/short holders could have optimized their return with spin-off arbitrage.PayPal Spin-OffIn the examples above, I present potential spin-off investment strategies that could be translated into impressive returns in a relatively short amount of time. However, the most important thing when investing in spin-offs is choosing the correct long leg and short leg for the trading, which will maximize the return before any additional trading happens and any leverage is used. I believe that a significant number of investors held EBAY solely for the PYPL exposure over the years and, once the spin-off was announced, they even increased their EBAY position to receive more PYPL shares after the spin-off. I believe that once distribution starts, the first (and probably the largest) shareholders will receive the distributed shares and sell some of their EBAY shares in the 'when-issued' market to pressure down the EBAY.wi share price. At the same time, the same investors will look to increase their PayPal position and try to buy additional PYPL.wi shares on top of the quantity they already have. This action will pressure PYPL.wi share prices up.Both of the processes described above (declining EBAY.wi price and rising PYPL.wi price) will continue along the 'when-issued' market lifetime until PYPL's first day of trading on July 20. There is good reason to believe that the large swings presented above will appear in different companies from different sectors and different spin-off specifics. I believe that the market will add a premium to the PYPL.wi shares once PayPal is a stand-alone company, and the long wait for this spin-off may increase the demand for PYPL.wi shares even further.Current eBay shareholders who decide to use the spin-off arbitrage strategy could gain a 10% to 35% return based on the timing of receiving the distributed shares. Investors who receive the first batch from eBay and short EBAY.wi will gain the most from the short and long PYPL.wi and, as we get closer to July 20, most of the short potential in EBAY.wi will be exhausted.ConclusionsIn an earlier article, I presented an investment strategy that enables investors to maximize their returns from the PayPal spin-off. The two primary elements in this thesis are choosing the correct short leg and long leg and assuming the market will price the long leg at a premium and the short leg below its current value. I presented some cases where choosing the correct legs could have yielded substantial returns from a long/short position throughout the ""when-issued"" market lifetime. I believe that in the PayPal spin-off case, EBAY.wi should be the short leg, and PYPL.wi should be the long leg. Historical swings suggest that this strategy could yield a substantial return."
3218086,61281,2015-05-28T09:04:51-04:00,"PayPal and eBay are getting ready to separate and filed their operation agreement for after the spin-off.For years, investors held eBay shares solely for the exposure to PayPal; now, these investors can sell their eBay shares and hold only PayPal shares directly.The expected outflow from eBay to PayPal and a potential upside in PayPal’s stock on the first trading day will have a significant impact on these stock prices.A spin-off arbitrage strategy will enable investors to optimize this situation and gain around 40% return.","The long-awaited separation of PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) passed an important milestone when the companies released the operation agreement between them for the post-spin-off era. The document does not provide any specific information about the separation process, and important issues like the distribution date, EBAY/PYPL distribution ratio, and PayPal IPO date remain unclear. However, it lifts all limitations PayPal had on offering its payment processing services to other competing e-commerce players and unlocks great growth potential for the company. For a long time, investors bought eBay stock solely to get an exposure to PayPal's growth, and the upcoming spin-off could enable them to benefit from an unusual opportunity to increase their return on their PayPal investment.PayPal vs. eBay's Marketplace RevenuesIn 2002, PayPal became a fully owned subsidiary of eBay after a short period as a public company listed on the NASDAQ. Since the acquisition, eBay has kept reporting PayPal's key financial and operational data in its quarterly and annual reports as a separate segment and allowed the investors to track PayPal's development. In the beginning, acquiring PayPal made a lot of sense to eBay, and PayPal became its default payment processing service for the company's popular marketplace and increased eBay's income from transactions made on its platform.In time, PayPal transformed from an additional revenue stream for eBay to an essential part of eBay's revenues. Greater awareness for online shopping, simple international funds transfer that supports the increased globalization trend, and the requirement for online security while performing payment transactions are the drivers behind PayPal's success. PayPal became such a successful business that on Q1'15, eBay generated more revenues from PayPal than from its core marketplace segment. As shown in chart 1 below, PayPal increased its net revenues at a quarterly rate of 4%, twice as much as eBay's marketplace segment.PayPal became so big that eBay revolved around the payments business and less around its core marketplace business. As PayPal became such a big revenue stream for eBay, it was only a matter of time until eBay would spin off its payments division, and the separation campaign led by activist hedge fund manager Carl Icahn probably accelerated that process.PayPal GrowthPayPal generates revenues mainly from transaction fees charged to merchants' accounts, which range between 2.2% to 3.9% per transaction. In Q1'15, the weighted average fees charged, also known as take rate, were 3.43% of PayPal's total payment volume (""TPV""), which was 12 bps lower than the previous year. From that 3.43% take rate, PayPal reduces payments to third-party payment processing services, financial institutions, and different operational losses. These expenses and losses are also measured per transaction and in Q1'15 totaled 1.24%. The net transaction rate (take rate less expense rate and loss rate) was 2.19%, which reflects the actual fee that ends up at PayPal's top-line. PayPal's transaction margin rate in Q1'15 was 64%, which means that 36% of PayPal's fees are offset by related expenses and losses.To assess PayPal's growth properly, we should look at the net transaction rate as well as the TPV to understand how both factors react over time. As shown in chart 1 below, while PayPal's net transaction rate declines, the company's TPV rises in an amazing 25% CAGR over the last 5 years and drives an impressive net revenues CAGR of 23%. When talking about PayPal's growth, the amazing TPV and net revenues CAGR are the main items to focus on.Once separation is done, PayPal could engage in business initiatives that it previously couldn't under eBay's management. Such initiatives may include:Spin-Off Arbitrage OpportunityAs mentioned above, some eBay stockholders hold it solely for an exposure to PayPal and will probably seek to transform their EBAY position, which is currently included in inherent PayPal exposure, into a pure PYPL position. This transformation could only be done once PYPL is tradable on the NASDAQ, which is expected to happen towards the end of Q2'15 or in Q3'15. Conservatively quantifying the portion of these investors at 15% of the total EBAY investors suggests a massive outflow of dollars from EBAY to PYPL.This outflow will drive a short-term pressure on PYPL and EBAY shares that will drive PYPL up and EBAY down. Investors interested to benefit from this expected short-term upside should start buying EBAY on the market now (the specific record date for the distribution was not announced yet) so they will be entitled to PYPL shares later on. The outflow from EBAY to PYPL will drive price appreciation in the short term, and the growth catalysts mentioned above are expected to drive price appreciation in the long term.However, after PayPal is traded on the NASDAQ, potential PYPL shareholders are exposed to short-term losses on their EBAY position resulted from the outflow mentioned above. To prevent any losses (or at least minimize them) from holding EBAY, investors could sell their EBAY units on the same day PYPL starts to trade. Assuming the outflow from EBAY to PYPL will last between a few days to weeks, PYPL investors could short EBAY for the long term and benefit from the technical drop in stock price.That might sound great in the first place if the ex-distribution shares of EBAY (not entitled to PYPL shares) and PYPL were not starting to trade before the PayPal IPO. The excerpt below from PayPal's 10-12A/B document filed with the SEC sheds some light on PYPL and EBAY shares through the distribution.In summary, PYPL shares will be tradable under specific conditions before the distribution date (and settle afterwards), which might drive PYPL price up before the first trading day. This part supports my suggestion to start buying EBAY shares now to be entitled to PYPL shares later. However, in the upper paragraph of the excerpt, the document states that ex-distribution shares of EBAY will be tradable before PYPL first trading day on the NASDAQ. In the period between the record date to the distribution date, there will be two classes of EBAY stocks in the market: ""regular,"" which are entitled to PYPL stocks, and ""ex-distribution,"" which are not entitled to PYPL stocks. Holders of EBAY shares will be able to sell their ex-distribution units in that period.Assuming the largest volume of the outflow will come from funds and institutional investors, the pressure on EBAY ex-distribution shares will start during the period between the record date to the distribution date. In order to maximize return from this unusual situation, holders of EBAY should short ex-distribution shares as soon as they can during the period between the record date and the distribution date and hold their PYPL long.Return AssessmentAs mentioned above, many of the details are still unknown, so I used some conservative assumptions to assess this position:As shown in chart 3 above, using the mid-point scenario for the outflow magnitude and mid-point scenario of the PYPL IPO upside reflects a more than 40% opportunity from PayPal-eBay spin-off. Even if the actual upside from the spin-off arbitrage strategy will be significantly lower, it is still a pretty good deal.ConclusionsAfter years of anticipation, PayPal and eBay are expected to separate soon and create an unusual opportunity for investors. Many investors hold EBAY stocks just as a gateway to PayPal, and the spin-off will allow these investors to invest directly in PYPL. The investors who will no longer want to hold to EBAY will sell their units and create pressure on the stock price. A spin-off arbitrage strategy could optimize this situation for investors and potentially gain double-digit returns."
3299715,24276,2015-07-03T10:35:19-04:00,"PayPal is trying to do a roll-up on the margins of payment processing.KKR has been trying the same thing at the heart of the business for a decade, with little success.Payment processing is hard work and no one should pretend otherwise.","Back when Elon Musk was its biggest investor, before it was acquired by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) in 2002, PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) was revolutionary, recruiting customers through viral marketing and promising to transform how money was handled. It was a nice little business with big promises.Now, as the company prepares to split from eBay and start trading under the symbol PYPL, it is doing everything it can to be seen as a regular payment processor. That makes sense, because over the last few years payment processors like Visa (NYSE:V) and Heartland (HPY) have become hot, hot, hot.But investors need to understand something. PayPal is building its payments business from scraps and remainders. It's a roll-up in an industry that doesn't look too kindly on them.Before today the company had put $280 million into Paydiant, a ""white label"" processor, $60 million into CyActive, a cybersecurity outfit, and $800 million into Braintree, whose Venmo service focuses on mobile and social payments, hot buzzwords with little traction. Now it wants to spend $890 million on Xoom (NASDAQ:XOOM), a money transfer service which, unlike the others, is publicly traded.The idea is that PayPal will put all these big brains together, re-label their services as PayPal, combine ad budgets and grow something worth buying. The response of the market should be, good luck with that, but Xoom zoomed over the price PayPal is offering, indicating some arbitrage fun might be in the offing.PayPal is trying to do a roll-up on the sides of the payment universe, and hoping for a valuation similar to a mainstream processor. Being a payment processor is nice work if you can get it. Heartland currently sports a Price/Earnings multiple of 57, on a revenue run rate that should come in at $2.4 billion this year on a $2 billion market cap.The question always is, how much of the work can you get? Payments are not a San Francisco business, despite Visa (V) having its headquarters there. It's not about innovation, it's about performance. Payments are basically an Atlanta business. It's real hard. A lot of the work is stuck in mainframes programmers are struggling to update. The reason Square stands a chance at success is because it basically offers one deal (two deals, if you include the one with Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)) for its services. Easy to program, easy to execute.But there's a reason why First Data remains under the KKR (NYSE:KKR) umbrella almost a decade after its purchase for $28 billion, and the company put another $1.2 billion into it last year. Payment processing has been around for over 50 years, it's hard, and trying to roll-up the industry doesn't generate much more than headaches. Henry Kravis' hope was that KKR could transform First Data from ""just"" a processor into a broad-based outfit with analytics and security.Frank Bisignino, hired from JP Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) in 2013, reportedly has the full support of KKR, but has been little heard-from since then because he has been busy. You think Musk is a wizard? Try running a payments company.In short, PayPal is trying to do what KKR itself tried to do a decade ago, only on the cheap. While KKR continues to fight alligators, PayPal thinks it's going to advertise itself as the swamp clearance expert, leaving existing managements in charge of the subsidiaries, and get a big payday.What works in this business is sticking to one's knitting, acknowledging the complexity of processing and growing existing solutions organically. This is not a business that lends itself easily to grand schemes. PayPal, in my view, is just one such scheme, and if Henry Kravis can't pull it off in a decade what makes anyone think PayPal can in a year?"

        Introducing four investment strategies for different levels of risk tolerance.
        The PayPal spin-off investment scenario reflects an expected return of 2% to 11%.","The long waiting period is finally coming to an end as PayPal (Pending:PYPL) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are getting closer to the first spin-off milestone - July 8th, the spin-off record date. The record date has some significant meanings in this context:After the previous article published about the PayPal spin-off arb strategy, I received many questions about how to create an optimized position that would benefit from this spin-off arb opportunity in a hedged environment. I answered some of this questions, and I want to present some scenarios that will assist readers and potential investors to tailor the best position to meet their unique characteristics.At the beginning, I wish to address two primary issues that are fundamental to this investment strategy: risk aversion and outflow theory. Before investing in the PayPal spin-off (if investing at all), investors should know exactly what their risk appetite is. Some investors take high risks in anticipation of higher returns than usual, and other investors take small risks and expect moderate gains. Both approaches are perfectly fine, but an individual investor should think of that before engaging with a spin-off arbitrage strategy and create an investment strategy that fits his or her risk aversion preferences (institutional investors assess their risk appetite regularly). Investors looking to gain from a short-long position should accept the outflow theory that I presented in a May article. An investor who believes that both eBay and PayPal will soar after the split should engage in a different strategy, which I will not cover here, and hold both equities long.To create a trading scenario for the spin-off, I will assume that most readers will receive the distributed shares between a week after the record date and the distribution date. At this point, EBAY.wi and PYPL.wi shares already reflect a 10% price fluctuation. Let's discuss the four possible scenarios:I also assume that the PYPL.wi price will increase by 5% during the period I described above, 3% during the weekend between the distribution date and PYPL's first trading day, and an additional 10% on the first trading day. All figures are within the reasonable spin-off fluctuations that were presented in the previous article. I also assume that the positive changes in PayPal's stock price equal the adverse changes in eBay's stock price. I calculated the return and volatility based on a distributed share price of $32 for a PayPal share and $28 for an eBay share, assuming cash from selling the EBAY stock was not reinvested.The four scenarios presented above yielded the following return and volatility figures:Investors highly averse to risk can choose to take action and get an estimated return of 2% of scenario A or just sell all units of the EBAY stock once received and gain 7% from a PYPL long-only position as presented in scenario B in the period between the moment the distributed shares are received until the end of the first day of trading in PYPL shares. Investors who have some tolerance for risk can choose a long-short strategy that maximizes return from the spin-off but is accompanied with a slightly higher risk. Scenario C, which suggests to sell 50% of eBay's distributed shares and short the other 50%, offers a lower risk for investors than scenario D. Investors who are somewhere in the middle between complete risk aversion and total risk taking could choose a larger/smaller quantity of EBAY shares to sell in order to hedge PYPL fluctuations.Investors who hold options of eBay pre-distribution can add an additional hedging layer with post-distribution options and protect their positions better from any downside. However, since the outflow of cash that is expected from PYPL and EBAY will trigger a possible movement in prices, it might be easier to hedge the position by playing with the ratio between the long and short positions."

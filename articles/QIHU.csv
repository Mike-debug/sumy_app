The company announced that it will delist before the market open on July 18th. Yet, we do not read this as positive news for other China ADRs that still have pending privatization proposals. QIHU's privatization process suggests this would not be an easy task for the late comers to try to relist in the domestic market.We will avoid China ADRs that still have pending privatizations and may consider shorting these stocks on rallies.Why we think QIHU is a unique caseWe recommended QIHU when media reported that the Chinese securities regulator was studying the impact of overseas-listed Chinese companies to relist in the domestic stock market. Share prices of many China ADRs fell heavily following the news as investors believed that the regulator might block domestic listing by companies that had recently privatized in the overseas markets.We strongly believed QIHU could complete its privatization due to the following reasons:Despite a strong business case and government approval, the privatization still took much longer than we expected to complete. The company only recently announced that it would delist before the market open on July 18th.Our low-risk arbitrage play was still a success but this has made us more cautious on the risks of investing in other China ADRs with pending go-private proposals.Why we will not invest in other China ADRs with pending privatization plansThe Chinese securities regulator may not encourage fundraising from some internet and entertainment companies.The companies may not get the approvals required to transfer U.S. dollars offshore.Buyer group may lower their bids.ConclusionWe think the completion of QIHU's privatization should be considered as a unique case. We would not invest in other China ADRs with pending go-private proposals as the regulatory and moral hazard risks have outweighed the potential returns of these companies."
4030287,50682,2016-12-13T17:52:32-05:00,Qihoo's latest smartphone foray with its purchase of the obscure Blephone reflects the tenacity of founder Zhou Hongyi.Industry watchers will recall that the last two years have not been good ones for Qihoo in the smartphone space.This will quickly end in failure due to a late arrival and intense competition in the space.,"Security software maker Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) just doesn't change its mind when opinionated CEO Zhou Hongyi sets his sights on something. After a somewhat disastrous beginning to Zhou's foray into smartphones over the last two years, he's loudly proclaiming that 2017 will be the year of the smartphone for his company. And to show he's serious, Qihoo has just revealed that it paid an ""eight-digit"" figure for an obscure smartphone maker called Blephone.Industry watchers will recall that the last two years have not been good ones for Qihoo in the smartphone space. The company kicked off 2015 with a newly minted smartphone-making joint venture with Coolpad (OTCPK:CHWTF) in what looked like a relatively solid partnership to enter the space. But that partnership quickly went sour over differences between the pair, and Qihoo ended up buying out the venture.Qihoo is still theoretically making smartphones, even though you never see its products in the market and I have yet to meet anyone who has bought or even seen a Qihoo phone. But Zhou seems intent on developing the space, despite intense competition that has nearly everyone losing big money, with no signs of the pressure easing.With that background in mind, let's look at the latest headlines that have Zhou announcing the Blephone purchase on his microblog and proclaiming that 2017 will be his company's year in the space (English article, Chinese article). The ""eight-figure"" sale price means Qihoo is probably getting Blephone quite cheaply since at a midpoint of 50 million yuan, the amount would equate to meager $7 million.That figure may sound low, but in China's cutthroat smartphone realm, anyone who can get any positive amount of money for such assets is probably lucky. Blephone said in a recent interview it sold 13 million smartphones in the first three quarters of this year, and is targeting 20 million for the entire year. It aims to raise that figure to around 30 million units last year. Presumably, all of that was before it sold itself to Qihoo.But regardless, such figures don't look very impressive to me, especially since they're quite probably inflated as they're coming from the company's chairman and we have no way to verify the information. But the fact that he's selling his company so cheaply hints that even if he's selling lots of phones, he's probably also losing lots of money in the process.Enter Qihoo into this equation, and I see a recipe for a new disaster. While I don't have any intimate knowledge of Blephone's products, I doubt that such a small name has the kind of cutting-edge technology needed to set itself apart from the dozens of other generic smartphones in the market that all look and perform similarly. A look at its website shows most of those phones sell for the equivalent of less than $100, meaning they almost certainly don't contain any proprietary technology.Secret SauceQihoo believes it has the recipe for creating a new breakout product in its own smartphone operating system (OS), called 360OS. The latest reports say that Blephone will start installing 360OS in all its phones from next year, meaning its current crop of models, presumably using the Android OS, will be its last.Zhou shows he's quite serious about developing the business, saying Qihoo will set up its own smartphone division complete with product development, sales and marketing channel teams. There's no mention of who is funding this endeavor, which is actually a big issue since Qihoo exhausted much of its financial resources earlier this year with its record $9.3 billion privatization from New York.Anyone who hasn't realized by now that I'm highly skeptical of this new endeavor surely doesn't know how to read between the lines. I have a very healthy respect for Zhou Hongyi, whose privatization of Qihoo from New York earlier this year was a feat that very few people could have completed. Zhou is also quite savvy in spotting the latest tech trends. But in this case, he's really too late to the smartphone bandwagon, and his insistence of pursuing such a path at all costs will ultimately end in disappointment and probably considerable cost to his company.Disclosure: None."
3989569,50682,2016-07-19T15:49:49-04:00,"Qihoo 360 was being more low key in announcing the failure of its bid for Norwegian browser maker Opera.Following the decision to scrap the previous sale, the two sides announced a smaller deal that would see the Chinese group buy about half of Opera's assets for about $600 million.The company simply couldn't provide the level of funding it had previously promised, hence the decision to downsize the original deal.","Bottom line: A Chinese group's decision to downsize an earlier deal to buy Norway's Opera was likely due to insufficient funds to complete the deal, but will still give Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) an important new browser asset in its drive to go global.Just a day after trumpeting its successful privatization from New York, software security specialist Qihoo 360 is being more low key in announcing the new failure of its bid for Norwegian browser maker Opera. In fact, Qihoo was really just one member of a group that bid $1.2 billion earlier this year to buy Opera, owner of the world's fourth most popular web browser (previous post). Following the decision to scrap the sale, the two sides have simultaneously announced a smaller deal that would see the Chinese group buy about half of Opera's assets for about $600 million.The turn of events looks a bit strange, and is undoubtedly leaving many observers scratching their heads. After all, the sale wasn't rejected by any regulators, even though the official reason for ending the deal was failure to get necessary approvals by the group's own self-set deadline. What's more, the new deal worth $600 million will still see the Qihoo group get Opera's prize asset, its popular web browser.My guess is that the group, which also included Golden Brick Silk Road and Kunlun Tech, may have suddenly found itself short of cash after Qihoo's management just spent a hefty $9.3 billion to privatize the company from New York last week. That buyout was the biggest privatization in history of a US-listed Chinese company, and posed huge challenges for Qihoo's management due to its huge size.We'll return to that part of the story shortly and what this revised deal might mean for the Chinese buyers. But first let's review the actual story, which saw Opera say the sale originally announced in February has officially failed (English article, Chinese article). Both sides could have easily extended the deadline to give the appropriate regulators more time, but Opera said it made the mutual decision to scrap the deal instead.Opera shares tanked by 10 percent after the announcement, and at their latest price of 54 kroner are now 24 percent below the 71 kroner offer price originally made by the Chinese group. The stock is actually still up slightly from pre-offer levels since the original price represented a 46 premium to earlier levels. But it could easily give back even those gains and possibly drop lower as the company is broken up in this new deal.Company Break-UpUnder the new deal, the Qihoo group will pay $600 million for certain parts of Opera's consumer business, including the mobile and desktop versions of its popular browser that the company says has 350 million users. But the buyer group won't get Opera's advertising, games and television units.Qihoo was the main strategic investor in this deal, since it operates a browser that is at once one of the most popular in China but at the same time is widely scorned by the rest of the world due to its invasive features. Qihoo also probably would have liked Opera's advertising business, since it's trying to monetize its online search service that has quickly become quite popular but doesn't earn much money.Kunlun also had a strategic interest in the deal, since it's a game developer and thus was probably interested in Opera's game business. Thus one could deduce that Qihoo is the relative winner in the alternate $600 million deal. That's because it will gain access to a globally accepted browser to complement its own browser business, even though it won't get the advertising monetization technology.Kunlun, by comparison, looks like the relative loser, since it was probably eyeing Opera's gaming business that is excluded from the smaller deal. All of that brings us back to my original assertion, namely that Qihoo was probably the main backer behind this deal and suddenly found its finances stretched after its just-completed privatization. I suspect a big portion of funds for the new $600 million deal are still coming from Qihoo, perhaps up to two-thirds. But the company simply couldn't provide the level of funding it had previously promised, hence the decision to downsize the original deal."
3973095,101662,2016-05-09T10:43:18-04:00,"Share prices of many China ADRs fell last Friday on concerns that their journey home may be complicated by a regulator's potential new rules.QIHU's privatization would not be impacted in our view.This is a good opportunity for investors to earn quick, low-risk profit.","BackgroundCompanies listed in the mainland China generally trade at much higher multiples than their overseas counterparts. As a result, more than 30 Chinese ADR companies have announced go-private plans since last year with a hope to cash-in the higher valuations.To re-list in the China stock market, most of these companies will likely opt for backdoor listings by acquiring ""shell companies,"" which are typically small caps with struggling core businesses. This has fueled speculative share buying of shell companies in mainland China's stock market.To curb the enthusiasm surrounding the underachievers in the stock market, China's securities regulator said on Friday that it is studying the impact of overseas-listed Chinese companies to re-list in the stock market.Share prices of many China ADRs fell last Friday on widely circulated market rumors that the regulator may block domestic listing by companies that have recently privatized in the overseas markets.Yet, we think the risks are mainly with the China ADRs that only recently announced their privatization plans and those that cannot act quick in the go-private process. The risk for Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) is much lower in our view.Three reasons why we think QIHU's privatization would not be affectedFirst, QIHU is already in the final stage of its privatization process and the buyers group should complete the deal soon.It generally takes 6-9 months for a Chinese ADR to complete the privatization and delisting process, which typically includes the following procedures:For QIHU, shareholders have approved the company to go private for $9.3b, or $77.00 per ADS, on March 30, 2016, and it is already at the final stage to de-list the company. This is contrary to many other Chinese ADRs, which have yet to reach binding agreements with the buyer groups, not to mention getting the green light from their shareholders in extraordinary shareholder meetings.Second, there is a real business need for QIHU to re-list in mainland China.QIHU is a company focusing on Internet security in China. Its status as a Cayman company listed in the U.S. does not fit the best interest of its future business. We think QIHU will be able to grow its B2B business with government entities if it becomes a domestically listed company. In our view, regulators are more likely to approve the re-listing of companies with concrete business purposes than those that want to return home just for higher valuation multiples.Last, QIHU's privatization has been approved by China's National Development and Reform Commission (""NDRC"") on 26 April 2016.The NDRC is a macroeconomic management agency under the Chinese State Council, which has broad administrative and planning control over the Chinese economy. The approval from one of the highest governing bodies in China suggests QIHU's go-private plan is well under progress.We think QIHU's go-private move should complete soonAfter shareholders approve the go-private bid from the buyers group, it may take a few days or even months for them to complete the delisting and privatization process. For example, Youku Tudou (NYSE:YOKU) took 17 days to complete the go-private transactions after the shareholder approval on 14 March 2016. Mindray Medical International (NYSE:MR) took only five days to complete the delisting after shareholders approved the bid from the buyers group on 26 February 2016.QIHU has received shareholder approval on 30 March 2016, and it has already been more than a month after the green light. We think the longer completion time is reasonable given the larger market capitalization of QIHU as the buyers group may need extra time to get the Chinese State Administration of Foreign Exchange approval for the large amounts of USD purchases. The recent NDRC approval suggests a similar approval from the foreign exchange governing body should be on the way.Conclusion:We recommend investors to buy QIHU at the current price.QIHU's shares currently trade at $73.42, still offering 4.8% upside versus the go-private price of $77.00. We believe this is a good buying opportunity for investors who would like to earn quick, low-risk profit. If the transaction can be completed in the next 30 days, this would imply an annualized return of more than 50%."
3979471,101405,2016-06-02T13:39:53-04:00,Going private at $77.00 per share.All necessary approvals and agreements are in place.The deal is funded in excess of the cash required to close the deal.Qihoo is close to closing the privatization deal.There should be plenty of incentive to close the deal in the near term.,"In early April, I wrote an article where I stated that Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) offered a compelling arbitrage opportunity with respect to its going private buyout. I will be the first to admit that my timeline for completing the deal was flawed. However, all signs point to the Qihoo deal closing and this situation still offers a compelling arbitrage opportunity. I believe it is prudent to provide an update.Shareholders faced a tumultuous number of weeks holding Qihoo where the stock moved substantially lower upon learning that the CSRC (Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission) was considering taking a stronger stance towards companies seeking reverse mergers on to the A-Share market. Despite Qihoo issuing a press release refuting rumors, the stock did still did not perform well.A week or so after the CSRC anxiety, there were various reports where Qihoo was meeting resistance with respect to converting currency. Qihoo needs SAFE (State Administration of Foreign Exchange) approval to convert RMB to USD. I reached out to Investor Relations and was told that the journalists were not stating the facts and there were no official channels or announcements confirming these issues. On May 13, Qihoo issued a press release stating that the buyer group notified the company that they were working towards closing the transaction and merger agreement was progressing as expected.On May 23, there was a deluge of information released in the Chinese media. Most news was positive, and in summary stated the following:The news stated above suggests that Qihoo is trading well below where it should be trading with respect to a deal that may be closing imminently. Although it is hard to determine when Qihoo will close the deal, it should be noted that Qihoo has attained all necessary approvals including: NDRC (National Development Reform Commission), MOFCOM (Ministry of Commerce of the PRC), and presumably SAFE.Also reassuring, as of early May, the two special purpose vehicles created to complete the deal were fully funded with capital in excess of $15 billion combined. The two special purpose vehicles are: Tianjin Qixin Zhicheng Technology Co., Ltd. and Tianjin Qixin Technology Co., Ltd. These are the SPV entities taking Qihoo private. Considering the capital is far in excess of what is needed to complete the buyout, one can surmise that the recent RMB devaluation has little effect on the ability of the buyers to consummate the deal.Also interesting, I have been monitoring various Chinese A-Share traded securities. The following tickers are on my list:In conclusion, it is hard to determine when Qihoo will actually close the going private transaction, the details in this piece should provide substantial evidence that the closing is potentially imminent and we can also understand why the June 15th date is significant. With a Federal Reserve meeting looming and interest rates potentially on the rise, the RMB may be under more pressure logically, the company should close the deal as soon as possible.I believe the large spread between the deal closing price and current trading price is due to the damage done over the last weeks with respect to various articles and rumors. There are no indications the deal is falling apart. In fact, a private equity fund also taking part in the deal reassured investors on May 10th with the following official statement which essentially translates to the deal not having any problems and will close. Qihoo currently makes for a very compelling trade in the short term."

Two of the largest such deals are in the headlines as we round out the week, led by word that a privatization plan by software security specialist Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) may be running into trouble due to China's strict foreign exchange controls. The other major deal has real estate giant Dalian Wanda (OTC:DWNDF, HKEx: 3699), reportedly moving ahead with a plan to privatize the company, after indicating earlier this week that it might abandon its original plan.It's becoming quite a challenge to write about this so-called ""homecoming trend"" by Chinese firms these past 2 weeks, since new obstacles seem to be popping up almost daily on this road back to China. The process was never an easy one, and involves raising hundreds of millions, or sometimes even billions, of dollars to take a company private. Then the buyout groups, usually led by company managers, must convince New York or Hong Kong shareholders to sell their stock, often at modest premiums.But perhaps the hardest part of the process is re-listing in China, since the country's regulator is notoriously bureaucratic and conservative. That fact is the real reason that led most of these companies to list overseas in the first place. These homecoming candidates thought they had solved this regulatory obstacle by discovering they could make backdoor listings using existing publicly traded shell companies in China. But then they learned last week that the regulator was preparing to clamp down on that path (previous post).Qihoo's shares have been on a roller coaster ride this week, plunging one day on worries about a regulatory clampdown in China, only to soar the next on more positive signals. The shares were on the downward track again in the latest session, falling 3.5 percent after media reported the company's $9.3 billion buyout deal had hit impasse with another Chinese regulator, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (NYSE:SAFE) (English article; Chinese article).In this particular case, SAFE's biggest concern appears to be Qihoo's plan to convert billions of yuan into dollars and move the amount offshore, all in one or two single transactions. It has been working hard to control the movement of capital out of China lately, worried about pressure on the country's own currency as investors concerned about a slowing domestic economy try to move their money overseas.A Bloomberg report on the matter says that Qihoo is negotiating with SAFE to resolve the situation, and in this case, the concerns look more technical rather than philosophical. Accordingly, this particular instance looks like a temporary setback, and I expect Qihoo and its strong-willed founder Zhou Hongyi will ultimately reach a compromise that allows for this privatization to move ahead.Waffling WandaNext, there's Wanda, whose Dalian Wanda property unit recently became the largest Hong Kong-listed company to consider a similar privatization just a year after making its IPO. But word last week that China's regulator might put a halt on backdoor listings reportedly prompted Wanda to consider scrapping that bid. Now, the latest reports are saying that Wanda is once again moving forward with the plan, following the latest signals that some backdoor listings will be allowed in the country, but at a very controlled pace (English article).In this case Wanda's flip-flop is directly tied to the mixed signals coming from the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). Wanda is very well connected with Beijing through its multi-billionaire chief, Wang Jianlin. Accordingly, I suspect the latest signal that the CSRC will permit some backdoor listings has led Wang to believe he will be able to secure the necessary regulatory approvals to bring his company back to China through such channels. The report adds an actual buyout offer could come as early as next week.At the end of the day, we can probably expect to see more volatility for these homecoming stocks, most of them traded in New York, until the CSRC finally comes out and clearly states how it intends to regulate backdoor listings. Even then, the regulator is notoriously fickle and could still decide to stop all backdoor listings at any time if China's stock markets enter a new period of volatility and another major correction begins.Disclosure: None."
3988598,50682,2016-07-15T05:36:13-04:00,,"Bottom line: Zhou Hongyi should be commended for completing his privatization of Qihoo in the face of numerous obstacles, though his plans to re-list his company in China might take at least 1-2 years.I haven't always been a fan of security software specialist Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) over the years due to some of the overly aggressive and often ethically questionable business practices of chief Zhou Hongyi. But I have to admire the outspoken Zhou today, following word that he has reportedly just completed the biggest buyout of a US-listed Chinese company in history, despite facing numerous obstacles that seems unsurmountable at times.Far smaller US-listed Chinese companies have abandoned their plans to privatize due to choppy markets and the difficulty of completing such deals. But Zhou remained steadfast throughout in his desire to privatize his company, with the result that Qihoo's shares will officially de-list with the start of trade on Monday, July 18, according to new Chinese media reports. (Chinese article)This particular story has quite a few elements that make Zhou's accomplishment quite remarkable. It occurred against a broader backdrop that has seen some 40 US-listed Chinese companies announce plans to privatize since the start of last year. Most of those were hoping to quickly re-list in China, on the belief that they could get far higher valuations in their home markets.Qihoo was once an investor darling in New York, thanks to early success for its 2-year-old online search service that posed the first serious threat in years to sector giant Baidu (Nasdaq: BIDU). But investors quickly abandoned the stock after Qihoo couldn't quickly monetize its search success, causing the shares to lose more than a third of their value from a peak during the euphoria in 2014.Feeling underappreciated at home, Qihoo joined the privatization train in the first half of last year, in a $9.3 billion deal that was easily the largest among the group of companies trying to de-list. But then China's stock markets underwent a major correction, and have been highly volatile since then, putting most of the privatization plans in limbo.Qihoo's deal was always going to be difficult due to its large size, but it ran into more headaches due to a major unrelated business dispute last summer with Coolpad (OTCPK:CHWTF), its partner in a smartphone making joint venture. Once that clash was resolved, Zhou returned his focus back to the privatization and the deal seemed to be back on track.Fund Flow DifficultiesBut then new reports emerged that the company was running into difficulties moving enough money offshore from China to complete a transaction that required billions of US dollars. Most of those problems arose due to China's tough restrictions on such offshore transfers, which were designed to control the movement of money into and out of China. A steady decline in China's currency, the yuan, has added to Zhou's headaches, making the deal more costly because most of his funds were denominated in yuan.Zhou seemed to be overcoming all those problems when Qihoo ran into yet another obstacle - this time from China's own securities regulator. Alarmed at the growing number of companies that were trying to privatize from the US and return home to list, the regulator signaled it would sharply slow or even halt the use of a backdoor listing path that many companies were using due to long wait times for traditional IPOs. That obstacle reportedly prompted Zhou to guarantee returns for his investors backing the privatization if he couldn't re-list Qihoo within a certain time frame.Anyone reading this is probably feeling quite dizzy when considering all the obstacles Zhou had to overcome. Any other executive probably would have given up after encountering just one or two of these obstacles, and Zhou's ability to complete the deal testifies to his extraordinary persistence. I still have doubts about whether he'll be able to re-list Qihoo in China as quickly as he would like to. But his remarkable achievement with this de-listing shows that this is clearly a man who makes decisions and then finishes what he starts.Disclosure: None."
3968086,40781,2016-04-26T12:27:16-04:00,"Dandang receives competing bid in buyout process.Dandang's competing bid is an example of management led buyouts that are exploiting current shareholders.YY is not only attractive for its arbitrage opportunity, but because the company continues to click on all cylinders and why its undervalued.This is why Qihoo 360 is well on its way to completing its $9.3 billion buyout.","Last year at this time, a wave of Chinese management buyouts began to hit the market. And because of the sheer volume of buyout proposals taking place, waking up to such announcements became the new normal for investors.Dangdang (NYSE:DANG), one of the leading e-commerce companies in China, was one of nearly 40 companies that received a buyout proposal last year.Dangdang's Chief Executive Officer Mr. Guoqing Li and Ms. Peggy Yu Yu proposed a going-private transaction ($630 million) to acquire all outstanding shares (""ADS"") for $7.812.This is where things get interesting.Last month, iMeigu Capital Management offered to pay $8.80 per share to shareholders, which represents a 13% premium from the original offering of $7.812. Shares jumped more than 8% on the news in anticipation of a bidding war.Then earlier this month, Jiangsu Huaxi Group announced that it has formed a consortium with iMeigu for the preliminary non-binding proposal. The two parties hired O'Melveny & Myers LLP as its international legal counsel and East & Concord Partners as its PRC legal counsel.As of right now, shares are stuck in limbo because the $7.812 offering is hanging over the heads of shareholders at the moment. This is why shares of Dangdang are stuck in the $7.00-$7.50 range for the time being until new details emerge from the buyout talk.And while Li and Yu Yu have talked about creating shareholder value over the years, their low-ball buyout proposal spoke louder than their words.So what exactly are these two organizations taking on the management led buyout?iMeigu is listed as a Cayman Islands asset management company focusing on Chinese internet investing. Huaxi Group owns more than 140 businesses with total assets totaling more than $7.5 billion. Safe to say, a bidding war won't likely scare or deter this consortium away.While it makes sense that shareholders want the higher bid to be accepted, the only problem at the moment is that Li and Yu Yu own 36% of the company's shares, which represents roughly 83% of the total voting power.But at the end of the day, it's my belief that Li and Yu Yu are going to have raise their bid if they want to succeed in their quest to take the company private. Seeing as how the company IPO'd at $16 a share back in 2010, management will more than likely (and should) face a number of shareholder lawsuits for the low-ball bid.With shares closing at $7.18 on Monday, investors now have the opportunity to make at least 9% in a worst-case scenario situation and as much as 23% if the consortium deal goes through.And if a bidding war takes place, shareholders will be the ultimate winners, which is why I believe the reward significantly outweighs the risks at this point in time.Qihoo 360 inches closer to merger completionLast month, Qihoo announced shareholder approval of its $77.00 per share going private transaction. The deal was expected to go through as shares jumped just 1% on the news.The company noted that approximately 99.8% of the votes that were cast were in favor of the proposal.With shareholder approval, Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) looks well on its way to delisting from the New York Stock Exchange as its looks to relist in China before the end of the year - likely fetching a big premium too.As the days roll on, expect shares of Qihoo to continue to narrow as it inches its way to $77. With the stock trading at $75.55, investors will see gains of approximately 2% from Monday's closing price.Why I Like YYLike Qihoo and Dangdang, YY (NASDAQ:YY) also was part of the group that was offered to be taken private. YY's Chairman Jun Lei and Chief Executive Officer David Xueling Li offered to buy the company for $3.7 billion, or $68.50 per share.Because of the bubble in the Chinese stock market last year, YY - which was actually fairly valued at the time - lost nearly 30% of its value and ended up being one of the hardest hit. YY currently trades at just 14X 2016 estimates and 10X 2017 estimates, despite growing revenues by 60% in 2015.At the close of Monday, YY sits at $63.49 and is sitting at a three-month high as it slowly inches its way to $68.50. I anticipate that shares won't climb higher than $65 until we get more details about the buyout and the progress, if any, that is taking place. This also goes right along with how a number of other Chinese companies have traded in the past.Last month, YY posted impressive growth despite the slowdown in China. The online social platform grew revenues by 62.3% to $293.3 million and reported an impressive 0.96 cents on the bottom line. This represents a 24% and 16% increase quarter-over-quarter.The increase was driven by the company's ability to grow its paying users by 30% year-over-year to 3.2 million.Other highlights include an increase of 69.3% in revenues from online music and entertainment to $176.8 million. Revenues from online dating increased by 102.4% to $29.2 million.Impressively, revenues from mobile grew 452% year-over-year and accounted for 45% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2015.Getting back to the buyout talk which has squarely held shares in check, I believe YY has the best chance out of the three of not being taken private. I also feel that if times gets closer to a deal, a bidding war - just like Dangdang among others - will quickly follow as shares are currently way undervalued.I expect shares to continue to trade in the $63-$64 range over the next month until earnings are released along with an update on the buyout talk.Bottom line: Investors should now expect Qihoo to complete its merger agreement over the next two weeks. As for Dangdang, I fully expect a bidding war to continue to take place and that shares will go well above the initial $7.812 buyout range that management tried to steal the company at.YY has the most potential and I believe that suitors will come calling just like they have for companies such as Dangdang, iKang (NASDAQ:KANG) and Starwood (NYSE:HOT), etc. I personally don't want YY's deal to go through because I believe shares should be worth $85-plus based on conservative estimates. There was a reason why shares traded as high as $96 over the past two years and at $68.50, investors are being shortchanged.Disclaimer: LinkFollow me on Twitter and StockTwits"

Qihoo already is the maker of one of China's most popular homegrown web browsers, and is also posing one of the first serious challenges in years to online search leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) with its Haosou.com engine. It's also making a big push to move its highly popular security software products into the global marketplace.Against that backdrop, this new deal looks quite intriguing and also like a smart step for Qihoo to complement its current strengths. But I would caution that Qihoo is famous for its business tactics, which many might describe as highly aggressive and even unethical. Those include designing products that make big changes to computer and smartphone configurations without their users' knowledge, most often to favor Qihoo at the expense of rival products.We'll return to that kind of broader implications of this deal shortly, but first let's look at the actual sale that will see a Chinese group purchase Opera's shares for 71 kroner ($8.52) each, representing a hefty 46 premium to their last closing price (English article, Chinese article). The deal values Opera at 10.5 billion kroner, or about $1.2 billion.Besides Qihoo, other members of the buying group include game maker Beijing Kunlun Tech, as well as financial investors Golden Brick Capital Management and Yonglian Investment Co. There's no breakdown on how much each of the partners will invest, but an equally divided participation would put the figure at about $300 million from each.Qihoo might have wanted to make this investment with less partners, as it's clearly the biggest beneficiary from a product perspective. But Qihoo's finances are a bit stretched right now, as it attempts to conduct a $9.3 billion privatization of its New York-listed American Depositary Shares (ADSs). Qihoo is pouring big money into its year-old smartphone division, which was the source of a costly battle for control last year with joint venture partner Coolpad.World's Fourth LargestOpera is the world's fourth most popular mobile browser with about 7.3 percent of the market, behind Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chrome (42 percent), Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Safari (34 percent) and the Android browser (11.1 percent). Smartphone makers that currently install the browser on some of their products include global giant Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) as well as homegrown Chinese giant Xiaomi.There's no mention of any speeches by Qihoo's controversial CEO Zhou Hongyi or any other Chinese executives at a news conference to discuss the deal. Instead, the reports include discussion by Opera executives who explained they made their decision because all of their current rivals are part of broader ecosystems of products and services.Thus Opera seems to be putting its fate into the hands of China's burgeoning online ecosystems, which are dominated by companies like Qihoo as well as the ""Big 3″ of e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), social networking leader Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Baidu. Among those four companies, Tencent would probably be my preferred partner, while Qihoo might be a distant second.That's because, as I've already said, Qihoo is known for aggressive business practices that could quickly lead to conflicts with its new Norwegian partners who are western and undoubtedly far more conservative. That said, I do like Qihoo for its forward-looking nature in terms of new products and services and also a strong ability to execute its vision. At the end of the day, we can probably expect to see some clashes early in this partnership due to differing styles. But I also expect they will eventually establish a solid working relationship that could ultimately benefit both partners.Disclosure: None."
3964132,101405,2016-04-08T17:40:56-04:00,"Going private at $77.00 per share, with the deal to close very soon.Approximately 18% annualized rate of return that will narrow as it gets closer to closing.A compelling low-risk opportunity with an adequate short-term return during a potential volatile earnings season.","Stock picking is a challenging endeavor and can certainly be more daunting during earnings season, which officially begins April 11, 2016. Keeping it simple can occasionally offer a compelling rate of return. In the short term I believe Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) offers a return that is difficult to overlook.On March 30, 2016, Qihoo announced shareholder approval of their $77.00 per share going private transaction. The deal approval with the investment consortium was not difficult to expect. Management was able to vote on the deal.In the SEC 6K filing linked in the above the company states the following:Completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The Company will work with various other parties to the Merger Agreement towards satisfying all other conditions precedent to the Merger set forth in the Merger Agreement and complete the Merger as quickly as possible. If and when completed, the Merger would result in the Company becoming a private company and its American depositary shares (the ""ADSs"") would no longer be listed or traded on any stock exchange, including the New York Stock Exchange, and the Company's ADS program would be terminated.Qihoo is seeking to complete the going private transaction as quickly as possible. Using various Chinese search engines can confirm that Qihoo is moving forward and is in the last phase of delisting from the NYSE. As Qihoo works through the closing conditions you can expect the stock to narrow toward $76.95 per share. With the stock trading at $75.80, this is a $1.15 or 1.49% spread. Note that I used the figure of $76.95 per share and not $77.00. Upon delisting from the exchange, the merger consideration to shareholders will be $76.95 per share which reflects a $0.05 ADR cancellation fee that shareholders incur.My expectation is that the deal will close in the very near term. Annualized, the projected 1.49% is approximately 18%. I have noticed that Chinese companies that have gone private this year have typically closed their respective deals within 7-10 days from the shareholder vote. As of the time of this note we are on day 9. My belief is due to the size of the buying consortium it may take Qihoo a bit longer than the average to complete the deal. From my perspective the risk of the deal falling apart is virtually nil, however that is always a risk to consider when participating in a merger arbitrage play.Moreover, earnings season which is about to begin may result in more than average market volatility. Per CNN Money and various financial pundits on TV, first quarter profits in S&P 500 companies are expected to plunge 7.9%. Of course it is unknown what the markets will do, and given the current expectations it is possible the markets have already priced in the negative profit expectations.All things being equal, Qihoo's going private transaction can be a way for investors to protect a portion of their portfolios in the near term and realize a tasty low-risk rate of return."
3962499,50682,2016-04-01T08:40:06-04:00,,"Bottom line: Qihoo's privatization is likely to succeed after shareholder approval of its buyout offer, though many similar pending deals could collapse and might consider strategic stake sales like the new one by LightInTheBox.The volume of noise coming from Chinese companies privatizing from New York has dropped sharply in the last month, reflecting volatility in their home market where many hope to one day re-list. But 2 major new stories from that wave are back in the headlines, led by shareholder approval for what would be the biggest privatization so far for security software specialist Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU).At the same time, the much smaller e-commerce firm LightInTheBox (NYSE:LITB) has just closed another deal that looks less radical than an outright privatization and could provide an alternative template for companies seeking to attract more investor attention. That deal has the company selling 30 percent of itself to Hong Kong-listed Zall Development (HKEx: 2098), which paid a large premium for the stake.The privatization wave of US-listed Chinese companies has moved in fits and starts over the last year, cruising ahead when China's stock markets rally and then suddenly losing momentum when those same markets correct. Right now Chinese stock markets seem to be in a holding pattern, which perhaps is why the privatization wave is also on hold while private equity backing most of the buyout bids waits to see how the markets will move.But one company that seems unconcerned about the volatility is Qihoo, whose strong-willed founder Zhou Hongyi made up his mind a while ago that New York investors didn't understand his company. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that New York understood his company too well, and was growing impatient with Qihoo's inability to monetize its fast-growing online search business. By comparison, Chinese investors are far less concerned with such fundamental issues as profits, and are more easily swayed by the kind of hype that Zhou is so good at dispensing.Qihoo announced its management-led buyout last year, and its shareholders have just approved the offer by an overwhelming majority of 99.8 percent of people who voted on the $9 billion deal. (company announcement; Chinese article) Under the deal Qihoo shareholders will get $77 for each of their American Depositary Shares (ADSs). The company's ADSs rose slightly to $75.70 after the vote, indicating investors are fairly certain the deal will close. I would agree with that assessment, and would add that anyone looking to make some quick cash could do so by purchasing shares at their current price.Shareholders UnimpressedNext there's LightInTheBox, which differs from other Chinese e-commerce companies in targeting foreign online shoppers for Chinese goods. Like many of its Chinese peers, LightInTheBox has failed to find much of an audience among US stock buyers.The company announced its deal to sell 30 percent of itself to Zall Development earlier this month for $3.60 per ADS, and has just announced that the deal has formally closed. (company announcement; Chinese article) Zall's price represented a premium of about 50 percent to LightInTheBox's share price when the deal was first announced, quite a bit higher than the premiums offered for many of the outright buyouts offers.But shareholders weren't too impressed by the premium, and LightInTheBox's ADSs rallied slightly after the announcement but have largely returned to previous levels since then. From a strategic standpoint, this particular deal looks promising for LightInTheBox, as it gives the company new cash and also an important partner with strong experience in the traditional and online retail sectors.LightInTheBox was briefly popular after its New York IPO in 2013, but has struggled since then and has been losing money in recent quarters. This particular investment looks like a potential alternative to the privatization that many Chinese companies are trying, as it involves the sale of a major stake to a strategic partner rather than an outright buyout that is far more costly and complex. Other companies now looking to de-list might consider a similar alternative if China's stock markets fail to stabilize, though it's unclear if similar longer-term strategic buyers would be interested in many of those firms.Disclosure: None"

Ltd (NYSE:QIHU) announced on Dec. 18, 2015, that it reached a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by a consortium of investors led by the company's chairman and CEO Zhou Hongyi. This deal involves an all-cash transaction valued at $9.3B with $1.6B debt redemption. This deal is backed up by insurance firms, venture capital firms, a billionaire and state-owned companies, securing financing. The two largest holders (61% of voting rights combined) have voted in favor, which only requires another 5% approval for the deal to go through. The deal is expected to close by 1H16. At the time of the merger each ADR shareholder will receive $77, representing 10% upside for today's price. This is an almost risk-less profit of 10%, or an annualized 20% return.Details about the Go-Private DealQIHU first announced receiving a non-binding going-private offer on June 16, 2015, for $77, a 16.6% premium to the prior day ADR's closing price. This offer became a definitive merger agreement on Dec. 18, 2015, to be acquired by a consortium of investors for $9.3B, including approximately $1.6B debt redemption. The group of investors is headed by the chairman and CEO of the company Zhou Hongyi and includes president and director of QIHU, Xiangdong Qi, Citic Guoan, Golden Brick Silk Road Capital, Sequoia Capital China, Taikang Life Insurance, Ping An Insurance, Sun Shine Insurance, New China Capital, Huatai Ruilian, Huasheng Capital, and others. At the time of the merger, all company's class A and class B shareholders will receive $51.33 in cash, and each ADR shareholder will receive $77. More details about financial advisors and legal counsel can be found in the press release.1. The chances for the deal to go through are almost certain given Zhou Hongyi's background and majority shareholders' approval.QIHU's CEO and chairman, Zhou Hongyi, has been through many litigation lawsuits (including cases with the largest Chinese corporations such as Kingsoft, Rising Antivirus and Alibaba) throughout his career and has mustered a team with expertise in the legal system. This is a very important factor that will facilitate the success of the deal.About Zhou Hongyi: Mr. Zhou founded ""3721,"" a Chinese language keyword search engine, which was acquired by Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) in 2003 for $120M. Zhou became the head of Yahoo China operations. The division was subsequently sold to Alibaba and Zhou left Yahoo in 2005. Zhou founded QIHU in 2006. QIHU developed 360 Saft Guard, which pioneered the free antivirus software business model and later received lawsuits from paid-antivirus companies such as Kingsoft, Kaspersky and RISING. Zhou and QIHU managed to survive all the litigation and drove competitors away, allowing 360 Total Security to become the absolute market leader in terms of market share. In the process, he gathered a team with legal expertise that later helped him deal with another dispute with Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY). Mr. Zhou also is an angel investor and his successful investments include Xunlei, Discuz!, Kugoo and several other Internet companies. He has a net worth of $1.4B at the beginning of 2015. He is an important facilitator of the deal.In terms of the deal's approval status, the board of the company has already approved the merger agreement and resolved to recommend the shareholders to do the same. In order for the deal to go through, the company needs at least two-thirds of the voting power to approve. At this point, Global Village Associates Ltd. owned by Zhou and the Young Vision Group Ltd. owned by Qi, have agreed to vote agreed to vote in favor of the deal. The two entities combined own 61% of voting rights attached to the outstanding shares. Only another 5% approval is needed, which is highly likely.The deal will be conducted in an all-cash transaction valued at $9.3B, including $1.6B debt redemption. Related to financing, the press release states that ""the consortium intends to fund the merger through a combination of cash contributions from the investors pursuant to equity commitment letters, and the proceeds from a committed term loan facility in an amount up to the RMB equivalent of US$3.0 billion and a bridge loan facility of up to the RMB equivalent of US$400 million, pursuant to certain debt commitment letters provided by China Merchants Bank Co., Ltd."" With the participation of a billionaire investor (Mr. Zhou), insurance companies such as Ping An Insurance, venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital, and state-owned companies such as Citic Gouan, financing should be secured without problems.From the company's strategic prospective, a domestic corporate structure/potential domestic IPO can improve QIHU's capital sourcing capabilities. QIHU went public on NYSE in 2011 when the equity market in China was under-developed and debt financing was the main source for Chinese domestic companies. Now with the Chinese equity market much more developed and governmental policy support for firms to raise capital from the stock market, QIHU should be able to have more financing flexibility for business expansion. Due to the sensitivity of its business nature (web/mobile/enterprise security), being a domestic company will help QIHU further penetrate the security market and cooperate with state-owned corporations. The investors are highly unlikely to cancel the deal, especially now it has become a definitive agreement.2. Even if the deal didn't go through, as an absolute internet and mobile security product leader in terms of user base and an increasingly strong product ecosystem, the company's business is poised for solid growth for the coming years.QIHU is a leading Internet company in China, and has built a solid product portfolio and ecosystem throughout the years. Below is QIHU's business overview, as of Dec. 2014:QIHU monetizes its product through online advertising (offering marketing opportunities through sponsored links on its platform products), Internet value-added services (revenue sharing with third-party game developers and online distribution services and payment collection service). With the dominant market position, QIHU has proven to be highly profitable and growth is expected to continue with its solid and creative development team.Even if the deal fails, downside is protected as QIHU continues to grow and the company business remains promising. The acquisition price assumes an 18x PE for 2016, which is low for an industry-leading company with 17% expected bottom line growth. Before JPM dropped coverage on QIHU after the initial non-binding deal came out (JPM is the financial advisor to the special committee), it rated QIHU as Neutral with $63 PT, which implies 17x PE for 2015 and 15x PE for 2016. This implied PE ratio is too low for a company that grew 100% and 90% bottom line for the past two years and is expected to grow at CAGR 17% bottom line for the next few years. A $77 acquisition price would only imply an 18x PE for 2016 assuming 17% CAGR for the next two years.Background for Chinese Company Going PrivateStocks for US-listed Chinese companies always seem to have a ""Chinese discount,"" trading at lower multiples than China-listed counterparts of similar business. This is mainly due to a lack of understanding of the way Chinese companies do businesses, a lack of confidence for financial reporting quality, and a fear of a crash in the Chinese financial system. In the past year, the Chinese government has been coming up with new regulation policies to form a more developed financial market in which it would be easier for companies to raise equity. The Chinese then-bull stock market gave birth to many ""going private"" deals with US-listed Chinese companies hoping to get a better valuation in the Chinese market.All in all, QIHU's ""go-private deal"" provides a 10%, or an annualized 20% return, which is attractive given its risk-reward tradeoff in this equity market."
3724366,25265,2015-12-01T12:03:42-05:00,"Sources tell the WSJ that investors are close to a deal to finalize the Qihoo 360 private offer.While the merger arbitrage opportunity is not what it once was, a sizable window still exists.Investors should consider buying the stock today for a potential 9% return over a 30-45 day holding period as a deal appears imminent.","Ever since Qihoo 360 Technology (NYSE:QIHU) received a non-binding, go private proposal from an investor group led by the company's Chairman and CEO, the company has been mostly quiet on the subject. A special board committee was formed and advisors were brought in to evaluate the proposal. This is of course mostly window dressing as the company is effectively owned and controlled by those that run the variable interest entities (VIEs). And those people are Qihoo 360 insiders. This is of course true of any Chinese internet company as the Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, has restricted direct foreign ownership of any Chinese internet business. So while the offer should be reasonable, no ADR holders can stop a deal from going through if those controlling the VIEs approve a deal.Post deal announcement, the company has said very little. When it reported Q2 earnings it failed to host a conference call to discuss results like it had in the past. In its press release, the company only repeated that no decision had yet been made on the response to the proposal and there can be no assurance that a definitive offer will be made. The company's Q2 results did, however, speak for themselves. Revenues were up 38%, diluted EPADS and cash flows from operations more than doubled. The company has made excellent progress in monetizing its search business, which is #2 in China on desktop behind Baidu in terms of queries.Given the long runway for Qihoo to continue to monetize its search business and move into adjacent businesses, the buyout seems like a decent price. The $77/ADR offer is 17x 2016 estimated EPS. While that seems low for a company expected to grow 30% per annum for the next few years, it did represent a substantial premium from the share price prior to the deal announcement.Then came the summer of terror for Chinese equity investors. Stocks got pummeled, including Qihoo and despite the $77/ADR offer still on the table. Shares fell to a low of $42 in mid-September, a 45% discount to the offer price. Then came talk that the investor group might cut its bid for the company due to the rout that lowered valuations across the board. But the truth is Qihoo's valuation was never that high. It became stupid cheap with the stock at $42. And its growth prospects were never really impaired. The internet movement in China is going to happen whether or not the country's industrial sector slows. Thankfully Q3 results from internet giants like Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent showed that. Stocks have been on the rise ever since in China.Qihoo has still yet to release its Q3 earnings. Consensus expectations are for revenues of $521.3M (+38.5% YoY) and EPS, adj of $0.94/ADR (+122.9% YoY). I expect the company to continue to meet or beat expectations as the story has not really changed. Online ad revenues should rise rapidly but be partially offset by declines in other internet revenues, mainly due to the continued suspension of online lottery operations and the leveling out of gaming revenues. Could the company be waiting to receive a definitive proposal so it can make the announcement at the same time as earnings? The timing of Tuesday morning's WSJ story is curious. After saying in late August the deal price might be cut, it now believes the deal will go through at a price at or near the original offer of $77/ADR. I see no reason to believe this will not be the case. Many have argued that due to the nature of the company's security products, it would be better served listing on the mainland than on the NYSE. According to this article, the company will relist in China soon after a deal is completed. The belief is of course that the company will fetch a higher valuation listing in China.So that really just means investors funding the buyout are providing a bridge loan of sorts. Temporary financing with a potentially very high return. In order for investors to provide financing, they may want to have a reverse merger target nailed down before cutting the check. Getting all their ducks lined up of course takes time, but this article cites sources that say a deal is nearing. If the domestic Chinese stock market remains stable through the end of the year, I don't see any reason for this deal to not go through. It's quite obvious the company will be valued significantly higher on the mainland where internet valuations are much richer. While the discount to the proposed take-out price has narrowed considerably, there still exists a 9% merger arbitrage opportunity for investors. The deal could close in the next 30-45 days. On an annualized basis, that return is quite spectacular. For the reasons laid out above, I feel very comfortable adding to my position with the expectation that I will receive $75-$77 in cash per ADR in the near future."
3495716,50682,2015-09-08T13:04:36-04:00,,"Bottom line: Qihoo's (NYSE:QIHU) latest move forcing Coolpad to buy out their joint venture could be a bargaining tactic to pressure Coolpad into ditching a separate tie-up with LeTV, and could spark a bidding war for Coolpad by Qihoo and LeTV.Smartphone maker Coolpad has become a bit of a hot potato lately, though it's not clear if the company is hot property or a pariah these days. The company was one of China's earliest smartphone makers and quickly built up share as a leading name in its fledgling home market. But rampant competition as others piled into the market hurt its prospects, prompting it to form a major equity tie-up with security software maker Qihoo last December, and then with online video firm LeTV last month.The LeTV tie-up surprised many and led Qihoo feeling betrayed. Now Qihoo, whose equity tie-up came in the form of a joint venture, appears to be seeking revenge for that betrayal. In its latest move to express its outrage, Qihoo just announced it will exercise a non-compete option in their agreement that will force Coolpad to buy out their joint venture at double the current market value.Qihoo estimates the move will cost $1.5 billion, which looks quite steep for a company like Coolpad that's already struggling due to the stiff competition in China. The timing of this move also looks a bit odd since Qihoo just launched the joint venture's first smartphones two weeks ago, with ambitious plans to quickly build up share in the China and India markets (previous post).All that leads me to believe that Qihoo's latest move with the exercising of its ""put call"" is just a bargaining tactic aimed at forcing Coolpad to dump its newer alliance with LeTV. Such a tactic could ultimately force Coolpad into divorcing LeTV, which formed its own tie-up by purchasing 18 percent of Coolpad last month for $280 million (previous post).All of this may be quite a bit confusing for readers unfamiliar with the situation, so let's step back and take a closer look at the latest announcement from Qihoo in this brewing battle for Coolpad. According to its announcement, Qihoo has decided to exercise its put option forcing Coolpad to buy out Qihoo's stake in their joint venture announced last December (company announcement).Expensive Price TagQihoo now holds 49.5 percent of that joint venture and paid $420 million the stake when it was set up. It set up the venture as part of its own bid to enter the crowded smartphone market to promote its own online products, including its popular security software and search engine. Coolpad's motivation was more practical as it needed the cash and a wealthy backer like Qihoo due to the intense competition.In its latest announcement, Qihoo says the put option in their agreement requires Coolpad to buy out the joint venture for twice the fair market value of Qihoo's stake. By its own estimates, that stake has grown sharply in value and is now worth $742.5 million, meaning Coolpad would have to pay $1.5 billion to buy out the venture.Qihoo also was careful to add that there's no guarantee that Coolpad won't dispute the value of the joint venture or try to dispute Qihoo's move in court. All that returns us to my earlier conjecture that all of this is just a bargaining tactic to force Coolpad to dump LeTV and consider selling some or all of Coolpad to Qihoo.Previous reports had indicated that Qihoo's controversial founder Zhou Hongyi was actually considering such a move after being surprised by LeTV's investment last month. Another report last month said Qihoo also was considering abandoning an unrelated separate recent bid to privatize the company, meaning it might be planning to use its cash resources instead to make a counter-bid for Coolpad (previous post).We'll have to wait to see how Coolpad and also LeTV respond to this move by Qihoo. As I've said above, Coolpad can hardly afford the $1.5 billion price tag that Qihoo says the buyout would require. But the cash-rich LeTV could probably afford that amount, and it's quite possible LeTV's equally feisty chief Jia Yueting could decide to spark a bidding war for ultimate control of Coolpad.Disclosure: None."
3499006,50682,2015-09-09T12:32:07-04:00,,"Bottom line: The next few months are likely to see a battle unfold for control of Coolpad, with Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) as the likely victor and a smaller chance that LeTV could emerge as a white knight savior.What's likely to become an entertaining battle for control of smartphone maker Coolpad has taken a new twist with the company criticizing its joint venture partner Qihoo 360 for being a control freak. The remarks from an unnamed Coolpad executive represent the first semi-official response to a surprise move by Qihoo to shut down their joint venture formed less than a year ago.Qihoo said earlier this week that it planned to exercise a ""put option"" that would effectively shutter the joint venture, forcing Coolpad to pay $1.5 billion to buy out Qihoo's stake. Qihoo said it was entitled to make the move after Coolpad violated a non-compete clause in their agreement by selling a major stake in itself to online video firm LeTV, which also was planning a move into the smartphone business. But the struggling Coolpad can hardly afford the $1.5 billion price tag that Qihoo has said dissolution of the venture will cost.Qihoo's move didn't come as a huge surprise since the company itself was somewhat blindsided by Coolpad's tie-up with LeTV in June, just a half year after Qihoo and Coolpad signed their own joint venture agreement. Qihoo's founder and CEO Zhou Hongyi is famous for his aggressive and often controversial business tactics, meaning this kind of tactical move was almost inevitable in response to the Coolpad-LeTV tie-up.The latest reports focus on Coolpad's response to Qihoo's announcement of its plan to end the joint venture and force Coolpad to pay $1.5 billion for the breakup. Not surprisingly, no one at Coolpad was willing to speak on the record, and the executive who commented was only quoted as an anonymous company insider.Soured RelationshipThe remarks describe a relationship that quickly soured after Qihoo and Coolpad signed their joint venture agreement last December. That deal saw Qihoo give $420 million to Coolpad which desperately needed the funds due to stiff competition that was eroding its profits in China's smartphone market. Of course, if Coolpad had done its homework it would have quickly discovered that Qihoo is an extremely difficult and opinionated company to work with. And frankly speaking, anyone who accepts $420 million from a new partner should expect that the money will come with conditions attached.The reports quote the Coolpad executive saying that Qihoo wanted to make big and unreasonable changes to Coolpad's smartphone production operations almost as soon as the joint venture deal was signed (Chinese article). That's not too surprising since most of China's smartphones look and perform similarly and Qihoo probably wanted to create a new type of product that could differentiate itself from the group.Perhaps Qihoo's demands were unrealistic, but the bottom line seems to be that Coolpad was unhappy with the partnership from a very early stage. It's unclear from the remarks if Coolpad deliberately made the new LeTV alliance in a bid to upset Qihoo. But Coolpad certainly must have known that Qihoo wouldn't be happy about that newer tie-up with another smartphone newcomer.The same reports also quote Qihoo's Zhou making menacing remarks late last month, saying companies that stand in his way should beware. Those remarks came out around the same time that the Qihoo-Coolpad joint venture launched its first phones and as speculation was brewing that Qihoo might make an aggressive move following Coolpad's decision to tie-up with LeTV.The moral in all this is that it's good to understand your partners before forming a new major joint venture or other big agreement with another company. In this case Qihoo really does look like a Trojan horse that will probably ultimately destroy Coolpad in its current form. I expect the months ahead will see a heated battle for control of Coolpad and that Qihoo will ultimately emerge victorious. But for anyone betting on such an outcome, I also would add there's a small chance - perhaps 20-30 percent - that the cash-rich LeTV could emerge as a white knight to save Coolpad from such a fate.Disclosure: None."

India is actually the second stop on Qihoo's smartphone roadmap, which will begin in its home China market with the launch of the first two models of its new Qiku smartphone brand. Meizu has become a major second-tier player in its home China market over the last few years and formally announced its own move into India this week as it looks to move overseas.The pair will join several of China's top smartphone makers in the increasingly crowded India market, which shares many qualities with China. Xiaomi launched in India last year and the market quickly became its second largest globally, while Huawei's Honor brand has also scored rapid progress in the market. But Qihoo's biggest competitor in India could be Coolpad, which is already a big player in the market but also will produce Qihoo's new smartphones through a joint venture formed by the pair last year.If all this sounds just a bit crowded and confusing, it's because the Chinese manufacturers are rapidly exporting their chaotic brand of competition to nearby India. That means they are almost certain to spark similar price wars there to the ones they've begun at home, especially since most players now entering the market either have big cash piles or are backed by major cash-rich benefactors.Let's begin with Qihoo, which announced its plans to enter the smartphone space late last year when it formed a joint venture with Coolpad. Now Qihoo has formally unveiled its first 2 Qiku models from the venture, including an entry-level and higher-end model (company announcement; Chinese article). Qihoo said it will launch the models in China next month and in India in October. It said it also will launch in Indonesia by year-end, and has plans to go to Brazil, Russia and Turkey.The announcement didn't charge up Qihoo stock, which tumbled 8 percent in the latest trading session. This kind of volatility has been quite common in US-listed Chinese stocks these days. But in this case Qihoo probably spooked investors with its plans to launch an unknown brand in two of the world's most crowded and competitive markets. Qihoo's products are generally well designed and distinctive, but even I would worry this new launch will be very costly and the chances of failure are high.Meizu's India RoadmapMeantime, Meizu has formally unveiled its own roadmap to India at a media event this week (Chinese article). Meizu actually told me about its India plan back in March (previous post), so I was slightly surprised to see the move has taken so long to actually materialize. The company has formally announced it will enter India with its mid-range MX5 model priced at the equivalent of about $300.Meizu has a major financial backer for this foray via e-commerce leader Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which earlier this year invested $600 million in the smartphone maker. Alibaba has been making its own big moves into India e-commerce lately. One of its investments, the locally popular e-commerce site Snapdeal, will be one of Meizu's major outlets for this new push into the country. Meizu told me in March it hopes to sell 700,000 smartphones in India in its first year, indicating it plans to be relatively aggressive.Both Qihoo and Meizu enjoy relatively solid reputations, and Qihoo in particular is known for solid designs that could help distinguish its products from the crowd. But both China and now India are becoming so saturated with Chinese brands these days that I really don't have huge expectations for either company in these two major new campaigns.Disclosure: None."

This kind of settlement seemed likely, after Qihoo tried to forcibly sell its stake in the joint venture to Coolpad over claims that the latter had violated an anti-compete clause in their agreement.Qihoo and Coolpad formed their joint venture last year, and Qihoo made its complaint after Coolpad later formed another smartphone manufacturing partnership with online video company LeTV in June. Now Qihoo says it has settled its dispute by agreeing to boost its stake in the Coolpad joint venture to 75 percent, giving it clear control of the enterprise.Two big questions will remain going forward, following this latest development in a story that has all the elements of a trashy romance novel centered on a corporate love triangle. The first is how this new agreement will affect Coolpad's separate deal to manufacture smartphones for LeTV. The second is what will happen to Coolpad, as it gets caught in a tug-of-war between these 2 aggressive suitors. My guess is that Qihoo will ultimately take over the joint venture, leaving LeTV to buy whatever is left of Coolpad.Investors were quite happy at the development that has ended several weeks of acrimony and was posing a huge potential liability for Coolpad. That's because Qihoo was threatening to exercise an option in their joint venture agreement that would have forced Coolpad to buy out the venture for more than $1 billion.With that worry now gone investors piled back into Coolpad's stock at the end of last week, with the Hong Kong-listed shares jumping 13 percent in Friday trade. The rally was partly due to relief, but could also signal that investors believe Coolpad's days as an independent company are numbered. It could soon become a takeover target for Qihoo, LeTV, or perhaps even another buyer looking to enter the smartphone space.Taking ControlAccording to Qihoo's latest announcement, it will boost its stake in the joint venture to 75 percent from a previous 49.5 percent, with Coolpad's share falling to 25 percent from a previous 50.5 percent. (Chinese article) Qihoo said it will transfer some of the joint venture's assets that continued to make Coolpad-brand smartphones back to Coolpad, indicating that no cash changed hands as part of the settlement.Qihoo added that following the development, it will no longer pursue its previously announced plan to exercise a ""put option"" that would have forced Coolpad to buy out the joint venture. The pair set up the joint venture last December, but the partnership quickly soured as Qihoo reportedly tried to dominate the partnership despite holding a minority stake.Now that we've covered the latest developments, let's close with a look at what's likely next in this story that may still have a few chapters left. Qihoo estimated the joint venture might be worth up to $1.5 billion at the time of its earlier threat to make Coolpad buy out the business. I expect $1 billion may be a more accurate assessment, especially after the venture returned some assets to Coolpad as part of the settlement.Coolpad currently has a market value of about $700 million, meaning about a third of its value is now locked up in the joint venture. Following this settlement, I wouldn't be surprised to see Coolpad sell its remaining 25 percent stake in the venture completely to Qihoo in the next year. If and when that happens, Coolpad itself could become a relatively easy target for LeTV to take over completely and fold into its own hardware unit.Disclosure: None.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

3448796,50682,2015-08-18T13:05:06-04:00,,"Bottom line: Qihoo could drop its privatization plan and launch a buyout offer for Coolpad, in a bid to protect its joint venture with Coolpad and stop a rival offer for the company from LeTV.A new media report is detailing an intriguing behind-the-scenes clash taking place between security software specialist Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) and online video company LeTV, with big stakes involved for both sides. If the report is true, Qihoo is quickly finding itself in a difficult position that could end with collapses for its recent privatization bid or its joint venture partnership formed late last year with smartphone maker Coolpad (OTC:CHWTY).The clash is pitting 2 of China’s highest-profile Internet executives against each other, with Qihoo’s outspoken CEO Zhou Hongyi coming under a surprise attack from younger rival LeTV CEO Jia Yueting. In this case it appears Zhou may soon have to choose between going forward with his plans to privatize Qihoo, or abandon that plan and instead mount a counter-offensive to prevent LeTV from making a bid to take control of Coolpad.The story is quite complex, so it’s best to go in chronological order to understand what’s happening. Things began last December, when Qihoo entered the smartphone business by forming a joint venture with Coolpad, an experienced manufacturer and well-known brand that needed cash due to stiff competition in the Chinese market. (previous post)Six months later Coolpad’s controlling shareholder was looking to raise more cash by selling part of its stake, and many believed Qihoo would be the buyer. But then LeTV emerged as the surprise buyer, reportedly purchasing 18 percent of Coolpad for HK$2.73 billion ($350 million) in June as part of its own bid to enter the smartphone space. (previous post)Right around the same time as LeTV’s surprise Coolpad investment, Qihoo unveiled its own surprise by announcing plans to take the company private. That announcement was part of a broader wave of similar privatization plans by US-listed Chinese companies whose shares had become undervalued on Wall Street. Qihoo’s plan was the most expensive of those buyout offers, since the company has a market value of nearly $8 billion.In a Difficult SpotNow the latest media reports are saying that Qihoo’s Zhou is suddenly finding himself in a difficult situation due to the latest developments at Coolpad. According to the reports, LeTV is quietly negotiating behind the scenes to boost its stake in Coolpad further still, making it the company’s largest stakeholder. (Chinese article)A separate headline seems to support the fact that LeTV wants to boost its stake, saying that the company has just hired a former Bank of America Merrill Lynch senior executive to head its global fund-raising business. (Chinese article) LeTV’s Jia confirmed his hiring of Winston Cheng on his microblog, hinting he has big fund-raising plans ahead for such major purchases as a buyout offer for Coolpad.Obviously a LeTV takeover of Coolpad would be detrimental to Qihoo, which has already plowed more than $400 million into its own joint venture with Coolpad. One potential alternative might see Qihoo make its own counter-bid for Coolpad. But Qihoo’s Zhou reportedly might have difficulty funding such a bid, since he’s using most of his financial resources now to raise money for his privatization plan, the reports say.If all of this is true, then Zhou may soon have to make a tough decision about where his priorities lie: with privatizing his company, or with making a counter-bid for Coolpad. Qihoo’s current stock price is around $62, which is below the $66 level where it was trading before it announced the privatization plan at $77 per share. Thus abandoning the plan probably wouldn’t have a big impact on Qihoo’s stock, but would force the company to remain listed in New York for the foreseeable future.But if Qihoo was considering such a move, it should stop first to think about what Coolpad wants. At this stage it really does seem like Coolpad prefers LeTV as its partner, and thus Coolpad might rebuff a counter-offer from Qihoo. But the independent-minded Zhou was never a person to care about what his friends or enemies thought. Accordingly, it’s quite possible we could see him decide to drop his attempt to privatize Qihoo, and a bidding war could erupt for Coolpad.Disclosure: NoneEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3519486,50682,2015-09-18T03:33:13-04:00,,"A brewing spat between security software giant Qihoo 360 (NYSE: QIHU) and struggling smartphone maker Coolpad (OTCPK:CHWTF) (OTC:CHWTY) has provided some good entertainment for followers of China's vibrant Internet sector over the last few weeks. The tale has all the elements of a good trashy romance novel, including a love triangle and vengeful scheming by China's most famous Internet bad-boy.But more fundamentally, the tale is also filled with valuable lessons for anyone doing business in China's high-tech sector, or really in any of the country's emerging industries where private entrepreneurs are driving the growth. The story's biggest moral is to be careful when choosing your business partners - a lesson that many private investors have learned over the last 3 decades as China transforms from a socialist system to a market-oriented economy.At the heart of the Qihoo-Coolpad tale are two of China's most successful and colorful high-tech entrepreneurs.Leading the cast is Qihoo's controversial CEO Zhou Hongyi, playing the role of jilted lover. Zhou shot to fame as founder of one of China's earliest and most successful online search companies, which he later sold to Yahoo (YHOO) for $120 million more than a decade ago. Since then Zhou has earned a name as China's Internet bad-boy, frequently bad-mouthing opponents and drawing lawsuits for his aggressive business practices.The other leading entrepreneur is Jia Yueting, whose smooth talk has thrust his online video company LeTV to the center of China's high-tech stage. Jia has only recently emerged as a master salesman for LeTV, launching a flurry of initiatives over the last year that helped his company's stock soar five-fold this year before giving back much of those gains in the current market correction.Somewhat ironically, Coolpad, playing the role of prized lass in this high-tech love triangle, doesn't have any high-profile figures at the head of the company. Instead, Coolpad's fame is based mostly on its name, after it was among the first to recognize the important role that smartphones would play in the mobile industry.Overtaken by CompetitionUnfortunately for Coolpad, many other bigger names like Huawei and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGF) (OTCPK:LNVGY) later entered the field, often with better resources to innovate and withstand the stiff competition that quickly developed. As a result, Coolpad found its early profits and success rapidly evaporating last year, and was in need of a cash-rich patron to help revive its fortunes.That's where our tale begins, with the faded but still relatively attractive Coolpad looking for suitors in 2014 to fend off a growing field of competitors fighting for share in China's smartphone market. After several years of breakneck growth, the market would finally top out in 2014 and begin to contract this year, adding further pressure to the dozens of domestic newcomers in the market.Against that backdrop, it's not difficult to understand why Coolpad was initially charmed by Qihoo, despite the latter's bad-boy reputation. Superficially at least, Qihoo had many qualities that Coolpad wanted. Most importantly, Qihoo had lots of cash, nearly $1.7 billion to be precise, after raising $900 million through a bond offering earlier in the year. At the same time, Qihoo wanted to enter the smartphone business to better promote its core security software and newer search engine to a growing number of Chinese who did most of their web surfing over their smartphones.Last but perhaps most importantly, Coolpad made an educated guess that Qihoo was relatively ignorant about smartphones and would let Coolpad handle most of the product design and manufacturing for their planned new venture. That assumption turned out to be Coolpad's fatal mistake, as it probably would have learned from doing some better homework on Qihoo and Zhou Hongyi.Internet WunderkindDespite his aggressive business tactics, Zhou is also generally regarded as one of China's leading Internet innovators. His accomplishments are quite wide-ranging, producing an enviable stable of products that include China's first major search engine, its leading security software, and a newer search engine that is posing one of the first serious challenges in years to the dominant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). Zhou's record for innovation, combined with his aggressive tactics, should have tipped off Coolpad that Qihoo would hardly be a silent partner in any joint venture.But Coolpad, more interested in Qihoo's cash, went ahead with the tie-up, which the pair announced last December as a joint venture to produce a new brand of smartphones known as Qiku. Coolpad contributed its smartphone-making assets to the venture and received a majority stake, while Qihoo forked over $410 million for a minority 45 percent that it later boosted to 49.5 percent.But if Coolpad thought its controlling stake would give it total control over the venture, it quickly learned otherwise. Instead, Qihoo turned out to be a control freak, seeking to micromanage many aspects of the venture's product development and other operations, an unnamed high-level Coolpad executive would say in an early September interview, after soured relations between the pair burst into the public.Another report at that time cited Zhou saying ""Whoever helps me, I will treat well. Whoever stands in my way should beware,"" commenting on Qihoo's demand for divorce from the venture. But that part of the story is still to come.White Knight ArrivesAs relations between the joint venture partners were souring, LeTV's smooth-talking Jia was also searching for a partner for his own new move into smartphones. Such a move was consistent with an earlier successful strategy that saw LeTV sell its online video products by bundling them with low-priced smart TVs that included service contracts.As its unhappiness with Qihoo grew, Coolpad turned to Jia and LeTV and began to discuss their own new tie-up. The pair then surprised everyone when they announced a deal in June, just a half year after the original Qihoo-Coolpad joint venture. That newer deal saw LeTV become Coolpad's second largest shareholder by buying 18 percent of its stock from the company's largest shareholder for 2.18 billion yuan ($340 million).The new tie-up left many observers puzzled since it appeared to compete with the earlier Qihoo joint venture. But a stream of angry statements that quickly followed from Zhou made it clear that Qihoo was also blind-sided by the move. Qihoo didn't waste much time reacting, announcing in September that it planned to exercise an option that would force Coolpad to buy out the joint venture for violating a non-compete clause in the original agreement.The buyout would be particularly painful for Coolpad, which would be forced to pay twice the value of Qihoo's 49.5 percent stake in the venture under the ""put option"" that Qihoo intended to exercise. By Qihoo's own reckoning, that stake had grown in value to $742.5 million, meaning Coolpad would have to pay twice that amount - or nearly $1.5 billion - to buy out the venture. Qihoo made the announcement knowing very well that Coolpad could hardly afford such an amount, after Coolpad reported having just HK$4 billion ($512 million) in cash at the end of June.Final Chapters to be WrittenThis story of crossed lovers undoubtedly still has some chapters left, as Qihoo decides whether to really move forward with the plan to exercise its put option. Even if it moves ahead, Coolpad could easily dispute whether the LeTV tie-up violates the non-compete clause in its earlier Qihoo joint venture agreement. It could also dispute Qihoo's valuation of their joint venture, moving the process into the court system for a prolonged period.Coolpad and Qihoo will probably reach some kind of settlement in the end, even though such a deal could easily move Coolpad closer to the brink of insolvency. It's always possible that LeTV could play the role of white knight by providing cash to Coolpad for a Qihoo settlement. But LeTV could also easily decide to walk away after determining Coolpad isn't quite so attractive anymore.At the end of the day, Coolpad may end up just one of many victims of China's smartphone price wars, after failing to innovate despite its early-arriver status to the sector. The company certainly could have boosted its chances for survival by choosing a better financial backer. And at the very least, it could have yielded more control and acknowledged that perhaps Qihoo could provide the innovation it needed to survive, rather than believing it could simply.Disclosure: None.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

Qihoo has just announced that its new smartphones will carry the brand name of Dazen, and will sell for a bargain basement price of 899 yuan, or about $150.The move appears to be an extension of Qihoo’s longtime strategy of selling products cheaply or even giving them away for free, and then using those products as a marketing tool for its other paid products and services. But in this case the strategy of going after the ultra low end looks a bit questionable, since that part of the market is already quite crowded and many brands are believed to be losing money.Despite its overheated state and declining sales, China’s smartphone market has continued to draw new entrants this year even as no one shows signs of quitting. The latest entrant has been video services provider LeTV, which recently launched its new smartphones that are aimed at the middle of the market. Qihoo is taking the low road with its new Dazen Note 3, which will go on sale July 27. (English article; Chinese article)According to the reports, the new Dazen model will mainly be available through a partnership with e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) over its popular Tmall online platform. An Alibaba spokesman said Tmall is aiming to sell 1 million units of the new model, which some media reports are also calling the F2. The model will use an operating system based on Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android. But Qihoo is aiming to roll out its own OS later this year (previous post), and the new Dazen models will have the ability to be upgraded to that system.Qihoo announced its decision to make smartphones late last year. It is producing the phones in its new Qiku joint venture with manufacturer Coolpad (OTC:CHWTY), an early leader in China that has more recently fallen on hard times due to stiff competition. Coolpad surprised many late last month when it also announced another major equity tie-up and production agreement with LeTV. (previous post)Late Entry to Tough MarketNow that we’ve recapped all the details and important background, let’s look more closely at Qihoo’s new smartphone play and its likelihood of success. As I’ve said already, I’m slightly surprised that Qihoo is setting its sights on the low end of the market, which is already quite crowded with models from the likes of powerhouses Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) and Huawei, as well as smaller homegrown players like Meizu and Coolpad itself.Qihoo will have a difficult time finding an audience for its products in such a crowded market, even if the actual phones are slightly higher quality than rival products. The company’s decision to develop its own OS also looks questionable, since many people are familiar with Android and might be reluctant to change over to an unknown system developed by a small company like Qihoo.But all that said, Qihoo does have a very strong track record for developing new products and services that manage to find an audience, even in the face of stiff competition from well established players. The most notable example has been the rapid rise of its Haosou online search service, which has rapidly stolen share from the dominant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and now controls about a third of the market just 2 years after its launch.We’ll have to see what kind of reviews the new Dazen model gets, and also what the new OS looks like before we can comment much further on Qihoo’s chances of success. But based on what we’ve seen so far and current market conditions, I would still set those chances at a relatively low level of perhaps 20-30 percent.Disclosure: NoneEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

If that isn't a warning sign, I'm not sure what else would count.The Chinese Internet firm works in a collection of industries, but generally it's focused on Internet search that is dominated by Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). Without that market commanding position, the stock market has rarely rewarded Qihoo 360 with a multiple equivalent to the growth rates. In fact, if it wasn't for an offer from the Chairman that appears a bust, investors might find the stock more attractive. Nevertheless, should investors ignore some of the warning signs and buy the extreme value?Qihoo 360 has a strong history of beating analyst estimates and growing the bottom line, yet the lack of definitive progress in mobile search is a major stumbling block. The company has spent the last couple of years aggressively growing market share in the desktop search area, but the market is quickly shifting toward mobile. Even Baidu is already obtaining over 50% of revenues from mobile search.The other issue is that the large growth in online advertising is now being held down from the value-added service segment that's primarily game related. Qihoo 360 took a hit in the latest quarter due to the suspension of online lottery operations by the Chinese government, but business in this category wouldn't drop 16% if problems were only with the lottery business.At the end of Q2, the company is mostly an online-advertising business that's far behind sector leader Baidu in mobile. It doesn't paint a very appealing future.As well, a lot of the user metrics the company continues to rehash in the quarterly reports are PC-based products that are showing meaningful deceleration in growth rates. As an example, average daily clicks on the personal start-up pages were actually down approximately 72 million pages from last Q2, or nearly 10%.Most importantly, the company instilled no confidence by not providing guidance or the typical earnings call. With Qihoo 360 generating solid cash flow, one might question why the company doesn't institute a stock buyback. The stock only trades at roughly 12x forward EPS estimates. On a valuation basis, it compares very favorably to Chinese Internet stocks like Baidu and even Alibaba (NYSE:BABA).QIHU PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsIf the chairman and CEO really saw the stock as cheap as the above chart highlights, the decision to accept the ""going-private"" offer should be more swift and decisive. If he and the board of directors aren't so certain, the market isn't going to reward this stock with a multiple commensurate with the growth rate or those of other industry stocks.The recommendation is to stay away from this stock until more clarity on the buyout and the company makes a better move into mobile search. For now, the good numbers don't match the stock price and when this occurs with a Chinese stock the market stays concerned."

That signal comes in a footnote to New Oriental’s newly announced quarterly earnings, in which it declares a rare special dividend — something you wouldn’t expect a company to do if it was planning to soon de-list.At the same time, software security specialist Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) is reaffirming its previous plans to push ahead with its privatization scheme, even as investors remain skeptical that this particular deal could fall apart. Qihoo is easily the largest of China’s companies looking to privatize so far, and clearly investors are worried that the company won’t be able to complete its buyout worth nearly $10 billion due to the recent market volatility in China.Let’s begin with New Oriental, which isn’t a company I write about very much due to its slow growth. Such anemic growth has led to lack of investor interest, which is the main factor now prompting many US-listed Chinese companies to privatize. New Oriental certainly fits that profile, with the company’s shares now trading slightly below their level from 5 years ago, even as the broader US markets have surged over that time.New Oriental’s latest quarterly results show why investors aren’t so interested in the company, with revenue up 14 percent and profits down 18 percent for the period. (company announcement) But what caught my attention was the company’s declaration of a modest but unusual special dividend of $0.40 per American Depositary Share (NYSE:ADS), equating to return rate of about 1.7 percent.Such a dividend is relatively small and will only cost New Oriental $63 million. But it sends an important signal that New Oriental is committed to its New York listing, since a company preparing to privatize certainly wouldn’t feel the need to curry investor favor by offering this kind of cash reward.The company’s shares actually surged as much as 5.4 percent in trading after it announced the quarterly results, though they ultimately only closed up 0.6 percent. I would personally commend the company for sending this kind of signal, and also for its apparent decision to stay in New York. China may offer better valuations right now, but it’s hardly a place for serious companies due to high volatility and lack of sophistication among its investors.Qihoo Pushes AheadThose negative elements don’t seem too worrisome for Qihoo, whose president Qi Xiangdong has said in an interview that his company’s privatization plan is proceeding on schedule and that Qihoo plans to re-list in China. (Chinese article) US investors seemed encouraged by the comments, bidding up Qihoo shares by 3.5 percent in the latest session in New York. But the shares still trade at 15 percent below their offer price, indicating there’s still quite a lot of skepticism.Qihoo made its comments after online dating site Jiayuan (NASDAQ:DATE) similarly reaffirmed its previously announced de-listing plan. (previous post) I do think that many smaller companies like Jiayuan that were early to announce their privatization plans could succeed. But larger companies like Qihoo that disclosed buyout plans at the height of a wave of such announcements last month could have more difficulty.At the end of the day, I do think New York isn’t the best place for all Chinese companies to list. Smaller names like Jiayuan will have trouble getting noticed and could also easily become victims of short sellers, making the cost of maintaining such a listing not worthwhile. But I do think the US is the right place for bigger, industry-leading names like Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Ctrip (CTRP), and don’t expect to see any of those abandon New York anytime soon.Disclosure: None"

At the same time, Qihoo's name has appeared in another headline that says a Guangzhou man is being accused of insider trading related to a plan announced last week to take the company private.These 2 headlines aren't really too related beyond the fact that they both involve Qihoo, whose aggressive business tactics and outspoken CEO have made the company a lightning rod for controversy. The Coolpad news reflects Qihoo's recent aggressive push into smartphones, mirroring similar actions by many other Chinese Internet firms. The insider trading news is more reflective of China in general, where such dealing is rampant and largely tolerated by a securities regulator that has other larger issues on its agenda.Let's begin with the Coolpad news, which is far more significant for Qihoo as it seeks to transform from its roots as a software security specialist to a more diversified Internet services company. As part of that transformation, Qihoo late last year formed a joint venture with Coolpad, a leading domestic Chinese smartphone maker that was getting squeezed for cash amid intense competition in the market. (previous post)That alliance saw Qihoo pump $410 million into a new joint venture that presumably contained a big portion of Coolpad's smartphone-making assets. Now it looks like Qihoo could be getting ready to invest in Coolpad itself, with word that one of Coolpad's largest shareholders is preparing to sell its stock in the company.According to the reports, Data Dreamland Holding Ltd is close to a deal to sell some or all of its 1.66 billion Coolpad shares, which account for about 38 percent of the smartphone maker's total stock. Coolpad stock was suspended pending the announcement, but Data Dreamland's stake is worth about $600 million based on the company's last closing price in Hong Kong. That kind of price is certainly quite affordable for Qihoo, which would get effective control of Coolpad through such an investment combined with its existing joint venture stake.Next, let's look at the insider trading news, whose origin lies in Qihoo's announcement last week that it had received a management-led buyout offer to privatize the company at a 17 premium to its stock's last closing price. Now media are reporting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has frozen the assets of a Guangzhou man they suspect knew about the privatization news before it was announced, and used the information to make some quick profits.According to the reports, the SEC is accusing the man, Luo Haijian, of making $1 million in illegal profits by trading in Qihoo call options before the deal was announced. (English article) The regulator added that Luo had no history of trading in Qihoo shares, and believes he was tipped off to the privatization by someone who knew about the deal and used him to benefit from that information.This kind of use of third parties is quite common in China, and sees company insiders conduct illegal trades through friends and relatives to try and hide their action. In this case, the company insider was a bit unlucky, since Qihoo's shares are only traded in the US where the regulator is far more aggressive than in China. I doubt this particular action will have any big implications for Qihoo itself. But that said, company insiders must certainly be looking forward to Qihoo's departure from New York and a possible re-listing in China, where their illegal activity is far less likely to result in any serious enforcement action by the Chinese securities regulator.Disclosure: None"
3296885,67313,2015-07-02T09:33:31-04:00,"QIHU's partnership with Coolpad looking precarious given LeTV's recent investment in Coolpad.Mobile search on track to become a meaningful player, a negative to BIDU.Privatization timeline not provided. Dual-listing not an immediate possibility.","I recently met with Qihoo's (NYSE:QIHU) management to understand the progress regarding its smartphone JV with Coolpad (OTC:CHWTY) Group. The Chinese smartphone market is becoming increasingly competitive with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) allowing iPhone trade-ins as a way to drive higher penetration of the iOS ecosystem, and LeTV setting new pricing (i.e., Rmb1500) for high-end devices. Both could potentially be a negative to the subscale local brands such as the Qihoo-Coolpad QiKU-branded smartphones.Search was another focus point as management looks to take a bigger share of mobile search away from incumbent Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). While BIDU may have the most comprehensive search results in China, it is worth noting that QIHU's search is effective to the point where BIDU's incremental advantage is irrelevant to the average user. Over time, I see the ease of access and mobile device footprint to be a key driver for QIHU search, and this will be a negative to BIDU's growth prospects.Finally, on privatization, management gave no clear timing of the process. However, dual-listing in both US and China/HK is out of the question given the cost involved. I reiterate my bullish view on QIHU as I see it is one of few internet companies proactively seeking hardware-software integration as a point of differentiation.Per my discussion with management, the QIHU-Coolpad smartphone, QiKU, has an expected launch date of sometime in July. No pricing has been announced but I believe it is likely to be competitive against the Xiaomi brand in the Rmb1000-2000 range. The core app will be developed by QIHU, while the hardware will be produced by Coolpad. This type of close integration is essential to deliver a consistent user experience as Coolpad's hardware capabilities must meet the processing and power demand of the QIHU OS.While I like the direction that QIHU is pursuing, the recent investment by LeTV in Coolpad raises the concern that Coolpad+LeTV could become a more important partnership by leveraging LeTV's content library, hardware footprint, and distribution channels. If that is the case, losing a hardware partner in Coolpad could be a negative to QIHU as mobile devices remain a key channel for ecosystem expansion.On search, management targets 15% share in mobile traffic share by the end of this year and 30% by the end of next year. QIHU is in no rush with respect to monetization, so it can aggressively expand its footprint at a loss to compete against BIDU. Management has a singular focus of market share expansion before moving to monetization at the end of this year the earliest. Investors can expect further competitive pressure on BIDU as QIHU zeroes in on the mobile search market.Finally, management gave no clear timing on privatization. The process will involve some back and forth between the buyer group, which is represented by a special committee and the company. Shareholder vote is expected to take place subsequently, and the process will conclude once 2/3 of the shareholder group votes in favor. Given the higher valuation that the A-share companies command, I expect shareholders to be in favor, so QIHU can re-list in the domestic A-share market."
3265775,24663,2015-06-17T15:14:51-04:00,"QIHU's CEO and President made a private offer of $10 billion for the company.While large, this devalues QIHU's ecosystem relative to other statups with smaller ecosytems.QIHU's search business alone is worth $10 billion based on BIDU's valuation and market share.","After quite a bit of speculation, Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) co-founder, President, and CEO Hongyi Zhou created enough capital with the help of three investment firms to make a private acquisition offer for the company. The $10 billion offer is equivalent to $77 a share, and while that may seem large, it is actually very cheap.First and foremost, Qihoo 360's stock price is trading at $71 as I type, about three hours into the trading day on Wednesday. That means that if Zhou's offer is eventually accepted, there is still about 8% of upside for investors to get. That alone is worth the buy, and if Qihoo 360 shares fall further in the coming days/weeks, it would be good to add more shares to an initial position. Personally, that's my plan.Given Qihoo 360's now $10 billion offer I felt it would be beneficial to compare it versus the valuation of other technology companies with large ecosystems. After all, companies like Qihoo 360 aren't necessarily valued on past fundamental performance, but rather how its large ecosystem of monthly active users can translate into more revenue several years down the road. With that said, four companies really come to mind after hearing the bid for Qihoo 360: Snapchat, WhatsApp, Pinterest, and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU).*At time of closing the acquisition with FacebookAs you can see, there are some really big valuations attached to these ecosystems, which seemingly increase with the size of the network. None of these companies have great business models in place. WhatsApp charges users a dollar per year after their first 12 months; they reportedly earned less than $30 million last year. Snapchat is involved in ads and Pinterest just launched a new service where users can buy the products pinned on its platform.Meanwhile, not only does Qihoo 360 generate a lot of revenue - $1.5 billion during the last 12 months - but is also very profitable with an operating margin of almost 20%. Like WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Pinterest, Qihoo 360 is too in the infancy of monetizing its large network, a network that trumps those above.Qihoo 360 is involved in a lot of businesses, but at the core it is a security business, both mobile and desktop. From there it creates revenue via marketing/advertising, routing those users to third-party flights, web games, and e-commerce services among others. It has over 500 million PC security users. Then, it has a whopping 778 million users of its 360 Mobile Safe app, an increase of 240 million users year-over-year. That number alone makes 360 Mobile Safe one of the largest networks in the world, about the same size as WhatsApp, and that's just one of many Qihoo 360 services. Its from this enormous presence that Qihoo 360 has managed to branch out into other businesses that don't involve third-party services.Source: nus.eduAmong Qihoo 360's newest ventures is hardware and at-home security. After investing $410 million into one of China's most popular hardware makers, Coolpad, Qihoo 360 recently announced the launch of a $64 smartphone. Obviously, the margins on a $64 smartphone won't be all that much, but the goal is to establish a presence in hardware and gain market share. Since Qihoo 360 already has such popular apps and services, and is a company that Chinese consumers associate with, it could have success in hardware.Likewise, Qihoo 360 is building on its success in mobile, desktop, and browser security with at-home and at-work security systems. Qihoo 360 will provide home security systems for Huayuan real estate developments. Those include intelligent surveillance cameras, electrical appliance safety alarms, intelligent gas, fire alarms, etc. Given its popularity in security, Qihoo 360 has a great shot to transition nicely into this space.In essence, the opportunity in hardware and at-home security illustrates how a company can utilize a large ecosystem to successfully enter new service categories, and why such large valuations are often supported by investors. Qihoo 360's most successful category stemming from security has been its internet search business. At the end of Qihoo 360's last quarter, it reported 376 million monthly active users on its PC browser, and 133 million daily unique visitors to its browser startup page.According to the research firm Marbridge Consulting, Qihoo 360 now controls 30% of the desktop internet search market. Qihoo 360 has created this presence in less than three years, and has consequently caused leader Baidu's share to fall from 80% to just 54.5%. Furthermore, Qihoo 360 entered the mobile search business a little over a year ago, and has already established a 10% share of the market. According to the company's President, that share will too grow and reach 30%.It's from this search business that Baidu's valuations becomes an interest to me, when valuing Qihoo 360. If valuation in companies like Snapchat and Qihoo 360 are really based on the potential of an ecosystem, then Baidu's monetization should play a large role in what Qihoo 360 investors see in its future. After all, Qihoo 360's search monetization and revenue is not yet significant; it just launched an ad platform in the third quarter of last year. However, Qihoo 360 still managed to grow online ad revenue by 75% during its last quarter, a rate that is expected to accelerate as the company launches more successful ad products.With that said, Baidu has a 55% share of China's desktop search market, and about 70% in mobile search. During Baidu's last quarter, mobile accounted for 50% of its total revenue, a market that Qihoo 360 hasn't yet penetrated on a large scale. Nonetheless, Baidu has a market capitalization of nearly $75 billion based on its share of the search market and monetization. If we assume that Qihoo 360 will soon see its share of the mobile search market rise to 30%, and its 30% share of the desktop search market is sustainable, then Qihoo 360's share of both markets will be more than half of Baidu's share. Yet, Zhou's offer values Qihoo 360 at less than 15% of Baidu, a premium that doesn't seem to reflect the potential of Qihoo 360's ecosystem and business.With all things considered, one could make a strong argument that Qihoo 360's search business alone is worth well over $10 billion. This is based on the valuations of other startups, the valuation of Baidu, Qihoo 360's market share, and the fact that Qihoo 360 just started monetizing search last year and is sure to create larger revenues long-term. If so, Qihoo 360's enormous security business would be deemed worthless, not taking into account a network that's among the largest in the world. As a result, if Zhou is successful in acquiring Qihoo 360, then he's getting it cheap. Personally, I expect him to be successful, but the good news is that because of its valuation, even if unsuccessful Qihoo 360 is a stock to be held long-term. In fact, because of its valuation, investors would be best suited if the company remains public.See how Qihoo 360 ranks on Tipping The Scale, and which 9 stocks have even more upside"
3319335,40031,2015-07-13T20:30:17-04:00,Qihoo received a go private offer and is trading 19% below it.Investors stand to make 22% short-term profit if the company goes private or a large long-term gain if the company stays public.The company is investing heavily for future growth and the recent initiatives are bound to reaccelerate the growth in 2H 2015.,"Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) largely missed China's major rally in the last couple of months as the company struggled with slowing growth and as it entered new categories and markets. Qihoo has managed to gain significant search market share but trails its major competitor Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) significantly when it comes to monetization. That's about to change and Qihoo intends to rapidly increase the search monetization efforts while the company also has entered the very important healthcare search segment, which should significantly boost its revenue growth in the second half of 2015. The company also is having initial success with its enterprise security solutions and the Coolpad joint venture also is a long-term positive for Qihoo. Given the fact that the company is trading $14 below the $77 go private offer, I think the current price is a good opportunity to make a short-term profit, and if the deal fails, the long-term upside should be significantly higher. There are indications that the growth in the second half of the year will accelerate and staying public could lead to substantial upside for Qihoo shareholders in the following years.Growth slows down as Qihoo makes investmentsMargin contraction and lower revenue growth are the main reasons for Qihoo's share price staying depressed in the last couple of monthsdespite the massive rally in China. Quarterly revenue growth has slowed down from 94% in Q4 2014 to 45% in Q1 2015 and the analyst estimate for Q2 is at 39%. On the other hand, spending was significantly ahead of revenue growth and has led to significant margin contraction in the last four quarters and EPS growth was almost flat in the last two quarters after rising in triple digits until Q2 2014. The increased spending and lower revenue growth also have resulted in somewhat lower future EPS expectations, which are often the reason for a share price correction. The absence of success in mobile search monetization also is an important issue which has contributed to the stock's weakness. However, the changes and the investments that the company is making are bound to have a positive impact on future growth and are necessary if Qihoo is to keep up with the competition. However, the future is much brighter than it currently seems and there are indications that the growth will accelerate in the second half of 2015.Search monetization set to significantly improve in 2015Qihoo has managed to take significant PC search market share from Baidu in the last couple of quarters to reach 30% at the end of Q1 2015. However, the company's PC search revenue market share stood between 6% and 7% at the end of last year, which leaves room for significant improvement going forward. Qihoo's management indicated on the Q1 call that they are targeting at least 13% by the end of 2015 which essentially translates into triple-digit PC search revenue growth in 2015 assuming the total PC search market growth is flat this year. However, PC search revenues have declined in Q1 2015, according to iResearch, and the real growth is coming from mobile, which is another area that Qihoo will focus on in the following months. Qihoo's PC search revenue will likely rise significantly this year despite the declining revenues in the overall PC search market and the other reason to expect increased monetization is the company's entry into the medical search segment. Qihoo is seeing solid interest from medical advertisers and the company expects to generate significant revenues from this segment starting in Q2 2015. Management expects the medical segment to contribute roughly around 25% of the total search revenue, which shows the importance of this segment for the long-term search growth.Another reason for the lower growth in 1H 2015 is the fact that the company gathered around 100,000 advertisers by mid-2014 and paused in order to increase engagement with customers and drive higher contribution from the established base. This process should be over by the end of Q2 2015 and the company will once again focus on rapidly increasing the advertiser base in the second half of the year which will likely accelerate revenue growth.Mobile search was the real soft spot for Qihoo and the company needs to address this issue if it wants to provide a really valuable solution for its customers. Qihoo has focused on offering a localized mobile search experience and the company has started to monetize search on a small scale and management expects to ramp up this service later this year. This is another reason to expect accelerating revenue growth in the second half of 2015 and I think that the current analyst estimates for Q3 and Q4 revenue growth are conservative with significant room for improvement. The Q2 report should be an important catalyst in terms of future expectations as the company will provide Q3 revenue guidance which will likely be ahead of analyst estimates. Qihoo also has a history of easily beating its guidance as well as analyst estimates, and this gives us additional confidence that the growth will come in ahead of expectations in the next couple of quarters.Enterprise security is another important growth opportunityRecent security breaches in the U.S. are having a positive effect on demand for enterprise security solutions and we can expect a similar effect on demand in China. Qihoo's enterprise security continues to gain traction and the company is working on development and improvements through internal efforts as well as through M&A. Qihoo's management also reported increased customer engagement. Qihoo already is known for its anti-malware and antivirus solutions, but the enterprise solutions are sophisticated and the company has a good chance to consolidate the very fragmented enterprise security space in China given its strong brand in online security. From a seasonality perspective, the enterprise security business is back-end loaded, which should further contribute to my thesis about accelerated growth in the second half of the year.Qihoo enters the hardware space with Coolpad joint ventureIn addition to entering the search market and the enterprise security market, Qihoo also has decided to focus on hardware. In December 2014, Qihoo formed a strategic partnership with Coolpad to enter the Internet of Things market and has closed the transaction in late April. The joint venture is focused on mobile phone hardware, mobile operating system and mobile apps. Qihoo also recently announced the new smartphone brand QiKoo and it also will launch a new version of its mobile phone operating system 360 OS. Coolpad held the fifth place in China with 9.4% market share in 2014 and it intends to boost its online sales this year and to move up to the second place in China web sales in 2015 and close the gap to the leader Xiaomi. The joint venture also should help with Qihoo's mobile search monetization efforts and I expect a positive impact on long-term growth expectations once the partnership ramps up.Valuation, strong growth prospects and the go private offer make Qihoo very attractive at current levelsThe main reason why I find Qihoo very attractive at current levels is its valuation and the fact that the stock is trading $14 below the go private offer. Qihoo is currently trading at just 19x its expected 2015 EPS while its forward 2016 P/E is just 13. This is a very low forward valuation for a company with a five-year expected EPS growth rate of 34% and the upside potential upside could very well be north of 100% even if the expectations stay the same. Margin stabilization, renewed EPS growth and the company's continued expectations outperformance should catalyze the stock higher in the second half of the year, assuming the company stays public.The main risks include continued margin compression, competition and of course, if the go private offer gets scrapped due to the bursting of the bubble in China. If the company is unable to increase mobile search share and monetization, it will likely negatively affect its share price. Baidu also is not likely to sit back and let Qihoo take more market share and increased spending is likely for both companies in order to protect and/or gain market share from each other. I think that Qihoo has sufficient funds to compete with Baidu and if the share price stays depressed, we should expect increased buyback activity which will help protect the downside and decrease the share count, which should positively affect the EPS growth going forward.ConclusionQihoo is working hard to address the negative issues that have negatively affected its share price and there are reasons to expect a growth re-acceleration in the second half of the year. Given the go private offer of $77 per share, investors have a chance for a 23% profit given the current price ($62.54 as of this writing). Increased PC search monetization and the company's entry into the medical search segment, a ramp-up in mobile monetization as well as the increasing penetration in the enterprise security market should positively affect future growth expectations and Qihoo should perform much better in the next 12 to 18 months with potential upside in the triple digits if the company stays public."
3220006,74295,2015-05-28T17:49:06-04:00,Qihoo 360 upped its stake in the joint venture with Coolpad.This demonstrates the company's desire to open up new revenue sources.This increased stake is a good sign that Qihoo is willing to pay cash to grow revenues in unexploited arenas.,"BackgroundQihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) announced a joint venture with Chinese smartphone maker Coolpad last December and invested $409 million for a 45% stake. This joint venture will sell smartphones under the brand QiKU and will have QIHU's mobile offerings pre-installed. As Coolpad is the third-largest smartphone maker in China, this JV has a lot of potential to increase users of QIHU's mobile products and increase the company's mobile advertisement revenue. The JV also will generate hardware sales that can add another dimension to QIHU's revenues and allow it to benefit from China's growing smartphone market in a way other than ad revenue.QIHU data by YChartsQIHU Ups Its StakeThe company announced Tuesday that it has paid $45 million to increase its stake in the new JV from 45% to 49.5%. This is what Mr. Hongyi Zhou, CEO of QIHU, had to say about the move:This JV is most likely the first of many deals by QIHU to involve themselves not only on the software side of mobile but on the hardware side. This may not come in the form of joint ventures where QIHU gets revenue from actual hardware sales, but could manifest as deals negotiated with individual smartphone makers to have QIHU's mobile offerings pre-installed on the devices. The JV with Coolpad and future deals with other smartphone manufacturers will ensure that QIHU's mobile offerings can gain market share in China's growing smartphone market without the company having to spend as much on marketing to advertise its mobile products directly to consumers.Having guaranteed market share for its mobile products will allow QIHU to focus on monetizing those products instead of having to worry about maintaining and growing its user base. However, in addition to increasing the number of users for its mobile products and therefore increasing ad revenue, QIHU might actually be going another route and might want to become a player in the hardware part of the Chinese smartphone market. Whichever route management decides to pursue, whether it's signing software pre-installation deals with smartphone manufacturers, trying to become a player itself in the smartphone market or both, QIHU's management is showing that it is willing to pay cash in order to pursue and open up new revenue sources for the company.QIHU paying $45 million and increasing its stake in the JV yields an important observation: the company is leaning toward becoming a player in the hardware market for smartphones. We know this because no matter what stake QIHU has in the Coolpad JV, all of the phones sold under the QiKU brand will have QIHU's mobile offerings pre-installed. This means that QIHU will get the increased ad revenue from the JV's smartphone sales regardless of its interest in the JV. This indicates that the explanation for QIHU upping its stake is that the company wants to get more involved in the hardware aspect of the mobile market because increased interest in the JV will mean increased hardware revenue for QIHU. If the company does indeed decide to enter the hardware side of the smartphone market, it could be a very beneficial move going forward.Opening up new revenue sources is a big positive for the company whose revenues from its current offerings will eventually start to level off. With the stock looking undervalued even excluding the company's possible venture into smartphone hardware, QIHU looks like a good pick for future growth.ConclusionQIHU increased its stake in the joint venture with Coolpad, which demonstrates that the company is willing to pay to open up new sources of revenue. It also might hint at bigger designs of QIHU entering the smartphone market on the hardware side in addition to its offering on the software side. This has positive implications for the company and for the stock, which should see gains in the future."
3208516,67313,2015-05-26T03:53:13-04:00,QIHU's 1Q15 revenue was in line but EPS beat by a wide margin.Search is gaining momentum in both mobile and PC.Divesting underperforming businesses could unlock value.,"Qihoo 360's (NYSE:QIHU) 1Q15 suggested that the company's transition into mobile is on track, with ad and gaming revenue accounting for close to a quarter of the company's overall revenue. More importantly, mobile search is gaining momentum and this is essential in strengthening QIHU's mobile ecosystem in the long term. PC search was also strong and I continue to believe that QIHU will remain a threat to Baidu's (NASDAQ:BIDU) dominance in both search and app distribution. The company is expected to launch the QiKU smartphone, developed under a JV with Coolpad, and I believe this is an essential step that shows the internet company is strengthening its ecosystem by partnering with a hardware company. Although the JV's financial success is yet unknown, I believe hardware and software/service could allow QIHU to further penetrate into mobile. Lastly, the underperforming asset in PC games is a near-term drag, but one possibility of unlocking shareholder value would be to sell the asset to an A-share listed company. I remain bullish on QIHU on the back of these results.Consolidated revenue of $384m, +45% y/y, was in line with consensus while earnings of $80m, +94% y/y, were ahead of consensus. Mobile now accounts for 24% of the total revenue driven by the company's app store revenue. Additionally, QIHU recently launched mobile search Haosou in several piloted cities, and so far it has been receiving positive feedback from the user group. PC search is also performing well with the acquisition of MediaV and by attracting medical advertisers onto the platform. The solid execution in both mobile and PC allows QIHU to compete head-on with BIDU down the road, in my view.I continue to see QiKU, the smartphone developed by the Coolpad-Qihoo partnership, to be an attractive call option for investors. It's worth highlighting that the Qihoo-Coolpad JV is the first attempt by a Chinese internet company to deeply integrate its software with a reliable hardware (see: Qihoo And Coolpad: A New Ecosystem In The Making). Given that the financial impact is unknown, any upside surprise in this area could result in analysts raising their estimates, so this is largely a free option for investors.Finally, QIHU's web game business has largely underperformed in recent years, and it makes sense for the company to divest its underperforming assets to A-share listed companies that are looking to acquire internet businesses.ConclusionI remain positive on QIHU as I consider it to be a serious competitor to BIDU as it enhances its ecosystem."
3291615,50682,2015-06-29T15:45:45-04:00,,"Bottom line: LeTV's purchase of a major stake in Coolpad is likely to upset Coolpad's existing alliance with Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU), and could lead to a turbulent period that could ultimately see one of the alliances terminated.The battle for supremacy in China's crowded smartphone space has just taken a strange twist, with word that online video superstar LeTV has purchased a major stake in domestic manufacturer Coolpad This particular move was quite unexpected, as I had written just last week that software security specialist Qihoo 360 (QIHU) was the most likely candidate to purchase a stake in Coolpad being sold by the company's largest shareholder, Data Dreamland.Coolpad was once one of China's hottest homegrown smartphone makers, but intense competition drove it to form a joint venture late last year with Qihoo, which contributed $420 million in much-needed cash for its stake in the venture. That led me to believe that Qihoo could make a bid to invest directly in Coolpad and perhaps eventually buy the company outright after Data Dreamland last week announced its intent to sell some or all of its 38.3 percent stake in Coolpad (previous post).The bigger story is that many of China's largest Internet companies are now racing to get into the smartphone space, believing such a move will help to promote their mobile products and services that are most often accessed over such devices. Qihoo's Coolpad joint venture was clearly aimed in that direction, and LeTV launched its own line of smartphones in April (previous post). Most of China's other major Internet companies also have invested in the space.Against that backdrop, this latest investment by Leview Mobile, a division of LeTV, certainly looks logical but somewhat surprising due to Coolpad's existing Qihoo connection. According to the latest reports, Leview has paid the equivalent of 2.18 billion yuan ($280 million) for 18 percent of Data Dreamland's previous stake (Chinese article). The sale will reduce Data Dreamland's stake in Coolpad to about 20 percent, allowing it to maintain its position as the company's largest single shareholder.This particular deal comes just weeks after LeTV raised around $400 million for its Leshi Mobile unit, which was created to spearhead its move into mobile devices (previous post). That funding was led by Internet giant Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), and was so popular that the final target was reportedly raised by 50 percent, giving the unit a value of $4.5 billion.LeTV has been quite clear that it aims to become a major player in the smartphone space, even though it's quite late in coming to the market. That's because the company, along with most of its peers including Xiaomi, are all aiming to create their own ecosystems that include a wide range of Internet services and also the products like smartphones and smart TVs that deliver those services.Please Be My PartnerThis particular investment appears to show that LeTV has chosen Coolpad to be its future smartphone partner, which looks like a relatively smart choice. Coolpad was one of the earlier Chinese companies into the smartphone space, and its products are still relatively well respected despite the company's more recent loss of market share to better-funded homegrown giants like Huawei, Xiaomi and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY).But all of that said, it does seem a bit unusual for a single company to have two such major manufacturing partners, which is what has now happened to Coolpad. Even the size of Qihoo's and LeTV's investments are roughly comparable, though the vehicle for those investments is slightly different.It wouldn't be impossible for Coolpad to produce smartphones for both LeTV and Qihoo, but I could see problems quickly emerging due to the big egos and different strategies by both companies' chief executives. Accordingly, we could see some turbulent times ahead for Coolpad in the next year, which could ultimately result in the end of the partnership with either LeTV or Qihoo.Disclosure: None.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Talk about cheap!Part of the problem has been certain analysts that have been covering QIHU and their absurd downgrades, causing a massive sell-off like we recently saw in March, when shares traded for as low as $45.At a minimum, QIHU is worth $77, and if the deal doesn't go through, long-term shareholders will be cheering as they expect to see shares return back to the triple digits (me included).Will The Deal Go Through?I expect the deal to go through, and don't expect much in the way that would stop it. There may be some activist investors that step in, but it will be tough to convince the board otherwise, as most likely the plan is already in place to quickly relist back home in China.Also, the bid of $77 took four parties to come up with the cash. If investors are betting on a higher price, they should think again, because another buyer would have to likely step up and by then, management would likely just walk away.For QIHU, there are several benefits by accepting the offer. First, they would be able to relist in China, where multiples are anywhere from 3X-6X times that of what most Chinese companies are currently going for in the United States.Second, and just as important, is that management seems to be uncomfortable with how fast Wall Street wants QIHU to start monetizing its hundred of millions of users. Management has stated numerous times that they will continue to go at its own pace so that they don't disrupt or chase away current or future users.Last but not least, QIHU was getting no respect on Wall Street. Earnings would come and go (topping analyst expectations almost every time), but never really moved after earnings over the last year. I don't know about you, but if you were the CEO that wasn't being respected, and saw the opportunity to go back home and list for 3X-4X times what's currently happening, why wouldn't you take it?At the close of trading on Wednesday ($70.15), shares still have upside of around 10%. I feel investors who get in now have a great opportunity at a win-win situation. Either shares go private at $77 and you make a quick 10% gain, or the low ball offer is rejected and shares continue to march toward triple digits as investors realize that $77 just set a floor for the stock.Disclaimer: Link"
3218816,88886,2015-05-28T12:45:00-04:00,"It is crucial to listen and analyze earnings conference calls to keep track of the businesses you own.Analysis of prepared remarks and Q&A suggests that Qihoo is well on track, but it faced seasonal challenges in the iVAS segment in Q1 2015.Corporate restructuring is suggested to unlock tremendous value. However, even without that, Qihoo remains an attractive value buy at these levels.","It has been a central belief of my investment philosophy that by owning stock of a company, you own a share in the business and the performance of which determines your returns in the long run.Earnings releases are a once-a-quarter opportunity where a retail investor gets to know the business up close. I strongly suggest investors keep track of businesses they own via the earnings release and particularly the conference call that follows. I understand that not everyone is able to dedicate enough time to analyze them or has researched the story well enough to read between the lines. Hence, I have decided to write a series of articles on the conference call analyses of the stocks I own and follow. These will not explain the background or profile of the companies covered, but will help investors who already know the story to keep up with what's going on with the business. It will consist of broad themes discussed in the call that are material to the evaluation of the business, followed with my take on: a) What should the company do to further enhance shareholder value, and b) what should long-term investors be doing with the stock.Today, we will be covering Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd. (NYSE:QIHU). The company which became well known for its PC security products is undergoing a transition to be a much broader mobile services player in the Chinese Internet sector. My central investment thesis has been that Qihoo will utilize its dominant position in Internet security (user base) to emerge as a considerable second player in the lucrative Chinese search market.While it had 30% market share in PC search traffic last year, only a fraction of Qihoo's revenue came from the search division. Its successful transition to mobile search products and accelerated monetization thus would be the key to earnings growth over the next five years. With this background in place, it becomes increasingly necessary to revisit how the company is executing its plan each quarter.This article analyzes Qihoo 360's Conference Call which followed the Q1 2015 earnings release:Qihoo 360 Q1 2015 Earnings Conference CallKey Themes (And Update On Each):Transition From PC Era To Mobile Era:The strongest bear case in the Qihoo story over the last year has been around the fact that it has failed to transition from the PC era to the mobile era. The argument finds its base in the opaqueness surrounding Qihoo's mobile user engagement numbers and the fact that all PC-based segments are declining, especially PC gaming.While I was impressed by the fact that the prepared remarks started with a handsome focus on mobile and search performance, I was disappointed with the press release which contained operating matrices mostly on PC performance (only single bullet for mobile operations). Going by the perception that companies pick and choose only the strongest numbers in the press release, lack of mobile matrices does not bode well for the bull case. The only bullet that focused on mobile numbers was the one having total smartphone users. While the tally was impressive (778 million in March 2015), it is to be noted that these numbers were only for security product users (360 Mobile Safe) and not search. Finally, it was good to see a breakdown of total paying gaming users: ~1.1M out of 1.3M users were mobile users and ~200k were PC users.Numbers from 360 Mobile Safe and gaming segments tell me that Qihoo is doing pretty well in the transition on iVAS and security products. While it remains to be seen whether Qihoo can replicate the same performance on search, it will be too early to declare that it has ""failed"" in doing so.Progress On Search Business (Engagement And Monetization):When I started my long position in Qihoo, my strongest thesis was based upon Qihoo monetizing its PC search traffic and using the cash flows to fund mobile R&D, thereby gaining mobile search market share in the long run. If both panned out well, it would make Qihoo a strong second player in a lucrative long-term growth market.Engagement:Among the many efforts undertaken by Qihoo to promote user engagement on its mobile search product, two were specifically highlighted in the call: Rebranding and pre-installation.Qihoo's search engine So.com was re-branded earlier this year to Haosou (which stands for ""Good search""). The intent behind this could be to move away from the "".com"" image (which gives a PC-friendly feeling) to a new brand identity which can be increasingly promoted as ""mobile-friendly.""Qihoo also is developing its pre-installed services platform in hopes of converting device buyers into MAUs (monthly active users) of Qihoo services (Similar to how Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) utilized the Android platform). In phones manufactured under the Qikoo brand, Qihoo will launch its own operating system, named 360 OS. No timeline was given for the Qikoo phone launches, but sales and adoption of Qikoo phones will have a direct impact on the installation base of its mobile search product.With these efforts in place, we can be confident about its mobile success, but not certain. There still is an opaqueness around Qihoo's market share numbers (in terms of traffic, especially mobile), which prevents us from tracking their sequential progress.When the CFO was asked about search market share, the number provided was in revenue terms (targeting 13% by end of 2015) and not in traffic terms. When a further specific follow up inquired about the numbers in traffic terms, it was answered only for PC (30%) but not for mobile. As a continuing theme, Qihoo has been silent on mobile search market share for quite a while now. Further, when the CFO was asked if Qihoo was number 2 in terms of search revenue, he said that the company hadn't looked at its competitor's number lately, which is hard to digest.Monetization:Qihoo has made handsome progress in monetizing its PC search traffic over the last couple quarters. The narrative over last year repeatedly mentioned the impending acceleration in search monetization. While the shorts on the stock have long believed that Qihoo won't be able to do so, it's refreshing to see the numbers now backing up Qihoo's monetization promises.Qihoo-Coolpad JV Update:First, the household chore: The Qihoo-Coolpad transaction closed in April, but it needs to be noted that first quarter cash balance doesn't reflect payout.Coming to the essentials: As outlined before, the thesis behind Qihoo getting into this JV (or any other category of smart devices) is to pre-install its services and gain active users. Thereby, the success of this JV would be directly tied to the success of Qikoo brand phones (phones manufactured under Qihoo-Coolpad JV).While not much detail was given out on the launch date, CEO comments suggested that Qikoo phones might have market-differentiating hardware features (especially on aesthetics). Management also outlined its belief that consumers will buy Qikoo phones to get into the Qihoo ecosystem rather than the other way round (i.e. Qihoo OS and iVAS should help increase Qikoo sales). Overall, this adds one crucial variable to be studied and 2016 could be an interesting year for concrete updates on JV products.Seasonal Headwinds Specific To Q1 2015:While the earnings did beat on the top and bottom line, further analysis into the call tells us that the performance among verticals did vary a lot.The iVAS segment (Internet value added services), mainly game and lottery underwent a seasonal slowdown in Q1. The phrase ""seasonal headwinds/challenges/seasonal weaknesses"" were mentioned several times, but no indication was given on when they are expected to reverse. It is my assessment that while the slowdown in games segment might be seasonal, and lottery effect is here to stay till further clarity is achieved (might have 10% impact on 2015 EPS estimate).On the positive side, it should be noted that better-than-expected search monetization covered up for iVAS weakness (along with cost control in iVAS). While the iVAS weakness is modeled into analyst estimates, any reversal in performance will help boost the numbers in Q2.The Road Ahead:With my personal experience of investing in Chinese securities, I have discovered that one of the biggest challenges is to keep track of management's vision of the company. Every now and then, I get on a call and the management uses the progress on ""renewed strategy"" to explain the numbers while the new strategy was never discussed in previous calls. This experience makes me a question which was focused on seeing if CEO Hongyi Zhou's long-term vision for Qihoo had changed.The way Mr. Zhou outlined the vision, it seems to me that Qihoo wants to leverage the ""safe"" brand to transform into a multi-platform safety and services company. However, in doing so, it also ends up in segments in which it doesn't have core competency in. For example, getting into kids watches, drop cams, automotive tracking, smart home solutions, etc. It is exposing itself to newer competitors and some might say undergoing over-diversification.Suggestions:If I was an independent activist, I'd suggest Qihoo management do the following to enhance shareholder returns (in addition to its current efforts):Conclusion:I believe Qihoo is steadily moving (and increasingly spending) toward its larger plans of being a mobile Internet platform player while monetizing its search operations. However, it is late in the race and busy playing catching up. The PC era to mobile era transition hasn't proven to be easy. Qihoo also has realized that it was late in reaping the benefits of hardware-software integration, but is trying its best to speed up. Current leadership (led by Mr. Hongyi Zhou) is capable enough to win the race, but the rivals (such as Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU)) remain a tough fight.Like every other growth story in a competitive market, Qihoo has material challenges. With the harsh treatment its stock has received over the last year, it seems that market participants have factored in the worst and declared it as a ""transition failure.""However, with a capable management and exceptional track record, I believe that Qihoo deserves some more time before we make a conclusion. The mobile transition story is just picking up and if successful, can deliver long-term sustainable revenues with accelerated growth ahead. Plus, at these valuations (<12x forward P/E), the worst seems priced in. A pessimistic sentiment, high short float and renewed operating performance can bundle together to orchestrate a ""smart' recovery. I'm holding on to my positions (I could have added more if that did not break my diversification rules).Disclosure: Long QIHU."
3200416,74295,2015-05-20T17:02:56-04:00,"Qihoo 360 reported first quarter earnings Tuesday.As expected, the company showed strong growth in revenue and smartphone penetration.The long thesis is a strong as ever.","Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) reported first quarter earnings Tuesday and results were a bit mixed. Revenue for the quarter came in at $384 million, which is a 45% increase over Q1 2014 revenue, and earnings came in at $53 million or $0.54 a share. However, revenue declined 10% from the previous quarter, which also affected the company's earnings which were down from $76.8 million in net income for Q4 2014. The stock initially rose after earnings but is taking a big hit Wednesday and is down nearly 9% as I write this. So should investors be concerned about earnings?Revenue and User GrowthAs I said in the introduction, QIHU's revenue for Q1 2015 was a 45% increase over Q1 2014 revenues, but a 10% decline from Q4 2014 revenues. The company stated that this quarter-over-quarter decline was mainly due to ""soft business trend in web games and temporary suspension of online lottery operations beginning in March."" While this definitely affected the company's revenue for the quarter it is not the only segment of QIHU's revenue that showed lackluster growth this quarter. The company's explanation explains the 20.1% decline in internet value-added service revenue from the prior quarter to this quarter, but does not explain the miniscule increase in online advertising revenue of 0.9% from the prior quarter. To downplay this, QIHU made a passing mention of ""seasonal headwinds.""I was skeptical at first but then I dug into the company's previous financial reports and sure enough in the Q1 2014 report, sequential growth from online advertising revenue was relatively flat due to ""the normal effects of seasonality."" In that quarter, total sequential revenue growth was 19.6%, which was driven by strong growth in the internet value-added service segment. However, because of the reasons stated previously, growth in this segment for Q1 2015 was hit hard and so the company reported a large sequential decline in revenue. It remains to be seen whether online lottery operations in China will remain ceased and it remains to be seen whether ""soft business trend in web games"" is a legitimate excuse; either way it will be important for investors to look at the second quarter earnings report to see how this situation plays out. For the second quarter, the company guided for revenue between $435 million and $445 million. Hopefully, this is a realistic estimate and the company will return to form by providing robust revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially.Moving on from revenue, QIHU continued to see strong growth in its year-over-year user penetration metrics and in its total number of users. The company reported a user penetration of its PC-based products of 94.7% and an increase in total users of those products from 479 million in Q1 2014 to 503 million in Q1 2015. Additionally, the company's smartphone user base increased from 538 million to 778 million. As expected, the difference in the metrics reported between Q4 2014 and Q1 2015 was less significant, but QIHU still reported sequential increases in all relevant metrics. These metrics are always important to look at because they provide a sense of how the company's user base, which is the source of all revenue, is responding to products and how that user base if shifting. From this earnings report, it appears that QIHU continues to maintain a sizeable user base that it can continue to monetize.New DevelopmentsIn the first quarter, the company launched its re-branded search engine, now called Haosou. Mr. Hongyi Zhou, QIHU's CEO, stated that the company has received ""encouraging user recognition and interaction with the new brand and our search services."" QIHU hopes this rebranding will strengthen the company's image and allow it to gain share in the web and mobile search market. What effect this has on revenue and the company's user base remains to be seen, but if the move is successful, it could have positive effects on the company in the future.QIHU also announced the finalization of its joint venture with Coolpad and expects to launch a series of smartphones under the brand ""QiKoo"" within the year. This joint venture can potentially be very beneficial as the smartphones sold under this brand will have QIHU's software suite pre-installed. Coolpad is the third-largest smartphone maker by market share in China so this partnership can legitimately provide additional revenue and users for QIHU's products that the company may not have otherwise been able to reach.ConclusionQIHU's sequential revenue decline is not a positive development, but if the company's guidance is any indication this is nothing to worry about. Operating metrics continue to improve and the company's user base continues to grow incrementally. New developments for the company look promising and have the potential to attract additional revenue and additional users. The second quarter will be important to look at to see if revenue recovers and if the company can return to form. Even so, the market's reaction appears unwarranted and for those investors that like to buy the drops, right now might be a good opportunity to get into QIHU."
3085376,40781,2015-04-22T09:09:05-04:00,QIHU reported strong earnings and revenue growth that surpassed Wall Street's estimates.Why investors should really think about adding QIHU to their portfolio if they haven't already.QIHU and Coolpad's strategic partnership continues to impress with its latest announcement.QIHU is undervalued and the market is finally starting to realize it.,"Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) is a leading Internet company in China. The Company is the No. 1 provider of Internet and mobile security products in China measured by its user base, according to iResearch. QIHU also provides users with secure access points to the Internet via its market leading web browsers and application stores.The Company has built one of the largest open Internet platforms in China and monetizes its massive user base primarily through online advertising and through Internet value-added services on its platform. QIHU is the No. 1 android-based mobile distribution platform in China and No. 2 in Internet browsers and PC search in China.Image CreditWhy QIHU Is The Real DealThere isn't a whole lot of surprises when it comes to earning reports with QIHU. The Company has met or exceeded analyst estimates 15 of the last 16 quarters since its IPO back in 2011 and looks poised to keep that streak going this year.To no surprise, QIHU reported strong earnings and revenue growth last month that surpassed Wall Street's estimates once again. Below is QIHU's fourth quarter results.*QIHU's Q1 guidance is between $375M and $380MEven though guidance is ""lower"" than my estimate, investors should know that QIHU has beaten the top line by an average of $11.1M over the last three quarters and $17.5 over the last four quarters. Taking this into account, QIHU will likely post first quarter revenue in the $388M-$395 range and easily surpass expectations once again.Because of QIHU's history of delivering strong earnings over the years, I believe it is time that QIHU deserves a better valuation that is more in-line and consistent with some of its peers.Coming To Life: Qihoo, Coolpad's PartnershipLast December, QIHU and Coolpad announced that they would establish a joint venture company to move into the smartphone industry.Well that day has now come as the two giants released big news when it was announced that QIHU and Coolpad are working on a new type of smartphone design that will have a ""frameless screen"".While the specific configuration and launch time is still unknown, I like what I am seeing out of the partnership between both parties.So what will QIHU get out of all of this? While there is much still to be determined, one of the main things that QIHU will be able to launch is its preloaded apps and other technology that users will be able to use right out of the gates. Overall, I believe it is a win-win situation for both parties.The new smartphones will now be able to possess larger screen proportion than ever before with current narrow-frame smartphones. This is possible thanks to patented technology by QIHU that can render the visual effect of a smartphone's screen to be frameless through a manufacturing process while displaying a frameless visual effect to users.In my opinion, this is a game changer as far as phones go. While phones continue to get bigger and bigger (even Apple recently gave into bigger phones), the partnership will allow smaller phones to be made, that will still have the same screen size as phones that we use today. Basically, they will be maximizing every inch of the screen and that is why I believe this will provide users with a better experience and should make both parties winners.The DownsideQIHU isn't out of the gate just yet. I believe there are a couple of things that are keeping a lid on QIHU's share price. First, costs and ""slowing revenue growth"". In just over the last year, cost of revenues jumped 247.8% and operating expenses jumped 73%.While revenue's jumped 107.2% YoY, expectations for revenue in 2015 is less than 50% YoY, and 35% in 2016. If costs continue to stay high without meaningful results, QIHU could be in for some trouble down the road.Second, investors have been wanting the Company to ramp up its monetization efforts. However, Zhou Hongyi, the CEO of QIHU, has stated several times during conference calls that he wants to do so when the time is right, and at a slower pace than what most investors want. It seems Hongyi wants to keep things cool within the Company's massive user base that is still rooted in the freemium phase. If Hongyi continues to hold back efforts in the monetization phase, some investors will certainly start to look elsewhere.The UpsideBased on what has transpired over the last six months, management believes shares are currently undervalued and have been aggressively buying back shares over the last couple of months. It's one thing when a Company promises to buyback its shares, and another thing when they actually go through with it.After announcing a $200M buyback plan in October, management announced less than five months later that it had completed the program after buying back 3.4M shares for an average price of just under $59 a share.Then a couple of weeks after that, management authorized a new $200M share buyback program as the Company looks to take advantage of it current share price. With the buyback program in full force, I believe it gives investors limited downside and great upside.On top of that, the partnership with Coolpad was a terrific move by management as both stand to greatly benefit from it.Last but not least, QIHU has been very successful with its new products over the years (QIHU's search engine) which has gone from nothing, to now the No. 2 player in all of China.Valuing QIHU Going ForwardBecause of QIHU's incredible growth over the years as well as its future expected growth, I believe it's time for QIHU to start being rewarded for it.On a price/sales level, QIHU is currently sitting at 5.4X revenues which is low compared to Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES), among others. BIDU currently sits at 9.3X and NTES sits at 8X revenues. With P/S of 9 (in-line with Baidu), QIHU would be valued around $12.5B or $100 per share.On a price-to-earnings ratio equal to its peers (30), QIHU should be trading close to $73 per share, or roughly 25% upside from Thursday's closing price. On a forward P/E basis equal to its peers (25), QIHU should be trading around $90 per share.On a price-to-earnings growth level (which some analysts agree is the best measurement for high-growth stocks), QIHU is trading at 0.70. A rule of thumb is that any stock with a PEG ratio below one is considered to be undervalued. Anything over one usually signals that the security is already close to being fully valued.With a PEG of one, shares of QIHU would be valued around $82 per share and on a forward PEG basis, shares would be valued around $120 per share.Putting it all together, shares of QIHU are currently undervalued by 65% with an average valuation coming in at $12.1B, or $98 per share.Another way to look at QIHU is comparing the valuation of Sogou. Reports have Sohu.com (NASDAQ:SOHU) planning a U.S. initial public offering of its search engine (Sogou) at a valuation of more than $3B in the second half of this year.Sogou is the No. 3 player in China in terms of web search queries with market share around 8%. QIHU, the No. 2 player in China has around 20% of the market share.Remember, the bigger the valuation Sogou gets, the better it is for QIHU and BIDU going forward. If Sogou is worth $3B+ with a market share around 8%, this implies that QIHU's market share of around 20% would value its search site close to $8B, or its entire market capitalization right now. This means that investors would be getting all of QIHU's other services for free, on top of an active buyback program.For these reasons, I remain long QIHU and will look to add on any dips as the Company continues to buyback shares, report solid earnings and move forward with its partnerships.Disclaimer: Link"
3199786,22148,2015-05-20T14:04:22-04:00,"Qihoo 360 reported mixed Q1'15 operating metrics.The Chinese search play is still struggling to gain mobile market share.Qihoo 360 offers a compelling valuation, but the stock is hard to own.","After the close on Monday, Chinese technology company Qihoo 360 Technology (NYSE:QIHU) reported Q1 results that generally exceeded analyst estimates. While the scenario is generally a repeat of the Q4 results a few months back (see Qihoo 360: Extreme Value Or Value Trap), the stock remains in the doldrums dropping over 5% by mid-day trading.Qihoo 360 continues to talk too much about PC products. The good news though is an apparent shift away from overly aggressive spending. The company was in a major spending spree to compete with search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), but the latest results and analyst forecasts are for a slowdown in spending growth.The valuation is compelling, but is Qihoo 360 the stock to own in the search sector?Mixed ResultsIn general, the top and bottom line numbers were a beat, but some of the other numbers weren't as impressive. The ad revenue surged 75%, but the Internet value-added services were only up 7%. Since Qihoo obtains roughly 35% of revenues from this category, it impacted total revenue growth. The big concern is the revenue hit from a slowdown in web games.A generally positive trend was the constrained cost growth. After all, despite 45% revenue growth, Qihoo 360 only produced a $0.03 EPS increase over the same period last year. Both the costs of revenues and operating expense saw jumps from last year. The key though was a sequential reduction in the costs of revenue and a constrained roughly 4% gain in operating expenses.Though the guidance and analyst estimates already forecasted the reduced revenue growth, it is concerning that Qihoo 360 might see Baidu surpass it's growth rate. Qihoo guided towards Q2 revenue growth of 37% to 40. Baidu guided towards Q2 revenue growth of 36.5% to 37.5% growth. Prior to the updated Q1 financials, analysts gave Baidu a slight node towards actually achieving faster growth.Regardless, the biggest hit to the growth story is that Qihoo successfully obtained PC search market share of 30%, but it is still struggling in the mobile world. The company is stuck at only 8% in mobile search.Still A Value Trap?Qihoo 360 remains a difficult stock to value. It plays second fiddle to Baidu in the Chinese search market and appears focused too much on PC products and web games. After all, the summary operating metrics provided by the company outlined only one mobile number out of six metrics offered the investment community.The stock trades at an absurdly low PE ratio, but the same could be said for Baidu. At the present, it doesn't appear that Qihoo 360 has anything to justify a higher multiple than the industry leader, especially if it is struggling to generate faster revenue growth and lacks mobile search market share.TakeawayThe Chinese Internet stocks typically offer solid values, but Qihoo 360 is going to have a difficult time convincing investors to own it over the well-established Baidu if it can't grow revenue faster. In addition, the questionable positioning in the mobile world has us staying away from this stock despite a compelling valuation."
3137246,50682,2015-05-04T15:49:13-04:00,,"Bottom line: The revocation of global certification for Qihoo’s security software by 3 European bodies will undermine the company’s credibility and hamper its drive to go global, putting pressure on its stock for the next few months.Security software specialist Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) is finding itself in the middle of a global scandal, with word that several European accreditation bodies have refused to certify its core security software products due to the company’s misleading business practices. The case comes as an embarrassment to Qihoo, which is used to and largely ignores such scandals when they occur in its home market where such practices are relatively common.But as Qihoo and its peers attempt to go global, they are quickly discovering that many of the things they do at home fall well below the standards set by global bodies, especially in the west. That won’t be too helpful for Chinese tech giants like Qihoo, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Xiaomi and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), which are all trying to show the world and investors that they can compete outside their highly protected home market where standards are often a bit lower than in the west.This particular scandal involves what would normally be routine behavior for Qihoo in its home market, though the company took the unusual step of issuing a statement to respond to the controversy. The matter centers on Qihoo’s core Internet security software products, which are offered mostly for free and are popular for that reason even though they can be highly intrusive on user privacy.It seems the intrusive qualities are largely the result of default settings that Qihoo includes in its products, which could technically be changed by users to avoid sharing personal information. But as anyone who uses this kind of app knows, users often simply choose the default settings and are too lazy to make any changes. They often do so on the assumption that a company wouldn’t choose any defaults that were harmful or intrusive, though that’s not necessarily always a safe assumption.In this instance, 3 European accreditation bodies — German lab AV-TEST, Austrian lab AV-Comparatives and British testing and certification body Virus Bulletin — have taken the rare step of banding together and very publicly rescinding their previous certification awarded for Qihoo products this year. (English article; Chinese article) Their grievance is that versions of Qihoo’s products they received were “significantly different” from those given to ordinary customers.One of the big differences appears to be in the default settings, based on Qihoo’s response to the scandal. In that response, Qihoo says it disclosed the differing configuration in its products submitted to the certification bodies, and blamed the difference on the fact that many of its users use devices with lower-performance computing power. (company announcement) It added the security levels provided by the submitted products are still the same as products given to ordinary users.Chinese consumers are used to this kind of double-standard, but westerners are far less forgiving of this kind of misleading behavior. That could be problematic for Qihoo which has recently embarked on an aggressive campaign to spread its free security software products around the globe. Earlier this year the company announced it is making rapid progress on the global front, and now has more than 100 million users outside of China. (previous post)Qihoo’s shares fell 4% last week, though it’s not clear how much of that was due to the scandal. The company’s stock soared last year on big hopes for its new search engine, which seemed to be challenging leader Baidu. But they’ve lost about half their value since last summer amid disappointment about the lack of progress to monetize the search business. This latest scandal will raise more doubts about the company’s plans to globalize its older security software, and could put more downward pressure on the stock for the next few months.Disclosure: None"

As I expected earlier, PC games underperformed while mobile games were better than expected, which allowed internet value-added service revenue to increase by 112% y/y to $167m. Advertising revenue remains robust on the back of strong search and mobile monetization. Ad revenue grew by 71% y/y to $243m.On the operating level, MAU of the PC-based products grew 7% y/y to 509m, reaching 96% of China's total internet user base. The company is also making headway into the smartphone space with total smartphone user growing +59% y/y to 744m. Despite the increase in average daily users of the personal startup page, average daily clicks actually declined y/y suggesting that the shift towards mobile is gradually having a toll on QIHU's operating metrics.HighlightsMobile revenue contribution declined to 19% of total, vs. 21% in the prior quarter. The weakness in mobile is expected as I have highlighted in my preview note and I expect the weakness to persist in the near-term until QIHU is able to create content that draws users onto its platform. As for mobile search, the company rolled out a new branded mobile search and expected monetization to kick in in 2015. Worth noting: both mobile gaming and search may see minor headwinds due to the stagnating growth profile of QIHU's mobile browser, and this near-term challenge is making QIHU's push into mobile device ecosystem a top priority to drive mobile growth.Management is positive on QIHU's partnership with Coolpad and was frank about its prior entry into mobile ROM, which was not successful. Most notably, management conceded that their first attempt was not focused so they did not produce a compelling product. However, this time is different in that Coolpad is a competitive smartphone maker and Dazen is a recognized brand. With Dazen's compelling price point, hardware spec and QIHU's ecosystem in search, mobile games and security, I believe that Dazen could gain some traction in lower tier cities. While I acknowledge that competition can only increase as OEMs drive down hardware costs, QIHU could differentiate itself with its seamless hardware and software integration and stand out among the competitors.Finally, QIHU authorized another $200m share buyback and I view this to be a positive move in creating shareholder wealth. With $1.65b in cash, I see QIHU as having enough capital to pursue M&A and share buybacks.ConclusionQIHU remains one of my top picks among the Chinese internet names given its mobile presence and assets in search and mobile OS."
3208576,24663,2015-05-25T06:45:00-04:00,"QIHU can't seem to trade higher, no matter how fast it grows or how profitable it becomes.With no logical explanation, it might have to do with the company's rapidly changing identity, a change that has affected other technology companies in the past.Thankfully, this usually means higher long-term stock prices.","For the last few months I have rattled my brain trying to figure out how Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) can grow revenue 40-50%, steal valuable internet search market share from Baidu at will, and still trade at just 11.5 times next year's earnings. The formula just doesn't make sense, not given how other fast-growing technology stocks are valued. However, after thinking long and hard of why Qihoo 360 can't break out of its slump, I finally realized after its first quarter that Qihoo 360 has entered itself into a Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN)-like span.What does this mean? It suggests that Qihoo 360's stock is suffering from the uncertainty that comes with replacing an older business with a newer yet more promising business. We watched as Groupon's Local, couponing business saw sales evaporate in recent years, and even turn negative in 2014. Thankfully, Groupon was able to find a fast-growing replacement with its Goods segment, e-commerce, and Travel. The problem for Groupon's stock is that it took time for the company's Goods and Travel businesses to grow large enough to counter the losses of Local, but now, despite Local still weighing on Groupon's overall revenue growth, its Goods business is large enough to drive consistent double-digit revenue growth.In regards to Qihoo 360, its value-added services business, gaming, is quickly losing momentum. The Chinese gaming industry is both robust and highly competitive, and Qihoo 360 has not only fallen victim to this competition but also lower prices and tighter margins. During Qihoo 360's last quarter, revenue in this business rose just 7%, yet total revenue still increased 45%. The reason is its online ad revenue rose 75%, but that could be just the start for this segment.As I explained in a recent article, Qihoo 360's ad revenue is quickly becoming dominated by mobile and PC search, where Qihoo 360 has become a market leader. During the third quarter of last year Qihoo 360 launched an advertising platform, and during this last quarter management noted that advertising revenue from search was its biggest growth driver.With nearly $385 million in quarterly revenue and 35% of its total associated with gaming, Qihoo 360 is in a transition period, much like Groupon. The good news is that Qihoo 360's search-related revenue remains very small versus what it could become. For example, Baidu's market share in PC and mobile is about twice that of Qihoo 360, but it is creating well over $2.5 billion in revenue per quarter with a profit margin of 25%. Over the long term, there's no reason Qihoo 360 should not produce billions of dollars in annual revenue from search-related advertising, if it can attract advertisers and monetize its internet search business effectively.That said, Wall Street does not like change, and given the obvious strengths to Qihoo 360's business it seems likely that the stock is being punished for undergoing a Groupon-like transition. We've seen such transitions over and over within the technology sector, and Wall Street almost always rewards this level of change with stock loss. Whether it was Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) splitting its DVD business and becoming more streaming focused in 2011; Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) transitioning to the cloud and a recurring business model in 2010; or Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) seeing its margins fall lower due to the diversification of its products in 2012. The common denominator is that each of these stocks had a period of loss, but always recovered to new highs once Wall Street learned to accept these new-look companies.So, will Qihoo 360, and Groupon for that matter, join the likes of Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft, rallying to create new highs at some point in the near future? Given its ridiculously low 12x forward earnings multiple combined with its growth, I certainly expect it to perform well. Yet surprisingly, when applied to my 10 point numeric research scale for finding top value and upside, Qihoo didn't even rank in the top 5 (premium research link), which I found to be shocking. While that doesn't mean it is a bad investment, it does signal there are unknowns and risks associated with the stock, which might add to reasons that it has underperformed despite its rapid growth and attractive valuation. Nevertheless, when a company does well, it's stock tends to follow, eventually. In the case of Qihoo, it has done very well, and its valuation is more than priced accordingly for any potential risks."
2989976,74295,2015-03-10T17:18:31-04:00,"Qihoo reported solid Q4 and full-year reports Monday.Revenue continues to grow and earnings are picking up steadily as well.The company's margins rebounded, which should ease fears over margin contractions.","Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) reported earnings Monday, and while the stock initially rose after the quarterly and full-year results, QIHU is down over 5% as I write this article. It seemed as if the stock might begin a run higher after it broke $50, but the price has steadily fallen to 52-week lows. So what was in the earnings report to make investors so ambivalent?QIHU data by YChartsRevenue and Mobile MonetizationAs everyone expected, revenue and EPS growth continued to grow explosively. Revenue for Q4 was $431.2 million, a 95% increase over Q4 2013, and net income came in at $77 million, which is well above the $17 million the company earned in Q4 2013. Full-year financial results tell a similar story. For the first time, QIHU broke $1 billion in annual revenue as revenue nearly doubled from last year to $1.39 billion. Net income also more than doubled from $100 million in 2013 to $223 million in 2014. Now these numbers are easily accessible from the earnings report so why am I reading them off to you here? I did this to show how QIHU's mobile monetization program has become successful. If one looks at the metrics, QIHU's PC-related metrics such as browser penetration, clicks on its homepage and average daily unique visitors to its home site have increased only slightly from 2013, yet its revenues have doubled. So where is all this money coming from? The answer is important because it demonstrates that the company is succeeding in a space where many were skeptical it could monetize: mobile.QIHU's mobile security product now reaches 744 million users, which is a huge increase from 467 million users in Q4 2013 and a significant increase from the 673 million users from the prior quarter. Additionally, online advertising revenues, which is where mobile monetization would be reflected, increased 20.5% from Q3 2014 and increased 81.3% year-over-year. To be fair, these numbers also include monetization from web-based services, but considering QIHU has already monetized its web products and considering the only slight increase in usage for these web products, I don't think it is too far-fetched to say that a chunk of the increase in revenue can be attributed to mobile monetization, which was seen as a weak point for the company. This earnings report seems to point to QIHU's success in mobile, at least for now.Margin RecoveryOver the last few earnings reports, investors have shown discomfort with QIHU's contracting margins. This report showed some signs of margin recovery as the company's heavy spending on mobile monetization is now translating into increased revenue.QIHU's non-GAAP operating margin was 30.6%, which is significantly higher than the 21.9% margin in Q2 2014 and 24.8% margin in Q3 2014. The company's 25.4% non-GAAP net income margin for Q4 also is an improvement. Though these numbers are still down from 2012 and 2013 margins, this is mainly due to the fact that QIHU has been spending a lot of capital on monetization and expanding its mobile reach. The fact that margins are now improving is definitely a positive sign, though the company might not be completely out of the woods yet.Why Investors Got SpookedSo if these numbers are encouraging, then why is the stock selling off? It was most likely caused by QIHU's guidance of Q1 2015 revenues of $375-380 million, which would be a 12-13% decline from this quarter. This is troubling for a company like QIHU that has seen such robust revenue growth over the last few years. The company cited ""the unique seasonal pattern of the enterprise security business, which we just started in the fourth quarter of 2014"" for this revenue decline. Revenue decline is scary, but not when you consider all of QIHU's growth drivers in the future such as the enterprise security business, increased mobile penetration through the joint venture with Chinese phone-maker Coolpad and the general increased use of technology, such as PCs and smartphones in China. One bad quarter does not a value trap make.ConclusionQIHU is still trading at a steep discount to 2015 and 2016 P/E estimates when compared to its peers and revenue growth for full-year 2015 is still on track to display continuing growth. The Chinese technology market is huge and still has a lot more room to grow. QIHU is well-positioned to take advantage of this market and become successful. From this report, it looks to me like QIHU is back on track and doing fine. It's impossible to tell whether the stock has bottomed out or not, but it is easy to tell that it's undervalued. QIHU has a lot of upside potential, but investors that do decide to buy in and investors that already have should definitely keep their eyes on revenue growth (or decline) and on margins."
2989686,24663,2015-03-10T15:31:20-04:00,"QIHU earnings confirm my bullish outlook for the company, but the stock doesn't seem set on reacting to fundamentals.While remaining optimistic is difficult, investors must try to look beyond the stock losses and at the underlying business.If so, there's little doubt that QIHU is a fast-growing company full of opportunities at a value investment price.","Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) shares fell 22% the last three months, and over 40% during the last six months. In a recent article, I explained why the cause of these losses were laughable, as investors had chosen to focus on minor segments of Qihoo 360's business that are insignificant to the company's larger, long-term picture. That said, Qihoo 360's fourth quarter results and guidance proved my points to be true, but much like recent history, its stock remains under pressure despite a solid overall quarter.In my last article, I acknowledged that 40% of Qihoo's revenue comes from value-added services (mobile gaming), but that its growing share of the internet search industry is by far the biggest value driving catalyst moving forward. This is a company that has seen its PC search market share grow to 30% in just a couple short years, and its mobile search business grows to 10% in only a year's time. Qihoo has consistently stolen market share from leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and judging from the revenue and top-line growth that Baidu creates annually from a declining search market share, Qihoo investors should feel quite satisfied with its long-term prospects.That said, Qihoo 360 is still in its infancy of monetizing its search business with advertisements, but did create over $240 million in revenue from advertising. The company's President also specifically noted that its search and mobile app store businesses more than tripled last year, having grown much faster than expected. These are all positive signs for long-term investors, as is the 42% revenue growth the company expects in the coming quarter.Nonetheless, Qihoo 360 did nothing during the fourth quarter but support my bullish outlook on the stock. That said, it is very hard to hold a stock that continuously trades lower despite solid earnings results. Immediately after the quarter was announced, Qihoo 360 jumped 6% to over $50, but thanks to a poor market on Tuesday, shares have since fallen by more than 4%.As previously said, this is a company that's barely scratched the surface with monetizing its PC and mobile search business, as Qihoo doesn't even break down advertising revenue in these businesses. Thus if Baidu can earn nearly $8 billion in 12-month revenue from a 55% and 50% share of PC and mobile search, I am very confident that Qihoo 360 too can generate billions long-term with a 30% share of PC, once it reaches a targeted 30% share of mobile search. Certainly, today's post-earnings losses are hard to stomach, but on the bright side Qihoo 360 now trades at just 9x this year's expected earnings. For a company that's growing this fast with such great opportunities in advertising, a 9x forward P/E ratio is unprecedented. In my opinion, Qihoo 360 now presents as good a value opportunity as ever, but that doesn't mean the losses aren't hard to watch."
3015986,50682,2015-03-20T05:24:22-04:00,,"Bottom line: Qihoo's new smartphones, including its self-developed mobile OS, could perform well due to its strong software development record, potentially bringing some excitement back to its stock later this year.Qihoo prepares mobile OSI don't usually have lots of positive things to say about Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU), but I'll admit I'm quite intrigued by the latest word that the security software specialist is preparing to roll out its own mobile operating system (OS). The new system, to be called 360 OS, will be based on Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) popular Android OS, so in that regard it will vie with many other Android variations in the market. But regardless of that, I would expect this new OS could quickly become a major player in the fiercely competitive space, drawing on Qihoo's record as one of China's savviest and oldest software and Internet product developers.Qihoo made headlines late last year when it pumped $410 million into a new joint venture with Coolpad (HKEx: 2369), a company that is one of China's leading homegrown smartphone makers but one that is also struggling due to fierce competition at the low end of the market. This new OS was clearly in the works before that deal was announced, but appears to be part of Qihoo's broader strategy to deliver its popular Internet and security software products over its own-branded phones.Word of the OS first appeared in comments during the company's quarterly earnings call last week, and now company executives have been quietly providing more details in a build-up to the release of the first Qihoo phones. The comments from an executive only say the first phones are likely to come out in the next few months and don't provide more concrete details, focusing instead on the strategic reasons for developing Qihoo's own OS to load on its smartphones. (Chinese article)I'm not sure if I agree with the argument that any serious Internet company needs its own smartphones and mobile OS, though other Chinese giants like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) are following a similar strategy. Search leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) was also following a variation of that strategy by developing its own OS, though it could soon abandon that path after a core group from its OS team jumped ship earlier this month to go to domestic smartphone maker Meizu. (previous post)All that said, let's return to why I'm so positive on the chances of success for Qihoo's foray into the smartphone OS business. The reason is simple, namely that the company's founder Zhou Hongyi has one of the industry's best track records for creating top-notch software products and Internet services, despite his outspoken nature and sometimes ethically dubious business practices.Zhou first rose to prominence more than a decade ago as founder and creator of 3721, a search engine that was the country's leading player when it was purchased by Yahoo (YHOO) in 2003. Later Zhou left that company and founded Qihoo, which now produces some of China's most popular security software and one of the nation's top Internet browsers. Most recently, he has launched a search engine, Haosou, which has risen rapidly to pose a serious challenger to entrenched leader Baidu just 2 years after its founding.Very few companies in China can boast such a track record for consistently developing hit software products and services. One of the few that comes close is Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) (HKEx: 700), though even there the company's strength lies mostly in social networking and gaming-related products. By comparison, Zhou and Qihoo seem to have a broader ability in many different areas, and also a good understanding of where industries are headed.Qihoo's shares have gotten battered lately, losing more than half their value over the last 7 months as investors grow impatient over monetization for its search business. Positive reviews and strong early sales for its new smartphones later this year could bring some much-needed excitement back to the company, perhaps providing a boost to its stock in the second half of the year.Disclosure: None."

The dial-in detail for the earnings is below:Given the faster than expected shift from PC to mobile in both search and gaming, I would be cautious on QIHU's core business as we head into the report given its exposure in both areas. Alternatively, QIHU's recent partnership with Coolpad to promote the Dazen-brand handset with built-in QIHU ecosystem is the right strategy in that the company secured a partner that has a proven track record of designing and manufacturing smartphones. I expect QIHU to gain traction on the back of this partnership, but the key lies in how well QIHU and Coolpad integrate hardware and software together to create an unrivaled user experience.Focus ListLast year, we saw the first ever decline in web game users in China due to the shift from PC to mobile gaming. Despite the increase in gaming revenue in the near term, I believe such an increase is unsustainable as games enter their late stages of game cycle and that new mobile games will likely win increasing amount of gaming revenue from the PC channels. I believe this is a negative to QIHU's web-based games and that, over time, QIHU must ramp up on its mobile app/gaming channels to offset the PC weakness.While QIHU's online search continues to grow at a solid pace, the concern is that QIHU's rivals such as Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and UC Web (acquired by Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) in 2014) are gaining shares at QIHU's expense and I think this could directly impact QIHU's mobile search growth in the long term.Given QIHU's headwinds in mobile games and search, it is becoming apparent on its rationale of partnering with Coolpad to drive its ecosystem in mobile search, gaming, browser and mobile security. Overall I am positive on QIHU's choice of working with Coolpad and pushing the low-cost Dazen handset in China's Tier 3 and 4 cities will present the biggest opportunity for QIHU's ecosystem expansion.ConclusionGiven that QIHU is a much smaller and nimble company, I expect innovation to continue to drive growth and I would be buyer of the name as smart execution could result in the emergence of a competitive ecosystem in China."
2989426,22148,2015-03-10T14:47:39-04:00,Qihoo 360 easily surpassed analyst estimates for Q414.The Chinese Internet stock continues to trade at a compelling valuation forecast by one analyst at roughly 9x 2016 EPS estimates.The quarterly report did nothing to alleviate concerns that leave the stock in the value trap position.,"After the close on Monday, Chinese technology company Qihoo 360 Technology (NYSE:QIHU) reported Q4 results that generally smashed analyst estimates. While the top line growth rate was phenomenal, the lingering issues that sent the stock plunging from over $120 to below $50 in the last year probably weren't resolved.While the company is generally compared to Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), the search leader in China, Qihoo 360 obtains a large portion of revenue outside of search and still trails in the transition to mobile. The stock trades at a extremely low valuation for a technology stock with its growth rates, but does the China connection and lingering issues make it a value trap?Massive Q4 ResultsQihoo posted impressive results especially compared to analyst estimates. The picture becomes mixed when reviewing the results compared to prior periods. The Chinese Internet company beat Q4 analyst EPS estimates by $0.04, but the numbers were only $0.05 higher than last year, or less than 10% growth.Similar to Baidu, the sector is spending rampantly to capture dominant positions in search, mobile app distribution and other categories. The Chinese Internet sector is posting exceptional growth due to the sudden proliferation of large screen 3G and 4G mobile phones that provide consumers in that country access to the internet that was not readily accessible to all users in the past.Cost of revenue growth during Q4 was still unconstrained with a 20.7% sequential increase to $103.0 million, but operating expenses saw a major improvement. Even though revenue grew 14.6% sequentially, operating expenses were virtually flat at $201.2 million leading to margin improvements.The mix toward mobile is suddenly showing up with Internet value-added service revenues actually declining sequentially by 3.1% due to weakness in PC game operations. In addition, a lot of the other PC-based metrics including users of the PC browsers and start-up page were generally weak suggesting the shift to mobile is on full-scale transition. CEO Hongyi Zhou made the following statement in the earnings release that doesn't provide the greatest confidence that Qihoo 360 is appropriately geared towards mobile search:Extreme Value?As previous analysis suggested, Qihoo 360 has a weak spot in mobile search that was perplexing considering the ramp up of expenses in the last couple of years. The stock though still traded at an exceptional value. Prior to beating Q4 EPS estimates by $0.04, Qihoo traded at only 13x analyst numbers for 2015 that forecast 50% growth.As an example of the perplexing valuation situation, a recent Morgan Stanley report dropped the price target on the stock to $85 while forecasting a stock trading at only 9x 2016 estimates. Confidence in the company earning over $5.20 in 2016 would signal a much higher target than the previous forecast of reaching $111.50. Instead, the analyst dropped the target by $26.50.Based on comparisons to Baidu and leading domestic search giant Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Qihoo 360 trades at a favorable PE multiple.TakeawayThe Q4 earnings report did nothing to alleviate concerns that Qihoo 360 is a value trap with a declining PC game business and a slow shift to mobile search. Not to mention, the concern over a potential 5% hit to 2015 revenue from the suspension of online lottery sales in China, according to a Credit Suisse estimate.At the same time, Qihoo 360 offers some intriguing value. The stock trades at a compelling valuation with estimates for over 40% revenue growth in 2015. The company continues repurchasing shares in $200 million increments, but until Qihoo 360 shows some market leadership the stock probably won't rally too much."

Back then it was trading over $70 and has slid progressively as the news doesn't get any better.In the last 60 days, EPS estimates for this year have fallen from $3.43 to $2.88.

2888916,50682,2015-02-05T14:11:20-05:00,,"Bottom line: Qihoo 360's (NYSE:QIHU) apparent attempt to unify its various products around the 360.com brand looks smart strategically, but it needs to improve its search and cellphone businesses to win back investor interest.I'm not usually someone to write about publicity stunts, but one such new ploy by struggling security software maker Qihoo 360 has piqued my interest as it hints at some major new strategic moves. The actual news is quite straightforward, saying Qihoo has paid a record $17 million for the 360.com web domain. This news was almost certainly leaked by Qihoo, since companies pay large sums for domains all the time and the news never makes big headlines since it's kept private. That hints Qihoo may have big plans for 360.com, most likely as a platform to unify its current stable of domains and brands.Qihoo certainly could use a more unified approach to its increasingly fragmented product portfolio. Its original security software products were offered under its qihoo.com domain, and in 2013 it launched a search engine under so.com, which it rebranded late last year as haosou.com. In addition, the company also made a recent major move into smartphones with its formation of a $1 billion joint venture with the large but struggling Coolpad (previous post).According to the latest reports, Qihoo purchased the 360.com name from European mobile giant Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) after hoping to secure the domain for a while (Chinese article). The reports don't contain any additional details on Qihoo's plans for the domain. A quick trip to the 360.com site redirected me to haosou.com, which Qihoo launched as its main search site late last year.A trip to Qihoo's original search engine so.com also redirects to haosou.com, and so does a trip to qihoo.com. That appears to show that haosou.com has become Qihoo's unified web address, at least for now. But I do suspect that 360.com could soon become the new unified site, since $17 million seems like a high price tag for a site that simply redirects users to another site. The 360 name also is easier to remember and has the added benefit of an association with a ""complete view"" of the world, from the expression ""360 degrees.""For anyone who follows the record books, the previous high price for an Internet domain was $16 million for insure.com, paid in 2009, according to several online sources I checked. After that, the next highest amount appears to be for sex.com, which reportedly sold for as much as $14 million. I personally remember the sale of the business.com domain for $7.5 million at the height of the dot-com bubble in 1999, though that price now ranks around fifth on the all-time record list.But all of that background aside, let's return to the bigger picture of what all this means for Qihoo. From a purely strategic standpoint, the idea of a unified website and brand looks like a good one, as it reduces consumer confusion. Search leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), which has recently become one of Qihoo's chief rivals, has a similar strategy around its main baidu.com website, and has done quite well with such an approach.But this strategic news leak also looks at least partly designed to breathe some life and excitement back into Qihoo's sagging stock. The company's shares soared after the launch of its original search site in 2013, at one point quadrupling from their previous levels. But since then they have lost half of their value as investors grew impatient with Qihoo's efforts to monetize the search business.The company's record domain purchase appears to show Qihoo is trying to create a single brand image around the 360 name, which looks smart and logical from a marketing perspective. But the company will still need to show that it can earn money from its search business, and also that it can turn around the struggling Coolpad cellphone business before investors will start to take its stock seriously again.Disclosure: None."

However, since its post-earnings high of $75.00 on November 26th, the share price has declined to its current level of $47.39 as of March 5th.The longer-term issues that I discussed in my third-quarter earnings preview still remain, but the developments that the firm has made during the quarter show that it is moving in the right direction. The most important issue of all is the monetization of mobile search, which Qihoo has been deliberately slow at doing. With the firm set to release its fourth-quarter earnings on Monday 9th March after the close of the markets, with the conference call at 7:30 am (ET) on the 10th, investors will be looking for evidence of continued monetization, in order to close the gap between the market share in terms of traffic and revenue, as well as commentary on the promising enterprise security and hardware business lines.Business PerformanceStrong PC User Numbers Hide The Declining User Penetration RateAs the firm focuses its resources on mobile, its PC business continued to grow. Qihoo's year-end internal PC market share target of 30% in terms of traffic was reached earlier in the year, and the firm has since gone on to gain additional market share. The total number of monthly active users of Qihoo's PC products was 495m compared to 465m a year ago. However, the user penetration rate fell from 94.2% to 93.6% as China's PC user base grew at a higher rate, from 493.6m to 528.9m over the same period. The average number of daily unique visitors to the 360 Personal Start-up Page and its sub-pages was 129m whilst the average daily clicks was 723m compared to 681m a year ago. The total number of monthly active users of the 360 PC browser was 357m, compared to 342m a year ago, whilst user penetration fell from 69.3% to 67.5%. This user base growth is important, because the clear majority of search traffic comes via both the Qihoo browser, as its default search engine is 360 Search, and from other browsers whose default search engine is also 360 Search.Source: Qihoo Investor RelationsThe user penetration rate across all PC products has fallen, as China's Internet population has grown at a higher rate. This has been a common occurrence over the past few years, and it is perhaps something that investors should be concerned about. Its PC products user penetration rate remains very high, but over the past eight quarters, the compounded growth rate of PC users is 1.18%, whilst China's PC user base growth rate is 1.62% over the same period. If these growth rates remain constant, then user penetration will fall below 90% in the first quarter of 2017. Nevertheless, should this continue, the firm will likely more than cover the detrimental effect on revenues through its continued mobile monetization.Source: Qihoo Investor RelationsStrong Mobile User Base Looks Set To Be MonetizedDuring the third quarter, Qihoo maintained its market-leading status in both mobile security and third-party app distribution. The total number of 360 Mobile Safe users was 673m, compared to 408m a year ago, whilst the 360 Mobile Assistant app has over 600m users, with total daily downloads from the platform exceeding 160m. Mobile search can be accessed through browser, app, app store and other verticals, so whilst the firm sees strong downloads in the app store, it will improve its mobile browser in order improve its mobile search traffic.Source: Qihoo Investor RelationsAs with the rest of the industry, mobile has become Qihoo's core business, and it has allocated resources accordingly. The 360 Mobile Assistant now accounts for over 20% of revenues, and mobile search is making impressive progress despite the mobile search app only being released in the first quarter of 2014, but investors are expecting to see monetization. Management stated in the third-quarter earnings conference call that it may begin to monetize mobile search within the coming months. As vague as this is, management is considering the monetization strategy, and the fourth quarter conference call should give further clarity on this. The firm has been built on the foundation of building a loyal and large user base by distributing quality products for free, and monetization can occur later, albeit not at the expense of a decrease in user experience.In terms of different business segments, Qihoo is currently spending most on mobile, and in addition to search, it is building a sales team for its mobile products. 2014 was likely the final year of mobile land grabbing, and although Qihoo can't match the spending power of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), it still has a lot of financial resources available in order to improve its presence in mobile over the coming quarters.Mobile GamingThere were 2,200 games commercially running on the firm's gaming platform, with paying game accounts standing at approximately 1.1m. As the paying game user base has increased, we have seen growth in the percentage of total revenues that is contributed by games. Game developers tend to release their best games in the fourth and first quarters, so we should see further growth in paying accounts over the next two quarters. In addition, with the weeklong Chinese New Year national holiday held between the 18th and 25th of February, it will be a good time for Qihoo to grow gaming revenues, and given the timing of the earnings report, management may give some color on first-quarter gaming revenues.Source: Qihoo Investor RelationsIn my third-quarter preview, I discussed that the key difference between the Qihoo platform and its major rival Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) is that Qihoo is a third-party distributor of games, whereas Tencent predominantly develops its own games. In response to Qihoo's strength in the market, Tencent has since begun to work with third-party game developers, but Qihoo management doesn't believe that this will have a material effect on its market share. This is because, if Tencent signs an exclusivity agreement with a game developer to promote a particular game, it will commit a lot of resources to promoting it, and non-exclusive games on the platform will suffer due to the relative lack of exposure. In addition, because Tencent develops its own games, the promotion of these will understandably take priority over third-party games, and these will hence suffer. However, Qihoo rarely signs exclusivity agreements with developers, and even when it does, the period of exclusivity is short, meaning that overall, third-party games get a better deal from Qihoo.China's Developing Migration To MobileChina's search engines have been reallocating resources to set mobile as their core business strategy over the past 18 months, and this has seen notable differences emerge between the use of search on PC and mobile.As smartphones have flooded the Chinese market, the number of apps available to download has grown exponentially. The effect of this is that users spend more time on apps instead of browsing websites on mobile. However, this shift from browser to apps hasn't happened to the same extent on PC.Revenues from China's mobile Internet industries reached 51.6bn RMB ($8.33bn) in the third quarter of 2014, which represented year-on-year growth of 93.4%. This has been driven by the growth of 4G, which has taken the place of 3G and 2G, because it allows for more data-heavy apps such as video streaming and online shopping to be used more frequently. This has allowed firms to monetize mobile users in ways that were previously only available on PC, which has in turn seen more firms offer their services to mobile users.Looking into the revenue shares by industry group, mobile shopping accounted for 12.8% of mobile revenues just two and a half years ago and accounted for 51% during the third quarter of 2014. In addition, mobile marketing has seen similarly strong growth, from 6.3% to 15.3%, over the same period. The reason for this is because both industry segments have been eating into the market share of value-added services. As mobile app technology and mobile network coverage improve, the revenues that can be derived from mobile shopping and mobile advertising increases, and as we have seen, the revenues of these two sources have been growing much quicker than value-added services and have hence taken its market share.Source: iResearch ChinaAs smartphone usage grows, particularly in the central and western regions of China, mobile app download growth will continue. There is a clear difference between app downloads for iOS and Android, because iPhone users tend to download the majority of their apps via the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store whilst Android users tend to favor mobile assistants. Qihoo's Android app store 360 Mobile Assistant is the market leader because it has benefited from the strong growth in smartphones across China, particularly the budget Android phones from domestic manufacturers such as Xiaomi and Coolpad. Because these are cheaper and much more accessible than iPhones, market penetration is much higher, and hence more people use mobile assistants to download apps.3,851 Android users and 1,333 iOS users were surveyed to see how they downloaded their apps. Source: iResearch ChinaThe geography of smartphone adoption in China is visible by looking at the proportion of app downloads on Qihoo's 360 Mobile Assistant from each province. The wealthier east coast provinces account for most app downloads whilst central and western China account for relatively less. However, this also illustrates the continued growth potential for Qihoo, because whilst smartphone penetration in these regions is growing, the quality of 3G/4G and Wi-Fi isn't growing as quickly. Therefore, over the next few years, as this improves, investors can expect app download growth to increase.Source: Qihoo 360 Mobile AssistantDuring the third quarter, China's search engine revenues reached 16.4bn RMB ($2.64bn), growing 11.7% sequentially and 50.6% annually. Annual growth has been above 50% for the past three quarters, which suggests that we have reached a stable and sustainable level of growth. Annual growth has increased over the past two years, and this is due to the increased contribution to revenues from mobile search, which reached 59.9% in the third quarter, compared to 39.5% in the second quarter.In the third quarter, Qihoo's market share in terms of revenues was 2.9%, up from 2.6% in the second quarter. Whilst this seems small, it should be remembered that Qihoo's market share in terms of traffic is 30%, which illustrates the revenue growth potential when it begins to fully monetize its user base.Source: iResearch ChinaRecent DevelopmentsFrom 360 Search To Good SearchQihoo is relatively new to China's search engine market, as its PC search was launched in September 2012 and mobile search was launched in June 2014. Yet, despite this, the firm has already achieved a strong foothold in the industry, with a traffic market share of over 29%. In January, the firm decided to rebrand its search engine services from 360 Search to Good Search (好搜 - Haosou). This rebranding has also seen the search verticals, such as music, news and the Baike (similar to Wikipedia) service all move under the Haosou domain.Source: Qihoo HaosouQihoo's search services have always contrasted with market leader Baidu (BIDU) in terms of search results. This is because Baidu tends to favor larger firms and those that pay more to appear higher on search results, whereas Qihoo allows for more exposure to small- and medium-sized websites and firms, because webmasters can submit their websites' site maps into Qihoo search. Since September, Baidu has had success in ""forced mobile monetization"", as it has increased the minimum bid price of a mobile keyword, as a percentage of desktop, from 10% to 30%. Whilst this can be seen as a sign of a growing acceptance of mobile search from firms, I believe that the rising costs will crowd smaller firms out of the market, and this creates an opportunity for Qihoo. One of the key purposes of mobile search is for users to find nearby services, such as restaurants and cinemas. As Baidu raises the cost of keyword bidding for mobile search, it becomes more expensive for smaller establishments to compete for business. However, because Qihoo offers a fairer service for SMEs, I expect that we will see these firms focus more on Qihoo search instead of Baidu.I expect that this will be Qihoo's search strategy as it competes with both the Tencent-backed Sogou (NASDAQ:SOHU) and Baidu. Sogou has been integrated into Tencent's hugely-popular WeChat and QQ social networks, and as Qihoo focuses more on SMEs, both search engines have solid strategies to take market share away from both smaller rivals and from Baidu.The Integration Of MediaV And The Launch Of 360 JuxiaoIn May 2014, Qihoo announced that it had taken a 60% stake in the digital advertising firm MediaV, and in September, integrated it into the Qihoo system. Qihoo launched several new commercial tools to improve traffic monetization, and investors should start to see results in the fourth quarter.During the 2014 Qihoo World Conference, the firm announced its new ad exchange platform 360 Juxiao (360 聚效), where companies such as Sina (NASDAQ:SINA), Youku Tudou (NYSE:YOKU), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tencent offer ad space on the exchange. These firms have all committed to providing ad inventory for at least three years, and Qihoo has promised that all revenue from the platform will be given to the firm's advertising partners over its first three years of operations. In addition, MediaV's Demand Side Platform (DSP) will help to improve the performance of display ads in the 360 browser ecosystem.Revenue from the MediaV investment during the third quarter was very low and split between ad exchange and the DSP. In the coming quarters, management will likely report the split between the two sources once revenue reaches a respectable level.Merchant ConnectIn order to pursue the O2O strategy, Qihoo launched the 360 Merchant Connect (来店通) service in early October. This is a mobile e-commerce platform for merchants and service providers that has been built into the 360 Safeguard security app. Users that make or receive calls from numbers that aren't stored in their phone book will see the contact details of the merchant if they have registered that number with Qihoo. This will help users to recognize, make calls to, and receive calls from delivery personnel, customer service hotlines and other numbers that have been registered with Qihoo. It will also likely reduce the number of spam phone calls that people receive, because if the number isn't registered with Qihoo, it would be assumed to be spam or a cold call. Merchant Connect also allows firms to show their location and promotions, which should help to attract new customers in the nearby area. Since the October launch, several hundred thousand merchants have already signed up, including partnerships with group buying sites Meituan, Ping An Insurance, and online travel agent eLong.Partnership With CoolpadOn the 16th December, Qihoo announced that it had entered into a joint venture agreement with Coolpad, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer. The joint venture will see Qihoo investing $409.5m for a 45% stake, with Qihoo installing its software onto Coolpad's Dazen (大神) smartphones.Coolpad Dazen phones. Source: JD.comWhilst relatively unknown outside of China, Coolpad is a well-known brand of smartphones in China that typically caters for the budget handset market. As of October 2014, Coolpad had the fifth largest market share of domestic manufacturers within the Android smartphone market in China and was the largest 4G-smartphone provider in China in terms of accumulative unit shipment.Source: Internet Consumer Research CentreQihoo only released the majority of its mobile search products in 2014, but the firm has quickly gained a strong foothold in the market. The purpose of this deal is to attract new users through different means, and by having its software as default on Coolpad's smartphones, users will become familiar with Qihoo's services and will in turn continue to use them away from their smartphones.When the announcement was made, Qihoo's share price fell 6.9%, but mitigating factors likely attributed to this fall. December had been seeing continued weak economic data out of China, as well as falling crude oil prices, which weighed heavily on Chinese equities. However, it does appear that investors have had an air of trepidation about this deal, mainly because this isn't the first time that Qihoo has partnered with a smartphone manufacturer. In June 2012, Qihoo partnered with Huawei to release the Shanyao phone, which wasn't successful, causing CEO Zhou Hongyi to say that Qihoo would one day make a comeback from the debacle. Investors will likely be waiting to see if lessons have be learned and whether or not the joint venture can result in improvements to the top and bottom line before changing their sentiment.Development Of A VoIP AppTencent has the best mobile ecosystem entry point via its market-leading WeChat instant messaging application. Several firms have tried and failed to break its dominance, particularly Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) with its Laiwang messaging app. The failure of Laiwang has shown that firms can't compete with WeChat by releasing a like-for-like product, because users have no reason to use both systems or switch from WeChat. This is why I see the Alibaba-backed Momo (NASDAQ:MOMO) as having the potential to succeed in the market, because WeChat is used to communicate with friends, whilst Momo is used to find new friends. It's therefore not a direct competitor, so it can be and is used as a complement to WeChat.A popular feature of WeChat is Voice Call, which is a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service. This allows users of WeChat to call each other for free over an Internet connection, like Skype's service. The limitation of this is that both users have to have a WeChat account and a stable Internet connection, and in the case of Skype, if only one user has an account, calling a mobile or landline number requires payment. Qihoo has released an app that allows for a user to call a domestic phone number for free, with an Internet connection over Wi-Fi or 3G/4G, which is called 360 Free Phone (my translation of 360免费电话).Source: QihooThis isn't the first app of its ilk on the market, as Weihua and Chubao are available, but these two apps are relatively unknown and certainly wouldn't be able to compete with Qihoo's financial strength. The 360 Free Phone app is likely to offer a similar service to the Chubao app, which, along with allowing for phone calls via entering the number manually or through your phone's contact list, offers a directory of services that can be called for free via the app, such as restaurants, taxis and cinemas. I expect that Qihoo will soon launch this service using its Merchant Connect feature.Given that Qihoo is the first major tech firm in China to release such an app, I would expect to see a big boost in its mobile user base. Because it is not a direct competitor to WeChat, I believe that users will see this as an app that can be used alongside WeChat. It also has the potential to be a valuable entry point into Qihoo's mobile ecosystem, which currently includes market-leading search engine, anti-virus, and third-party game distribution services.Qihoo Loses Court Case To SogouIn my third-quarter preview, I discussed how the rejection of Qihoo's appeal against an anti-monopoly ruling regarding Tencent was likely to be the end to an ugly string of affairs between the two firms that began in 2010. On the 23rd January, a Beijing court ruled that Qihoo had to pay 51m RMB ($8.2m) to the Sohu subsidiary and Tencent-backed search engine Sogou. This relates to a 2013 case where Sogou accused Qihoo's security software Qihoo Defender of preventing users from downloading Sogou's Internet browser since 2011. This isn't the first time that Qihoo has been accused of using its security software to block access to its rivals' services, however, these incidents relate to several years ago.The Smart WatchOne of the issues with Qihoo is that whilst the firm is actively promoting its search and mobile services, there is seemingly an upper limit to its success because it is competing with the BAT trio, who have much more financial strength than Qihoo. However, one promising industry in which Qihoo is making strong progress is in wearable technology, particularly smart watches.The firm has launched a range of smart watches for children and the elderly, which not only allows them to be located, but also allows them to be contacted via a smartphone. Users can track the location of the wearer on a smartphone, and because the watch has an in-built speaker and microphone, wearers can be contacted easily. It can, in a sense, be thought of as a locatable walkie-talkie and allows for parents to give their children more freedom whilst being able to know exactly where they are. In addition, it allows for people to better take care of elderly relatives.Source: QihooThe market is incredibly promising for Qihoo, who had the highest sales of children's smart watches in the world in 2014, and is likely to become the world's largest child security firm in the near future. The smart watch only costs 289 RMB ($46) and includes a 12-month connectivity service, which after expiration, users need to continue to subscribe to the service. This also provides a viable alternative for parents, as the smart watch is a much cheaper way for parents to keep in contact with their young children than buying a smartphone.From A Valuation PerspectiveSource: Qihoo Investor RelationsQihoo's third-quarter revenues and earnings both beat analysts' expectations. Revenues grew 100.3% year on year and 18.4% sequentially to $376.4m, which was driven by strong performance in online advertising and Internet value-added services (IVAS). Online advertising revenues grew 67.2% annually and 17.9% sequentially to $201.9m whilst IVAS revenues grew 157.7% year on year and 18.2% quarter on quarter to $172.8m. The growth in IVAS revenue was driven by strong performance in PC and mobile gaming revenues, which grew 159% year on year and 31% quarter on quarter to $140.4m.Source: Qihoo Investor RelationsThe cost of revenues increased 229.7% year on year and 28.2% sequentially to $85.4m. This increase during the quarter has seen gross margin fall from 86% a year ago and 79% a quarter ago to 77%. However, I don't believe that too much emphasis should be placed on rising costs of revenue, because as the firm focuses on monetizing its search traffic and shifting resources towards mobile, increased costs should be expected.GAAP operating expenses grew 102.8% year on year and 8.3% sequentially to $225.5m, meaning that the GAAP operating margin was 18.1%, compared to 27.0% a year ago and 13.8% last quarter. GAAP net income grew 29.7% annually and 47.6% sequentially to $57.7m, resulting in a GAAP net margin of 15.3%, compared to 23.7% a year ago and 12.3% a quarter ago.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $200.1m, compared to $95.3m a year ago and $182.6m last quarter, resulting in a non-GAAP operating income of $93.3m, which grew 39.9% year on year and 33.9% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin was 24.8%, compared to 35.5% and 21.8% a year ago and a quarter ago respectively. Non-GAAP net income was $89.5m, growing 45.5% year on year and 29.3% quarter on quarter, meaning that non-GAAP net margin was 23.8%, compared to 32.7% a year ago and 21.8% last quarter.Source: Qihoo Investor RelationsDuring 2014, Qihoo has seen an improvement in its operating and net margins, which is a good sign ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings. However, we have seen a slight decline in the gross margin although I believe that this is an indication that the firm is investing its core businesses in order to boost monetization.Looking AheadFourth Quarter EarningsFor the fourth quarter, the firm is expecting revenues of between 410m and 415m, representing year-on-year growth of between 85%-87% and sequential growth of 9%-10%. Although this would represent revenue growth at the slowest rate in almost two years, when we forecast a 10% positive revenue surprise, which is typically the upper boundary over the past three years, sequential and annual growth would be in line with that of the third quarter.Source: Qihoo Investors Relations & Yahoo FinanceWith Qihoo set to release its earnings report on the 9th March, the at-the-money straddle with the closest expiration is the March Week 2 $47.50 straddle, which has a mid price of $5.20 as of the time of writing. With the break-even prices being $42.30 and $52.70, the straddle is currently forecasting a move of 10.9% by Friday 12th March.Will Investors' Bullishness Over Monetization Potential Soon Turn To Impatience?CEO Zhou Hongyi has built the firm on the ethos that the most important aspect is to build a strong user base with quality products distributed for free, because if the user base is loyal, monetization can be easily worked out. Throughout the year, Qihoo investors have cited this monetization potential, however, there comes a point where bullishness towards the potential turns into impatience over the unrealized gains.A key point that was touched upon in the third quarter conference call was that the under-monetized user base is already big enough, so there is limited present value in increasing it even further. Qihoo has developed the back end to a search union, but there is no rush for the firm to develop it further because user monetization is the priority.The Chinese tech market is very competitive, and as firms aggressively build their mobile ecosystems, their business models become ever more China centric. This makes it difficult for these firms to expand their business model overseas, as Baidu has shown with its overseas efforts, particularly in Japan and Egypt. Chinese firms also benefit from government protectionism against foreign firms, with Weibo and Youku Tudou benefiting at the expense of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and YouTube respectively. For Qihoo, its market-leading app distribution platform would have difficulty in establishing a foothold in an overseas market, because of the dominance of Google Play, which is inaccessible in China. Qihoo's management has acknowledged the difficulty of gaining traffic overseas, and I don't expect that overseas expansion of its core services will be part of the firm's near-term strategy.Qihoo is aiming for a quarter of its search traffic to come from mobile, which roughly equates to between 7-10% of the overall market, and within two years wants this figure to be 30%. This drive for higher mobile traffic will come from its search engine, which is likely to see more traffic after its recent branding and through its strong mobile game distribution platform. Rivals in this market are gaining market share, but this is at the expense of smaller firms, as opposed to Qihoo.Enterprise SecurityThe firm launched its new enterprise security products at the end of 2014 and is set to launch several more products during the first half of 2015. Therefore, when the firm releases its second-quarter earnings, the enterprise security business should be generating meaningful revenue.The fourth quarter won't have seen any meaningful revenue from enterprise security products, but management will likely discuss how the products have been performing since their release, as well as a more detailed understanding of the products that will be released later this year. Management stated in the third-quarter earnings conference call that the 2015 investment strategy would focus on improving the enterprise security business. The firm has already made some small transactions that will help to build its presence within the industry, and management will focus on continuing this in 2015.The Development Of The Mobile EcosystemManagement discussed that one of the key aims of the 2015 investment strategy is to improve the mobile platform. All of China's tech firms are investing heavily in the mobile ecosystem, and Qihoo will focus on its mobile services in order to attract new users and make current users more loyal. Internally, making improvements to mobile security and through content, such as its popular news and video platforms, will help to improve user stickiness. Externally, the firm will be looking to make acquisitions in order to improve the quality of the mobile ecosystem.With the launch of Alipay's credit rating system, we are starting to see firms monetize their huge collection of mobile user base data in ways other than through targeted advertising. This is why it is integral for firms to build a loyal user base within a closed-loop mobile ecosystem, so that more user data can be collected. Alipay has used its market-leading position in online payment to develop its credit rating system, and I would expect that Qihoo will focus on its market-leading security business in order to further monetize user data.A Broader Diversification Towards HardwareQihoo has been making an attempt to diversify away from Internet and security software, and move into hardware. As well as the smart watch that I discussed earlier, Qihoo has introduced routers, Wi-Fi dongles and web-cams. The web cam is actually a very interesting product, because as well as being able to hold video calls with family members and colleagues using the camera and a connected smartphone, it can also be used for home security. Even if the user is on the other side of the world, the camera will send still photos and videos to a user's smartphone if somebody breaks into their house.Source: QihooQihoo has moved its hardware department to the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, just to the north of Hong Kong. The city is well known for its high tech industries, and by moving the department to Shenzhen, Qihoo is making a great effort to develop its hardware business. I expect that we will see a growing focus on hardware over the coming quarters.Leveraging The Security Software Reputation To Protect The Smart Home ConceptQihoo has targeted the smart home market as a future driver of revenues. As most firms develop integrated products, Qihoo will leverage its market leading position in personal security software to develop a smart home security system. In the smart home concept, all products will be interconnected to form a LAN for the family and home. However, with all of this personal information within the network, it needs to be protected, because if the network were to be hacked, then personal information and expensive electrical goods would be compromised.Qihoo is developing smart security routers to prevent this from happening and to protect the smart home network. I believe that this is the best way for Qihoo to enter the market, because by leveraging this business on its personal and enterprise security software reputation, it would have an advantage over rivals in the market. In addition, a smart home that is protected by Qihoo would encourage users to purchase other Qihoo goods, as they would work seamlessly within the network. This would help to build market share in China's highly-competitive technology industries.The Investment Case2015 is set to be an important year for Qihoo, as it monetizes its huge user base and diversifies its revenue sources. Whilst the firm has been slow to monetize its mobile user base, indication from management that it will have a noticeable effect on revenues over the coming quarters should begin to see Qihoo fulfill its potential. Despite Baidu maintaining a dominant position in search, the gulf between Qihoo's search market share in terms of traffic and revenues is a strong indication of the revenue growth potential for Qihoo. Given that rival search engines have been much quicker at monetizing their respective user bases, investors should expect Qihoo's revenue market share to be much higher than 2.9% by the end of 2015. In addition to search, Qihoo has market-leading positions in mobile security software and mobile app distribution, giving it one of the largest mobile user bases in China.2015 will see the highly-anticipated enterprise security business generate meaningful revenue. Due to the Chinese government's concerns about foreign firms having access to private data, state organizations aren't allowed to use enterprise security software from outside of China, such as that from FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE). Understandably, this gives domestic firms a huge advantage, none more so than Qihoo, which has a dominant, market-leading position in personal security software. If the firm is able to leverage this reputation to build its enterprise security business, then investors should expect to see significant revenue contribution from enterprise security by the end of 2015.In addition to enterprise security, Qihoo has been further diversifying its revenue sources by introducing hardware products. The smart watch for children and the elderly has already seen strong sales during 2014 and will likely see the firm become the largest child smart watch manufacturer in the world. Network security for the smart home concept will likely take longer to generate meaningful revenue, but it shows that the firm is committed to building on its market-leading reputation in order to generate revenue from new sources.Investors have been waiting for Qihoo to monetize its huge user base, and there is the sense that patience has been running thin over the past few months. In November, I argued that Qihoo's fall from $102.76 in the summer to $69.36 was an indication of this, and disappointment over the perceived lack of monetization has continued since. However, 2015 will see further monetization from Qihoo, as well as revenue from new sources.The recent heavy losses on the back of a downgrade from Jefferies are exaggerated, and given the strong seasonal factors in the gaming industry in the fourth quarter, Qihoo will likely have seen stronger gaming revenues last quarter. Since the middle of February, the share price has fallen from $60 to $47, and this 21.7% fall is on the back of very little substance. Therefore, if there is concern about the fourth-quarter earnings release, then logic would suggest that it has already been completely priced into Qihoo's share price and only a substantial negative surprise would take it lower."
2766225,71845,2014-12-18T12:55:49-05:00,,"Shares of Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) have been tanking since shortly after reporting Q3, and have dropped over 25% from a post-earnings pop. One of the reasons for the slide was the prospect that growth in mobile was slowing (QoQ user growth of about 5% in its flagship mobile security app, down sharply vs. a double-digit pace reported in earlier quarters), but that wasn't the only area of concern.The company also mentioned that it was redirecting internal focus to mobile search monetization, away from PC search monetization, something which would require more R&D and patience before contributing to the bottom line.With the prospect of a PC search business on autopilot, and investing more in mobile search in a run-up to finally generating revenue, it's no wonder that shares have been sold lower. But to be fair, the stock's fall hasn't been all on management's shoulders, as there have been copious amounts of selling pressure coming from soft eco data, which has weighed on the majority of US-listed China stocks.Adding to investor concern about Qihoo 360's direction is the latest announcement that it will enter into a joint venture with Coolpad to produce handsets under the Dazen brand. Why is this concerning? It seems that the goal is to create an all-encompassing ecosystem connecting hardware, software and applications, a very lofty goal. The stretch seems even further when considering this isn't the first time Qihoo 360 has tried to enter the hardware space. So far, those efforts have produced little by way of results.Although the JV may work (all parties play nicely, products actually ship), using history as a guide indicates that this is a risky proposition for the company. Not surprisingly, there may be a contingent in the market taking a ""show me"" approach to the venture, choosing to wait on the sidelines to see how it goes.Disclosure: None."
2773265,71845,2014-12-22T14:00:36-05:00,Recent reports from a US-based security firm claim to have found serious malware in Coolpad Phones.Qihoo has built a reputation on security; did it trust the wrong partner?What does that mean to the recently announced JV?,"A few US tech blogs recently ran stories (one source here) about an alleged vulnerability discovered in some Coolpad smartphones, something that surprisingly seems to have gone mostly unnoticed by media outlets in the US. The company, which earlier published details on the security threat, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), first found out about the problem by monitoring complaints from Coolpad users in China. And it doesn't seem to be a case of a US security firm trying to prey upon users' fears to sell software: a few Chinese websites have also run stories on the alleged problem with the software on some Coolpad phones.For those not technically savvy, the vulnerability is a backdoor - software which allows for control of the device without asking any permission first. According to information that Palo Alto Networks provided online, the backdoor (nicknamed CoolReaper) can just about completely control the phone. Specifically, CoolReaper can enable remote download and installation of software, uninstall software, delete user data and send detailed phone usage information to remote locations, among other tasks. Most, actually all, of these are big no-no's without user permission.If these allegations are true, it could be a huge problem for Qihoo 360's (NYSE:QIHU) new joint venture with Coolpad. Qihoo has developed its reputation in China primarily as a security software company. Its advertising business was built around giving away desktop antivirus software, gaining users' trust to install its browser and use its landing page. It's the same brand that has helped the company make so much progress in mobile; it regularly boasts how many millions of smartphone users are using its 360 Mobile Safe - a security product for mobile devices. The trust in the brand image has arguably been the lynchpin of much of the company's development.And if it turns out that Qihoo 360 partnered with a company that has intentionally inserted a significant security vulnerability into its smartphones, that brand image could sustain some serious damage.Thus far, it seems like Coolpad isn't doing much talking, surprising since the CoolReaper news first broke in late November. There hasn't been an official release to address the issue, also surprising due to the gravity of the allegations. Maybe they hoped it would go away? Or perhaps they'll use CoolReaper itself to install a patch, quietly hoping nobody notices? Or maybe it's billed as a ""feature"" for providing remote updates and maintenance of phones?For Qihoo investors, however, this should raise a few important questions, most significantly being how this could impact the brand in China and how much pre-deal vetting really went on before the company made such a significant commitment.Regarding the brand, it wouldn't take much for a competitor like Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) or Kingsoft-backed Cheetah Mobile (NYSE:CMCM) to have a field day with this. Qihoo 360 hasn't exactly been a stranger to courtrooms (versus names like Baidu, Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), and Kingsoft), which could make the opportunity for some payback all the more appealing for competitors who have locked horns with the company in the past.Based on the presumption that Qihoo 360 is an expert in the arena of mobile security, some investors might be wondering just how much vetting went on before the company jumped into the JV with Coolpad. The company has taken a clear risk with its reputation, and its cash, in tying up with Coolpad. If it turns out that Palo Alto Networks' accusations are true, it could suggest a very sloppy process driving the deal, and should raise question marks for management's deal-making chops going forward.Qihoo has aspirations to become a bigger player in China's mobile internet landscape, including creating a comprehensive ecosystem to attract and retain users of its software and services. As several globally recognized firms have been recently discovering, an ecosystem containing customers' personal data is only as safe as the weakest link in the fence. Although recent allegations leveled at new JV partner Coolpad may not derail that dream, it may force the company to be a lot more careful, and choosy, in the future when trying to realize those goals."
2931066,24663,2015-02-19T10:39:41-05:00,"QIHU fell on a downgrade from Jefferies.Jefferies noted weakness in mobile gaming as the culprit for the downgrade.However, neither gaming nor security will drive QIHU's stock long term.The real catalyst suggests deep value in the stock.","Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) shares made a fast descent toward 52-week lows on Thursday after Jefferies downgraded the stock to ""Hold"" with a $67 price target. The problem with Jefferies' downgrade is in fact the reasons for the downgrade itself. Judging by Qihoo 360's 44% stock loss over the last 12 months, it appears that just about everyone on Wall Street has forgotten where the real value in this company lies.The fact that Qihoo 360's stock dropped sharply on the notion that the online and mobile gaming industry is becoming a tougher business environment in China is just laughable. Yes, Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) is the quintessential king of mobile gaming, and yes, almost half of Qihoo 360's revenue comes from its value-added service, most of which is gaming related, but this is a business that's barely significant relative to the long-term potential in another of Qihoo 360's businesses.Albeit, that promising business is not security. Qihoo 360's gaming revenue and other revenue rely heavily on the traffic it creates from PC and mobile security products. The company's PC products had nearly 500 million monthly active users at the end of the third quarter, and its popular mobile app, Mobile Safe, had a whopping 670 million users. However, despite having these enormous user bases and an incredible presence on mobile devices that mirrors the likes of WhatsApp, Qihoo 360's big value opportunity is yet to be discussed.That value opportunity is in PC and mobile search. Just like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has created a $50 billion a year advertising empire through its search business, and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) a near $8 billion advertising business through its own search business, Qihoo 360 has a growing share of China's search market that is yet to be monetized on a large scale. In just a couple short years, Qihoo 360 launched a PC search platform that now controls over 30% of China's Internet market, up from 16% year over year. Last year, Qihoo 360 entered the mobile search business and now controls 10% of that market, and according to the company's President, Qihoo 360 will have a market share of 30% in two years. Granted, a big reason that Qihoo 360 has been able to grow its share of the search business is because of its large presence in security and other businesses with high traffic. Regardless, Qihoo 360 is now positioned to become an advertising powerhouse in China.That said, Baidu has been the company to suffer the most from Qihoo 360's rise, as there is a very clear connection between Qihoo 360's rise in search and Baidu's decline. At Baidu's peak, it controlled over 80% of the PC search market, but that share has fallen below 55%. Granted, Baidu saw the shift to mobile search in advance and quickly grabbed a dominant share in that business as well. However, just like PC search, Qihoo 360 is quickly climbing the ranks of mobile search, and just like last time, it will certainly pinch Baidu's mobile grasp long term.Despite Baidu losing market share in Internet search, it still grew revenue 53.6% in 2014 as mobile revenue grew to 42% of its total, up from the mid-20% range in 2013. Furthermore, Baidu is expected to grow revenue 39% this year and another 32% in 2016 until its revenue surpasses $14 billion. The reason is because Baidu controls well over 80% of China's search market share by revenue, meaning it has effective advertising products.Meanwhile, Qihoo 360 has just begun to monetize its market share with a search advertising platform it launched in the third quarter of 2014. In the fourth quarter, which was Qihoo's first full three-month period with this platform in place, Citigroup estimates that it earned $62 million from PC search revenue alone. However, if Baidu's revenue is any indication of the opportunity in PC and mobile search, Qihoo 360's search revenue is going to grow quickly and become very large.All things considered, Jefferies' downgrade of Qihoo 360 and the stock's reaction really are baffling. Not because of the price target, but rather the fact that investors and analysts are placing so much emphasis on the company's gaming business. In retrospect, advertising and search are the future of Qihoo 360. As a result, much like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) paid over $20 billion for a low revenue generating mobile app with over 500 million users, Qihoo 360 should not be looked at based on current or trailing operating performance, but rather the potential that its market share in search could create.The same theories apply to stocks like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) whose current operating performance could never validate their market capitalization. Still, for such companies, investors are willing to pay large multiples to have a piece of what they may ultimately become. The same should apply to Qihoo 360. Based on the fact that it owns half the market share of Baidu, theoretically it should be able to create half of Baidu's revenue with more effective advertising products. Therefore, with a market capitalization under $7 billion, Qihoo 360 should be viewed as one of the better investment values in the technology sector, not as a stock that drops considerably on gaming-related fears."
2771115,74295,2014-12-21T15:05:57-05:00,"Qihoo announced a joint venture with Chinese original equipment manufacturer Coolpad.All phones produced by the JV will have Qihoo's software pre-installed.This partnership should help Qihoo expand into mobile search, an area that has been a point of emphasis for the company.","This past week, Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) announced that it has entered into a joint venture with Coolpad, a Chinese original equipment manufacturer of Android phones. QIHU agreed to invest $409 million into the JV, good for a 45% stake, which will sell phones pre-installed with QIHU's lineup of mobile applications. The deal is advantageous for QIHU, which has struggled to find a foothold in mobile where its biggest competitor Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) owns 80% market share. The JV should help QIHU take at least some market share away from BIDU because Coolpad is one of the top Android manufacturers in China and estimated to grow substantially.How The JV Helps QIHUQIHU has enjoyed high user penetrations for its security products on desktop and mobile, however the search market, which is much more profitable, has eluded the company. Market share for web search is coming along as the company reported market share of 30% during its Q2 earnings report. While the company has definitely made progress expanding its reach in the desktop search market, mobile search is another story.Mobile search is currently dominated by BIDU, which invested heavily to get Chinese OEMs to pre-install its mobile apps. The company has seen revenue skyrocket as its investment in mobile pays dividends. QIHU currently expects to have 10% market share in mobile search by the end of 2014, which is pitiful compared to BIDU's 80%. QIHU hopes to increase this to 30% in the next two years.This a very ambitious goal and it remains to be seen whether it is attainable. What we do know is that the company is prepared to invest in this goal, as this JV demonstrates. As part of the JV, Coolpad's entire product line will be shipped with QIHU's mobile app package pre-installed, which will be a huge boost for the company's mobile market share considering Coolpad is currently the #3 smartphone vendor in China. Coolpad also expects to sell 20 million smartphones this year with the help of its online store, which would put it ahead of Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) as the country's number two smartphone vendor. Sales of Coolpad smartphones are expected to increase 50% year-over-year to 60 million units.Another Important Point To NoteAfter the announcement of this JV, QIHU barely budged, which is strange because mobile search has been an area where investors have placed a great deal of importance. The JV demonstrates that QIHU is taking steps to grow its share of the mobile search market, so it is noteworthy that the stock still trades near 52-week lows.Regardless of the market's reaction (or lack thereof) to this move, the company represents an obvious buying opportunity. Even before the announcement of this JV, QIHU was undervalued as its share of web search is increasing, its revenue is growing at a breakneck pace and the stock is down almost 53% from its 52-week high. The company currently trades at 17.1 times forward 2015 P/E, making it extremely undervalued in the Chinese internet space. The JV with Coolpad is just more reinforcement that QIHU will outperform in the future and that the stock is undervalued.ConclusionThe JV with Coolpad will help QIHU expand its market share in mobile search and will allow the company to stay competitive with BIDU in the space even though BIDU has four-fifths of the total market share for mobile search. But that just leaves a lot of market share to gain for QIHU and this JV should help the company do just that. Additionally, QIHU is very undervalued and buying in now near the stock's 52-week lows could yield big gains if QIHU rebounds in 2015, which I believe it will."
2762025,71845,2014-12-17T07:52:16-05:00,"Qihoo paying $410MM for 45% stake, focus on software and marketing.After earlier attempts testing the hardware waters, the company is diving in.Given challenges facing the company, is this a good idea, now?","Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU, profile) recently announced that it was tying up with domestic manufacturer Coolpad (""酷派"" in Chinese) to focus on mobile devices that will be sold primarily online. According to the release, Qihoo is going to invest about 410 million USD in the venture in exchange for a 45% minority stake.The arrangement seems to draw on both companies' strengths. Coolpad will handle the hardware side of the equation (design and manufacturing), while Qihoo will focus more on software and marketing. The deal could help Qihoo further its goals to increase its mobile footprint, fending off other rivals, while for Coolpad the obvious benefit is sales growth. The news release also hinted at a mobile ""ecosystem"", referring to the integration of hardware, software, and applications. Creating such an environment could either be a smart play to create and capture an audience [Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iTunes comes to mind], but if not done right could backfire, sending users fleeing to more open and user-friendly platforms (Blackberry is an example of a closed ecosystem not working out).Who is Coolpad?In Qihoo's release, it noted that JV partner Coolpad was ""a leading smartphone company in China"", however for most foreign investors, it probably isn't one of the few brands that they've heard of [Huawei, ZTE (OTCPK:ZTCOY), Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY) and Xiaomi, among others]. Based on some quick searching on JD.com, the majority of Coolpad's handsets seemed to be priced toward the budget-conscious consumer (53 out of 100 shown were under $100 equivalent). The Coolpad phones that the JV will market are the Dazen brand, which appear to be a relatively new entrant to the market.Coolpad isn't a newcomer however, and has already achieved a degree of success in selling Android-based phones in China. Data from C-net affiliated size zol.com.cn showed that Coolpad held a decent chunk of China's Android smartphone market, about 6.5%, in August 2014, larger stake than recent upstart Xiaomi. The company's total 2013 revenues were about 2.5 billion USD in 2013, vs. Xiaomi's approximate 5 billion USD total for the year.Hardware? Again?Qihoo's stock reacted negatively on the day of the news release, closing nearly 7% lower on above-average volume. The timing of the release coincided with macro data indicating contraction in China's manufacturing sector, which could have piled on additional selling pressure. But another reason to the rout could be memories of the company's earlier failed attempt at launching a smartphone (it was in 2012, with Huawai). CEO Zhou Hongyi said he would make a comeback following the debacle, and this appears to be it.So is this a good move for Qihoo, and more importantly its shareholders?Qihoo's core expertise originally was in software (namely antivirus), however it into branched out into desktop search, claiming 30% of China's PC search share in August 2014, and has also been pushing into mobile. Historically, the company has been strong in mobile, touting the massive install base of its flagship smartphone antivirus app. Qihoo began monetizing its user base mainly through game platform operations in early FY2013, which became a major driver for the company's results. Based on comments in FY2014 conference calls, investors can expect to see results from mobile search monetization sometime in FY2015.But this move has the faint scent of desperation. Mobile user growth seems to have plateaued recently (Q3 mobile safe users grew +65% YoY in Q3, down from over 90% in Q1-Q2, and was just +5% QoQ vs. double-digit growth in Q1-Q2).Is investing in a hardware manufacturer the best way for the company to acquire new users? Perhaps not, and could be a bit dangerous when basically setting sights on Xiaomi. Developing and marketing smartphones is Xiaomi's only business, and it has quickly become a force to be reckoned with, taking share from the likes of Samsung and Apple in the process. Although locking horns with a rising power may be admirable, for a first salvo into the market it may be too bold. The JV's goal, after all, is to create a comprehensive ecosystem between hardware, software, and applications, something which doesn't sound like an easy task.Heroics of challenging Xiaomi aside, it seems that the goal here for Qihoo may be less to bring a copycat business model into Xiaomi's back yard, but more about developing expertise on hardware design and production for future adventures.A JV doesn't seem like the best way to achieve that, particularly when considering the reputation that CEO Zhou Hongyi seems to have earned in China's tech space (spoiler: his leadership style may be more curt than some employees prefer). If things don't go absolutely smoothly between the JV partners, it could lead to a messy break-up, and investors may have little appetite for the drama. An outright acquisition could skirt all this, but it would also come with a significantly different price tag.Qihoo has made several attempts at entering the hardware space before, at one point decrying the vested interests throwing up resistance to new ideas (source, Chinese). After seeing Xiaomi achieve a notable degree of success, it seems that CEO Zhou can't resist the siren song, and is headed back in.This new venture is likely to further pressure margins while developing, and because the success is uncertain, pressure may persist on the stock until there is a degree of clarity on the outcome. Earlier attempts to develop hardware haven't really panned out, and until progress is shown to be otherwise, skepticism is warranted. Unless, of course, this time it's different."
2777995,67313,2014-12-25T02:33:04-05:00,QIHU has introduced a VoIP app that allows only one user have the app to make the phone call.Chinese telcos will see ongoing voice/text revenue erosion from entries by Chinese internet companies.Long QIHU and short CHL.,"EventAccording to Sina Tech, Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) has introduced an VoIP app to further expand QIHU's mobile presence and ecosystem offering. Unlike the VoIP feature inside Tencent's (OTCPK:TCEHY) QQ and WeChat, or Skype, in which both users are required to install the designated app to call each other, QIHU's VoIP app only requires one user to have the app installed, meaning that the user with QIHU VoIP app can call another user that does not have the app. This is similar to the Chubao mobile app, which already has over 200m users around the world making free VoIP calls.In the wake of its partnership with Coolpad, I expect QIHU to aggressively push this feature as part of its ecosystem expansion. Over time this will be a negative to the Chinese telcos as internet companies increasingly pressure their voice and text revenue. As such, I believe that it is inevitable the Chinese telcos will follow the North American telcos in introducing data only and unlimited talk plans amid the commoditization of voice services. I reiterate my bullish view on QIHU and negative view on the Chinese telcos: China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) and China Telecom (NYSE:CHA).HighlightsPutting the pieces together. QIHU's entry into VoIP is a good strategy in that it differentiates from the competing VoIP players in China, namely Tencent's QQ and WeChat app, both of which operate under a closed ecosystem where the dialer and the receiver are required to use the app to make a connection. QIHU differentiates itself in that only one side is required to use the app to call, and the other party can still receive the call. This model is similar to that of the Chubao app which not only allows users to call VoIP free of charge but also incorporate mobile services and directories into the app. While QIHU's app can only make VoIP calls at this time, I expect updated versions to include directory services.Negative for the telcos. Chinese telcos' voice and text revenue are at risk from the emergence of messenger apps, and the adoption of 4G connections is ironically accelerating this trend as a faster connection is improving VoIP quality and reliability. In short, Chinese telcos will see continued voice/text revenue erosion and following the North American model of charging only for data while offering unlimited voice/text is likely to be the future trend.ConclusionLong QIHU. Short CHL given it is the most mature of the three Chinese telcos.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Shenzhen-based Coolpad saw shares halted pending news release.The acquisition of Coolpad immediately gives QIHU an asset with solid distribution, brand and competitive hardware.QIHU seems to remain focused on building its own ecosystem, more so than BABA, BIDU and 700HK.","EventTechweb reported that Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) is likely to acquire a Shenzhen-based smartphone maker and has allocated Rmb5b, or $800m, to pursue this acquisition. In conjecture with this speculation, Coolpad (OTC:CHWTY), which is based in Shenzhen, has halted trading on the Hong Kong Stock exchange pending a news release.ImplicationWith a market cap of close to $1b, Coolpad is within the target acquisition range, and I expect this rumor to have some credibility. For QIHU, the company needs to drive its mobile software usage higher amid a maturing market and user base. After witnessing Xiaomi's success of integrating both the software and the hardware to create a competitive ecosystem in China's smartphone space, I suspect that QIHU may be looking to mimic Xiaomi's strategy.The issue for QIHU is that it would be too late to create its own branded handset because the market is already crowded with the Chinese big four, consisting of Lenovo, Coolpad, Huawei and ZTE. Branding and promotion would further erode QIHU's margins, and there is no guarantee that the handset could be a success. Note that QIHU previously ventured into the mobile OS space with its own customized Android fork and mobile apps by partnering with subscale handset manufacturers that ultimately gained little traction. As such, one way to maintain its current growth profile is to vertically integrate the supply chain by acquiring a handset maker that has 1) strong brand value, 2) expansive distribution base and 3) competitive products that can ensure the broader adoption of QIHU's mobile software.Coolpad fits the bill as one of the Chinese big four handsets that have strong brands among low-income consumers and a superior relationship with China Mobile (NYSE:CHL), China Unicom (NYSE:CHU) and China Telecom (NYSE:CHA). More importantly, Coolpad has been climbing the ranks with decent handsets that are competitive against its comps and emerging branded players including Xiaomi, OPPO, BBK and Meizu. I note that Coolpad's F1 Dashen handset costs Rmb888, or ~$144, and features a 5"" 720p display, 8-core 1.7GHz processor 13MP/5MP rear/front camera and 2GB of RAM, being the more affordable octa-core smartphone on the market.Acquiring Coolpad could immediately allow QIHU to become a relevant player in China's smartphone market, and integration with Coolpad's hardware could eventually result in QIHU creating its own ecosystem of mobile search, app distribution, software and potentially O2O and LBS services. This will likely make QIHU competitive against Xiaomi and give them an edge over the incumbent internet players such as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) which is still in the process of trying to figure out how to integrate the Aliyun OS, and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) which seems to be lacking focus with its recent investments in Brazil and Uber. Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), on the other hand, seems to be preoccupied with monetizing WeChat and pursuing investments in the Asian gaming space. QIHU seems to be the only internet company that is focused on building its core competencies and drawing the pieces to create its own ecosystem.ConclusionM&A remains a compelling call option for QIHU. I reiterate my buy recommendation."
2730585,71845,2014-12-04T09:40:27-05:00,,"Qihoo 360 Technology (NYSE:QIHU) doubled revenues YoY and delivered EPS of 0.44 USD per ADS (non-GAAP 0.63 USD EPADS), beating the consensus estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Although gross margins continued to weaken, operating leverage pushed up both operating and net profit margins higher QoQ.Along with solid financial results, operating metrics showed forward momentum, but also included some signs of slower growth. The number of unique visitors to the company's Start-up page reached 129 million in Q3, up +2% YoY vs. nearly a +20% pace in the first half of the year. Daily clicks on the Start-up page showed a similar change. The company has been following the overriding consumer trend toward mobile, which could account for not only lower stats, but also a dwindling importance of desktop metrics to the bottom line. The total number of users for Qihoo's main mobile security product, 360 Mobile Safe, reached 673 million in Q3, +65% YoY, notable progress vs. under 150 million in late FY2012.Management's Q4 outlook was for revenues of 412.5 million USD (above the consensus 405 million USD revenue estimate), a slower pace (+86% YoY) than the triple-digit rate seen in Q1-Q3. Qihoo began stepping up monetization in late FY2013, affecting the comparability of earlier periods' annual growth rates.The company generated about 91 million USD of operating cash flow in Q3, up from 58 million USD last quarter and 75 million USD a year ago. Higher share-based compensation and depreciation expenses, both non-cash items, were the main reason for higher operating cash flow vs. earlier periods.The quarter-end balance sheet included approximately 1.7 billion USD of highly liquid current assets (mainly cash and cash equivalents), up from about 800 million USD last quarter 1 billion USD in Q3 last year. Qihoo issued a convertible bond in Q3, raising about 1 billion USD net of issuance costs, which contributed to the company's cash reserves.OutlookThe company's Q4 FY2014 outlook included the following:The apparent slowdown in the pace of annual growth may have to do with earlier periods not being fully comparable. Qihoo started aggressively monetizing its search business and increased the monetization of some of its Internet properties in late FY2013, so the quarters since weren't directly comparable YoY (before the monetization efforts kicked in).When discussing the near-term outlook on the Q3 call, it seemed clear that there would be increased effort on developing more strength in mobile as opposed to a continued focus on PC search. As a result, there may be higher R&D as well as Selling and marketing expenses going forward as the company steps up acquisition efforts and invests more in its mobile offerings.The company's efforts to monetize mobile search seemed to be a long-fuse effort, with management suggesting no significant revenue contribution until mid-FY2015. Considering the lag between investment spending and seeing results, near-term margin pressure seems almost unavoidable.Operating MetricsKey Business Developments during Q3 FY2014Convertible - the company raised approximately 900 million USD through the issuance of convertible bonds in Q3, one group maturing in 2020 and one in 2021 (equal amounts of 450 million USD). The conversion prices were $125.33 per ADS for the converts maturing in 2020 and $120.77 for the bonds maturing in 2021. Interest rates on the bonds were 0.50% for the bonds maturing in 2020, and 1.75% for the bonds maturing in 2021.Monetization of mobile - management noted that mobile-related revenues had already reached the 20% mark (of the total) by Q3, however these revenues were primarily derived from Qihoo's app store. Although mobile search was already the majority of total search traffic, monetization has been slow to follow. On the Q3 call, the company suggested that monetization of mobile search could begin sometime over the next several months, suggesting sometime in FY2015.Financial PerformanceThird quarter revenue was pushed higher mainly due to the continued strength of the Internet Value Added Services (IVAS) segment, which saw revenues up +158% YoY (+18% QoQ), offsetting slower Online advertising revenue growth (+67% YoY vs. +89% YoY in Q2). The number of games on the company's platform grew nearly 90% QoQ, and the number of paying player accounts was also up during Q3, about 10%. Internet advertising revenue growth was higher mainly due to progress in search monetization during the quarter. Going forward, management expects continued progress in search, and expected to boost its value proposition with customers through integration of Media V technology for ad exchange and mobile monetization.Direct costs increased as a result of revenue mix changes as well as continued investment in search monetization efforts, which pushed costs higher. As a result of increased direct costs, gross margin fell to a multi-year low of 77%.Fixed expenses as a percentage of sales declined to 60% (vs. 66% last quarter and 59% a year ago). Both Selling and marketing as well as Product development spending were up in Q3, but the faster pace of revenue growth led to operating profit margin improvement vs. earlier quarters.Pretax margin was pushed higher due to some non-operating income (including the gain on sales of investments), which led to higher net income YoY and QoQ and an expanded net profit margin.Disclosure: None."
2715665,24663,2014-11-28T08:15:35-05:00,"Qihoo 360 trades at $75 a share, with a market capitalization of just $9 billion.WhatsApp was purchased for over $20 billion for its 600 million users; Qihoo's security user base is much larger.Baidu has a market capitalization over $85 billion, but Qihoo has consistently stolen market share and now has half Baidu's search share.Qihoo is now launching monetization tools for search, which should have a profound effect on the business.Given Qihoo's large user base in two different segments, combined with future monetization efforts, $75 is too cheap.","Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) reported third-quarter earnings on Monday night, and on Tuesday, the stock soared nearly 10% in response. While the company's revenue growth of 100% was clearly celebrated, investors are still missing the long-term opportunity that can be found in this stock. Even after Tuesday's gain, the stock is trading about 40% off its 52-week high. Nonetheless, Qihoo 360 continues to prove itself as a buy-and-hold investment, one that could ultimately exceed $200 a share.Qihoo's emerging search businessQihoo 360 is currently trading at $76 a share, and the reason I believe that $200 is a fair price target is simple: Its increased market share in search. That said, Qihoo 360 operates in two key segments. The first, its flagship service, is mobile and desktop security, in which Qihoo's products dominate the Chinese market, with near-100% market share. Its popular app, Mobile Safe, had over 670 million users at the end of the third quarter alone. Qihoo then receives fees for routing users to third-party sites, along with gaming; the majority of Qihoo's revenue derives from this business.However, Qihoo 360's growth driver lies in mobile and desktop search. In just a couple short years, Qihoo 360 has grown its desktop search market share north of 30%. After launching a mobile search service earlier this year, it has already earned a 10% market share. The company's president, Qi Xiangdong, believes it too can achieve a market share of 30% within the next two years.The result of Qihoo 360's growth in search has been lost share for China's current search market leader, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). During the last couple years, Baidu's desktop search market share has fallen from 80% to below 55%. Albeit, Baidu's revenue continues to grow, as China's internet market is growing fast, and like Google, it continues to profit from better monetization tools.The search vs. revenue disconnectAccording to iResearch, Baidu owns 81.7% of China's search engine market by revenue. Given its market share of search by use versus revenue, investors can see that Baidu's success is, in fact, a result of monetization efforts. Meanwhile, Qihoo 360's market share by revenue stood at just 2.6% in the second quarter, which represents a very large disconnect from its market share by use.However, if there's anything investors have learned over the last few years, watching the likes of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and even WhatsApp, it's that a large user base has high value. The reason is because revenue can always be created from a large user base (i.e. Facebook), as companies can often roll out monetization tools whenever they like.That said, Qihoo 360's search revenue is so insignificant that the company doesn't even report exact advertising dollars earned from the segment. After Qihoo's 360's second quarter, Citigroup estimated that PC search revenue accounted for 20% of the company's total, rising 52% quarter-over-quarter to $62 million. In the third quarter, Qihoo 360 finally launched a search advertising platform, but the company only said it's received ""very encouraging responses"" in regards to the platform. These things insinuate that Qihoo 360 is finally ready to monetize search, which should be a game changer for the stock.How's $200 figured?Albeit, this is where the real upside value lies in shares of Qihoo 360. The company's desktop search market share is roughly half of Baidu, and if Xiangdong's guidance is right, then Qihoo 360's mobile share should be about half of Baidu's in the next two years. As the company rolls out advertising products and monetizes its search business, Qihoo 360's search business has the potential to become half of Baidu.Currently, Baidu has a market capitalization of $86 billion. My $200 price target on Qihoo 360 would give it a market capitalization of slightly over $35 billion. Essentially, I think Qihoo 360 is worth 40% of Baidu, on market share alone. This leaves room to consider that Qihoo 360's monetization efforts might not be as efficient as Baidu, but it also completely discounts the value of Qihoo 360's existing security business, which is still growing fast, creating the company about $1 billion in revenue over the last 12 months.Worst-case scenarioWhile I think that Qihoo 360's search and security businesses combined make $35 billion a highly attainable market capitalization long-term, there are, of course, risks associated with the stock.For example, how will Qihoo 360 respond to the threat of new competition from the likes of Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY)? Currently, Qihoo 360 is spending rapidly, which has likely contributed largely to its market share gains. In the third quarter alone, sales and marketing costs increased a whopping 226% year-over-year, now accounting for roughly 1/4th of its revenue. Hence, how will Qihoo 360 perform once spending subsides?Finally, will Qihoo 360 effectively monetize search? Certainly, Qihoo 360 has market share, but rolling out advertisements is a risky endeavour, as it's impossible to know how users will react to the addition of ads on their screen. As for Baidu, it has already proven its success with ads, something Qihoo 360 must still accomplish.That said, all are valid questions, but have answers. As for competition, Qihoo 360 has already stolen market share from Baidu, who was even more dominant in China's search market than Google in the U.S., implying Qihoo can handle competition. In regards to costs and monetization, I think history must be used as a guide for the future.Many forget that Qihoo 360 originally started as a PC security company. It then expanded into mobile and browser security, PC search, and now mobile search. With each new market, Qihoo 360 has succeeded, thus suggesting that management is fully aware of the risks and how to navigate them in order to succeed.Something to think aboutAll things considered, $200 a share for Qihoo 360 might seem foolish right now. But don't forget, Facebook valued WhatsApp over $20 billion because of its 600 million users, not its $20 million in revenue. Qihoo 360's Mobile Safe app has over 600 million users, and its PC products have nearly 500 million users. That's two different segments, mobile and desktop security, combined for over one billion users, an asset that's very valuable for Qihoo 360 long-termTherefore, $200 a share might be undercutting the stock's potential when looking at all of the moving parts. Long-term, Qihoo 360 might spin off its search business, or it might even be acquired. Either way, the company is very undervalued, and has a golden opportunity for significant revenue growth in the years ahead, making $200 a share highly likely."
2714195,75515,2014-11-26T12:20:07-05:00,Qihoo has initiatives to guide higher on revenues and margins.Search revenue growth will accelerate next year.Extremely cheap valuation with approximately 18% of its market cap in cash and equivalents.,"Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) recently reported third quarter 2014 results, and I had a number of takeaways I thought would be interesting to highlight. In my previous article, I provided a fundamental analysis of Qihoo's margin pressures, and concluded that they would handily beat the Street's expectations. This is exactly what happened, with Qihoo beating on the top and bottom line and providing Q4 revenue guidance above analysts' expectations. The stock shot up 7.6% in response, and received a key analyst upgrade in the process. Now that the stock has moved up big, it's important to see whether the pieces are in place for the company to outperform going forward.Delving into the RevenuesFor 3Q 2014, Qihoo reported revenues of $376.4M, another triple-digit year-on-year (YoY) percentage increase, which I predicted in my previous article. Moreover, I believe we will see acceleration in Qihoo's revenue growth starting in the first quarter of 2015. Why do I feel that way when next quarter's $410M ~ $415M revenue guidance (which exceeds Street's expectations) only implies 85% ~ 87% YoY increase?Reading in between the lines, we see that Q3's online ad revenue increased 67.2% YoY ($201.9M versus $120.7M). In the past, their online ad revenue has increased over 100% YoY, but over the last three quarters that growth rate has shown a downtrend.On Qihoo's conference call, co-CFO Alex Yu states that the company has roughly 25% of their search coming from mobile by year end. This mobile search portion of the business has been growing steadily as a percentage of total search over the past several quarters.This is relevant because Qihoo is actually not monetizing mobile search yet. So, even though they have expenses tied to their mobile search ramp, they aren't booking any revenue for it. That's why as their mobile search traffic increases, we see a ""decline"" in search revenue growth.The reason why it should not be a concern is because Alex goes on to state that they are looking to begin monetizing mobile search in the next several months, after they increase their mobile search traffic share. This should begin near the end of Q4 / beginning of 2015 when they should have low double-digit mobile search share (Alex estimates 7% ~ 10% of mobile search share by end of year) along with more time with the MediaV integration. At that point they will begin having meaningful revenue contributions from mobile search. When that happens, we should see a big lift to revenues, re-acceleration of revenue growth, and much better profit margins as well (remember that they aren't offsetting the cost of goods and operating expenses relating to mobile search at this time).On the internet value-added service (IVAS) side, Qihoo has continued to show impressive growth in mobile gaming, which contributed to IVAS revenue growth of 157.7% YoY. This is especially meaningful and highlights Qihoo's execution in light of Tencent's (OTCPK:TCEHY) recent quarter, where the company showed a slowdown in their mobile game revenue.Furthermore, Alex continues to be very bullish on the gaming industry. In the Q&A portion of the conference call, he talks about the industry tripling in size over the next 12 months. That's an extremely big addressable market, and if Qihoo continues to execute well against that backdrop, then there's no reason why its IVAS revenue cannot continue to grow at a torrid pace.Another Look into MarginsQihoo's Q2 earnings were marred by their declining margins as they invested very heavily in their own growth. I made an argument for why margin decline will reverse starting Q3, particularly with the one-off spending and the MediaV integration.As we saw in the results, Qihoo's operating and net profit margins improved significantly from Q2 to Q3. And as we look out to Q4 and beyond, I believe the margins will continue to improve for a few reasons.First, the MediaV integration has only recently been completed. We already see the improvement in margins with the launch of two advertising platforms to help optimize search monetization and manage search ad inventories. As this integration gets underway, I fully expect its effectiveness to increase over time. This is extremely key because Qihoo has an incredibly huge under-monetized opportunity in its hands, as shown on the earnings call when Alex says ""...the issue we're facing today is not the lack of traffic…We have too much traffic, we're not doing a good job to monetize those traffic.""Second, Qihoo expects Q3 to represent the peak of pre-installation spending as greenfield smartphone users give way to replacement cycle users. Those are meaningful operating expenses that will decline starting next quarter.Third is the already aforementioned monetization of mobile search revenue, which should begin to offset the cost of goods and operating expenses related to mobile search development.When you factor in all the above, there are a lot of initiatives both new and in progress that will lead to continued margin expansion moving forward. And with the huge runway due to Qihoo's large search share and the overall growth in China's addressable market, I expect the company to close the gap with Baidu's (NASDAQ:BIDU) search margins next year.A Few Bearish ArgumentsThere are of course bearish arguments out there against the company as well. Obviously it's impossible to address all of them, but there are two that I'd like to quickly give my two cents on.Previously, I was critical of an article by Shuli Ren because it did not provide much analysis and relied on lukewarm analyst notes (despite their price targets being 30% - 50% above the stock price). Even with many analysts upgrading the stock to a buy or outperform, Shuli appears to be negative on the stock when she writes:I believe Shuli continues to miss the boat on this stock, as she had prior to the Q3 earnings report. The main knock on Qihoo in the second quarter was the margin pressure due to increased competition in security, search and the mobile app store. Qihoo of course has lower traffic share on mobile because its first goal was to gain a meaningful traffic share on the desktop market. Keep in mind Qihoo was initially a PC security software company, so for it to lay out a target of 25% PC search traffic share, and exceed it last quarter, is very impressive. Now it's turning its attention to gaining mobile market share, and there's been no reason to doubt Qihoo's ability to execute so far.With regard to the news that Alibaba reduced its revenue sharing collaboration with Qihoo, I believe it was actually addressed in the conference call when Alex highlights the impact of one large customer's change in spending priority, which I believe refers to Alibaba. The reason why I don't feel that it is an issue is because Qihoo has diversified to the point where no one customer accounts for 10% of its revenues. So even despite that headwind, Qihoo is still able to post a 100% increase in its revenues in its latest quarter.The Final VerdictBased on my analysis of Qihoo's Q3 results and conference call, I continue to remain bullish on this stock. Despite the Q4 revenue guidance exceeding Street expectations, I believe the CEO is under promising because of the pending monetization of mobile search, their improvement in profit margins, and their well-executed strategy in the mobile games industry.On the margin front, Qihoo has many levers it can pull, and a huge user pool that it is beginning to monetize more efficiently. We've started to see signs of that in Q3, and with more time for its MediaV integration and mobile monetization initiative, along with declining costs associated with pre-installations, we should see margins continue to improve each quarter sequentially.The company has the fundamentals in place for it to grow substantially for several years to come. On a valuation call, the company trades extremely cheap. The consensus EPS estimate for Q4 is $0.82. If we assume that Qihoo meets the EPS estimate (even though it usually exceeds it), then Qihoo's 2014 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be $2.49, giving it a 2014 forward P/E of 30.One thing that I think analysts are also not modeling is that Qihoo has about $1.68B in cash on its balance sheet. That's roughly 18% of its market cap in cash. Based on roughly 132 million ADRs (198M diluted shares x (2 ADR) / (3 shares)), Qihoo has roughly $12.73 of its stock value backed up by its own cash. Backing out the cash, Qihoo would trade at a forward P/E of 25. For a company with a strong balance sheet, low valuation and high growth rate, it's easy to see why Qihoo would buy back its own stock with a $200M repurchase agreement.While there are a lot of differing opinions about where the stock is going to be, I think it's more meaningful to look at the company's fundamentals. I was very bullish on Qihoo for this recent quarter, believing it will handily beat estimates. Based on everything I see, I think the stock will appreciate past $90.00, but it's good to take things quarter by quarter. As we get closer to Qihoo's Q4 earnings release, I'll update again with my own estimates compared to the analysts."
2709305,40031,2014-11-26T04:55:23-05:00,"Qihoo reported Q3 earnings and revenue ahead of views.Margins remain under pressure on higher spending and changing product mix.Management guided Q4 revenue above analyst consensus.Reiterating my bullish view on Qihoo, the stock is a bargain at a forward 2015 P/E of 17.","Qihoo 360 Technology (NYSE:QIHU) reported Q3 earnings and revenue above analyst estimates. Q3 revenue increased 100.3% Y/Y to $376.4 million, which was $11 million ahead of analyst consensus. Non-GAAP EPS was up 34% Y/Y to $0.63 and $0.02 ahead of views. Gross margin in the third quarter was 77.3%, down from 86.2% a year ago and from 79.1% in Q2. Higher search monetization costs and product mix changes are pressuring margins. Operating expenses once again rose above revenue growth due to a 226% increase in sales and marketing spending. Non-GAAP net margin in Q3 was 23.8%, down from 32.7% in Q3 2013, but up from 21.8% in Q2. Management guided Q4 revenue between $410 million and $415 million, which was above a consensus of $405.1 million.Total monthly active users of PC-based products and services rose from 465 million in September 2013 to 495 million in September 2014. Total smartphone users of Qihoo's primary mobile security products reached 673 million in September 2014, representing a significant increase from 408 million in September 2013. The 360 Mobile Assistant, the company's Android-based app store, continues to lead the market with the largest Android app distribution market share despite intense competition. The competition should be further intensified as Google might launch its Google Play app store in China.Management stated that Qihoo reached 30% of PC search traffic and that the company started to ""allocate significantly more resources to support product development and market penetration of its mobile search."" Search monetization is still in its early stages, and represents a substantial opportunity for Qihoo in the future.Qihoo's Q3 report is encouraging and further strengthens my bullish thesis (see my previous coverage here). I believe that Qihoo is a bargain at the current price, given the significant growth opportunities and the fact that it is trading at just 17x its 2015 EPS. This gives the company a 0.65 PEG ratio, and I believe that the potential upside is above 100% in the next two to three years. We should still see some margin pressure going forward as the company continues to ramp up spending to capture more search and mobile market share, but the sequential net margin improvement is encouraging. Competitive pressure remains the largest risk, but Qihoo has managed to grow its market share and revenues significantly despite the increasing competition, which bodes well for the company's growth going forward."
2705285,67313,2014-11-25T01:03:07-05:00,QIHU to report on Monday after market close.Mobile competition heating up on both the app store and search side.Corporate security is the long-term driver.,"EventQihoo (NYSE:QIHU) will report Q3 2014 result after market on Monday. Consensus expects EPS of $0.61 on revenue of $365m (+94% y/y). For those who want to dial into the call, details are +1 866-519-4004 for the US callers, +65 6723 9381 for international and +852-3018-6771 for HK investors. The conference ID is 33982392. Heading into the quarter, I will be looking for any updates regarding the competitive landscape involving QIHU's app store as Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Xiaomi have ramped up on competing for quality third-party app developers. While Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has expressed its intention of getting back to China by opening up Google Play to the Chinese developers, I do not expect GOOG to be a relevant threat to QIHU given GOOG is not a widely used app store in China. Mobile search is another battlefront for QIHU as Tencent and BIDU begin to get aggressive on product ramp up. Finally, I will be looking for the progress involving its corporate information security products. In my view, QIHU's corporate security product could be a long-term driver as it penetrates the government and SOE customers.Focus listMobile competition heating up? The competition in mobile has been heating up with each heavyweight focusing on building its own ecosystem. I note that Baidu, Tencent and Xiaomi are trying to attract third-party developers to get the most compelling apps and aggressively building up mobile search to compete against QIHU. For example, Tencent's introduction of WeChat search could be a competitive threat to QIHU's mobile search ambition. Management has expressed the goal of expanding its search traffic to 25% of its total by the end of the year, and while it may seem aggressive, it is actually reachable if QIHU expands its presence in the corporate security market (see below).Corporate security the long-term driver. QIHU's CISP product could be a long-term driver as the market is expected to grow in the mid-teens to reach $3.3b by 2017, per IDC data. CISP services include firewall/VPN, software and consulting services, all of which QIHU specializes in. Within the CISP market, government and SOE account for 70% of the customer base and they are increasingly shifting their preference towards local vendors due to the heightening security concern of outsourcing such project to foreign entities. That said, this market presents the more favorable opportunity for QIHU given its expertise in mobile and PC security.ConclusionI am a buyer of QIHU ahead of results.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

A leading Internet company in China focused on mobile games and search saw substantial growth, but the company faces significantly higher expenses in a push towards search growth and a further expansion into mobile search. The stock is down significantly following the peak over $120 back in March as the market realizes that the company must spend significantly more to compete with the Internet giants in China and the shift to mobile search.For Q314, Qihoo reported revenue surged 100% to $376.4 million. EPS grew 34% to $0.63, up from $0.47 in the same period last year. Earnings exceeded analyst estimates of $0.61, but the numbers were lower than the expectations 90 days ago that projected EPS of $0.67. The company still reported impressive net margins of 23.8%, though down from the fantastic 32.7% earned during Q313. The substantial revenue growth was driven more by the strong ramp in mobile games with the Internet value-added service revenues growing 157.7% over last year. The online advertising segment that includes search revenues only grew revenue by 67.2%. In total, the Internet value-added service revenues of $172.8 million are approaching the size of the online advertising bucket at $201.9 million. Qihoo forecast Q4 revenue in a range of $410 million to $415 million, representing an increase of up to 87% YoY. The forecasted numbers exceed the analyst estimates for only $405 million.The original investment thesis in the article ""Qihoo: Is Second Place In Search Enough For Higher Stock Prices?"" remains intact. The stock is more attractive following the solid Q3 numbers and the lower stock price. A big question remains on whether Qihoo can obtain the market share targets for mobile search recently targeted at 10%. After the 8% jump following the earnings beat, the stock trades at roughly 19x 2015 earnings, yet the failure to shift development resources to mobile search leaves Qihoo behind the curve on the future growth area. The stock is worth a shot at the current valuation at $75, but it faces tough competitors with larger budgets that could continue pressuring margins."

Negtaive implication for Baidu. Neutral on BABA and Tencent. Potential negative for Xiaomi.","EventIn-line with my prior expectation, Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) plans to invest $409m in cash to take a 45% stake in a JV with Coolpad (OTC:CHWTY). The JV will be focusing on distributing mobile handsets via online-only channels by leveraging Coolpad's experience in smartphone design, manufacturing and supply chain management, and QIHU's capability in mobile apps, online marketing and mobile services. The initial handset will be based on Coolpad Dashen-series, which sells the cheapest octa-core powered 4G handset in the market, and will be distributed via online-only channels.Positive implications for bothFaced with the increasing competitive pressure from Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) that are combining their own respective ecosystems and Xiaomi that is already finding success in the online-only distribution model, partnering with Coolpad is a bold move for QIHU to eventually create its own ecosystem. With a mobile search engine that is gaining a relevant foothold against Baidu, an app store that is competitive against BIDU's 91Wireless and Wandoujia, and the most widely installed mobile security software, the last piece of the puzzle for QIHU is to find a competent hardware partner to back its mobile OS and services.QIHU's prior entry into smartphones in 2012 was a failure despite the partnership with Huawei. The failure was a combination of poor execution on both the hardware and the software front. On the hardware, it is worth noting that the majority of Chinese smartphone OEMs back then were only making sub-par handsets that largely mimicked those of Korean and Japanese OEMs. Xiaomi was an exception with its mimicking of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which partially resulted in its earlier success. For companies such as Huawei, Coolpad and ZTE, most of the handsets were underwhelming compared with the foreign competitors in terms of both hardware and software. On the software side, QIHU's mobile OS was not compelling and offered little to differentiate itself from the competition like NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES), Renren (NYSE:RENN), BIDU and BABA. Two failures do not add up to one success and it was certainly the case with QIHU back then.However, that dynamic has largely changed over the past two years both in the hardware and software aspects. We see the emergence of the Big 4 offering compelling low-cost handsets that beat out the Korean OEMs and branded players such as OnePlus and Xiaomi seeking overseas growth. As for the software, QIHU has created a solid mobile OS and related services in search, security, app distribution and browsers that have become competitive against the larger players. With close to 700m smartphone users of QIHU's product, the time is right for QIHU to make an aggressive push to build out its ecosystem.ConclusionThis is a positive for QIHU in that the company has found a truly competent partner in building its ecosystem. BABA, BIDU and Tencent have yet to aggressively roll out their own hardware/software integration so QIHU has somewhat of a first-mover advantage. As for Coolpad, the company has carved out a niche with its low-cost 4G octa-core powered smartphone in the Dashen-series handset, which is starting to differentiate from the rest of the low-cost smartphones on the market. As for the other smartphone makers such as TCL Communications, Oppo, BBK, Meizu, Gionee and Tianyu, investors can expect similar JV/M&A activities in this space as the rest of the internet heavyweights start to pick their partners to fill in the hardware piece of the puzzle.Additional research:Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

2679155,40781,2014-11-14T14:13:13-05:00,Analysts' recent price cuts still offer investors with more than 50% in upside potential.Qihoo has met or exceeded analyst estimates for the last eight quarters and looks poised to keep that streak going.Why I'm a buyer before earnings are released next week.,"Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU), a leading Internet company in China, will report its third quarter 2014 financial results on Monday November 24, 2014, after the close of the U.S. markets.Following the results, a conference call will take place to discuss the financial results on Tuesday, November 25, 2014 (8:30 p.m. Beijing time on November 25, 2014).A live webcast of the conference call will be available on the investor relations section of Qihoo 360's website here.After beating analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines the last five quarters, will QIHU be able to beat expectations once again? Let's take a look at the numbers that Wall Street expects.Wall Street Expects:So how has the company performed with its earnings reports? The table below shows QIHU's top line numbers over the past five quarters.It's always nice to see the top line beat expectations, but another big part of the story that investors need to watch is what is taking place on the bottom line. A company can earn billions of dollars in revenues, but will continue to run into problems if it cannot find a way to turn profitable.Luckily for investors, QIHU has been able to turn profitable, thanks in part to strong growth in gaming, search and many more Internet value-added services. These are just some of the reasons why QIHU has beaten expectations on the bottom line the past four quarters.As you can see from the table above, QIHU has done a great job with growing revenues not only on the top line, but on the bottom line as well.What also is interesting to note is that QIHU went on a spending spree last quarter due to the World Cup. This is why the EPS surprise was smaller than it usually is. Management noted that those were just one-time costs and margins should look better this quarter as well.* Projected earnings compiled by analyst estimatesWhy are most analysts now fixed on margin concerns (as you will see in the paragraph below)? I find it funny that price targets have significantly lowered as well, even though EPS trends continue to be on the rise.AnalystsBefore QIHU even reports earnings next week, some analysts are already coming in with reduced price targets and expectations. Last month, Nomura Securities analyst Chao Wang and his team lowered their price target on QIHU from $113 to $101.Here is their reasoning;UBS analyst Erica Poon Werkun also downgraded QIHU's price target from $158 to $112. Here is Poon's reasoning;This year investors have been paying special attention to margins and less on revenue growth. Even though QIHU reported more than 110% top-line growth on top of crushing earnings last quarter, shares have fallen more than 30% due to margins looking soft.Instead of going into a detailed report about this, I will refer you to a great article posted by Investment Insight Advisor who talks specifically about QIHU's margins and why analysts are missing some key points.ConclusionTwo weeks ago, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) posted its first earnings report since going public and even though posted spectacular top-line numbers, came up a bit short in other areas. Profit margins dropped from 54.4 percent to 50.5 percent from the previous quarter, yet for some strange reason, investors looked past margin erosion as shares climbed more than 4% on the day.Analysts defended the Company saying that while profitability wasn't what was expected, it doesn't derail the long-term view they have on China's economy and Alibaba's business model.So why did I bring this up?Because shares of QIHU got spanked when investors looked past revenue growth and didn't look past lower margins. So why the double standard? I don't know but based on current valuation, QIHU has more than 50% in upside potential.Looking ahead to 2015, QIHU will be trading at just 17X forward earnings with a PEG of 0.65. Not only that, but revenue growth looks to grow by more than 50% next year.Adding it all up, QIHU is undervalued, especially when compared to other high flying Chinese companies. This of course presents investors with an attractive buying opportunity along with the company's $200M share buyback program that was announced last month.The bottom line: Based on my findings, I believe QIHU will provide investors with another earnings beat with revenues coming in between $372M-$378M on the top line. As for the bottom line, I expect EPS to come in 15%-20% higher than projections, as QIHU once again exceeds analyst expectations.Disclaimer: LinkStock Performance Tracker: Link"
2701675,74295,2014-11-21T07:16:49-05:00,"Qihoo stock closed Thursday at $67.60 a share, well below its 52 week high.I wrote a bullish article last month saying that the stock was a very good buy. The stock price was around $67 then as well.I still think the stock is very cheap and that buying now can lead to high returns in the future.","IntroductionQihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) stock closed at $67.60 this Thursday, about 45% off its 52 week high of $124.42 which it achieved back in the beginning of March. Before the stock dropped into the levels we are seeing now, it was trading in the upper 90s. Shares then fell off a cliff after the company released an earnings report that showed the company's margins contracting. The huge sell-off was completely unwarranted as the earnings report also showed that the fundamentals of the company were as strong as ever. I examined the Q2 2014 results in my previous article, which can be found here. This article will only summarize the important aspects of the earnings report, so if you would rather read an article more focused on the earnings report itself, you can read my previous one.QIHU data by YChartsWhy the Future is BrightThe stock price has been hitting a ceiling in the mid 70s this past month and every time the price climbs to this point it dives again. I think QIHU will break through this ceiling before the end of the year as the company's growth prospects for the future are too good to ignore. As I discussed in my previous article, QIHU is in a great position to benefit from China's technology boom as the company's software is ubiquitous in the country. The only obstacle the company has yet to overcome has been the monetization of its products. QIHU has obviously begun to do this because its revenue growth is exploding.QIHU has nearly doubled its revenue every year since 2011 and the company is on track to continue this massive growth for 2014. For full-year 2013, revenue came in at $671 million. Revenue through the first two quarters of 2014 has already been $583 million, indicating QIHU will most likely break $1 billion in revenue for the first time. Assuming a 10% growth rate in revenue for Q3 and Q4, which is conservative considering QIHU's quarterly annual growth rate has been closer to 20%, I estimate full-year revenue to come in at $1.32 billion. This would continue QIHU's streak of doubling its revenue every year.QIHU Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsBecause QIHU's user penetration in the PC and mobile market is more than 90%, this revenue growth can be coming from two places: 1) increased monetization of the company's popular PC and mobile products or 2) increased market share in the internet search space. I believe that both of those are contributing to QIHU's continued growth. In the Q2 report, CEO Mr. Hongyi Zhou had this to say about QIHU's search market share:There are two keys points to note in this statement. The first is that third-party data indicated that ""a few days"" before the August 24th report, QIHU claimed 30% of the PC search market in China. This is great news for the company as critics frequently question QIHU's ability to take market share from rival Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). This shows that the company is doing just that, and quicker than expected as the company had set the 30% market share goal for four months later than the goal was achieved. The second important thing to note is that the company expects to ""allocate significantly more resources to support product development."" With more market share comes more responsibility. To maintain the 30% market share the company now controls, more resources will have to be dedicated to developing new products and improving its current products. This will inevitably cut into margins, which can already be seen from the 22% operating margin for Q2 2014 while the company achieved a 36% margin in this quarter the year before.Therein lies the reason why the contracting margins do not matter. If the contraction was due to a smaller market, less market share, company mismanagement or uncompetitive products then it would be worrisome. But when margin contraction is due to the company trying to maintain market share that it fought very hard to gain, this is more a positive than a negative. As I mentioned in my previous article, management's focus on the long term prospects for the company is a much more beneficial strategy for the future than trying to keep margins up in the short term while losing market share to BIDU and other smaller companies, which are plentiful in the PC search and mobile space.QIHU releases Q3 results next week and there are a few things to look for in the report. The most important thing to look at will be an update on the company's market share in the PC search space. Some other important things to watch for are:Overall, I expect the earnings report to show more of the same. Revenue growth will probably be around 15-17%, margins might decrease a little and the company's user base and PC search share will probably achieve a modest growth rate. A particularly good report could shoot the stock price through the ceiling in the mid 70s. From there, momentum could bring the stock back up to its previous heights and beyond. Optimistic? Yes. But unrealistic? I don't believe so.ConclusionQIHU has been hovering in the mid 60s and low 70s for a month now after reporting Q2 results. Margin contractions are not a worrisome development in the short term and the report showed that the company's user growth and revenue both drastically increased in the quarter. When accounting for the company's future growth and the future growth of the Chinese PC and mobile markets (which I discussed in detail in my last article), QIHU is undervalued and shares present a very attractive buying opportunity."
2542075,74295,2014-10-06T05:27:59-04:00,"Since reporting Q2 results, shares of Qihoo 360 have lost almost 35% of their value.Were earnings really bad enough to justify this share price implosion?The future looks bright and investors should take advantage of the buying opportunity.","Some BackgroundSince reporting second quarter results on August 24th, shares in Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) have taken an absolute beating. Qihoo is a Chinese technology company whose major products deal with mobile phone security, web browsing and an app store for mobile devices. Since achieving a 52 week high of $124.42 in March, shares have lost almost 50% of their value to close at $67.20 today (Thursday). After reaching this 52 week high, the stock dropped into the high 70s before stabilizing and recovering. However, even though Qihoo reported second quarter beats on earnings and revenue, and guided Q3 revenues above consensus estimates, the stock price fell sharply. The drop was attributed to profit margins contracting from 36% in Q2 2013 to 22% in Q2 2014. While this may be a concern for investors in the short-term, the long term prospects of the company are still very bright indeed. The dip offers an opportunity for big gains.Some NumbersThese are some of the numbers Qihoo reported for Q2 2014 just to give an idea of how the company is doing:Source: Qihoo WebsiteSome InterpretationThe numbers that really matter here are the 1) 93.9% user penetration of Qihoo's PC products 2) the 90% increase in the number of smartphone users using Qihoo's mobile security product and 3) the 109.6% increase in Qihoo's revenue from Q2 of last year. While the other numbers are nice to gauge the companies current status, for long-term investors the three numbers I pointed out are the most important ones to consider.1) 93.9% of Chinese PC users utilize a product developed by Qihoo. This is a market of 568 million internet users, yet only 42% of the Chinese population has access to the internet. Internet use in China is growing quickly and this market will only expand. If Qihoo can effectively monetize its users through advertisements, the company stands to accelerate revenue growth and increase it's profit margins.2) The number of users utilizing Qihoo's mobile security product increased 90% to 641 million users. The same argument for PC user growth can be made for mobile users. As the Chinese population gains more access to the internet, Qihoo's mobile security product will gain more exposure.3) Revenue growth is always important. Qihoo is still a growth company, and if the company's revenue increased 109.6% from Q2 2013, then that shows that Qihoo's market is increasing too. The last step for Qihoo to really start accelerating profit margins and growth is to monetize its widely-used products through advertisements.The decrease in the company's profit margin isn't a good thing, but it does show that the company is content to allow near term profit to suffer in order to achieve long term stability. Profit margins are suffering because of increased spending on expanding the company's product penetration and monetizing these products.Monetizing SearchQihoo has been locked in a bitter battle with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) over market share in the Chinese internet space. Baidu is a web services provider whose web browser competes with Qihoo's search browser. While Qihoo has been snatching market share from Baidu recently, Qihoo's revenue is still derived almost entirely from the other segments of its business. This indicates a huge opportunity for Qihoo to boost revenue by monetizing its web browser. To put the opportunity in perspective, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) derived nearly $50 billion of revenue from advertisements in 2013. Qihoo's total revenue for 2013 was $671 million. While Google obviously has much higher site traffic than Qihoo, the model Google used to produce such massive revenue could be replicated, albeit on a smaller scale, by Qihoo. And Qihoo's presence in the Chinese mobile and internet space combined with China's projected growth in internet usage could mean big gains for Qihoo and investors if the company executes well.ConclusionThe sharp drop in Qihoo's share price looks like a very good buying opportunity because of the company's growth prospects in the future. While Qihoo's last close of $67.20 gives the company a somewhat lofty P/E ratio of 56.1, Qihoo's estimated full-year 2015 EPS is $3.96 which would give the company a much more manageable P/E ratio of 17, which is more in line with the industry average."

This external reason for the fall presents an investment opportunity.Qihoo’s management focuses on building its user base through free services, which can be monetized later. The potential for further monetization is much greater than its rivals.Search traffic market share is 30%, whilst market share in terms of revenues is just 2.9%.

This should reassure investors as the public spat has been a distraction for five years.Qihoo’s management sees great potential in the enterprise security industry, and will leverage their market leading status in personal security applications.","IntroductionQihoo (NYSE:QIHU) has seen a significant fall in equity value since the release of its second quarter earnings, from $102.76 to its current level of $69.36. Investors were disappointed at the falling margins that continued from the first quarter of the year, attributed to increased investment in mobile technology. I believe that the near 40% fall in equity is unjustified, particularly given that the increase in investment will likely reap rewards in upcoming quarters. This report discusses Qihoo's business model and the long run bullish investment case, ahead of the upcoming release of the firm's third quarter results on the 24th November, after the close of the US markets.Business ModelQihoo 360 is a software company known for its two key anti-virus software products, 360 Safe Guard and 360 Mobile Safe, and has since become well known for its search engine, as well as its 360 Browser web browser and its 360 Mobile Assistant application store. Zhou Hongyi and Qi Xiangdong, CEO and President, respectively, founded the firm in 2005.Qihoo's services are categorized into three layers. The Core Security Layer, the Access Layer, and the Service Layer.Core Security LayerAccess LayerService LayerDeriving Growth From Both PC And MobileQihoo continues to see user base growth for its 360 PC Browser, with 345m users at the end of the second quarter, compared to 330m a year ago. Yet this growth is slightly deceptive, because its user penetration declined to 65.2% from 69% a year ago, implying that China's PC Internet population is 529m compared to 479m a year ago. Whilst management discussed no further details, Qihoo is either failing to attract new users of the Internet, or it is failing to keep its current user base from the grasps of both domestic and overseas rivals. Average daily unique visitors to the 360 Personal Start Up Page and its sub-pages were 128m in Q2 compared to 114m a year ago, whilst average daily clicks on the 360 Personal Start Up Page and sub-pages were 749m in Q2 compared to 590m a year ago. Total monthly active users of Qihoo's PC-based products and services reached a record 496m compared to 461m a year ago, although again, this is deceptive because user penetration of PC products declined to 93.9% compared to 96% a year ago as China's Internet population grew.Despite seemingly disappointing growth figures from PC, mobile continues to attract users at a rapid rate. The 360 Mobile Assistant Android app store continues to be the clear market leader in app distribution, and is recognized as the 'go-to' place for third-party mobile game distribution. Monetization of the mobile app store made good progress in the second quarter due to advertising and mobile games, and this should be expected to continue in the second half of the year. Qihoo is seeing strong growth in its Mobile Safe application, with total smartphone users in the second quarter being 641m, compared to 338m a year ago. This demonstrates the firm's continually strengthened market leading position in the fast growing smartphone security market in China.The firm has no mobile search monetization, although this should change by early 2015. Most of the mobile search products were launched this year, so at the beginning of the year, mobile search traffic as part of its total traffic was around 5%. As of the end of the second quarter, that proportion was in the low-to-mid teens, and management has stated that it is aiming for 25% of traffic by the end of the year.The search engine was launched two years ago, and has gained notable traffic share. By the end of August, Qihoo had a search market share of over 30% in terms of search traffic share, and has already achieved internal year-end targets. However, when we look at market share in terms of revenue, Qihoo's share is just 2.9%. The firm has been very conservative in terms of monetizing PC search, because it has seen that when rivals have monetized too quickly, it can hurt user experience, and thus the user base decreases. Qihoo has increased monetization of PC search during the quarter with more targeted advertisements, and with the acquisition of MediaV, which I will discuss later on in the report, management projects that monetization will increase further without hurting user experience.Whilst the firm continues to target higher market share in PC search, management is making a strategic shift to focus their resources on mobile search, and have shifted a significant portion of their PC search team to mobile in terms of product development. They are also hiring external teams and talent to specifically target mobile search related products. Qihoo launched several mobile search related products in the second quarter in order to boost market share. During the quarter, Qihoo also made significant upgrades to the back-end system, which should boost search monetization. Management's long-term aim is for PC and mobile search to have equal market share. This is realistic because Baidu's (NASDAQ:BIDU) near 70% search traffic market share is simply unsurpassable, so Qihoo can actively compete with Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY)-backed Sogou for second place in the market.The fastest growing of all of China's Internet-related industries is the online game industry. China's online game revenues were 89.16bn RMB in 2013, increasing 32.9%. Qihoo is already a leading player in both web and mobile games, and despite seasonality in the mobile game market, mobile already accounted for over 20% of its business. At the end of June, Qihoo had approximately 1,200 games commercially running on its game platform, and the total number of paying games accounts was approximately 1m.In China, on PC, there are essentially two large user bases. One is Tencent and the other is Qihoo. Given that Tencent produce its own games, game developers find it hard to survive without such a large user base, which is why they can collaborate with Qihoo. In the second quarter, Qihoo formed a joint venture with The9 to jointly operate a MMO game called Firefall, and the firm will continue to collaborate with other developers in this manner. Whilst Tencent and Qihoo are the two biggest user bases in gaming, there is a distinct difference between the two. Tencent sees the vast majority of its gaming revenues from in-house games, and can hence control the development cycle so that the effect of seasonality is nullified. Qihoo, on the other hand, is a distribution platform and cannot mitigate the effects of seasonality, where the first and fourth quarters are the strongest, whilst the second and third quarters are relatively quiet in terms of game releases. Since the end of the first quarter, the entire mobile game industry hasn't really launched any big or blockbuster games, unlike in the first quarter or end of last year, where new titles would be released daily. Because Qihoo is a gaming platform, it's reliant on content, so in times when new games aren't being released, it doesn't get the steady increase in paying users. This will continue to some degree in the third quarter, because most of the new titles will be launched in the fourth quarter.Qihoo is moving towards two directions in the game industry. One is towards mobile games, whose user base is generally broad. The second direction is the hard-core gamer that uses PC web games. Qihoo is one of the leading distribution platforms in China, which serves the first category of gamers, but this market will soon meet maturity. However, the hard-core MMORPG PC games attract a very loyal and steady user base, whose players tend to be heavy spenders. Facebook's acquisition of Oculus VR is a sign of how this market will evolve, and Qihoo will be working with developers to cater for this future technology trend.China's Online Search IndustryRevenues from China's search engines are primarily derived from online advertising, and this has seen year-on-year revenue growth continue to increase. The boom in mobile search over the past two years has seen mobile advertising revenues become the key driver for search engine revenues, which has kept year-on-year revenue growth above 50% for each quarter in 2014. iResearch China is expecting that mobile search revenues will contribute 59.9% to search engine revenues. This forecast suggests that mobile search revenue will have increased 180.1% year on year, from when it contributed just 31.3% to total revenues.(Source: iResearch China Search Engine Views)Search engines aren't the only firms that are targeting mobile as their core strategy for the coming years, because mobile Internet revenue continues to grow at more than double the pace of PC Internet revenue. Industries such as online retailers and video streamers are all focusing their efforts and resources on developing a mobile platform that can cater for users' impulsiveness on the go.Revenues from mobile search are forecasted to grow exponentially over the next few years, which is why it is important for search engine firms to capitalize on this growth by monetizing their mobile search services. iResearch forecast that the annual growth rate for mobile search revenue will be between 85% and 92.3% between 2014 and 2016.Developing a mobile search engine isn't as simple as transferring the PC search service onto a smaller screen, because mobile search users have different requirements. Mobile search users tend to be on the go, and so the speed and convenience of the search engine is the most important feature, which will help to develop a more loyal user base than on PC.Whilst firms focus on developing their mobile search technology, I don't expect that mobile will replace PC search. Instead, I expect that mobile will complement PC, in the sense that mobile will be used to meet the instant search needs of users, whilst PC will be used to search for more static and complex topics. In addition, mobile is set for fast growth, but its sustainability as a core driver of revenues is unclear. The short term will see a rapid shift of advertisers from PC to mobile, but growth will quickly slow, and mobile is much more limited by screen size than PC. Therefore mobile advertisements would have to become much more targeted than on PC in order to maintain a steady revenue source.Recent DevelopmentsFall In Equity ValuationThe release of Qihoo's second quarter earnings in August coincided with a general fall in Chinese equity valuations, and was exacerbated by the announcement of failing margins. The falling equity prices for Chinese companies was almost certainly due to fund managers adjusting their Chinese exposure ahead of Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) record-breaking IPO. For most fund managers, their exposure to China will consist of a group of Chinese equities, whose weighting will be calculated as a function of market capitalization and some financial metric. Given that Alibaba's market capitalization currently stands at $275bn, it is the biggest listed Chinese firm, so fund managers will have had to have sold stakes in their other Chinese holdings in order to readjust their portfolio for the inclusion of Alibaba. I believe that this was the main cause of Qihoo's decline in equity valuation, and because it was an external reason rather than company specific, Qihoo remains undervalued at these levels. This 38.3% fall and subsequent 10.5% rally in Qihoo's equity valuation contributes to this investment thesis.(Source: Stockcharts.com)$200m Share Buyback PlanOn the 1st October, Qihoo announced that it would repurchase up to $200m of the firm's ADS, and this acted to halt the decline that Qihoo's share price had seen since August. Whilst no time frame was given to the share repurchase plan, the company would have no issue in terms of funding the scheme, given that it raised approximately a billion dollars in a convertible bond offering in August.The timing of the announcement can be taken two ways. Firstly, the company's share price had fallen from $101.75 to $63.89 by the time of the announcement, and management needed a way to halt the decline. By announcing the $200m share repurchase plan, the company publicly states its confidence in the company and the announcement acts as a floor for the share price. Alternatively, with Qihoo's shares trading at $63.89, share repurchases at this level would be in the best interests of the shareholders.Acquisition Of MediaVIn May, Qihoo acquired a 60% stake in digital advertising firm MediaV for over $100m to improve the efficiency of its online advertising business for both PC and mobile, as well as allowing the firm to expand its business offerings to advertisers. Qihoo only began monetizing its search business in January 2013, and through recent upgrades in the search monetization system, the firm has seen notable improvement in monetization efficiency. MediaV will be used to focus on three different aspects of advertising. Firstly, it will help to do a better job at matching user needs on the display ad side. These are the display ads on the start-up page, the app store, and other PC and mobile platforms. Secondly, MediaV is connected with Qihoo's search monetization system, which will enable Qihoo to offer more contextual ads. Thirdly, MediaV will offer Qihoo an ad exchange platform. The first two are the priority, and then the third will be implemented. The third quarter earnings report will give investors their first chance to see how MediaV has been integrated into the Qihoo search network, and whether or not improvements in search monetization can be seen.Tencent Antimonopoly Court CaseTencent and Qihoo are no strangers in the courtroom, as the past few years have seen a string of anti-trust disputes. The three-year long lawsuit was finally ended on October 16th 2014 when China's Supreme People's Court rejected an appeal from Qihoo that Tencent's control of the PC-based and mobile instant messaging service markets was a monopoly, given that its market share in both is greater than 80%. The original case began in October 2011, when Qihoo 360 sued Tencent for hindering market competition and abusing its market position. Tencent then counter-sued Qihoo for unfair competition in 2012 and won, and Qihoo's subsequent appeal was rejected in February 2014.A previous spat between the two firms in 2010 saw Qihoo accuse Tencent of invading the privacy of its users through an Internet security program that was bundled together within Tencent's QQ instant messenger download. Qihoo subsequently released its own security software, claiming that it would speed up QQ and offer better privacy. In November 2010, Tencent announced that it would shut down the QQ service on computers that had Qihoo's security software installed on them, and asked users to make a choice between Tencent and Qihoo. A day after the announcement, Tencent lost 3.1% of its market capitalization on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and a week later Qihoo announced that it would resume its products' compatibility with QQ.The end of the lawsuit will come as welcome news to investors of both firms, as the five-year long public spat has left a sour taste in the mouths of users, and has benefited rival firms. Likewise, whilst the compensation of 790,000 RMB that Qihoo has had to pay to Tencent isn't significant enough to alter the firm's plans, it's an expense that the firm doesn't need to incur.Association With The WireLurker Malware VirusIn November, Chinese police received a tip from Qihoo 360 about a malware virus that specifically targets iOS devices, and subsequently made three arrests. The malware family, called WireLurker, was being served by a third-party app store called Maiyadi (麦芽地), which has previously received investment from Qihoo. Since the arrests were made, Maiyadi was shut down as several sources were claiming that there was a direct link between the app store and the malware. Although the police only released the surnames of the three arrested individuals: Chen, Li and Wang, sources have claimed that two of the individuals could be the founders of Maiyadi, Chen Peng and Wang Jian, whilst the third individual is likely to be Li Fei, whose name appears in the Windows WireLurker code, and had a certificate from Apple used in the iOS version of the virus.The Free Giveaway Of The Qihoo 360 Smart ButtonCEO Hongyi Zhou has built Qihoo on the theory that a firm will always figure out monetization sooner or later so long as it has a large user base, and the best way to build a large user base is to give away quality products for free. This is why Qihoo provides its own anti-virus products free of charge, and has been seemingly slow to monetize its search services.Qihoo has developed its own Android button device, has merged this product with Quick Button, which it has reportedly invested in, and has given away around one million buttons to university students since the middle of August. Qihoo's Smart Button was previously priced at 3.6 RMB ($0.58), and given that Hongyi Zhou has stated that hardware should be priced at cost so that profits can come with the software, we can assume that Qihoo has essentially spent $580,000 to increase its user base by 1,000,000 users. This is because these university students would become familiar with Qihoo's services through the Smart Button.By pressing the button, users will gain access to the Qihoo platform, which will eventually see 100 apps, including the Chinese version of Evernote, Alibaba's Taobao, and Tencent-backed restaurant search app Dianping.(Source: Qihoo Smart Button)From A Valuation Perspective(Source: Qihoo 2014 Second Quarter Earnings Release)Qihoo's second quarter earnings exceeded both the company's own and analysts' expectations. Revenues saw year-on-year growth of 109.6% and quarter-on-quarter growth of 19.9% to $317.9m. This was driven by solid performance in both online advertising and Internet value added services (IVAS). Equally importantly for the stability of this growth is that no single customer contributed over 10% to total revenue during the quarter. Online advertising grew 89% year on year and 22.3% quarter on quarter to $171.3m, whilst IVAS grew 140% year on year and 17% quarter on quarter to $121.3m. IVAS revenue is predominantly derived from the PC and mobile game platform, and within this total IVAS revenue, game revenues contributed $121.3m, which represented year-on-year growth of 149% and quarter-on-quarter growth of 14%.The firm recorded cost of revenues of $66.6m, compared to $17.8m a year ago and $50.4m last quarter. This resulted in a gross margin of 79%, compared to 88% and 81% a year and quarter ago, respectively. The decline was mainly due to cost reallocation related to search monetization, as well as a change in revenue mix.Non-GAAP expenses were $208.3m, compared to $97.2m a year ago and $175.1m a quarter ago. Share compensation was $25.8m, compared to $18m a year ago and $20m last quarter. The increase was mainly due to acquisitions that have been made in recent quarters. Non-GAAP operating income was $69.7m, compared to $54.5m a year ago and $59.5m a quarter ago. This resulted in a non-GAAP operating margin of 21.9%, compared to 36% a year ago and 22.5% a quarter ago. The fall is attributed to increased marketing and promotional expense, personnel-related costs, and bandwidth and equipment depreciation expenses. Non-GAAP net income was $69.2m, compared to $51m a year ago and $73.3m a quarter ago, which resulted in a non-GAAP net margin of 28.8%, compared to 33.6% a year ago and 27.7% a quarter ago. GAAP net income was $39.1m, compared to $33m a year ago and $49.1m a quarter ago.The falling margins were cause for concern for analysts, but management attributed the declining margins to increased competition in the security and app store markets, both of which Qihoo is a leading player, and this has made it difficult for the firm to maintain and grow market share. Therefore, Qihoo has had to increase marketing expenditure in order to strengthen its product penetration and position within the market. It is important that this is done now because it's widely regarded that 2014 is the last year users of all ages will begin to adopt smartphones in rural areas, and from next year onwards, the only demographic without a smartphone will be children who are currently regarded as too young to own one. This means that Qihoo has been actively marketing its services to these new users of all ages who have yet to become used to a particular service in order to maintain its market leading position. In addition, in terms of costs and personnel, the firm is investing in testing new products, and whilst this isn't necessarily contributing anything meaningful to revenues at the moment, this testing, and hence this expenditure is necessary for the firm to find its next growth driver. Higher costs were also related to acquisitions that the firm made, as well as the increased spending around the World Cup advertising, which was a common theme across consumer industries in China.Looking AheadThird Quarter EarningsWith third quarter earnings to be released on 24th November after the close of the US markets, investors will be expecting to see an improvement in margins and a clearer outlook for 2015. During the second quarter conference call, management stated that guidance for the third quarter would be for revenues of between $306m and $365m, which would represent year-on-year growth of between 92% and 94%, and sequential growth of between 13% and 15%. This is less than recent sequential revenue growth, which has averaged around 20% over the past four earnings reports. Consensus analyst estimates currently stand at revenues of $365.65m, which would represent year-on-year growth of 94.6% and sequential growth of 15.0%, whilst consensus EPS is $0.61. In my view, this revenue growth would be similar to industry leader Baidu's recent sequential revenue growth, despite the fact that Qihoo is yet to fully monetize its services in the way that rival firms have. Therefore focusing on revenue and profit growth isn't as relevant as it would be with Qihoo's rivals, because the firm is focusing more on building its user base. With the introduction of the mobile search app, investors should be looking for strong growth in mobile users, as well as an improvement in PC user base growth relative to the growth of China's Internet population.Looking at Qihoo's earnings history, the average absolute one-day move is 5.11% whilst three day is 5.42%. However, looking at non-absolute averages, the one-day average is negligible, whilst the three-day average is -2.00%.(Source: Streetinsider.com)As of the time of writing, the at-the-money straddle with expiry on Friday 28th November is pricing a 7% move between Monday 24th and Friday 28th November. Given the earnings move history discussed above, the straddle looks a little rich, given that the last time Qihoo's share price moved 7% in the three days after an earnings release was after the 2012 fourth quarter earnings release.Margin ImprovementsInvestors were disappointed with the falling margins seen in the second quarter, but Qihoo expects this situation to improve over the coming quarters. The firm is already in the process of streamlining, and notable cost control should be evident by the fourth quarter earnings report. The second quarter saw increasing costs, but despite investors' disappointment, these were non-recurring costs, such as the acquisition of MediaV and increased advertising costs due to the Football World Cup. In addition, from an industry perspective, smartphone penetration is done, and will soon be getting into the replacement cycle. Qihoo has already achieved its management's target market position due to its increased spending in 2014, so as spending decreases as a result, 2015 should see significant margin improvement as the firm reaps the gains from the investment in 2014. A case in point is the acquisition of MediaV, which was valued at over $100m, which was more than the total operating expenses for the second quarter of 2013. Whilst this is a relatively large expense incurred by the firm, the acquisition of MediaV will help the firm to monetizeStrategic Investment OutlookThe cash and equivalents at the end of the second quarter stood at $786.8m. Adjusting for the $200m buyback plan and the $1bn raised in the convertible bond offering in August, we can surmise that cash and equivalents currently stands at approximately $1.5bn. The near-term investment policy will be focused on search and mobile monetization, as management sees these as the two most important growth drivers.The search advertisement sales network, including the direct sales force and agency networks, will continue to be developed, as will significant investment into its mobile and security brands, in order to expand its monetization network, and to support product and technological innovation. Management will also pay particular attention to the management of the company's rapid growth in order to maintain operational efficiency and the innovative corporate culture.As with all Chinese Internet firms, Qihoo is looking towards expanding its ecosystem of services, and will consider opportunities via strategic partnerships, investments, and M&A. During the past two years, China's technology industry has seen intense M&A activity, with Alibaba and Tencent predominantly driving this trend. This has made it difficult for firms outside of the BAT tech trio to compete in the M&A market, because they simply don't have the spending power that Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent have. This was alluded to by management in the second quarter conference call, stating that the war chest is more likely in the hundreds of millions rather than billions. This means that Qihoo has to be selective with its investments, and as such, management is looking at two investment directions. Firstly, Qihoo's management will consider any strategic asset that will improve the company in a certain way. Secondly, they will consider companies with innovative products and innovative teams, such as mobile tech start-ups.Investment In Carmel VenturesIsraeli venture capital firm Carmel Ventures closed its fourth round of funding at the end of October, worth a total of $194m, and two major Chinese technology firms provided investment: Qihoo and Baidu. Carmel Ventures is a venture capital firm that focuses on the technology start-up industry in Israel.From my perspective, this is an important move by Qihoo. Investment in the fund not only allows the firm to profit from the growing high technology start-up scene in Israel, but it also gives Qihoo exposure to new technologies. This is important, because in China's fiercely competitive technology industry, it's very difficult for firms like Qihoo to acquire or invest in new technology because they are priced out of the market by the three tech giants; Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent, collectively known as the BAT trio. Therefore by expanding their horizons, and gaining exposure to other sources of new technology, Qihoo has given itself an opportunity to compete with the BAT trio.Rivalry With Tencent-Backed SogouBaidu is the outright leader in China's search engine industry, and whilst its market share has fallen from a few years ago, it continues to hold a dominant share. Investors would be hoping that Qihoo will continue to eat away at Baidu's market share, but in the mean time, its biggest rival is tech giant Tencent, who has taken a strategic investment in Sohu's (NASDAQ:SOHU) Sogou search engine.Qihoo tried to partner with Sogou in 2013, but the Sohu subsidiary chose to work with Tencent instead, and Tencent has since merged Sogou with its own Soso search engine. Sogou has benefited greatly from its partnership with Tencent, particularly due to its integration into the QQ and WeChat platforms. The all important mobile search market has seen Tencent drive Sogou's traffic growth, especially through the QQ mobile browser.Whilst Sogou is able to leverage itself on Tencent's social platforms, much like JD.com has, I believe that Qihoo is more than capable of competing. Qihoo has a very large user base on both PC and mobile of its security services and other applications, and has created a very strong ecosystem. Qihoo's ethos of expanding its user base prior to monetization makes it stand out in the industry. Promotions such as the free Smart Button giveaway to over one million university students is a very effective way of attracting new users to the firm's ecosystem, and from there, Qihoo can begin to slowly monetize.Enterprise SecuritySince 2013, Qihoo has begun allocating resources to establish its enterprise security operations. Security software has been the core of the firm's success over several years, with its market-leading personal security products for both PC and mobile, but the biggest opportunity in China's security software market is enterprise security.Demand for enterprise security has been increasing due to the concerns over corporate espionage between China and the US during the past few years, as well as the leaked cables documenting the US spying on other governments. The Chinese government has introduced new regulations governing enterprise security in China, with the main purpose of making sure that Chinese firms don't use US enterprise security software. The new regulations state that firms must use one of five Chinese security firms.With Qihoo being one of these firms, there is great potential for Qihoo to become the market leader in China, given its brand reputation and market leader status in personal security. The firm intends to leverage this reputation through internal and external investments, and quickly introduce the next generation of enterprise security software into the market. Given the highly fragmented nature of the industry in China, Qihoo is looking at good teams and small operations that it can acquire through M&A and investment in order to quickly consolidate a leading position in the market. Qihoo stated in its second quarter earnings that it sees itself becoming the leader of this potentially multi-billion dollar market within the next few years.Qihoo already has a team in place and a product is in development, whose expected release is during the fourth quarter. Management has stated that Qihoo's enterprise security products would be similar to the current offerings of firms such as FireEye and Palo Alto.The Investment CaseThe 38.3% fall in equity valuation presents investors with an opportunity, because the primary reason for the decline was external. The vast majority of Chinese equities saw heavy declines in valuation between August and October as investors reallocated capital to Alibaba in order to readjust their China exposure.Qihoo has been investing in improving its revenue growth for 2015, and with the acquisition of MediaV, I expect to see search monetization improve notably over the next few years. The firm is noted for being very conservative regarding monetizing search, because management believes that it is more important to build a large and devoted user base, and from there, monetization methods can be figured out. This can be seen in the difference between the firm's search engine market share in terms of traffic and revenues. Qihoo sees 30% of the industry's traffic, yet only generates 2.9% of the industry's revenues. On first glance, this may seem like a structural problem with the firm, but management believes that monetizing should not be forced, in case it hurts user experience. Therefore, understanding the management's ethos demonstrates that there is a large potential for revenue growth as and when the firm increases monetization of search.Further demonstration of the management's ethos has been shown in the free giveaway of the Smart Button, which will attract new users to the firm's ecosystem. It must also be noted that the figure of one million devices already given away was correct as of September, so management may update this figure during the current conference call, as Qihoo's web site continues to offer free Smart Buttons.The $200m share buyback program reiterates management's belief in the Qihoo's future, and even at current levels, Qihoo remains cheap. Insider ownership stands at around 22%, which is rare for Chinese firms, and again reiterates confidence in the firm.Looking forward, the biggest opportunity for Qihoo is in enterprise security, and whilst other firms will compete in the market, Qihoo has the huge advantage of being the number one personal security firm in China. This reputation and current user base will be leveraged to help Qihoo take a dominant position in this new and promising market.Whilst I believe that earnings releases and associated conference calls for the third and fourth quarter of 2014 will continue to discuss the trade-off of lower margins in 2014 for stronger revenue growth in 2015 and beyond, investors should remain bullish about the firm going forward. The share repurchase program acts as strong support if the share price approaches $60 again, and with the promising outlook for the firm in terms of enterprise security and further monetization of search, Qihoo presents a long-term bullish opportunity for investors."
2708385,67313,2014-11-25T22:07:55-05:00,"Qihoo beat in Q3 on both revenue and EPS.Search may have decelerated sharply in the quarter, but IVAS more than offset the weakness.Operating metrics holding up. Search could see a recovery in Q4.","EventQihoo (NYSE:QIHU) reported Q3'14 results that handily beat consensus with revenue of $376 million (+100% y/y) and EPS of $0.63. Online ad sales of $202 million (+67% y/y) was driven mostly by mobile, although the sharp deceleration of the growth profile suggests that competition in mobile ads and search is heating up (see: ""Qihoo Q3 2014 Preview: Mobile Competition Heating Up""). However, IVAS revenue of $172.8 million (+158% y/y) held up, and that was largely responsible for the beat this quarter.Mobile games revenue was strong, which suggests QIHU's leadership in mobile apps and distribution is unlikely to be challenged anytime soon. Marketing expense was higher than expectations, indicating that QIHU is still focused on pre-installation of its software in new mobile handsets. I expect marketing expenses to continue, as Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Xiaomi have begun to get aggressive on enhancing their own ecosystems. I note that Xiaomi already is an emerging threat to QIHU in the mobile app distribution space, thanks to the proliferation of its low-cost smartphones. The company has been aggressive in sourcing music from Baidu and, soon, video from Baidu and Youku (NYSE:YOKU) to strengthen its ecosystem. BIDU, BABA and Tencent will also likely to step up marketing efforts as the hyper-growth phase of China's smartphone market starts to decelerate.QIHU's management provided guidance of $410-$415 million, above the $405 million consensus expectation, suggesting a recovery of mobile ad revenue and continued strength in IVAS. In short, I remain overweight on QIHU on the back of this result, and continue to favor QIHU over Cheetah Mobile (NYSE:CMCM) in China's mobile security software space. The preference toward home-grown mobile/PC security makes QIHU a beneficiary of this trend.HighlightsOperating metrics holding up. QIHU's topline growth remains robust, with the exception of decelerating ad growth. However, I am encouraged at the fact that operating metrics continue to trend positive. Total PC-based MAU increased to 495 million (+6.4% y/y). Mobile security users, at 673 million (+65% y/y), continue to highlight QIHU's dominance in China's mobile security space, despite rising competition from CMCM and other sub-scale solution providers. While PC browser penetration declined slightly y/y, this is due to a higher shift toward mobile devices. In short, QIHU's Q3 suggests its operating growth profile is intact, which underscores management's positive revenue guidance.Margin pressure a near-term concern. The decline in GM to 77.3% from 79% in Q2 highlights the increasing cost pressure associated with monetizing search. Moreover, higher marketing expense (+226% y/y in the quarter) indicates that pre-installation of QIHU products on new mobile handsets is still necessary for QIHU to expand its user base. While I do not view the aggressive pre-installation of software to expand its user base as a sustainable strategy, I am encouraged by the rising MAU metrics, so it appears QIHU's current strategy is working.ConclusionContinue to prefer QIHU over CMCM.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
2612885,75515,2014-10-29T16:47:16-04:00,Qihoo was recently slammed in a Barron's article without much analysis of the argument.Management has addressed worries over margin pressures.A $200M share buyback points to management's confidence in their strategy.,"Earlier this week, a piece in Barron's by Shuli Ren points out all the things Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is doing right, while simultaneously taking down Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) for what the company lacks. Having delved into Qihoo's conference calls recently, I found myself on the opposite end of her argument with respect to Qihoo. Since the article seemed to rely more on snippets of analyst notes and price target revisions than anything else, I thought I'd take a moment to share my views on Qihoo's fundamentals.Delving Into QIHU's Margin PressuresQihoo is a China-based Internet technology company with very high growth rates. The recent Q2 2014, Q1 2014, and Q4 2013 quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) revenue growth rates are 110%, 141%, and 115%, respectively. In the same time period, its non-GAAP EPS QoQ growth rates were 25%, 285.7%, and 218.2%, respectively.Despite these impressive numbers, the stock took a big hit after the second quarter because of continued margin pressures and the belief that competition will keep margins depressed. It's a valid concern, because QoQ operating expenses have outpaced revenue growth a few times in the recent quarters.However, during the conference call, CEO Hongyi Zhou cited many one-offs in Q1 and Q2 SG&A related to the acquisition of MediaV and World Cup advertising. These expenses squeezed their margins -- case in point, the MediaV acquisition alone was valued over $100M compared to total operating expense spending of $175M to $200M per quarter for Qihoo. But these expenses are one-offs and will not have any further impact going forward. In addition, MediaV's strength lies in search monetization through better user analytics and ad offerings, as well as synergies in Qihoo's ad exchange platform. Optimizing search monetization equals improving the revenue and margins from ad revenue streams, all of which will help increase Qihoo's total profit margins going forward.While sell-side analysts have highlighted the competition from Baidu and Tencent, the reality is that those two companies have been competing with Qihoo for the past several years. Despite the competition, Qihoo has targeted 25%-30% traffic share on desktops, and already achieved that in this Q2. Qihoo has set its sights on a similar share for mobile, and has gone from 5% share at the beginning of the year to low- to mid-teen-digits share currently, as stated by co-CFO Alex Xu in the Q&A portion of the Q2 2014 conference call (Shuli believes it is 2%, but does not state where she gets that information).So while competition does continue to exist, Qihoo has shown an ability to operate well in a competitive environment as evidenced by their traffic share gains and their triple-digit QoQ revenue growth. And although margins have been depressed in the past few quarters as Qihoo invests heavily in its growth, management expects that to improve going forward due to the one-offs and MediaV integration.This past month, the board of directors has authorized a $200M share buyback, and Hongyi Zhou reiterated his confidence in management's plan. For a growth company to spend part of their capital on share buybacks suggests the company expects strong cash flow/reduced spending going forward, and that management is very bullish on their own company.VerdictAfter reading the past several earnings transcripts, I believe Qihoo is priced attractively right now. I am long the stock today, and expect great Q3 earnings at the end of November. Currently, analysts are expecting $365.5M in revenues (94.5% QoQ growth) and $0.61 in non-GAAP earnings (29.8% QoQ growth). Qihoo has not had lower than triple-digit revenue growth in the past four quarters, and I don't expect next quarter to be any different.I also expect reduced spending and one-off expenses plus the MediaV integration to start improving their margins going forward. This, combined with their EPS growth rates in recent quarters, should contribute to a beat on the EPS estimates as well.Currently, the stock is trading at a TTM GAAP earnings P/E of 57, with a growth rate of >88%. It is cheap relative to its growth rate (PEG ratio of ~0.64) and will be extremely cheap on the out years as long as the company continues to execute. Shuli Ren believes Qihoo will continue to be range-bound going into year-end. I guess we'll see who's right in late November when the company reports."
2536635,40031,2014-10-02T10:54:07-04:00,Qihoo 360 experienced a sharp drop after reporting second quarter earnings.The company announced a $200 million share buyback program which should help protect the stock from further downside.A look at a P/S ratio chart reveals where the potential bottom is.,"Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) is down 35% since mid-August as the company's margins have suffered as a consequence of increased spending. The move down was exacerbated by the selloff in China's internet names, as most of the stocks are also down significantly in the last couple of weeks. I believe that the latest move in the share price is unwarranted, especially if we look at Qihoo's growth expectations and forward valuation. I am reiterating my previous view on Qihoo, and I believe that the current price will prove to be a bargain when we look back in the next couple of years. The $200 million share repurchase program should help protect the downside and we should see a bottom soon.Expectations continue to rise but the stock goes southQihoo is down 35% in the last month despite the fact that the company reported Q2 earnings and revenue ahead of analyst estimates. On the negative side, margins were down significantly in Q2, with expectations for further compression in the following months. The company has decided to sacrifice short-term profitability in order to invest more aggressively in 2014 to capture market share and to grow revenues. The market clearly did not like this, and the share price is at the levels last seen in August 2013. However, the move down is most likely exacerbated by the selloff in most of China's internet issues in anticipation of the Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) IPO, which was believed to reduce the liquidity and created a reallocation of capital to Alibaba. I believe that the underlying fundamentals have not changed for the worse and that current price is a bargain. One would have thought that expectations have turned south given such a strong correction in the share price, but revenue estimates are actually trending higher since the Q2 report. Revenue estimates for 2014 and 2015 before the Q2 report were $1.32 billion and $1.92 billion, respectively, and now they stand at $1.35 billion and $1.99 billion. EPS estimates are mixed, with the 2014 EPS estimate down from $2.49 to $2.48 since the Q2 report, while the 2015 EPS estimate is up from $3.94 to $4.07.P/S ratio chart indicates that the bottom is nearIf we look at Qihoo's historical P/S ratio chart, we can see that Qihoo is approaching the low end of its historical valuation. I believe that further downside should be limited to 20%, or to around a TTM P/S ratio of 7. When Qihoo's P/S ratio was at current levels in the summer of 2012, its share price was around $16, and the stock went on to produce triple digit gains in the next two years, and is still up almost 300%. Additional downside beyond 20% is possible in the case of a significant meltdown in the general market and specifically in China's internet group. I believe that the expectations for strong revenue and earnings growth in the following years make the current valuation a bargain, as Qihoo is currently trading at a forward 2015 P/E ratio of 15.7, while its PEG ratio is 0.6.Source: Ycharts.comShare repurchase program to help protect the downsideThe company has reacted to the falling share price and has announced a $200 million share repurchase program on October 2. The repurchase program should help protect the downside and shows the management's belief in the value of the company.ConclusionThe last time Qihoo's valuation was this low, the stock produced triple digit gains in the next two years, and this might be the case once again. The company's growth prospects are similar or better to those in 2012 and I believe that the recent selloff created a solid long-term buying opportunity. Additional downside is possible, especially if Chinese internet stocks continue to go down, but the current price should prove as a bargain in a few years."
2468565,65073,2014-09-03T14:41:39-04:00,"Qihoo 360 continues the hot growth story with doubling revenue and almost doubling online advertising revenue.Already reached goal of 30% Internet search market share in China four months ahead of schedule.Increased costs can be minimized with lower one-time items, and earnings and margins will get back in line with revenues.Qihoo 360 still a strong play in the Chinese Internet market even with increased competition from larger companies such as Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.","Qihoo 360 Technology Ltd. (NYSE:QIHU) is a Chinese internet company that specializes in the internet security market, gaming and search. The claim to fame is internet security but have made the shift to gaming and internet search. If you have read anything I have written over the past few months or follow the IWC Stock Portfolio, you will know that two companies I'm extremely bullish on are Qihoo 360 and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). The reason being the developed nations have an internet usage rate of between 75-80% of the population. China has an internet adoption percentage in the 40% range. With a huge population and low but rapidly growing internet adoption rate, this market should double and therefore large internet companies in China (i.e. Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, etc.) stand to benefit. In the IWC Stock Portfolio, the two biggest positions are Baidu followed by Qihoo 360.So Qihoo 360 published second quarter financial results on August 24th, 2014. Here are some of the quick highlights from the report comparing the quarterly results from the same quarter in 2013.For more information, read the full press release with all the financial results, but the main message from the report are two things.Typically when analyzing a company, you look at sustainable and growing profits. The point of a company is to supply a good or service and make a profit supplying this good or service. This is my main case against investing in companies that cannot make a profit or lose money. This removes me from investing in exciting young companies like Organovo holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO), SolarCity (OTCQX:SCTY) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR). This is just a personal investing strategy that maybe excludes me from blockbuster companies in the beginning but also protects me from investing in a company that could lose everything. Why does this tangent matter? Because the second part of the investing strategy is when investing in a company that is growing so fast, profit margin consistency is not really a concern over growing the overall business. Qihoo 360 makes money which is great but everything should be put into growing the business, especially Qihoo 360 in this case for a few reasons I will get into soon. Therefore, a decrease in margins is no reason to change my strategy at this point with Qihoo 360. Well, the overall market disagrees with me and it showed with a huge drop after the report and sluggish stock price results the following week or so. Below is a chart showing the stock price performance in 2014 so far.The stock price went from a close of $101.75/share at the end of August 21st, 2014, to $87.83/share on the close of August 28th, 2014, representing a drop of almost 13.7%. So it seems profit margins are a big deal with respect to a large amount of Qihoo 360 shareholders.Continued Growth of the Chinese Internet Search MarketQihoo 360 in the beginning of 2014 had a goal to achieve 30% of the Chinese internet search market. Well, with four months to spare in 2014 Qihoo 360 has achieved this mark at mainly the expense of Baidu which now sits at around 54%. Qihoo 360's growth in the internet search market is quite remarkable when you consider that it started from basically nothing a couple of years ago to now a strong 2nd place and closing in on the once out of reach Baidu market share. A lot of resources have been deviated from PC internet search to mobile as priorities are being shifted. This makes sense as most of the Chinese people access the internet through their mobile devices.Currently, search market share growth has been the focus with Qihoo 360 over the past couple of years and they have succeeded in that way. What they have not focused on at this point is monetizing this increased market share. Reading the conference call, which you can find the attachment here, the management seem to have been concerned with increasing market share and protecting the user experience. The aim is for 2015 to begin seeing the monetization of search grow. For perspective, Baidu has 54% of the Chinese internet search market share and derives $1,923 MM in revenue. Qihoo 360 has 30% of the market share but only derives $171.3 MM. Therefore, with over 55% of the market share Baidu has, Qihoo 360 makes less than 10% what Baidu does monetizing search. With management focusing on monetizing moving forward, this could grow revenues immensely and subsequently grow profits and stock price.Valuation Has Become Very AttractiveWith the recent stock price hit, Qihoo 360 now finds itself with a P/E ratio of about 76.2 compared with Baidu having a P/E ratio of 38.9. Based on this ratio, you would think Qihoo 360 is wildly expensive compared to Baidu but the above ratio does not take into account growth. Using the PEG (price to earnings to growth) ratio the results change. Qihoo 360 has a PEG ratio of about 0.83 while Baidu has a PEG ratio of 1.15. Typically, PEG ratios below 1 represent a good valuation. Qihoo 360 is growing at a much faster clip which should command a higher stock price with respect to earnings.A company with over 100% revenue growth and a PEG ratio below 1 gives big upside potential.Potential for Strategic Moves in Near FutureQihoo 360 has seen increased competition from Baidu and Tencent in the internet security business. As of June 30, 2014, Qihoo 360 has $786.8 MM in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. Mergers and acquisitions will be important for Qihoo 360 in the competitive China market. Back in May 2014, Qihoo 360 bought MediaV to improve advertising and boost revenues. With increased competition from much larger companies (i.e. Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, etc.), more acquisitions may be on the horizon.Margin Concerns?Qihoo 360 management passed of the increase in spending due to one-item events including the World Cup. This makes sense since the World Cup occurs only once every four years. With that in mind, expenses should decrease next quarter with margins back up to normal conditions.The following graph looks at the spending in three different segments to see if 2014 is in-line with the normal trends or abnormal. The 2014 numbers are an extrapolation (basically doubling the results from the first two quarters). This means seasonal expenses are not taken into account in this analysis.Selling and marketing expenses seem to have been bumped in 2014 which gives credence to the one-time expenses claim by management. One good development is the constant increase in R&D spending (product development) with no signs of slowing down. With added competition continual R&D spending is critical. Overall, margin pressure needs to be followed to see if next year continues the trend or gets back to normal levels. A growing company that is spending to grow the business while still turning a profit makes it a good potential investment.Final ThoughtsDecreasing margins due to increasing spending in advertising and research is different than decreasing margins due to revenue decline. Qihoo 360 is growing but also spending. While turning a profit and growing earnings, the pressure on margins needs to be evaluated over the next year or so to determine the impact the World Cup advertising had on expenses. Growth does not seem to be slowing down any time soon and the China internet wave continues to ascend which means good times for Qihoo 360 moving forward. More competition is to be expected but a strong balance sheet and increased monetization of search will make Qihoo 360 a stock to own in the long-term.In the near term, margin concerns will put a hamper on the stock price but as the next few quarters pass and expenses decrease back to the norm, margins will increase again. Once this occurs the stock price will again push all-time highs with the growth potential moving forward.Before ending this post I want to ask people what are your opinions on my bullishness of the China internet market and specifically Qihoo 360. Are you as bullish on Qihoo 360 as I am and if not why? Getting different views is important for every investment thesis and hearing some downsides to Qihoo 360 or Baidu is important so I don't invest with rose-colored glasses. I'm saying that Qihoo 360 has a chance to greatly increase in value over the next year or two."

Ltd. designs and distributes internet and mobile security software and services in China. Its main products include 360 Safe Guard, 360 Anti-Virus, and 360 Mobile Safe. It was founded in 2005 and is based in Beijing, China.Key PointsGuidanceWhat to look for in Q3Enterprise SecurityThe company has previously explained that it is ready to enter the enterprise security market, which seems like a logical move given its user penetration at the consumer-PC and mobile levels. In the Q&A session, management stated that it has enterprise products under development and that it plans to launch some of these products in 3Q or 4Q.User penetrationThe company has nearly 94% user penetration for its PC-based products, but this actually represents a decline of about 2% from last year, which indicates that new PC users are not being exposed to the company's products as well. Look to see if this changes at all in Q3 as the company is facing increasing competition and has also ramped up spending on sales and marketing.Marketing expensesThe company spent a lot on sales and marketing in Q2 compared to Q1, and management cited that this was one of the main factors that impacted the company's earnings. At this point, it seems that if the company does not expand its product portfolio, or expand into other markets, it will be faced with increasing competition and expenses in order to maintain its market share.Quick TakeManagement started off the call by detailing the company's progress in gaining market share for its search engine and its efforts to monetize the product. The company's security software is extremely popular in China, and is installed on over 90% of PCs in China.The company's earnings and sales exceeded consensus expectations and the company provided strong sales guidance, but the costs that the company incurred have driven down margins from previous quarters. It would have been helpful if they could have provided expectations for expenses. It's clear that the company's sales are growing rapidly, but so are expenses. The company's lack of guidance beyond sales expectations makes it difficult to do an accurate valuation, especially since its marketing expenses have been inconsistent.During the Q&A session. one of the analysts asked about the company's big jump in sales and marketing spending from Q1 ($68.7 million) to Q2 ($84.9 million). Management claimed that this was due to increasing competition and World Cup advertising. However, with such high market share and user penetration for its products, it seems as if the company is going to have to spend increasingly on its advertising in order to maintain its customer base, which will erode margins.This is a company that gained a massive amount of market share and exposure very quickly, and is facing increasing competition for its consumer products, which is eroding margins. In order for it to expand margins, it needs to find new markets. I would look for the company to put a lot of effort into the Enterprise Security market over the next few quarters.Transcript is available on Seeking Alpha here, and the company's webcast and investor presentation materials are available here."
2462085,71845,2014-08-31T08:09:58-04:00,,"Originally published Monday, 25 August 2014.Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU, profile) released Q2 FY2014 results which included revenue of 317.9 million USD (exceeding management's earlier guidance) and net income of 37.0 million USD. The Q2 results beat the consensus revenue estimate of about 309 million USD and also beat on earnings (non-GAAP EPADS of 0.50 USD vs. 0.46 consensus). In addition to Q2 results, the company offered a strong Q3 outlook. Management's Q3 FY2014 revenue guidance was for about 363 million USD (higher than the 357 million USD consensus), reflecting growth of about +93% YoY and +14% QoQ.Along with a quarter of strong top-line growth, management continued investing in future growth. Although fixed expenses (Selling and promotion, Product development) were at levels similar to earlier quarters (percentage of revenue), higher costs of revenues meant further operating margin compression YoY and QoQ. It seems worth noting that some of the recent initiatives (mobile, search monetization) could bring more long-term results, so focusing on the near-term might paint an incomplete picture.Along with encouraging financial results, Qihoo 360's operating metrics were also positive. Unique visitors to the company's Personal Start-Up page grew to nearly 128 million during Q2, reversing a declining trend from the previous two quarters. Despite increased traffic, however, the number of daily clicks was lower QoQ, reaching nearly 750 million during the quarter vs. 772 in Q1. Qihoo 360's efforts in mobile showed continued progress, with the number of 360 Mobile Safe users reaching 641 million during Q2, up about 90% YoY and 20% QoQ.In prepared remarks, the company emphasized progress in mobile, highlighting growth in the number of 360 Mobile Safe users (reaching 641 million during Q2, about +90% YoY), and other mobile initiatives. Management also noted that it had achieved its full-year target for a 30% share of search based on a news story circulated shortly before the Q2 release. When noting its progress in search, management suggested that it would step up its efforts in mobile, so higher R&D spending might be around the corner.The company generated about 57.7 million USD of operating cash flow during the quarter, down from the 100.5 million USD generated in Q1 and 86.4 million USD in Q2 last year.The company's Q3 FY2014 outlook included the following:Operating MetricsFinancial PerformanceRevenue higher both YoY and QoQ due to the combined strength in the company's online advertising and Internet value-added services businesses. Online advertising revenues grew 89% YoY (22% QoQ), driven by growth in the search and mobile advertising business, as well as increased monetization for the 360 Personalized Start-Up page. Internet value-added services grew about 140% YoY (17% QoQ), driven higher by additional PC and mobile games on the company's game platform.Cost of revenues increased significantly both YoY and QoQ, outpacing revenue growth, resulting in gross margin compression vs. last quarter and a year ago. Some of the company's direct costs include bandwidth and traffic acquisition costs, and it seems that increases in traffic could drive both higher. Noting that the company has seen its search share increasing, it seems reasonable to conclude that other competitors may be responding with increased traffic acquisition spending, which could be driving up overall price levels.Fixed costs rose during Q2, driven by increased spending on the key areas of Selling and marketing and Product development. Selling and marketing rose to 27% of total revenue during Q2, a relative high vs. recent quarters. Product development expenses rose to slightly over 100 million USD, the fifth consecutive quarterly increase, as the company has been investing in R&D to support its search monetization and mobile efforts. Higher overall revenue levels meant that although the cost item was higher, the impact on operating margin was limited (product development was 32% of total revenue vs. 32% last quarter and 40% in Q2 FY2013).On aggregate, fixed expenses were 66% of total revenue, flat vs. Q2, so a the decrease in gross margin was the main factor behind the lower operating a margin vs. Q1.Qihoo 360 recognized minimal non-operating items, unlike the boost provided from a disposal of long-term investments in Q1, so net income was largely driven by results at the operating level.Disclosure: none."
2448215,67313,2014-08-25T08:39:11-04:00,QIHU beat top and bottom line with Q3 guidance higher than consensus.Strength in online advertising once again driven by mobile and search.Expects more M&As ahead to strengthen the ecosystem.,"Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) reported Q2 '14 results in which non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 and revenue of $318m (+110% y/y) both beat consensus of $0.46 non-GAAP EPS and $309m in revenue. The company guided $360m-365m in revenue for Q3, representing a 92%-94% y/y growth, again beating consensus expectation of $357m.A conference call will be held at 7:30am Monday morning EST, detail of the call is below.A replay of the call will be available at 10:30am and dial-in for the replay is below:An easy beatQihoo made its Q2 '14 beat seemed so easy with consolidated revenue of $318m (+110% y/y) handily beating consensus of $309m thanks to strength in both online advertising (+89% y/y) and IVAS (+140% y/y), indicating that mobile, search and IVAS are gaining steam. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.50 was also ahead of consensus of $0.46 and the midpoint of Q3 guidance was 1% above consensus estimate.Mobile, search and IVAS ramping upThe strength of the online advertising revenue ($171m) was mostly driven by search and mobile monetization. On the search side, total MAU of PC-based product increased 7.6% y/y to 496m with PC browser user base +5% y/y to 345m users and this may have helped Qihoo to gain incremental search traffic. In addition, average daily unique visit to the startup page increased 12% while daily clicks increased 27% y/y, indicating higher engagement trend that again may have contributed to the strength in search.Mobile was also encouraging in that total smartphone user of Qihoo's 360 mobile security product reached 641m (+89% y/y), indicating growing adoption of Qihoo's mobile security product among the Chinese users. I continue to see Qihoo as the leading mobile security platform in China given its scale, diversified product offering and longer operating profile, and reiterate my bearish view on Cheetah Mobile (NYSE:CMCM) given its smaller scale and unproven track record in mobile monetization.IVAS revenue of $146m (+140% y/y) continues its robust growth profile on the back of PC and mobile games which are gaining popularity among Qihoo's users, an indication of effective execution by Qihoo on cross-promotion of products within its ecosystem.Expects more M&A aheadManagement has indicated that it intends to strengthen and expand Qihoo's ecosystem via strategic partnerships and investments in what I see as further signs of potential M&As ahead. With $400m in net cash at the end of the quarter, any acquisition could be small in nature if the company does not consider increasing leverage. Given the competitive dynamic of the industry, investors could expect another round of debt issue as Qihoo looks to beef up its ecosystem."
2410445,40031,2014-08-11T14:21:25-04:00,Qihoo seems to have digested its move down in the last couple of months and might be ready to rally.The company has done a note offering which means that a major acquisition may be in the making.Comparing Qihoo’s valuation to Baidu's reveals which stock has potential for more gains in the next couple of months.,"Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) is still consolidating after the strong selloff in the March-May period. On March 10, I suggested that it may be time to sell Qihoo and buy Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) as Qihoo was extended at the time, and as I thought that Baidu presented a better opportunity to profit in the next couple of months. In early May, I revisited my thesis and said that it is time to buy both Qihoo and Baidu, as their upside potential was roughly the same and as both companies are benefiting from the strong momentum in their businesses. Both stocks bottomed a few days after I wrote the article, although Qihoo has not performed as well as Baidu. While I am maintaining my buy ratings on both stocks, I believe that Qihoo should outperform in the next couple of months. The company is due to report earnings in late August and the recent note offering suggests that a major acquisition is in the making, and both events may serve as strong catalysts for the share price in the next couple of weeks or months. Qihoo also has more upside potential than Baidu when we compare the growth and valuation of the two companies.Two potential catalysts are comingActually, one catalyst is coming up that we are sure about, and that is the Q2 earnings report. The company is expected to report earnings in late August (no exact date is specified yet), and the report will likely determine the short-term price movement of the stock. I believe that the company should continue to deliver revenue and earnings above analyst estimates and provide guidance above views, which was the case in at least the last four earnings reports. On the other hand, the company has done a large note offering a few days ago, raising $900 million for ""general corporate purposes."" This might be another catalyst for the stock, as the company might do a large acquisition since it already has $900 million in cash and equivalents and does not need the funds for regular day-to-day business activities. I do not want to speculate about potential candidates, but the note offering is a clear indication that something is being done in that area and is most likely related to the mobile business.Valuation favors Qihoo at the momentWhen I wrote about Qihoo and Baidu in early May, the upside potential for both companies was roughly in the same ballpark. I said that both stocks could rise between 50% and 70% in the next six to twelve months, while Qihoo could rise more than 100% in the bullish scenario. Since the article was published, Baidu is up 35% while Qihoo is up just 7%. The rise in Baidu's share price has shifted the reward/risk ratio in Qihoo's favor. In my latest article on Baidu, I noted that further upside is possible, and that the stock could reach $300 by the end of the year. Baidu's potential upside is between 30% and 50% right now, although the stock might be vulnerable to a pullback after such a strong run in the last two months. On the other hand, Qihoo has consolidated in that time and may be ready to rise. A look at the valuation in the table below leaves me with the conclusion that Qihoo should outperform in the next couple of months. Qihoo's growth figures and forward expectations are above Baidu's, and its forward valuation is lower than Baidu's. I still believe that Qihoo might be a double from here in the next six to twelve months, especially if the company's strong business momentum continues in the next couple of quarters.Source: Yahoo! FinanceConclusionI am still bullish on both Qihoo and Baidu, but I think that Qihoo should outperform in the next couple of months, based on higher growth prospects and a lower forward valuation. Qihoo's Q2 earnings are coming up in three weeks and the company has done a note offering, raising $900 million, which it might use for a large acquisition very soon. Qihoo's upside potential could be north of 100% in the next six to twelve months while Baidu's upside is more in the 30% to 50% range, making Qihoo a better opportunity at the moment.Disclosure: The author is long QIHU.

2348925,40781,2014-07-28T14:46:59-04:00,"Thomas Chong, an analyst at Citigroup, initiated coverage of Qihoo 360 with a BUY rating and $114.10 price target.Why I strongly believe Chong is undervaluing Qihoo by at least 30%.Baidu's recent post earnings blowout, suggests other players like Qihoo will benefit greatly over the coming quarters.","Last week, I wrote an article on Seeking Alpha that talked about the strong growth of Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU), and why I felt shares had upside of more than 65%. Since then, shares have already climbed close to 10% and look to be on the way of a major breakout as you can see in the chart below.For those technical investors out there, the next couple of areas to keep an eye out for is the resistance levels around $105, $112, $120 and of course the 52-week high at $124.42.With Qihoo's new found momentum over the last month or so, I feel that shares could possibly test the 52-week high before earnings roll around which will most likely take place in the middle of August.Analyst Views On Qihoo 360Last week, Citigroup announced its new lead analyst (Thomas Chong), for its China Internet sector. Because of the transfer of coverage, Chong's view on how to value the sector is quite different.According to Chong, Chinese Internet companies should be valued on a PEG basis (Price/earnings to growth), instead of the discounted cash flow model. Chong believes the earnings growth in the medium term can best capture the performance of Internet companies amidst the fast-changing developments of the sector. According to his report, Chong gave ratings on Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Qihoo.Tencent was given a PEG of 1.2x on 2015 earnings. Chong believes Tencent will continue to grow at an annual rate of 20%.Baidu was given a PEG of 1.0x on next year's earnings ($7.71), with an annualized growth rate of 32%. This implies a price target of $245.So what kind of rating did Qihoo receive? Before we get to that, let's first take a look at what Chong had to say about the search, software and gaming company;Chong gave Qihoo some well deserved kudos as the Company has demonstrated strong execution in monetization through PC search and mobile app stores with a focus in the China Market. On top of that, Chong believes Qihoo will be able to provide a one-stop search service to PC and Mobile advertisers through its formulated multi-channel strategy.Last but not least, Chong believes Qihoo will more than triple revenue in 2014 ($289M), driven by mobile games, etc.So what's the new price target? Surely will all of the positive praise Chong gave, a raised price target seemed to be in the making. Boy was I wrong! Chong initiated coverage of Qihoo with a BUY rating and a price target of $114.10, down from $165 (from former analysts).Chong gave Qihoo a PEG of just 0.60x based on next year's earnings ($4.32), with an annual growth rate of 44%. This of course translates into a price target of just over $114.I'm sure longs everywhere were just as perplexed as I was when I first read the report. Here we have continued growth with estimates being raised yet again -- adding it all up, somehow this contributes to a lower price target? What gives?In the words of Chong, ""Qihoo is too young"". ""...It (Qihoo) does not have enough operational history to show for. As a result, ""we apply 40% discount to PEG on its short history in search and mobile monetization.""I'm not really buying the ""Qihoo is too young"" argument. Yes, Qihoo has not been around as long as Baidu and Tencent has, but we're only talking about a couple of year's difference here.Also, if Qihoo is ""too young"", then what about another high profile company in Vipshop holdings (NYSE:VIPS). Vipshop was founded in 2008 (three years after Qihoo), but has emerged as a legitimate powerhouse. If you don't believe me, then just take a look at the chart on the right. Shares are up more than 3,700% since its IPO in 2012. If VIPS can trade without a big discount on a PEG basis, then why should Qihoo?That is why I went ahead and set up my own table and put some figures together that shows what the value of Qihoo would be based on a number of different PEG ratios.For those of you that are not familiar with the PEG ratio, here is a little overview for you. The PEG ratio compares a stock's price/earnings ratio to its expected EPS growth rate. If a PEG ratio is equal to one, that means the market is pricing the stock to fully reflect the stock's EPS growth.If the PEG ratio is less than one, it can indicate a couple of things. The first and most likely scenario is that shares are just simply undervalued. On the other hand though, shares could be undervalued for a reason as investors believe XYZ company will not be able to reach its intended growth rate.If the PEG ratio is greater than one, it can also indicate a couple of things. First, that shares most likely are on the overvalued side. At the same time though, shares could still be somewhat undervalued because the markets expect the Company to continue growing at a blistering pace and above Wall Street's projections. More likely than not though, shares turn out to be on the overvalued side.Breaking it all down, finding a stock with a low PEG that is consistently surpassing Wall Street's expectations is what every investor should be closely watching. Luckily for investors in Qihoo, they have already found one of those Wall Street gems.ConclusionAs you can see from my PEG table above, based on a PEG of 1.0x, like Tencent, Baidu, Sina, etc and many other companies are currently going for, shares would have a price target well over $190. That would imply a return of more than 100% based on Friday's closing price. Even applying a 10%-20% discount to PEG, shares of Qihoo would be well into the $150-$170 range. This implies upside of more than 50%, or 30% above Chong's price target of $114.With the earnings season in full swing, investors everywhere are looking closely at the competition to try and gauge what kind of numbers the companies they have invested in are likely to put up.Last week was no different as Baidu posted another round of impressive results Thursday afternoon, easily beating the top and bottom lines. Shares of other high profile Chinese companies such as Qihoo and YY (NASDAQ:YY), received a nice boost in the process.Qihoo Continues To Take China's Market ShareOne of the biggest things to help fuel Qihoo's strong growth over the years has been its transition into the search engine business. In August of 2012, Qihoo, which is well known for its anti-virus software among many other things, entered into the Chinese search engine space.In just a short amount of time, Qihoo tapped into its hundreds of millionS of users to become the second most popular search engine in China.As we can see in my infographic on the left, Qihoo has consistently grown its market share over the last two years.In fact, over these last two years, Qihoo has gone from nothing, to becoming the second biggest search platform in China with over 26% in market share.Baidu, has taken the biggest hit over the years as its seen its market share fall from 80% to under 60%, thanks in part to Qihoo. As of last month, Qihoo has increased its market share to 26% with Baidu hanging on to just 60%.Long before Qihoo came around, Baidu was enjoying a dominating performance with a market share well over 80%. Certainly Qihoo has shaken things up in China, as the Company now expects to have at least 30%-35% of the market share by the end of this year.It seems that investors are starting to finally take notice of Qihoo again as shares have broken out of downtrend and are on the verge of a nice breakout.It doesn't hurt either that options traders are also betting big on Qihoo as calls outnumbered puts by a 12-to-1 ratio, a reflection of the session's bullish sentiment last week.On top of that, there was heavy volume for the $130 September strike calls. Volume was more than 19 times the previous open interest at the strike, suggesting that new money was put to work on the long side.In conclusion, I believe shares of Qihoo have at least 50% in additional value over the next 12 months based on a number of different factors (Fwd P/E, PEG ratio, etc.). With revenue looking to continue growing at a blistering pace over the next couple of years, investors should be rewarded with plenty of gains over the coming months and years.

2447675,50682,2014-08-25T04:53:47-04:00,,"Rising online search star Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) has reached a major milestone, winning 30 percent of China’s traffic for the first time just 2 years after the launch of its So.com search engine. Despite that huge achievement, Qihoo’s newly released quarterly results show it’s having a harder time monetizing its search business, which may partly explain why its shares are down 20 percent since a peak in the spring. From the perspective of an observer, these latest signs still look quite encouraging and might even prompt a Qihoo skeptic like myself to consider buying the company’s stock at its current price.Qihoo achieved its milestone on August 21, when its share of the China search market for page views and unique visitors officially clocked in at about 30.2 percent, according to CNZZ, the independent web traffic tool owned by Alibaba. By comparison, industry leader Baidu’s (NASDAQ:BIDU) share came in at about 53 percent, while the third largest player, Sohu’s (NASDAQ:SOHU) Sogou logged about 13.5 percent.Qihoo’s steady gains are quite remarkable for such a young search engine, and reflect a number of factors. The company’s controversial founder Zhou Hongyi was one of China’s earliest pioneers in the space, setting up a search engine more than a decade ago that became the country’s leader and which he eventually sold to Yahoo (YHOO). The company’s current So.com also incorporates a number of innovative features and benefits from traffic sent to it by Qihoo’s other products.I’ll admit I haven’t used So.com before, but perhaps I’ll give it a try as there are many things I don’t like about current leader Baidu, which has become a Chinese Internet superstar by successfully monetizing its own search business. Baidu’s search results are notoriously non-transparent, cluttered with paid links and links that favor Baidu’s own sites. That means users often have to plow through several pages before finding any results that are useful.I’m sure Qihoo probably engages in similar practices, though perhaps not as egregiously as Baidu since it’s still trying to build an audience. Despite So.com’s huge gains in search, Qihoo’s latest results show just how far the business has to go before it becomes a serious revenue and profit engine. The search business is mentioned numerous times in Qihoo’s announcement, which was released over the weekend. The closest the company comes to giving any actual figures is its comment that search was an important factor in its online advertising revenue growth of 89 percent.The lack of any solid figures given for search means the business is almost certainly still quite small, perhaps accounting for as much as $20-$30 million of Qihoo’s $171 million in second-quarter advertising revenue. By comparison, Baidu logged a massive $1.9 billion in search revenue for the second quarter, or about 70 times Qihoo’s figure, based on my own estimate.All that said, Qihoo has proven itself quite competent at turning its new businesses into profit centers. Baidu itself took quite a while to perfect its current system, which really only began to show big results in the last 4 or 5 years, even though the company itself is more than a decade old. I expect Qihoo will probably be able to achieve similar results a little more quickly, and could start to get some significant contributions from search in the next 2-3 years.Looking at the company’s stock, Qihoo now trades at a relatively rich but not unreasonable price-to-earnings ratio of about 90. Its shares are up 20 percent from the beginning of the year but down 20 percent from a peak in the spring, probably reflecting some investor impatience with the search monetization. But for anyone who does have some patience, the stock certainly could look like a good buy for investors willing to hold it over the next 2-3 years.Bottom line: Qihoo’s stock could be a good bet for buyers patient enough to wait for it to monetize its fast growing search business over the next 2-3 years.Disclosure: None"

        MediaV a near-term pain but long-term impact is attractive. Remain bullish on the stock.","Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) will report its 2Q14 earnings on Monday before market opens. The detail of the conference call is below:Consensus expects $0.46 in EPS (vs. $0.40 a year ago) on revenue of $309m (+104% y/y). The stock has outperformed the broader NASDAQ by 5% over the past three months.Expect continued momentum in search and mobileThe company guided $300-305m in revenue, slightly conservative vs. consensus but nonetheless indicates that both online advertising and IVAS (ie. mobile games, search and advertising) to continue its near-term momentum. In particular, search will be an area to focus as CNZZ recently released its China search market estimate in which QIHU has 30% of the market in terms of page views vs. Baidu's (NASDAQ:BIDU) 55%, indicating that Qihoo is gaining momentum in the search market. On the same note, iResearch data indicates that Qihoo's search time spent market share has improved to 16% in Q2 vs. 14% at the end of last year, another indication that Qihoo is making progress in search.I expect mobile search to accelerate in the latter half of the year on the back of new product launch (ie. mobile search app) and mobile browser with embedded search services, which will be accretive to search traffic down the road.MediaV a near-term pain but a long-term gainIn May, Qihoo purchased a majority stake in MediaV, a VC-backed advertising and digital marketing company for $100m. This move indicates that Qihoo is active in securing strategic investments and putting its cash to use for potential M&A. The near-term impact of the MediaV acquisition will be margin dilutive given the minimal revenue contribution but long-term's contribution from MediaV's targeted ad system could accelerate mobile and search advertising, which will likely to be margin accretive.I am a buyer of Qihoo ahead of result. At 41x forward earnings, the stock looks attractively priced given the long-term growth profile, competitive positioning in mobile and emerging opportunity in search."
2204443,65073,2014-05-08T17:18:42-04:00,"Chinese Internet adoption in 2013 is about 42.3%, which is an increase from 28.9% in 2009.Based on current trends, the percentage of people in China using the Internet will reach 78% by 2020.Baidu and Qihoo 360 are the dominant Internet companies in terms of search and Internet security.The recent sell off of both companies (especially Qihoo) may provide a buying opportunity for a long-term play.","There are few things in life that are certain and even fewer things certain in the investing world. One trend that is almost certain to occur is the continual Internet adoption in China. China has been in the news lately due to a slowing economy, which says nothing about recent news of the U.S. economy actually contracting the last quarter. China without a doubt is slowing down from its double-digit growth years but the economy is still growing and there is that undeniable fact of a lot of Chinese people. China is still the most populated country in the world with India coming in strong. The World Bank currently pegs the Chinese population in 2013 to be around 1.35 billion people with India a bit above 1.2 billion as shown in the following figure.Figure 1 - Population growth for China, India and USA (World Bank)This number could have easily been higher if not for the one child policy instituted by the Chinese government. This huge population has helped push China to become the second largest economy in the world next to the United States, overtaking Japan. So where does the Internet come into all this. A bigger population means a larger audience for companies to push products and services towards. With less and less people watching TV, the advertising dollars is going towards the Internet, which is pulling a larger and larger audience. China with its large population and standing as an economic power for the next few decades, Internet adoption in China is lower than most of the developed world. Below is a figure showing the Internet usage statistics for the major economies in 2009 and 2013.Figure 2 - Internet usage statistics between 2009 and 2013In 2013, most of the largest economies are above 50% with the highest Internet user percentage belonging to the United Kingdom, France, Japan, Germany and the United States. There are most Chinese Internet users but in terms of percentage of population, only 42.3% of people in China are connected. The momentum to close the gap between China and the big five countries is there. Since 2009, only Russia has grown faster than China in Internet adoption percentage. If the pace continues, China will have almost 78% of the population connected to the Internet in 2020. Even if the Chinese population remains stagnant until 2020 (highly unlikely assumption), that is an additional 480.6 million Internet users in China or a total of over a billion Chinese Internet users. By 2020, there is a chance that most if not all entertainment is derived from the Internet with a larger percentage of advertising money funneled away from other media outlets and focusing on the Internet.In the United States, Google has revolutionized how advertisers view the Internet. By dominating search and maps, Google has commanded billions of dollars per year in advertising dollars. This trend is only going to grow as consumers spend an increasing percentage of time on the Internet. Competition in China is always fierce, and the Internet is no different but two companies have stood out in terms of dominating the Internet space in China, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU).Market Leaders: Baidu and Qihoo 360Baidu has been the market share leader in search within China for some time now with over 60% of the market share. Due to this dominant share of search, Baidu has been called the Chinese Google. Along with search, Baidu products and services include maps, cloud storage, and app developing. Baidu is also looking into expanding to other large Asian markets including Japan and South Korea. Qihoo 360 dominates the Chinese Internet through security. Qihoo 360 possesses two of the industry leading security software packages: 360 Safe Guard and 360 Anti-Virus. Dominant is the only term to describe Internet security and Qihoo with Qihoo covering 94% of the PC market share and over 70% of the mobile market share. The real amazing development was in 2012 when Qihoo entered the Internet search domain. In short order, they captured 20% of the Chinese search market share and the #2 position behind only Baidu. Qihoo aims to capture 30% of the market share by the end of 2014 and with the growth projections, they may hit that mark. The below figure shows the change in Internet search market share between the end of 2012 and the end of 2013.Figure 3 - Search engine market share between 2012 and 2013.In the past couple of years, there has been some market share gained by Qihoo at the expense of Baidu but combined their market share has been steady at about 80%.So Baidu is the leader in search and Qihoo the leader in Internet security but how do they perform financially. All sources for the tables were obtained through the company profiles from the Motley Fool. Table 1 looks at some financial metrics for the trailing twelve months.Baidu is about five times bigger than Qihoo with a longer financial history. The gross margin for Baidu is very strong while Qihoo is superb at almost 94%. Net margin, ROA and ROI are all favoring Baidu though both companies are making money and get returns for their investments. Both companies are expensive from a price-to-earnings perspective. As a comparison, Google trades at a P/E ratio of 27.1. Table 2 is where we see the true value in both companies and possibly justify the high P/E ratios.Baidu has been growing at an incredible pace while Qihoo has been doubling revenue and earnings consistently. The EPS growth for Baidu for 1-year needs context as Baidu has invested heavily in mobile. 80% of Internet users used mobile to access the web using a smartphone in China. With this shift away from traditional desktop and moving towards mobile, how Baidu and Qihoo monetize mobile will be a key to any investment thesis. The next couple of tables compares key income statement (Table 3) and balance sheet (Table 4).Both companies have a healthy spend in R&D with Qihoo heavily investing back to R&D. As growth companies in technology, it is vital to invest back into the company and continue to innovate and push out new products and services to stay ahead of the curve.Investing in growth companies is typically tough since companies need to invest heavily to grow which puts pressure on income and cash flow. Based on the income statement and balance sheets, both companies make a significant amount of money which gives them the financial strength to invest in mobile and other ventures including expanding, acquisitions, etc.So far in 2014, growth companies have been hit hard as the markets cool down a bit after a huge 2013 for most companies and Baidu and Qihoo have not been immune to the weakness in the market. The following stock chart shows the returns YTD in 2014 for Baidu and Qihoo.Figure 4 - Baidu and Qihoo stock performance in 2014.Qihoo gained almost 50% before losing all of it. Both companies are down for the year, which may present a buying opportunity.Final RemarksBaidu and Qihoo are both Chinese Internet companies that are dominating search and Internet security. As the people of China continue to increase using the Internet, the revenues for both companies will increase. As growth companies, both are financially strong, have healthy balance sheets, and make money. They are also aggressively expanding into mobile, which is where Internet consumption is shifting toward. With the recent sell off for both companies, and the growth prospects, a position in Baidu and Qihoo may reap healthy returns in the mid-to-long term.Disclosure: I am long QIHU, BIDU.

2328005,40781,2014-07-22T05:02:16-04:00,Analysts' price cuts do not accurately reflect and justify the future growth that is ahead of Qihoo 360.Learning from history: Analysts are usually late to the party and this time is no different.Qihoo 360 reported strong earnings on both the top and bottom lines in May and looks poised to continue doing so over the next couple of years.Shares of Qihoo 360 are highly undervalued and have upside of more than 65%.,"Just a few months ago, shares of Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) were stuck in a downward trend. After hitting a 52-week high ($124.42) in early March, shares slid more than 30% in the weeks thereafter.Nothing significantly changed within the Company to warrant such a sell-off as growth and momentum stocks across the board dropped due to a mini market correction. The chart below shows Qihoo's fall from grace during the spring sell-off, as well as its newfound momentum heading into the summer.As you can see in the chart, over the past couple of months, shares have started to rebound nicely and have broken out of that downward trend. It seems that investors are finally starting to notice the huge potential that is in Qihoo.One of the main drivers behind Qihoo's fall besides the mini correction in March, was that a number of firms and analysts cut their price targets on the Company. The table below shows you which firms reduced their price targets and what those new revised price targets are now.Analyst's Views On Qihoo 360In a note to clients, Maxim analyst Echo He lowered her price target on Qihoo, even though she expected the Company to beat Q1 earnings last May. Here is what He had to say:I'm sure you are just as perplexed as I was when I first read this. Here we have growth estimates being raised year-over-year as well as an indication that Qihoo was likely to beat Q1 estimates (which it easily did). Adding all of it up, somehow this contributes to a lower price target? What gives?Breaking it all down, He believes that investors are less willing to pay up for high growth rates today than they have been in the past. As a result, He lowered her price target on Qihoo from $130 to $100 based on 29 times 2015 earnings ($3.50 X 29 =$101.5). The $30 price target reduction is due to a lower market multiple being assigned.I disagree with He and here's why. No matter where you look in the market, there are investors willing to pay up for growth when a company consistently delivers results. Look no further than Vipshop Holdings (NYSE:VIPS), which is one of my favorite picks right now. Shares are up more than 3,500% and look poised to keep chugging along. Certainly there are plenty of growth investors out there and Vipshop is living proof of this. This is one of the reasons why I'm not buying He's reasoning right now.Another thing that stood out to me in the research report, is that He believes Qihoo will deliver just $3.50 in EPS in 2015. Meanwhile, based on current rates and trends, Qihoo looks like it will deliver EPS in the $3.90-$4.00 range. That's almost 15% above He's estimates!On top of that, analysts expect the Company to grow earnings between 40%-50% annually over the next couple of years. Certainly this type of growth should be rewarded and not punished. This is why I believe Qihoo is currently undervalued and presents investors with a terrific buying opportunity for gains of at least 65% over the next year or so.Since the year is already half way over, investors need to start looking at 2015 estimates instead of 2014 estimates. In 2015, Qihoo should be doing close to $2B in revenue with revenue growth coming in over 50%.As of right now, Qihoo is trading at 22 times 2015 earnings. This is right around the market average for stocks across the board. However, most companies are growing revenues between 10%-30% and not 45%-95% like Qihoo is managing to do. It's not rocket science that Qihoo should be trading at a higher multiple than the market average. So what kind of multiple should be applied?The chart above gives you a great idea of how Qihoo stacks up against other momentum and growth players in the market. As you can see, Qihoo is trading rather cheaply when compared against other high growth players.Adding up 2015 estimates, these companies (excluding Qihoo) are going for an average of 73 times 2015 estimates. That is three times more than what Qihoo is currently going for! If Qihoo traded at those levels, investors would be paying more than $285 a share. At today's levels, that would be an increase of more than 225%.I believe shares should be going for around 35-40 times 2015 estimates, which would put shares in the $138-$157 range. This averages out to around $147 a share. Based on yesterday's closing price, shares would appreciate by more than 65%. So how achievable is this target? Very! Here are a couple more reasons why.So what's fueling Qihoo's strong growth? Two words; search engine. In August of 2012, Qihoo, which is well known for its anti-virus software among many other things, entered into the Chinese search engine space.In just a very short amount of time, Qihoo was able to tap into its hundreds of million of users to become the second most popular search engine in China.As of today, Qihoo has around 26% of China's market share with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) having around 60%. Before Qihoo came around, Baidu was enjoying its dominating performance with a market share of more than 80%. Certainly Qihoo has shaken things up in China, as the Company expects to have at least 30% of the market by the end of the year.Revenue, Expenses & Net IncomeOn June 2, 2014 analysts at Nomura Securities lowered their price targets on Qihoo 360 from $125 to $113, citing ""surging expenses"" and ""lacking catalysts"" as the reasons the firm cut 2014 and 2015 estimates. So with that, I put together an infographic of Qihoo's revenues, expenses as well as net income over the past two years.As we can see, revenues as well as net income are at the highest levels they have even been. The only downfall, is that expenses continue to grow too. But like the old saying goes, ""you gotta spend money in order to make money."" Companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) know this and have been on a spending spree (marketing, research and development etc.), over the last couple of years.While it's true that Qihoo has been ramping up expenses over the last little bit, they are also benefiting from record revenue growth with each passing quarter. Based on future projections and expectations, revenues will continue to outpace expenses and net income looks like it will continue to rise as well.ConclusionHave you ever wondered how good an analyst was at his or her job? Over the years of investing, I've seen some great analysts and some bad ones as well. Knowing who you can trust in the market is a big deal for investors.While I don't mean to pick on Maxim analyst Echo He, there is a lot to learn from her investment picks. The table below shows some of her calls and how shares have traded since.While He has made some great calls on companies like Dangdang (NYSE:DANG) and Youku (NYSE:YOKU), her overall track record isn't the most kindly to look upon as you can see from the table above. So what does this all mean? Simply put, He tends to be late to the party.After cutting her price target on Qihoo to $100 from $130, my buy signals started chomping at the bit. Of course this wasn't the only reason why I like Qihoo, but it certainly was the icing on the cake.In conclusion, I believe shares have more than 65% in additional value over the next 12 months based on 35-40 times 2015 estimates. Is this expensive? No, not really. With revenue growth looking to grow at a blistering pace over the next couple of years, 35-40 times next year's earnings looks pretty fair to me. Don't forget either, that at this time next year, Qihoo will be trading at just 16 times 2016 estimates.As always, I'm providing you with my track record and other particular stocks that I recommend. The link provided will show you all of my picks, how they have fared, and where I think they will be going in the near future. I think you will find my track record to be very impressive and useful.Disclaimer: LinkDisclosure: The author is long VIPS, QIHU.

2284153,20568,2014-06-24T13:21:13-04:00,,"With the coming IPO of China's largest e-commerce portal, Alibaba, investors are looking for more ways to play the massive growth of the world's largest common-language/culture Internet market. Alibaba, who is still owned 24% by Yahoo (YHOO), has astonished web-focused investors with its consistent profit growth and massive revenue haul.Alibaba's (ABABA) fourth quarter saw a huge quarterly profit gain -- its fourth straight -- of $792 million on sales that surged 51% to $1.78 billion. Word is that Alibaba's transaction volume is greater than Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and eBay combined.Until the IPO of the ""Amazon of China,"" which is projected to be valued at as much as $200 billion, I am buying a young upstart in the Chinese web jungle: Qihoo 360 Technology (NYSE:QIHU), the country's largest Internet security provider, with over 460 million monthly active users, representing a penetration rate of 96% in the biggest web market.I first wrote about QIHU last September when I saw them taking the #2 spot in search next to the giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU)...The Story is OutQihoo 360 Technology offers a broad spectrum of Internet and mobile security products. Its core Internet and mobile security products include 360 Safe Guard and 360 Anti-virus 360 Mobile Safe, 360 Safe Browser, 360 Personal Start-up Page, 360 Application Store and 360 Safebox.In a brilliant strategy move, Qihoo 360 began offering its cloud-based Internet security products for free to users. And this has allowed them to monetize their significant audience through online advertising services, including paid links as well as Internet value-added services, such as offering access to third-party Web games and virtual items.In 2013, the company's launch of a search engine so.com was the game-changer that leveraged its broad reach in China to capture lucrative search market share and advertising dollars. The “360” brand stands for Internet security to the company's users, and these users are a ripe audience for advertisers.But the innovation didn't stop there. In September, the company launched 360 Yingshi Daquan, the mobile version of 360 Video, Qihoo’s video vertical search engine. 360 Yingshi Daquan is a 360 mobile app that enables users to search for and view videos from Qihoo partners on Android based smartphones.What else do Chinese PC and mobile users rely on Qihoo 360 for? Gaming! In an early June research report after meeting with QIHU management, Jefferies analysts noted...Qihoo has ""robust web game growth with strong mobile game player acquisition. Management continues to see a 40%+ organic revenue growth and stable ARPU trend on web games with the majority of the incremental paying gaming accounts attributed to mobile games. The small acquisition of several game companies in early 1Q14 was done to improve Qihoo’s game platform monetization despite their low-margin business profile."" Jefferies has a $150 price target on Qihoo shares.Monetize ThisAs Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) seems to be hitting its stride with mobile ad revenues, many analysts believe bigger success is around the corners for QIHU as well. Here's what Macquarie had to say in late January...We believe Qihoo is seeing solid trends across all its major business lines – directory page ads, mobile app store, search and web gaming. Qihoo remains one of the few platform companies in China that control the bulk of the Internet and mobile Internet traffic, thus future monetization opportunities from the traffic.Controlling ""the bulk"" of Internet and mobile traffic sounds like a pretty good position to be in.According to Bloomberg, ""Alibaba is competing with Tencent Holdings and Baidu for China’s 618 million Internet users by making deals in its home market and the U.S. to extend its e-commerce reach to mobile games and messaging.""“The growth rates sound like they’re pretty positive for the entire sector, for e-commerce. They have a large base, they have the lion’s share of e-commerce in China,” said Stephen Yang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sun Hung Kai Financial Ltd. “For Alibaba itself, how many large cap companies this size are going to get 51 percent growth?”App-etizing GrowthThat is impressive. And it should come as no surprise that the smaller, more nimble Qihoo is growing at high double digits as well, with projected 140% EPS growth in 2014 and 70% growth for next year. So the question becomes ""Can Qihoo keep it up and compete for market share in these areas against the giants?""Macquarie analysts believe the Qihoo App Store is currently the biggest story at Qihoo with its app store having 30% market share in terms of time spent, according to iResearch.They note, ""with the proliferation of apps and mobile games in China and ongoing consolidation of the app distribution channel (e.g. app stores), the balance of power is shifting to the app store side from the developers. We don't believe the recent announcement by Alibaba to take only 20-30% of revenue share compared to the industry norm of 40-50% today will change the industry dynamics as Alibaba does not have critical mass yet in terms of the app store traffic.""The Search QuestionWith a forward P/E multiple now below 30X due to strong quarter-after-quarter of growth, QIHU shares have seen quite a bit of volatility in the past few months as investors and analysts weigh how much of the search market they have. The drop from $120 to $90 has made the risk/reward much more attractive, trading 25% above Baidu's valuation but with double the growth rate.The company claims over 20% market share of search, but some critics say it's probably lower and so not likely on a path to achieving expectations of 30% share that the company projects is possible by the end of this year.But the Macquarie analysts don't see that as the big issue right now. They figure it's a wide, yet growing, range of 15-25% search share right now and leave it at that. Why so sanguine about this key metric?Because they see Qihoo growing revenue share splits on search from the current 2% to as high as 10%, ""especially when it is launching a new keyword bidding system in mid 2014."" And this month brought the launch of Qihoo's new mobile search engine.All in all, the pace of innovation to serve more web users is keeping Qihoo revenues growing at quite a clip. Jefferies analysts project 2014's top line to hit $1.3 billion, 2015 to threaten the $2 billion level, and 2016 to reach $2.7 billion. Here's a look at that top-line growth trajectory which is growing faster than Baidu's current $5.8 billion haul...Bottom line: Qihoo has quickly become a major player in the Chinese web ecosystem because they entrenched themselves as the reliable must-have security provider. Now they just have to keep the bad guys down, the traffic humming, and the innovations rolling to keep growing at high double digits.Disclosure: I own Qihoo 360 (QIHU) shares for the Zacks Follow the Money portfolio."
2506045,22148,2014-09-18T19:09:45-04:00,"Qihoo continues to produce fast growth in several different product categories.Qihoo is behind the curve on the shift to mobile search in China and trails Baidu by a wide margin on search monetization.Stock is attractively priced based on estimates, but concerns exist regarding the future growth potential of the second largest player in Chinese search.","Zillow's (NASDAQ:Z) CEO famously states that his reasoning for ramping up spending and attempting to buy Trulia (TRLA) is that advertising revenue eventually flocks to the dominant player in any industry. By owning Trulia, Zilliow becomes the dominant player in the domestic online real estate market and will in theory grab the advertising spending. The theory is backed by the domestic search market where Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) eventually grabbed the vast majority of the ad revenue. If the dominant player provides access to the majority of users, why advertise on a secondary platform unless rates are lower?These exact scenarios are playing out in the Chinese search market where Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is the dominant leader especially when comparing revenue. Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) has made phenomenal penetration into the PC search market, but the company isn't able to monetize the traffic and has limited mobile traffic despite the effort to ramp up growth. While the stock of Qihoo appears attractive on the surface, the biggest concern has to be that the second largest provider in any sector typically doesn't make for a good investment. The company has some solid opportunities outside search, but the market leadership and defined position isn't easily known in those areas.Strong Q214 ResultsFor those who typically buy into Qihoo 360 due to search revenue growth, people need to understand that the major growth now comes from the mobile game platform. For Q214, revenues for online advertising grew 89% YoY to reach $171.1 million. This revenue category includes search and mobile monetization that isn't clearly defined. The value-added service revenue grew 140% to reach $146.2 million. This segment includes mainly the online game platform.The company claims 496 million users on PC products and 641 million smartphone users on the mobile security product. Along with these large user groups, the company claims a strong user base in personal start-up pages, browsers and mobile app distribution. Unfortunately, the company doesn't break out the revenue by product line other than too break out online advertising versus value-added services.Search Share DebateThe claims on Chinese search are very confusing and typically misleading. Qihoo backs the claim that it now holds 30% of the search queries based on page views and not revenue. The reports from CNZZ suggest that the market share for Baidu is down to only 54.5%, but other outlets suggest the numbers are significantly higher. Regardless, the revenue totals back a Baidu dominated world. The Chinese search leader produces quarterly revenue of over $1.9 billion compared to the $171 million online advertising segment from Qihoo that includes the search product. Citibank analyst Thomas Chong estimated that PC search revenue grew 52% QoQ to reach $62 million. The search number assigned to Qihoo is only a fraction of what Baidu generates on a quarterly basis.Oddly, Qihoo ramped up spending the last couple of years to enter the search market to only miss the shift to mobile. Baidu has outspent the company on mobile and now dominates that market as the iPhone 6 enters the market and China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) implements 4G service. Qihoo must now spend to catch up on mobile. According to China Mobile gateway traffic from June, Baidu has nearly 80% of the market share with Qihoo 360 non-existent.Crashing MarginsAs highlighted in the Baidu quarterly report, margins are crashing in the sector due to the ramped up expenses by both the search leader and Qihoo 360. For the latest quarter, Qihoo reported that non-GAAP operating expenses surged to $182.6 million from only $79.3 million in the prior year period. The costs of revenues are a smaller piece of the total costs, but the numbers surged 273.3% during Q214 to reach $66.6 million.The net margin fell to 21.8%, compared to 33.6% in the same period last year. Importantly though, the number is still substantially positive and compares to the 30% range generated by Baidu. Clearly both companies are fighting over market share in the quick growing Chinese Internet market versus some of the scenarios in the US where companies report substantial losses to gain market share.The interesting part about the margins story is that Qihoo's management suggested during the earnings call that margin pressures would subside by Q4 and into 2015. However, the company proposed ramping up spending on mobile search suggesting the pressures may not subside that quickly.Compelling ValuationQihoo reported EPS of $0.50 and analysts forecast full-year earnings of roughly $2.50 followed by $4.10 in 2015. The stock is very reasonably priced at less than 20x forward earnings and estimates continue to rise. Citigroup analyst Thomas Chong recently placed an EPS estimate of $4.32 for 2015 on the stock and a price target of $118.50.Qihoo continues to crash from the 2014 peak back in March at around $125 despite the recent solid forecasts into 2015 and attractive valuation. The stock even has a precarious looking head and shoulders pattern that is a major concern for lower stock prices.At the same time, Baidu has surged over the summer probably due to the leading position in the mobile search market. Will the divergence continue or reverse going into 2015?QIHU data by YChartsConclusionWhile Qihoo continues to gain market share in PC search, the company hasn't proven that it can attract advertisers at a meaningful rate to adequately monetize that asset. Being the second largest provider in any tech market typically leads to an underperforming asset and less value. The fact that Qihoo has failed to reach the mobile search market and the far flung product set isn't distinguishable, the stock is difficult to own despite the valuation. Too many questions surround the ability to monetize the search market and the failure to focus on the shift to mobile to own the stock now."
2236973,40781,2014-05-26T00:30:22-04:00,"After beating the top and bottom lines over the past three quarters, will Qihoo 360 be able do it once again?Many Chinese companies have reported strong earnings. Is this a telling sign for Qihoo 360?Qihoo 360's past should give investors plenty of confidence heading into earnings on Tuesday.","Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU), a leading Internet company in China, will report its first-quarter 2014 financial results on Tuesday, May 27, 2014, after the close of U.S. markets.Following the results, a conference call will take place at 7:30 a.m. ET on May 28, 2014 (7:30 PM Beijing time on May 28, 2014). A live webcast of the conference call will be available on the investor relations section of Qihoo 360's website. The dial-in details for the conference call can be found here.Last quarter, Qihoo released its fourth-quarter earnings and full-year results. Revenue came well ahead of expectations at $221.6M, beating estimates of $209.7M. On the bottom line, Qihoo achieved EPS of $0.70, easily beating the consensus of $0.43.The report showed continued top-line expansion, driven by performance in online advertising, Internet value-added services as well as PC and mobile games. So how does Qihoo look heading into earnings next week?Based on the latest trends, metrics, and reports, I believe Qihoo is well positioned to deliver another strong earnings beat. This should provide a nice catalyst for investors as shares make their way back into the triple digits. Let's take a look at the numbers that Wall Street expects.Wall Street Expects:So how has the company performed with its past earnings reports? The table below shows Qihoo's top-line numbers over the past five quarters.As you can see, Qihoo has beaten the top line by an average of $7.14M over the last five quarters. Based on strong earnings results from other Chinese companies [Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Vipshop (NYSE:VIPS), YY (NASDAQ:YY), etc.] who have reported thus far in the earnings season, I believe Qihoo is poised to surprise again to the upside.While Qihoo certainly has impressed on the top line, how does the bottom line compare? Looking over the bottom-line figures (""EPS"") we can see that Qihoo has also done a great job over the last couple of quarters, thanks in large part to record top-line growth.After coming in line with estimates during Q1 of last year, Qihoo has stepped up its game and has handily beaten estimates for the past three quarters. In just the last three quarters, Qihoo has beaten EPS by an average of 47.8%. Looking over the last five quarters, Qihoo has beaten estimates by more than 30%.*SourceAs we can see from the graphic above, Qihoo has not only beaten expectations on both the top and bottom lines, but future EPS trends are going up as well. This signals that Qihoo's growth isn't slowing down anytime soon as the company continues to grow revenues at record levels.ConclusionThe bottom line is that Qihoo has proven to shareholders that it can deliver and will likely deliver again. Investors just need to realize beforehand, if those results are already baked into the share price or not. Last quarter was a great example of this as Qihoo delivered strong results, yet shares didn't really pop on the results as shares tumbled more than 30% over the next couple of months.Fast forward three months and shares of Qihoo are trading in double-digit territory, quite a difference from the triple digits just three months ago.So the million dollar question remains, should investors Buy, Sell or Hold shares through Q1 earnings? While anything can happen on earnings day, I think given the 30% fall that Qihoo experienced the last two months, provides investors a great reward to risk ratio at this point.If shares were trading up in the $115-$125 range, then I would have some cause for concern on earnings day. However, seeing as how Qihoo is currently trading at the average market multiple based on 2015 estimates, I feel investors will most likely receive a nice pop on earnings day.Of Wall Street recommendations, the average opinion on Qihoo is a BUY, with an average price target set at $133.00. Based on today's closing price, Qihoo has more than 50% upside.As always, I'm providing you with my track record and other particular stocks that I recommend.

Second quarter revenue was up 109.6% to $317.9 million. Non-GAAP EPS was up 25% to $0.50. The company has significantly increased sales and marketing spending which had a negative effect on margins. Non-GAAP net margin in Q1 was 21.8%, compared to 33.6% in Q2 2013 and 27.7% in the first quarter of 2014. Management guided Q3 revenue between $360 million and $365 million, representing a Y/Y increase of 92% to 94%. The mid-point of the guidance is $5 million higher than the current consensus.Online advertising revenue increased 89% Y/Y to $171.3 million. The strong growth was driven by search and mobile advertising and increased monetization of user activities on 360 Personalized Start-up Pages. Internet value-added service revenue was up 140% Y/Y to $146.2 million. The growth was driven by both PC and mobile games. The growth in both segments decelerated from Q1, when online advertising revenue grew 141% and internet value-added services revenue was up 172%. Qihoo is also taking more search market share from Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). CNZZ reported last week that Qihoo's search market share is now 30.2% in terms of page views. That means that Qihoo is four months ahead of its year-end search market share target. Baidu's share is now 54.5%, down from 67.7% a year ago.Although we did not see a blowout quarter, which was the case in Q1, the results are still quite good and complement my previous bullish thesis. I am reiterating my bullish view and I believe that Qihoo can rise significantly in the next six to twelve months. The company has just started to monetize search, and the growth in the mobile segment is in the early stages. The massive expected growth in the future should translate into a significantly higher share price going forward. Analyst expectations should rise on higher Q3 guidance and we might see upgrades and/or raised price targets, which might move the stock higher in the next couple of weeks. And as I said in my previous article, the latest note offering and a substantial cash position might be used for a large acquisition which might also push the share price higher. Qihoo's growth and future expectations are higher than Baidu's, but the two companies are currently trading at the same forward 2015 P/E. I am bullish on both Qihoo and Baidu, but I believe that Qihoo should outperform Baidu in the next couple of months."
2189133,40031,2014-05-04T04:18:59-04:00,"Both Baidu and Qihoo have fallen since I suggested that selling Qihoo and buying Baidu might be a better way to profit in the future.Since Qihoo has fallen much more than Baidu, the reward/risk proposition has changed and it might be prudent to consider a long position in Qihoo and stay long Baidu.The growth outlook for both companies has improved in the last two months.","In my previous article on Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), I suggested that it might be prudent to sell Qihoo and buy Baidu, as I argued that the reward/risk ratio was on Baidu's side. Since March 10, Baidu has fallen 13%, while Qihoo is down 27%. Although both trades are losers at the moment, Baidu might have saved you more money, or you would have made money if you went long Baidu and short Qihoo. Since Qihoo suffered more, its valuation is now more compelling, and I believe it is a good time to consider a long position in Qihoo.The selloff in the internet names creates a new buying opportunityAs the market went down in the last two months, high-flying internet names were hit the hardest. Baidu and Qihoo are down 15% and 30% respectively from their early March highs, but their fundamental outlook has changed for the better. Baidu reported Q1 earnings that were ahead of estimates, and the growth outlook has improved in the meantime. Baidu's revenue growth has accelerated in the last three quarters, from 41.5% in Q2 2013 to 61.2% in Q1 2014. Earnings per share grew 23% to $1.18 after four quarters of very modest growth. Qihoo is slated to report earnings in two to three weeks, and analysts expect triple digit earnings and revenue growth. Both companies are investing aggressively to capture market share, and have been crossing each others' path on the way, but China's market is big enough for both of them. The mobile segment is deemed the most important right now. In Q1, mobile search was the main driver of Baidu's page view growth, and the company expects it to surpass PC as the biggest source of search traffic later this year. Management is pleased with the progress on mobile monetization but the race is just getting started. As customers see stronger ROI from mobile, the company expects the CPC gap between PC and mobile to continue to narrow.On the other hand, Qihoo's search monetization accounted for 30% of its total business and the number is expected to be higher in the future. Qihoo's search and mobile monetization are ramping up, and the company expects the strong growth to continue.The recent selloff has driven the valuation of both Baidu and Qihoo to a more attractive level, and the reward/risk ratios are more favorable right now. I believe it may be time to consider a long position in both Baidu and Qihoo. Although Baidu enjoys a more favorable valuation, Qihoo's growth levels justify its current premium.Potential upside - both stocks can move higher significantlyIn the table below, you can look at some key growth and valuation metrics for Baidu and Qihoo. The growth outlooks for both companies have improved since my last article, and the valuation is more compelling. For example, Baidu's TTM P/S ratio has contracted from 12.7 to 9.5, and Qihoo's TTM P/S ratio is down from 21.5 to 15.8. On the other hand, Qihoo's forward P/E premium is almost gone, and Qihoo is now trading at a 10% and 20% premium over Baidu.As for the upside potential, I think that both stocks could rise 50% to 70% in the next six to twelve months. As I stated earlier, Baidu could be trading at 11 to 13 times its 2014 sales, which translates into 55% to 85% upside from the current price. Qihoo should retain its higher P/S ratio as it has higher growth rates, and if it retains the current P/S ratio of 15 by the end of 2014, its share price might rise 45%. If the stock rises again to its former P/S ratio highs, the upside could be north of 100%, but I do not think this will be the case, since the growth prospects are not as high as they were in the previous six to twelve months. However, judging from the previous ""beat and raise"" trends, there might be substantial upside for consensus estimates which translates into more upside than I might have anticipated.Source: Yahoo! FinanceAs for the downside, both stocks could fall 20% to 30% from here given the P/S ratio trends over the last year. This would make both stocks quite cheap, as both would be trading at a forward 2015 P/E of 15 to 18, which is quite low given the growth prospects and the secular internet and mobile growth trends in China.Source: ycharts.comConclusionThe recent selloff in the internet segment created some compelling buying opportunities. Baidu and Qihoo have significant growth potential, which should translate into a much higher share price in the next couple of years. Both stocks could rise between 45% and 100% in the next six to twelve months, and the downside should be limited to 20% to 30% and regarded as a solid buying opportunity for long-term investors. This gives investors an asymmetric reward/risk proposition.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in BIDU, QIHU over the next 72 hours.

2126153,54222,2014-04-04T09:57:42-04:00,Qihoo is fast establishing its dominance in the Chinese Internet market with its strong product portfolio.Qihoo has successfully challenged market leader Baidu for market share in the search space.Qihoo's monetization strategies and rapid growth rate make it an attractive investment.,"Qihoo 360 Technology (NYSE:QIHU) has been one of the fastest-growing stocks in recent times. Qihoo's shares have risen more than 200% in the last one year, as the Chinese Internet company has reported rapid growth. Just recently, Qihoo reported its twelfth consecutive quarter of strong growth. The company is engaged in a fight with market leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) to establish its dominance in the Internet industry in China, and it seems to have done well so far.Growing its dominanceQihoo has expanded its leading position in key product categories, and has made significant inroads in new markets. Its monthly active users of PC-based products and services, which cover 94% of the Chinese PC Internet population, have increased to 475 million at the end of 2013.Also, with around 467 million smartphone users for its flagship mobile security product, Qihoo covers approximately 70% of the Chinese smartphone market. So, Qihoo is a fast-growing player in Internet security in China. In addition, monthly active users of its PC browsers are now at 354 million, representing over 70% of the Chinese PC Internet population. Going forward, Qihoo is allocating significant resources to tap the fast-growing mobile Internet market, and is also strengthening its position in the PC Internet market.Qihoo now enjoys 23% of the search traffic in China, substantially exceeding its own internal target. Now, Qihoo is in a solid position to increase its share in China's search market through continued product improvements and technological innovations.Monetization movesQihoo began monetizing its search and mobile products last year, and within a short time, it has made significant progress. The combination of search and mobile monetization should drive substantial long-term growth for Qihoo, since the mobile market is growing at a fast pace.Strength of the monetization process and incremental contribution from search and mobile monetization has resulted in strong online advertising growth for Qihoo, as advertising was up 88% in 2013 as compared to 2012. Also, Internet value-added services are gaining steam, with PC games and a strong ramp-up in mobile games outpacing the market with strong revenue growth. Qihoo's search and mobile monetization are in their nascent stages, so the company is seeing faster ramp-up in these segments.Similarly, Qihoo's gaming platform is also seeing strong growth. Qihoo's total number of paying gaming accounts grew to approximately 700,000 in the fourth quarter of 2013, as compared to 560,000 in the prior quarter. Qihoo has over 800 games running commercially on its game platform, and this is yet another area that's driving the company's growth.Also, Qihoo is making fruitful investments in product and technology development to strengthen its leadership position and expand its footprint, particularly in mobile Internet and search, where there is strong opportunity for future expansion. Meanwhile, Qihoo will continue building its sales and marketing infrastructure to provide support to such enhanced monetization efforts. Such investments should strengthen Qihoo's foundation and help support the growth momentum, and drive long-term growth.Better than BaiduQihoo is engaged in a spending war with China's search leader, Baidu, to capture a bigger market share on both PCs and mobile devices. According to CNZZ, a Chinese research firm, Qihoo's market share has grown to 24.9% of the market in China, while Baidu's has fallen to 58.3%. Just last year, Baidu commanded a 70% share of the Chinese search market, but that has steadily fallen. As Qihoo continues to make more moves in the Chinese search market, Baidu could see its shares tumble further.What's more, Qihoo has successfully managed to monetize its desktop search engine. Desktop search accounted for about 30% of Qihoo's business at the end of 2013, and since the company has continued to report strong gains in market share, this business should grow further.From a valuation perspective, there's no doubt that Qihoo is more expensive when compared to Baidu. Qihoo trades at a trailing P/E ratio of almost 120, while Baidu trades at 32 times earnings. But, on a forward P/E basis, Qihoo's P/E ratio comes down substantially to less than 24. The same is true for Baidu as well, with a forward P/E ratio of just 3.4. However, Baidu's earnings fell slightly in the previous quarter as a result of the various investments that it made.On the other hand, Qihoo's revenue was up a massive 115% in the previous quarter, with earnings growth coming in at an impressive 30.60%. Hence, even though Qihoo is more expensive, its premium is justified, since the company is growing at a rapid rate.ConclusionQihoo has reported rapid growth so far on the back of investments in its various intellectual properties. Its moves have led to strong growth in its business, along with solid share price gains. Going forward, Qihoo is looking to maintain this momentum, and this should lead to market share gains. Hence, investors should consider investing in Qihoo, as it looks like a solid investment and definitely a stronger buy than Baidu that's losing market share.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company operates as a software and Internet service provider, with a core function in security tools of all kinds for computer users, a growing field thanks to more industry attention being given to hackers, snoops, and Internet data interception by illegal groups as well as governments these days.Source: YchartsFinancialsQihoo has been enjoying a significant rise in both gross and net income in the last three years, which has given the company significant cash flow power to grow and solidify its new gains. Rising from a gross revenue and net income of $168 million and $15 million, respectively, in 2011, Qihoo closed out 2013 with a whopping gross revenue of $671 million (an increase of 104% from $329 million in 2012) and a new net income level of $100 million (an increase of 113% from $47 million in 2012), representing a jump 660% in available operating profits.Company management and operations did pick up quite a bit more in short-term debt and costs, but that was to be expected with the increased cash flow availability from new revenues.That said, the company's assets are rising just as fast, easily managing and maintaining the ability to pay down the additional liabilities as needed.Many times companies looking to boost cash flow quickly for big investments start issuing more stock, diluting the interests of those already in play. That hasn't been the case for Qihoo. With 131 million shares outstanding, the company has stayed firm on current ownership share, meaning the gains will continue to directly benefit shareholders that exist.In the last two years, there have been a number of recent insinuations about Qihoo's financials and the integrity of its accounting books. Despite these accusations, Qihoo has responded in detail and with very strong, quantitative reports, shutting down every criticism so far. The response has been so strong, it goes far beyond what has been the average due diligence provided by Chinese companies to American general public analysis.OperationsQihoo represents yet another strong leg of the Chinese technology market that U.S. companies have been frustratingly not been able to penetrate to full domination. While the names of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are ubiquitous with daily computing in the U.S., in China names like Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Qihoo and similar dominate the spectrum.The company originally started as an anti-virus security software producer, but it soon realized that by providing these products for free, it could leverage a large audience for secondary advertising and marketing, producing a far more lucrative revenue stream from other companies wanting to pitch their goods to Chinese audiences. Ergo, the middleman effect became the cash cow for Qihoo very quickly.To emphasize and channel the synergies of all of its own products as well as those marketed by clients, Qihoo continues to direct users through its 360 Browser products which, of course, are free and trigger all the other aspects of the company that actually generate revenue. That traffic is estimated to be well over 450 million subscribers and users as of the end of 2012.Direction PossibilitiesQihoo generally sits in a very comfortable position of heavy cash flow, strong assets over liabilities, a household name recognition among Chinese consumers and audiences, and a strong customer basis, both in clients and subscribers for services. No surprise then, Qihoo's management could just sit back and let the company run on neutral, enjoying the profits and the gains in place. That's unlikely to be the case, however.The company has been enjoying a rise of market share at Baidu's expense, but it still needs to be wary of Google looking for ways to expand its penetration into China. In that respect, Qihoo will likely continue to saddle on new products with a security focus to its customers through its conduit products (i.e. the 360 Browser and similar), taking advantage of its captive market for the recurring revenue streams. That strategy will likely continue to work in the short run.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2047103,54872,2014-02-25T14:32:40-05:00,,"Since outlining the reasons behind the risks and rewards of Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) on 1/26/2014 in a previous article, it has since gained a respectable 20%. Instead of waiting for its upcoming earnings release in early March, investors have decided to push the stock price higher. I will very briefly state four reasons why investors could look forward to another earnings beat.Four Reasons For An Earnings Beat1. Qihoo has beat earnings for the last four quarters. Three of the last four earnings had beat by 100% or more. This is primarily the reason which fueled its 234% rise in the last eight or so months. Although much of the growth has already been priced in, with a 20% or so market share there is still room for growth in the context of the three other reasons stated below.2. The Chinese economy is still growing at a 7.8% clip. It's easier to see this on the ground with more railways being built, subways, roads and buildings. The demands for energy and cars certainly isn't stopping. With an $8 trillion dollar economy growing at that pace, at least on paper, lots of capital is shifting hands or being created. It's not out of the question to see capital flowing out of other emerging markets, or places like Southern Europe, to China due to its low cost manufacturing, relative stability, position relative to the economies of South Korea and Japan and anticipation for future growth which pushes assets higher. Let us not forget that at least a part of China's foreign currency reserves can be used to stimulate the economy but certainly not all of it.3. China's internet user growth, particularly its 3G subscribers, is booming. In another article, I outlined the reasons behind Baidu's (NASDAQ:BIDU) potential growth in China. With around 49% of the country using the Internet, there is room to grow. With more added users and a similar business model, as partly an Internet marketing agency, Qihoo's services increase in value as more participants are added on. Things like tracking and storing data of consumers and their habits has value to other businesses that would like access to that information so they can advertise more efficiently. With 3g subscribers growing 79% in 2013, this is important for Qihoo because not only does it add more traffic to its servers, but it broadens the reach of its advertisements to the rural sectors of the economy where people are not internet users. Since in many places the infrastructure is not built yet to support a landline which allows for internet use, they can surf the web using their mobile devices which may be cheaper. In addition, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was recently added to China Mobile, targeting its 700 million customers. Many of them were waiting to buy an iPhone along with an internet subscription after saving up their hard-earned money.4. Seasonal holiday trends support more use of Qihoo's services. With the holidays - New Year's along with Christmas, which is celebrated in many parts, more people are using their mobile devices to pass time as they travel back home to celebrate the New Year festivities.A Brief ConclusionWith a decent moat, Qihoo has done well in the previous year. It is rather hard to duplicate Qihoo's business model since search engines require the technical capabilities and necessary servers in order to maintain the business. It has also taken on a niche market of providing computer security from viruses.The big question is how much longer will Qihoo's growth continue? More importantly, will the stock price keep going up? In the context of the four points outlined above, there is a decent risk-reward ratio. Even though there is always uncertainty, either investors have set up Qihoo to have a precipitous drop after earnings, or they see potential for its ongoing growth in the context of a developing economy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in QIHU over the next 72 hours.

The stock has appreciated over 400% since the release of so.com, Qihoo's search engine product, in June of 2012. Since the company beat earnings estimates and issued a positive outlook on March 06, Qihoo stock has dropped to a trailing P/E of 127. This presents a rare buying opportunity in a company that saw 100+% revenue and earnings growth in 2013, has dominant and innovative products, and is only beginning to roll out its monetization system. CEO Zhou Hongyi cultivates an innovative and dynamic culture. Check out his microblog if you are interested. In the interest of brevity this article will focus on opportunities in core business lines including anti-virus, search, and app distribution. Be aware that Qihoo is a true platform with browser, gaming, hardware, entertainment and device management offerings too.Highlights from the March 06 earnings release include:- Record Quarterly Revenues of $221.6 million, up 115.3% Year-over-Year- Record Quarterly Non-GAAP Net Income of $96.3 million, up 260% Year-over-Year- Record Full Year Revenues of $671.1 million, up 104.0% Year-over-Year- Record Full Year Non-GAAP Net Income of $226.3 million, up 132.4% Year-over-YearAnti VirusQihoo's core business is the PC Security Defender product. It enjoys 94.6% coverage in the PC market, is free to use, and protects against a wide variety of security threats including viruses, mal-ware and spam. In addition it acts as a portal, raising awareness of the entire 360 product line amongst its 475 million users.Building on its security successes, Qihoo released the Phone Defender in 2006. It is also free to use and acts as a portal to other products. In the last year its user base has more than doubled to exceed 500 million. Despite attempts by Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Tencent (HK.0700) to enter the mobile security market, 360 Phone Defender is the best mobile security software available, and they have the user growth to back it up. As increasing amounts of time and money are spent on mobile devices, security is becoming crucially important. Mobile payments are one opportunity for future growth and cooperation.SearchAfter firmly establishing itself in security, Qihoo made the bold decision in the summer of 2012 to enter the search market. This was a direct challenge to Baidu's monopolistic position in search. Initially, the company's chances of success were written off. Today, so.com's PC search market share (according to CNZZ data) is 25% and rising steadily. Key verticals include web pages, news, maps, medicine, music, and pictures. Baidu margins are collapsing as they try to slow market share erosion.In addition to so.com, Qihoo also operates a mobile content search engine called LeiDian (English translation: Thunder and Lightning). While it is still new, progress has been rapid. The search capabilities are unique and innovative, serving up the content most useful to mobile users. The company is beginning to distribute it across their existing user base.A final strength of Qihoo is in app distribution. With the purchase of 91.com last year, Baidu made an attempt at heading off the 360 App Store. It is proving futile. The 360 App Store continues to out-compete other distribution channels, as evidenced by distribution of top mobile game titles. As other internet players have spent heavily on promoting their mobile apps and games, Qihoo has been a key beneficiary. But more importantly, Qihoo can distribute its own apps for free. This is why the Qihoo software portfolio is so deep and widely used.In conclusion, the recent retrenchment in Qihoo stock may be a buying opportunity. Affiliated advertising agencies now cover all provinces and administrative regions of the PRC. The long-term platform strategy remains intact, and may be accelerating according to the full-year financial results and year-ahead guidance issued March 6th. Then they advised for stable margins and 1Q revenue between $226 million and $228 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 106% to 107%.Disclosure: I am long QIHU.

2160263,50682,2014-04-24T06:53:09-04:00,,"Two of China's fastest-growing tech firms are stepping up their overseas expansion, with word that smartphone sensation Xiaomi is planning a major acceleration of its drive into emerging markets, as security software maker Qihoo 360 (NYSE: QIHU) eyes the U.S. The Xiaomi move looks like a smart one by avoiding developed markets for now, though the rapid speed of the expansion could strain the company's resources. Meantime, the Qihoo move looks mostly like hype, in a bid to prop up its rapidly deflating share price. I also seriously question Qihoo's decision to target such a competitive market like the U.S. for its first move outside China.These latest 2 announcements highlight the pressure that China's privately owned tech firms are feeling to move beyond their home market, which is both highly protected and has also become quite crowded lately. China's only tech firm to do well abroad so far has been PC giant Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY, HKEx: 992), and that company has only succeeded by selling low-cost hardware into developing markets. Internet products and services are much more lucrative, but they are also far more competitive as the Chinese companies have to face global giants like Google (Nasdaq: GOOG, GOOGL), Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Symantec (Nasdaq: SYMC).Let's start our global round-up with Xiaomi, the marketing savvy company which has been relatively low-key since launching its signature smartphones last month in Singapore, the first stop on a global expansion planned for this year. The company broke its weeks of recent silence with a news conference this week where it detailed its roadmap onto the global stage for the rest of the year (English article).That map looks very focused on the developing world, with the company announcing 10 new markets it plans to enter. Those include BRICS countries India, Brazil and Russia, along with Southeast Asian nations Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Vietnam. Rounding out the list is Turkey, whose consumers should also appreciate Xiaomi's high-performance models that carry relatively affordable price tags.In addition to its smartphones, Xiaomi also revealed some other products at the event, including routers and set-top boxes that it hopes will become lucrative new growth areas. One slightly interesting note was the absence of Hugo Barra, who defected from a high-level position at Google last year to head Xiaomi's global expansion. I wouldn't read too much into his absence in the news stories from this latest event, and it's quite possible he was present and just didn't do interviews.Next let's look quickly at a newly announced partnership that will see Qihoo sell its security software and other mobile apps through a partnership with recently-listed mobile game developer Sungy Mobile (Nasdaq: GOMO) (company announcement). The partnership will see Qihoo offer the products over Sungy's mobile app distribution platform, and is targeting key markets including the U.S.I'm not familiar with the reach of Sungy's distribution platform, though the company says in its latest results that a big proportion of its users are from outside its home market. Still, I question whether gamers who are Sungy's main customers will be interested in buying Qihoo's security products, many of which are free and are famous for loading manipulative software onto users' computers.I suspect this latest partnership isn't all that substantive, and is probably more designed to boost Qihoo's stumbling stock. Qihoo's shares tripled last year on big hopes for its fast-growing online search service. But progress in monetizing that business hasn't come so quickly, and the company's shares have recently lost nearly a quarter of their value from a peak last month. Investors didn't seem too excited about this latest announcement, and I expect we could see Qihoo's shares continue their downward track for the next few months.Bottom line: Xiaomi's move into 10 new countries looks smartly targeted at emerging markets, while Qihoo's move into the U.S. looks mostly like hype to support its sagging shares.Disclosure: No positions."

Investor sentiment is of course divided as usual. Facing the likes of Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Google Hong Kong (NASDAQ:GOOG), Sohu (NASDAQ:SOHU), and Yahoo (YHOO), is there any more room for revenue growth? Will consumers use Qihoo instead of Baidu? In my previous article, I outlined the risks and competition Baidu is facing. With a similar business model, there are some risks, but if Qihoo's management can continue their gains in market share, allocate capital correctly, poach talent, increase revenue from advertisement budgets, focus on brand, and customer satisfaction for its products, then there should be considerable success in the future in the context of a developing economy.Overview of Recent News Related to QihooWith the recent slowdown of manufacturing activity leading to a global selloff, investors today ask themselves whether China's GDP growth is sustainable. With continued efforts by the central government to solve their GDP vs. environment dilemma, it seems the only way out is to revise their determined all out effort to charge head-on with economic growth regardless of the environment. There isn't any easy answers to how to fix their environmental woes. It can't be resolved overnight. This isn't just a Chinese issue, however, as investors everywhere worry over manufacturing data.If Qihoo, or Chinese equities, want success in the future, GDP growth is inherently necessary which includes the increased demand for energy that comes along with it. The charts and data does not support the decrease in GDP and that this is happening.Assuming that there is GDP growth and most forecasts aren't abysmally inaccurate, identifying key sectors of the economy and investing in them now should net considerable profits as it becomes a function of growth. That is of course considering other things like if there isn't shareholder dilution. To answer the question of revenue growth or if Qihoo can compete with Baidu and Google Hong Kong we'll have to very trivially look at future GDP growth, future revenue growth, and future market share. After considering these three issues a better long-term picture should arise in the minds of investors on the future prospects of Qihoo.Another issue which keeps investors away from Chinese equities is the perception of lax accounting standards. Interestingly enough in addition, there was a new report today that mostly US accounting firms were suspended from auditing US listed Chinese tech companies by the SEC for accounting issues. This is likely a pitched battle by regulators over unfair business practices and different standards. It is certainly an issue to pay attention to as it has given many companies a decent 4% haircut.Just a few days prior, two members of Qihoo's board were or will be ousted as one resigned and another will resign in May. There was speculation as to why two board members would resign from a company that is seemingly on an exciting upswing. Their replacements should have the interest of shareholders in mind which includes following accounting standards which will give investors confidence in light of recent news.Following rumors of an increased stake by the Chinese internet/e-commerce giant Alibaba, Qihoo soared 10% on 1/08/2014. On 1/09/2014, it had a precipitous hangover which dropped the stock down 10%. Qihoo has started the year off well with a 18% gain.The Online Advertising Market Is Still GrowingQihoo generates revenue mostly from online marketing services and advertisements that come from a portion of their clients' advertisement budgets. This is directly related to how well businesses are doing and how much they are willing to commit in terms of expenses. This could be related to GDP. The latest data on online advertising revenue in China indicates that the market is still growing rapidly. Recent Q3 revenue increased 30% year over year to almost $4.4 billion. Data on the online advertising market has been great for search engines like Qihoo.Baidu is of course still the leader of the pack of Chinese internet companies. If Qihoo can continue gaining market share or even hold onto what it has right now it will bode well for investors in the future if the market for online advertisement continues with its current trend in growth.Revenue Growth and Market ShareFrom January to July is where we see a spike in revenue and EPS growth which fueled the 200% climb to around $90. Since September, Qihoo has traded sideways as investors wait on earnings in March. In order for Qihoo to move higher, it has to gain a bigger share of the online advertising market through winning over clients and increasing the value of its services by having a larger internet user base to advertise to. It will move higher if it gains a larger market share, more investors, or releases a new product.Not many investors had faith in Qihoo at the start of last year as Baidu certainly was king of the Chinese internet search realm. Since then it has lost almost 20% of its market share to its competitors. Qihoo now has a sizable 22% of the market similar to the market share Bing has in the US economy. Qihoo's management has high hopes for 2014 as they have publicly stated that they will reach 35% by the end of the year. It will be a battle to win over the hearts and minds of Chinese internet users, or even those in Korea, Taiwan, or South East Asia. At current prices, it is not likely that the market has priced in online advertising budgets several years down the road.ConclusionQihoo has to maintain or grow its market share to see further success. Given the unpredictability of technology, consumer satisfaction, habits, and how products are advertised is key. It is hard to predict winners in the technology space given Qihoo was a dark horse candidate and Baidu the clear frontrunner at the start of last year. These two companies dominate the Chinese internet search engines.Qihoo is in a great position to grow profits if China's online advertising market and internet continues to grow in the future. There has been major gains in a relatively short period of time. Those who have missed out in the great run at the start of the middle of last year are likely to remain in the sidelines. The future is always uncertain and it's not clear whether Qihoo has a business model that will do well in the future. Current investor sentiment is that some are still fully invested while others have taken some profits off the table. Many are willing to jump back on before earnings in March in the $70-$80 range if they have confidence in Qihoo's management and if the management is able to maintain their market share which their revenues rest upon.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1959221,50682,2014-01-22T08:11:51-05:00,,"Normally the sudden resignation of a quarter of a company’s board would ring alarm bells for many investors, but just the opposite seems to be the case for controversial software security specialist and rising online search star Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU). The company’s shares jumped nearly 6 percent during the latest trading session in New York, and then managed to maintain most of those gains even after it announced the resignation of 2 of its 9 directors after the market closed. But that kind of performance seems normal for Qihoo these days, as investors buy heavily into the bullish growth story for its search business and ignore a number of potential warning signs, including these latest resignations.Qihoo’s shares moved on a steady upward trajectory last year, more than tripling as the company’s recently launched So.com search engine made steady gains against dominant industry leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). Qihoo’s service had already gained more than a fifth of the market by the end of last year, and just last week the company bullishly proclaimed it was aiming for more than a third of the market by the end of 2014. All of this comes despite the fact that Qihoo has yet to make much money from its search business, though investors are hoping that will change soon.Against that backdrop, the latest resignation of 2 of Qihoo’s 9 directors certainly looks a little strange. After all, why would directors want to leave this kind of red-hot company with such good future prospects? But then again, Qihoo is not your ordinary fast-climber, and its Chinese name that translates to “strange tiger” is perhaps quite appropriate here.According to the latest company announcement, 2 directors, Hong Chuan Thor and Shujun Li, have both resigned for “personal reasons.” (company announcement) Both men come from private equity and investment advisory backgrounds, and the pair collectively represented one-third of the 6 independent directors on Qihoo’s board.Interestingly, the names of both were still present on Qihoo’s website when the announcement came out, indicating that perhaps the resignations were sudden rather than a planned move. Also interestingly, Thor was chairman of Qihoo’s corporate governance committee, while Li was a member of its audit committee, possibly the chairman, based on the wording of the announcement. While Thor will leave immediately, Li’s resignation won’t become effective until after the company files its annual report on May 1.I don’t know how other people might interpret this development, but to me it seems to have red flags all over it. The resignations seem to imply there was some kind of disagreement between these 2 directors about Qihoo’s financial statements and also its corporate governance, which is never a good sign. That’s especially relevant following a steady stream of short-seller reports and even an article in Forbes magazine over the last 2 years questioning the accuracy of Qihoo’s financial statements. To its credit, Qihoo has managed to defend itself after each attack and rather than falling, its shares keep climbing to new highs.I’ve long said I suspect there’s at least some truth to some of the reports, since Qihoo is known for its aggressive business tactics in general. I’ve also said several times the company’s shares could be due for a correction, following their recent run-up that has made them quite expensive with a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 100. I still believe that such a correction is due, possibly later this year. But that said, I also suspect investors will probably just dismiss these latest board resignations the same way they have already ignored all the other warning signs about this strange company.Bottom line: The sudden resignation of 2 of Qihoo’s independent directors hints at internal disagreement over the company’s finances, but is likely to be ignored as unimportant by bullish investors.Disclosure: None"
1868181,50682,2013-11-29T02:38:45-05:00,,"Software security specialist Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) has become the latest Chinese web firm to launch a major reorganization lately, joining names like Alibaba, Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) in trying to rationalize companies whose rapid growth in the last 5 years has made them unwieldy and sometimes chaotic. This wave of reorganizations reflects the fact that these Internet giants of today look quite different from the companies they were just 5 or 6 years ago. Nearly all the big names have entered numerous new areas outside their original core businesses, even though most lacked the corporate structure to integrate so many different units.From an observer’s perspective, this wave of reorganizations looks both encouraging but also a little worrisome. It’s encouraging that these companies realize they have become too big and require new structures to try and improve the efficiency of their operations. But it’s also a bit alarming, since such restructurings represent an admission of chaos and lack of efficiency inside many of these companies due to their recent rapid growth. Such major overhauls are also quite difficult to execute well.Qihoo reflects the larger group, both in terms of the its size and business. The company’s shares have risen more than 5-fold over the last 12 months, with its market value now just under $10 billion. It has also expanded rapidly outside its original business of making security software for PCs. Most notably, it entered the online search business last year, and has rapidly picked up market share on industry leader Baidu. At the same time, the company is making a major push into the mobile business, mimicking moves by most of China’s other major Internet companies.With so many new businesses and initiatives on its radar screen, it’s not surprising to learn that the company has recently undergone a major restructuring that has seen it separate itself into 2 broad areas, one focused on products and services for traditional desktop PCs and the other on wireless. (English article; Chinese article) As part of the overhaul, the company’s controversial founder Zhou Hongyi will personally assume control of the wireless part of the business.Industry watchers will recall that Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu have all undergone major similar restructurings over the past 2 years. In Baidu’s case, founder Robin Li personally took over the head of the company’s wireless business, in a move that looks almost identical to Qihoo’s. (previous post) In Alibaba’s case, founder Jack Ma also formally stepped aside as head of day-to-day operations by naming a new CEO, and said he would focus on broader strategic initiatives in the future like mobile and social network.Qihoo is a bit later than the other companies in launching its overhaul, though the company’s growth has also come a bit later than the others. Zhou’s decision to focus on mobile looks like a good move, as the mobile Internet is clearly a major trend as a growing number of Chinese access the web over their smartphones. Like Jack Ma and Robin Li, I have no doubt that Zhou will remain very active in his company and will also remain a controversial character for aggressive business tactics.So, what do I think of this overhaul for Qihoo? The timing does seem quite good, as Qihoo is making this move much earlier than Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, which were all much bigger and had many more businesses when they launched their reorganizations. Thus the overhaul, if executed well, could position Qihoo to function more efficiently in the future if and when its fast-growing search business starts to earn some major revenue. The major potential downside for the company will be Zhou himself, as this controversial figure’s fondness for confrontation and pushing boundaries could ultimately land both him and Qihoo in legal or regulatory trouble.Bottom line: Qihoo’s reorganization looks well timed and could position the company to operate more efficiently as it enters a new high-growth period.Disclosure: None."
1861401,40031,2013-11-25T11:10:32-05:00,,"Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) delivered Q3 earnings and revenue ahead of estimates, and guided for Q4 revenue above analyst expectations. Revenue growth accelerated to 124% on increased monetization in all of its segments, and a significant ramp-up in search monetization. Qihoo gained search market share ahead of expectations, and the company already achieved the year-end traffic share goal. I am confident in the company's future prospects, and believe that Qihoo's share price will continue to outperform Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) in the next couple of quarters.Q3 highlightsQihoo reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.47, ahead of analyst estimates for $0.37, and 135% higher than Q3 2012. Revenue increased 124% to $187.9 million, $6.1 million above consensus estimates. This was the second consecutive quarter of revenue growth acceleration, after 58% revenue growth in Q1 2013 and 108% in Q2. Non-GAAP operating and net margin expanded 750 and 390 basis points to 35.5% and 32.7% respectively over Q3 2012.Earnings and revenue beat are the result of broad strength of all of the business segments. Online advertising revenue increased 107% to $120.7 million on increased monetization and further development from both search and mobile monetization. Management noted that Qihoo's search market share already reached the year-end target. Internet value-added services revenue grew 163% year-over-year on strong momentum in mobile games, with solid growth in paying games user base and an expanded games portfolio.Some of the other important metrics in Q3 include:- User penetration of Qihoo's PC-based products was 94% in September 2013, compared to 95% in September 2012.- Total smartphone users of 360 Mobile Safe reached 408 million in September 2013, compared to 149 million in September 2012.- User penetration of Qihoo 360's browsers was 69% in September 2013, compared to 65% in September 2012.Qihoo had over $1 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of Q3. Cash balance increased significantly due to strong operating cash flow in the quarter and the net proceeds of the note offering, which accounted for the most of the increase. Given the company's already strong cash position, the company will probably use the cash to make an acquisition.Taking market share from competitorsAccording to CNZZ, a third-party internet data research firm, Qihoo's search market share in October was 23% in terms of number of unique visitors. This is a 4% increase over the September numbers. The increase comes at the expense of its competitors: Baidu, Sogou (NASDAQ:SOHU), and Tencent's (OTCPK:TCEHY) Soso. Qihoo now also has the largest Android-based app distribution platform in China, with 29% market share, ahead of Baidu's 24% and Tencent's 6%.Qihoo will continue to outperform BaiduQihoo is up 178% year-to-date, while Baidu is up 56%. While I believe that both stocks have great growth potential in the future, I still believe that Qihoo's share price will outperform Baidu in the next 6-12 months. This is based on the strong earnings and revenue growth momentum, as well as market share gains over Baidu and Qihoo's leading position in the mobile segment. Although Qihoo is trading at a significant premium over Baidu, the valuation seems more than justified when you compare the growth levels.(Click to enlarge)QIHU data by YChartsConclusionI remain positive on Qihoo, and believe that it will outperform Baidu in the next 6-12 months. Qihoo's growth rates outpace Baidu's, and its search market share gains and the leadership role in the mobile segment position the company to grow ahead of Baidu in the future. Earnings and revenue are growing ahead of expectations, and the company is executing its growth strategy very well. Strong cash balance and the note offering may be used for a meaningful acquisition in the near term and might serve as another catalyst for further price appreciation.Disclosure: I am long QIHU.

1879431,50682,2013-12-05T07:35:16-05:00,,"Top executives at controversial software security maker Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) have been blitzing cyberspace these past few days with a campaign to convince the world that it’s suddenly become a defender of justice and occupier of the moral high ground. This sudden offensive almost looks coordinated, with Qihoo aiming its newest assaults at 3 of its favorite targets, search leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), top social networking firm Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY) and fast-rising super-cool smartphone maker Xiaomi.I’ll start off by saying I highly doubt the sincerity of Qihoo’s new attempt to convince the world of its new virtuosity. I wrote earlier this year that perhaps the company was opening a new chapter after it signed a major government contract, in an attempt to break with its past reputation for underhanded and even illegal business tactics. (previous post) But I’ll admit my analysis was premature, and Qihoo will have a very hard time changing its reputation under its current leadership.All that said, let’s look at the latest inflammatory words coming from this “Strange Tiger”, which is what Qihoo means in English. We’ll begin with Qihoo’s chief himself, the outspoken Zhou Hongyi, who tried to soften his tone last week with words of thanks on his Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) Weibo on the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday. (microblog post) In his somewhat bland post, Zhou thanks Qihoo’s loyal users, as well as competitors that force his company to continually improve itself.Zhou is not quite so benevolent in another post, which is really a re-post from an official Qihoo account criticizing monopolies that stifle innovation. (microblog post) Anyone who follows the company will know that’s a reference to Qihoo’s lawsuit against Tencent, which is being heard on appeal in Beijing after a Guangdong court ruled in Tencent’s favor earlier this year. While Zhou was circumspect about the case last week, his vice president Qu Bing was a bit more vocal with a couple of rants that directly blasted Tencent for operating a monopoly in the instant messaging space. (microblog post)Frankly speaking, I’ll admit that I tend to side with Qihoo in this case. Tencent really does have a stranglehold on China’s instant messaging market, first with its popular QQ desktop product and now with its equally popular WeChat mobile service. It will be interesting to see what the courts rule this time in Beijing, which is far removed from the courtroom in Tencent’s home province of Guangdong where the original hearing took place. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Beijing court rule at least partially in Qihoo’s favor this time.Outside its Tencent feud, Qihoo also had sharp words for Baidu. In this case the words came from another top company manager Wang Erfei, who posted a mini tirade accusing Baidu of using underhanded tactics to smear Qihoo’s name. (microblog post) This kind of accusation is somewhat ironic coming from Qihoo, which is famous for similar practices. It’s also part of a recent feud that includes a string of lawsuits between the 2 companies, including one in October where Qihoo accused Baidu of unfair competition. (previous post) The subtext to all this is that Qihoo last year launched one of the first serious assaults in years on Baidu’s industry-leading search business, and now the pair are fighting a dirty war for dominance in the space.Last but not least, Qihoo also leveled criticism at Xiaomi, with the assault this time coming from Qihoo analyst Mi Xiaobin. In his post, Mi is critical of Xiaomi’s recent entry into the wireless router space. (microblog post) His post implies that Xiaomi is simply copying a similar move earlier this year by Qihoo, which launched its own routers in June. (previous post) It’s slightly strange that Mi seems to criticize Xiaomi’s low price tag of 799 yuan ($130) for its routers, since Qihoo’s own routers reportedly were selling for just 99 yuan. But Qihoo isn’t always a logical creature, and it’s quite possible this strange tiger is worried that wireless web surfers may prefer Xiaomi’s “cool” image to Qihoo’s reputation as a stealthy and often ruthless predator.Disclosure: None"
1823542,50682,2013-11-08T14:22:20-05:00,,"Online search aspirant Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) is back in the headlines, this time by boosting its targets as it gains ground on market leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). At the same time, the company is also watching its flank, launching a new war of words against a new potential rival from the newly formed combination of Sohu's (NASDAQ:SOHU) Sogou search engine and Tencent's (OTCPK:TCEHY) Soso. From a tactical standpoint, this kind of attack on current and future rivals probably looks like a smart move. But from a more practical standpoint, these kinds of assaults are unlikely to have any real effect on Qihoo's search business; instead such acts of aggression give off a signal of slight desperation as Qihoo tries to justify the recent run-up in its share price resulting from hype about its year-old So.com search engine.Qihoo is probably feeling pressure to show some financial rewards from the rapid rise of So.com, which controlled around 21 percent of China's search market in October about a year after its launch, according to traffic monitor CNZZ. (English article) I should quickly add here that I'm just slightly suspicious of those numbers, since Baidu referral traffic to my own website currently outpaces So.com referrals by a huge factor, something like 25 Baidu referrals for each So.com referral.But let's look past those figures and zero in on the latest news, which has a Qihoo executive saying the strong October results have prompted his company to raise its target from a previous 20 percent to a new 25 percent of China's search market by the end of this year. (English article) Qihoo previously said it aims to control 30 percent of China's search market by the end of 2014, and 40 percent by the end of 2015. By comparison, Baidu controlled about 63 percent of China's search market in October, and Sogou and Soso combined controlled 13 percent.Qihoo's shares have tripled this year on high hopes for So.com. The company has yet to announce a reporting date for its third-quarter results, but acknowledged in its last report that monetization of its search business remains in the nascent stages. I suspect we won't see much contribution from search when the company does report its third quarter results, most likely later this month. While that's not a huge surprise, it could also explain why Qihoo is doing so much to focus attention on other matters in the search space.One of those matters has Qihoo launching a new assault on Sogou, accusing the Sohu search engine of secretly collecting user data. (Chinese article) I find it somewhat humorous that Qihoo actually held a news conference to announce its discovery, which marks the latest move in a colorful war between the 2 companies. Qihoo was in talks to buy Sogou earlier this year, but ultimately lost that contest when Sohu wisely opted to sell a strategic stake of itself to Tencent. After that happened, Sohu sued Qihoo of using unauthorized means to secretly change settings on people's computers to make Qihoo their default web browser instead of Sogou. (previous post)This latest allegation by Qihoo shows the war of words between the 2 companies is likely to continue for a while. Qihoo is no stranger to such hostility, and is also currently embroiled in a series of lawsuits also with Baidu. (previous post) All of this looks at least partly like a diversion by Qihoo to hide its lack of progress in monetizing So.com. Investors may be realizing that too, as Qihoo's shares have tumbled 13 percent over the last 3 trading sessions amid a broader sell-off for many Chinese tech shares. Look for more downward pressure on Qihoo stock in the months ahead, as investors get tired of all the rhetoric and grow impatient for some real results.Bottom line: Qihoo's raising of its search targets and new allegations against Sogou look aimed in part at diverting attention from its slow progress in monetizing its search business."
1996021,20568,2014-02-05T13:40:29-05:00,,"With the coming IPO of China's largest e-commerce portal, Alibaba, investors are looking for more ways to play the massive growth of the world's largest common-language/culture Internet market. Alibaba, who is still owned 24% by Yahoo (YHOO), last week posted a big quarterly profit gain -- its fourth straight -- of $792 million on sales that surged 51% to $1.78 billion.Until that potential IPO of the ""Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of China,"" which is projected to be valued at as much as $190 billion, I am buying a young upstart in the Chinese web jungle: Qihoo 360 Technology (NYSE:QIHU), the country's largest Internet security provider, with over 461 million monthly active users, representing a penetration rate of 96% in the biggest web market.I first wrote about QIHU last September when I saw them taking the #2 spot in search next to the giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) ...The Story is OutQihoo 360 Technology offers a broad spectrum of Internet and mobile security products. Its core Internet and mobile security products include 360 Safe Guard and 360 Anti-virus 360 Mobile Safe, 360 Safe Browser, 360 Personal Start-up Page, 360 Application Store and 360 Safebox.In a brilliant strategy move, Qihoo 360 began offering its cloud-based Internet security products for free to users. And this has allowed them to monetize their significant audience through online advertising services, including paid links as well as Internet value-added services, such as offering access to third-party Web games and virtual items.In 2013, the company's launch of a search engine so.com was the game-changer that leveraged its broad reach in China to capture lucrative search market share and advertising dollars. The “360” brand stands for Internet security to the company's users, and these users are a ripe audience for advertisers.But the innovation didn't stop there. In September, the company launched 360 Yingshi Daquan, the mobile version of 360 Video, Qihoo’s video vertical search engine. 360 Yingshi Daquan is a 360 mobile app that enables users to search for and view videos from Qihoo partners on Android based smartphones.What else do Chinese PC and mobile users rely on Qihoo 360 for? Gaming! Here's how one analyst characterized the growth potential based on data last summer ...Monetize ThisAs Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) seems to be hitting its stride with mobile ad revenues, many analysts believe bigger success is around the corners for QIHU as well. Here's what Macquarie had to say in late January ...Controlling ""the bulk"" of Internet and mobile traffic sounds like a pretty good position to be in.According to Bloomberg, ""Alibaba is competing with Tencent Holdings (OTCPK:TCEHY) and Baidu for China’s 618 million Internet users by making deals in its home market and the U.S. to extend its e-commerce reach to mobile games and messaging.""“The growth rates sound like they’re pretty positive for the entire sector, for e-commerce. They have a large base, they have the lion’s share of e-commerce in China,” said Stephen Yang, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Sun Hung Kai Financial Ltd. “For Alibaba itself, how many large cap companies this size are going to get 51 percent growth.”App-etizing GrowthThat is impressive. And it should come as no surprise that the smaller, more nimble Qihoo is growing at high double digits as well, with projected 80% EPS growth in 2014. So the question becomes ""Can Qihoo keep it up and compete for market share in these areas against the giants?""Macquarie analysts believe the Qihoo App Store is currently the biggest story at Qihoo with its app store having 30% market share in terms of time spent, according to iResearch.They note, ""with the proliferation of apps and mobile games in China and ongoing consolidation of the app distribution channel (e.g. app stores), the balance of power is shifting to the app store side from the developers. We don't believe the recent announcement by Alibaba to take only 20-30% of revenue share compared to the industry norm of 40-50% today will change the industry dynamics as Alibaba does not have critical mass yet in terms of the app store traffic.""The Search QuestionWith a forward P/E multiple maintaining below 60X due to quarter-after-quarter of growth, QIHU shares have seen quite a bit of volatility in the past few months as investors and analysts weigh how much of the search market they have.The company claims over 20% share, but some critics say it's probably lower and so not likely on a path to achieving expectations of 30% share that the company projects is possible by the end of this year.But the Macquarie analysts don't see that as the big issue right now. They figure it's a wide, yet growing, range of 15-25% search share right now and leave it at that. Why so sanguine about this key metric?Because they see Qihoo growing revenue share splits on search from the current 2% to as high as 10%, ""especially when it is launching a new keyword bidding system in mid 2014.""Bottom line: Qihoo has quickly become a major player in the Chinese web ecosystem because they entrenched themselves as the reliable must-have security provider. Now they just have to keep the bad guys down, the traffic humming, and the innovations rolling to keep growing at high double digits.Disclosure: I own Qihoo 360 (QIHU) shares for the Zacks Follow the Money portfolio."

The company also guided Q1 2014 revenue ahead of consensus. Qihoo posted another quarter of triple digit earnings and sales growth and continued to gain search market share, which stood at 23% in Q4. However, the stock paused and reversed lower after the earnings report. A possible area of concern is that daily unique browser home page visitors averaged 119 million in Q4, down 7 million sequentially, and home page daily clicks were flat sequentially. Although there is more good news than bad news, the stock itself might be ahead of itself, and may pullback and consolidate in the next couple of weeks or months. The company's valuation is quite high at the moment, and although revenue and earnings are growing in triple digits, the latest move may be overdone. I would at least take partial profits here if I were long Qihoo, and invest the money in Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), which might perform better in the next couple of months.Q4 highlightsQihoo posted another quarter of triple digit earnings and revenue growth. Q4 EPS was $0.70, a 218% increase over Q4 2012 and $0.27 ahead of analyst estimates. Revenue increased 115.3% to $221.6 million, and was $11.9 million above consensus. Online ad revenue increased 113% Y/Y to $142.4 million, while Internet value-added service revenue rose 124% to $78.9 million.The company stated that, according to third party data, it had 23% search market share in Q4. Management also said that it aims to have 30% of the search market by the end of 2014.While the results were overwhelming, market reaction was muted. It seems that the news was priced in. There is also one area of concern. Daily unique browser home page visitors in Q4 were at 119 million, up 28 million year-over-year, but down 7 million from Q3. And home page daily clicks averaged 681 million, up 231 million from Q4 2013, but flat sequentially. But, overall, the company is doing great, and its market share gains and strong growth have been reflected by the surging share price.Time to take profits (and go long Baidu)?I wrote my first article on Qihoo in March 2013, and the company was in the early stage of search market penetration, and the share price was around $32. The stock has risen almost 300% since, and I believe it may be prudent to take some profits off the table, and perhaps, use the gains to buy Baidu, which is more fairly valued. Baidu's recent efforts and accelerated revenue growth make the stock even more attractive at current levels. In my November article on Qihoo, I stated that Qihoo will continue to outperform Baidu, as its growth levels and market share gains might propel the stock even higher. Qihoo is up 46% since, while Baidu is up 16%. While Baidu's earnings growth was almost flat in recent quarters because of increased investments, it resulted in accelerated revenue growth and the company made significant progress in mobile monetization, which stood at 20% of total revenue in Q4. Earnings growth is expected to pick up significantly in 2015, and Baidu's current valuation makes it a more attractive trade at the moment, although Qihoo's premium over Baidu is partly deserved on much higher growth. Qihoo's share price is extended after a 50% run in the last two months, while Baidu is just attempting to break out from its two-month consolidation.Source: Yahoo! FinanceSource: Stockcharts.comHowever, given the recent momentum, I would not be surprised if Qihoo continues to go higher. It currently trades at a 2014 P/S ratio of 15.4 and may move close to a P/S ratio of 20, implying 30% more upside from here. Still, I believe that Baidu has more upside. If Qihoo is to attain a 2014 P/S ratio of 20, Baidu could easily be trading at 12 or 13 times its 2014 sales, which translates into 40% to 50% upside. Baidu has been trading in a TTM P/S range between 11 and 13 in the last six months, and there may be room for the ratio to expand on accelerated revenue growth, which would translate into more upside than I anticipated.ConclusionAlthough Qihoo posted very strong Q4 numbers last week, its share price is extended and vulnerable to a pullback. Worries about a sequential decline in browser users might weigh on the share price. On the other hand, Baidu's recent efforts on the mobile front and accelerating revenue growth are encouraging, and Baidu may outperform Qihoo in the following weeks/months.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in BIDU over the next 72 hours.

1710632,20568,2013-09-24T12:04:39-04:00,,"Looking for the next Internet search portal to take market share from Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU)? Look no further than Qihoo 360 Technology (NYSE:QIHU).Qihoo 360 is the largest Internet security provider in China, with over 461 million monthly active users, representing a penetration rate of 96% in arguably the world's largest web market. That's right. You are talking about the largest common-language/culture Internet market in the world and QIHU is now the No. 2 portal.With that kind of access to the Chinese market, why haven't we heard of this $7 billion upstart before as a threat to Baidu? And where does the search element come in?The Story Is OutQihoo 360 Technology offers a broad spectrum of Internet and mobile security products. Its core Internet and mobile security products include 360 Safe Guard and 360 Anti-virus 360 Mobile Safe, 360 Safe Browser, 360 Personal Start-up Page, 360 Application Store and 360 Safebox.In a brilliant strategy move, Qihoo 360 began offering its cloud-based Internet security products for free to users. And this has allowed them to monetize their significant audience through online advertising services, including paid links as well as Internet value-added services, such as offering access to third-party Web games and virtual items.More recently, the company's launch of so.com, its Internet search engine, is the game-changer for the company as it leverages its broad reach in China to capture lucrative search market share. The ""360"" brand stands for Internet security to the company's users, and these users are a ripe audience for advertisers. Take a look at how savvy (and China-connected) investors tripled QIHU shares in the past five months after the launch of so.com, once they realized the growth potential:Mobile Search and GamingEarlier this month, the company launched 360 Yingshi Daquan, the mobile version of 360 Video, Qihoo's video vertical search engine. 360 Yingshi Daquan is a 360 mobile app that enables users to search for and view videos from Qihoo partners on Android based smartphones.Like Qihoo's 360 Mobile assistant, the new mobile app will serve as a mobile traffic hub for the company, attracting mobile users who ultimately can be monetized by the company. According to CNNIC (China Internet Network Information Center), during the first half 2013 there were 160 million Internet users accessing online video using mobile devices in China -- a 34.4% utilization rate. As mobile devices evolve with new technologies including larger screens, video will continue to be in great demand among mobile users.What else do Chinese PC and mobile users rely on Qihoo 360 for? Gaming! Here's how one analyst characterized the growth potential: ""We believe Qihoo possesses a solid mobile search entry point supported by the strong distribution capability of its app store which is ranked no. 1 with 21.6% market share by number of times used in July, according to iResearch. For example, number of downloads of 'Plant Vs. Zombie 2' reached 10mn in 36 hours on 360 mobile assistant, compared to 25mn downloads in two months on iOS app stores.""Rich Valuation, Compelling OpportunityThere is no doubt that QIHU shares ran quickly to near full valuation (average analyst target price is $100) once the story was out that they were grabbing significant search engine traffic from Baidu. The leader currently owns over 60% of the market, while the newcomer is pushing 20%.I recommended this stock three weeks ago in the low $80s as an aggressive growth and trading opportunity. It traded back above $90 and has since come off a bit. For investors, keep an eye on the earnings momentum. After their last earnings report, which beat consensus estimates by 100% (just like the previous three quarters), analysts bumped next year from $1.26 to $1.55 -- that's 80%-plus year-over-year growth.At $85, that's also a forward P/E of 55X. But if the aggressive growth trends of QIHU keep muscling in on Baidu's turf, this company may sustain that multiple.Apple: Free Stock Analysis Report (email registration required)Baidu: Free Stock Analysis Report (email registration required)Google: Free Stock Analysis Report (email registration required)Qihoo 360: Free Stock Analysis Report (email registration required)"
1693402,24466,2013-09-13T13:41:44-04:00,,"Qihoo 360 Technology (NYSE:QIHU) stock has given a return of ~228% ytd compared to ~48% return on Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and the market return of ~20%. Qihoo is a leader in PC security and browsers. Apart from the PC security, the company also got good traction in mobile security and the mobile apps store. Company revenue was up by 108% year on year. The growth resulted from its mobile apps, its online game and search engine.Strong presence in the security marketThe company's core Internet security product and services has shown steady growth and by June 2013 its user base has increased 96% in the PC segment and 70% in the smartphone segment. The PC segment has grown from 94% to 96% year over year, while smartphone users have increased from 120 million to 338 million in the same time horizon. With the increase in the smartphone usage in China, the company will be able to increase its security product and services in the smartphone space. This will help the company cross-sell its services, such as browsers, directory page, and app store to the user, and increase its revenue.Sogou acquisition boosts the search engine revenue for QihooChinese search market is dominated by local player Baidu, which has around ~67% of the total search traffic. Qihoo is the second-largest player in the Chinese search market. Google's exit from the Chinese market has created an opportunity for Qihoo to gain market share in the search market and narrow the gap with Baidu. In the last one year since Qihoo has launched its own search engine, the company has been gaining market share from Baidu. As measured by page views, Qihoo's market share has increased from 15.8% in June 2013 to 17.5% in August 2013. The company is in talks to acquire Sogou, which will help increase its market share in the search engine business. This will help it to pose a real threat to Baidu as the major search engine player. The acquisition will also help increase its revenue and margin. The company's search engine can become an effective alternative to Baidu and can gain a market share of about 30% in the short term.Gaming and Mobile will drive future growthAs of June 2013, there are about 270 games commercially running on the Qihoo platform, including both mobile and PC games. The number of paying gaming accounts increased to 444,000 compared to ~ 360,000 in the prior quarters. I expect that the mobile gaming and mobile ads will be the future source of revenue as the smartphone use in China is growing at a rapid pace. The company has also tested its new mobile search engine ""Leidian"" in June. Leidian is a combination of a traditional search box with a navigation page to enable one-click access. I believe that mobile ads can contribute significant near-term revenue growth, while mobile search/commerce are long-term growth drivers.ValuationIf we compare these key metrics, Qihoo is trading at a premium to its peers in both search engine and internet platform provider areas. But, given the active user and the scope to cross-sell its product to the existing members, I believe the stock is correctly priced.ConclusionThe revenue model of Qihoo 360 lies between that of TENCENT Technology Co. and Baidu Inc. The main source of revenue is games because more than half of revenue comes from them. Baidu Inc. obtained a long-term impetus from advertising of searching and site navigation. So, Qihoo 360 has become the rivals to these companies in the respective fields. I believe that with the possible acquisition of Sogou, Qihoo further will strengthen its position in the search engine area. The growth in the mobile segment is very impressive, and with new apps and search engines it can further consolidate its number one position in the mobile segment. So, I believe the stock is fairly priced at current value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1575722,39791,2013-07-26T11:25:58-04:00,,"Qihoo360 (NYSE:QIHU) has become the No.2 search engine in China growing at a fast pace over the last few years and is now starting to pressure the market leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). The company started out by selling a mobile browser and leveraged its market lead in the mobile browser space to become a top search engine provider. The search engine market in China is quite large and both domestic and foreign companies such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Sohu (NASDAQ:SOHU), NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES) and Tencent Holdings (OTCPK:TCEHY) have been trying to break into the lucrative Internet segment. Google was forced out of the Chinese market, as the government was not too comfortable with Google becoming a leading information provider in the closely controlled society. The other top Chinese Internet companies have not been too successful in carving out a marketshare. Qihoo has made a big impact in a short time as it could show its search tab in its mobile browser. The company has taken the fight to Google and is now in talks to acquire Sohu's search engine division to gain scale. The stock is not cheap and the market capitalization is already $8 billion. The company also has been caught in the past for some unethical practices. So while I think that the company has done a good job in the search engine, the corporate governance standards and the high valuation makes this stock avoidable.Qihoo Negatives1) Unethical Practices - All companies have been caught in the past for aggressive business practices. Google , Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) etc. are no strangers to large fines due to wrong practices such as price-fixing, monopolistic behavior etc. But Qihoo 360 has crossed the line a few too many times for comfort. They started selling anti-virus software to uninstall the pesky toolbars that come with free software/browsers, even as they were following the same practice with their mobile browsers. They have been warned by the China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) for unfair competition and practices. The company also tried to install its own software by incorrectly informing internet users that it was a Microsoft patch.2) Google entry could be damaging - The Chinese market is dominated by local companies as foreign companies have exited the business or are insignificant in size. However, Google's search engine technology is miles ahead of Qihoo and if they manage to strike a deal with the Chinese government in the future, Qihoo prospects would turn quite bad overnight. Google dominates the search engine market in most of the global markets. Even though Microsoft and Yahoo (YHOO) have managed to garner a combined 20-30% marketshare in the U.S. market, Google completely dominates Europe and countries such as India with a ~90% marketshare. QHOO has almost no chance of expanding into foreign markets and it will remain a China centric company.3) Geographical Risk - Qihoo depends on the Chinese market for most of its revenues and profits and internationalization looks remote for the company. The Chinese economy is slowing down and there are even some risks that the economy might face a hard landing. Qihoo's super charged growth may fizzle out very quickly in such a scenario, as advertisers pull back on their spending. In contrast, big U.S. Internet players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google and Microsoft have a large part of their income being generated from non-U.S. operations.4) Chinese ADR Risks - The Chinese companies listed in the U.S. have come under sharp attack for accounting problems if not outright fraud. Qihoo has also been criticized for its aggressive accounting practices and some numbers which do not look right. Many big Chinese companies such as Sino-Forest have crashed as they were proven to be frauds. Top investors with huge stakes in these companies have been found wanting in their due diligence. This risk has to be kept in mind while investing. SEC is taking action against the Chinese subsidiaries of big audit firms for not providing adequate disclosure.5) Valuation is very Expensive - Qihoo is priced to perfection with a P/B of 14.8x and a P/S ratio of 20x. The company already supports a market capitalization of more than $7 billion with just $47 million in annual 2012 revenues. There is little prospect of upside given these kind of valuations.6) Stock Price has Increased too much for comfort - Qihoo's stock price has increased by more than 100% year to date and is currently near its all time highs of $60. The company's stock took a bit of a hit when the merger talks were announced but shrugged that news off and have continued on their exponential trend. I think the stock price has overshot its fundamentals by a wide margin.(Click to enlarge)QIHU Total Return Price data by YChartsRisks to the Upsidea) Sohu Merger - Qihoo is reportedly in talks to buy China's No.3 search engine Sogou. This would give Qihoo a ~24% market share of the Chinese search engine market and give it a critical scale. The Chinese search engine market is not just about technology but more of a sales and marketing game. You need a huge sales force to sell advertisements to thousands of SMEs. It is about establishing relationships and gaining scale. However, the downside is that Qihoo might have to pay a large amount for Sogou.b) Fast growth and large market - China's huge search engine market has made Baidu's investors fabulously wealthy as the company grew by more than 50% CAGR for a long time. Qihoo operates in the same market as Baidu and has grown rapidly in the last few years. Revenues and net profits have increased by more than 100% in the last few years. If the company manages to keep up the pace, then its bubble like stock valuation may not be unjustified. However I don't think that will be the case, as the search engine market is more competitive and the market leader Baidu would fight Qihoo tooth and nail for additional marketshare.SummaryBaidu remains a formidable Internet force in China due to its dominant search engine. Qihoo has managed to capture a 10% plus marketshare as it started to install its own search bar on its popular mobile browser which is used by millions of Chinese users. The company's next growth phase will be very tough as it has to use different levers to gain more marketshare. The company's valuation is already reflecting exponential growth in the future with the trailing P/E of almost 200x. If the growth does not come about, then expect a very sharp fall in stock price. Qihoo is not a technology leader so the company is unlikely to grow in foreign markets. So it has only the Chinese market from which to derive its growth. The Chinese market is not a small one, however the competition is rising and Internet penetration has already increased to a high level in the past few years. I think investors should avoid Qihoo as the risks do not seem to be adequately reflected in the current stock price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1724632,50682,2013-10-02T06:31:48-04:00,,"After seeing its stock price quadruple over the last year on huge expectations for its online search service, Qihoo 360 (NYSE: QIHU) must be feeling some pressure to start delivering returns to investors who have are betting on the company's strong growth potential. That's the most positive explanation I can find for a sudden slew of complaints against Qihoo from other Internet executives, who accuse the company of tinkering with their software. Those accusations have produced an entertaining war of words on the Twitter-like Weibo service between Qihoo Chairman Zhou Hongyi and top executives from smartphone maker Xiaomi, software maker Kingsoft (HKEx: 3888) and web portal operator Sohu (Nasdaq: SOHU) (previous post).While it's entertaining for an observer like me to watch, these matters can hardly be entertaining for Xiaomi, Kingsoft or Sohu, which are seeing their software get hijacked by Qihoo 360 products. What this case really underscores is the fact that Chinese firms can't depend on legal protection when they encounter this kind of unethical and often illegal behavior from rogue companies like Qihoo.While Chinese companies can file lawsuits to try and stop such behavior, such suits usually take years to reach a conclusion, by which time the plaintiff has already taken action to address the matter. Even if the courts find in favor of the plaintiff, financial damage awards are often so small that they have no deterrent effect on companies like Qihoo, which continue to commit similar offenses.All that said, let's take a closer look at the new war of words and the actions that first Sohu, and now Xiaomi and Kingsoft, have taken against Qihoo. The war began last week when Sohu's Sogou search engine filed a lawsuit accusing Qihoo of using its software to change the default browser on Sogou users' computers to Qihoo's rival browser, which favors Qihoo's So.com search engine.Now Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun is taking an unusual break from his usual promotional talk on his microblog to announce that his company is formally removing all Qihoo products from its online apps store. I won't go into the details of Lei's complaints, but they involve allegations similar to Sohu's and accuse Qihoo of hooligan behavior and maliciously misleading users.Kingsoft CEO Fu Sheng has leveled similar accusations, saying his company has also taken all Qihoo products out of its mobile phone assistant software. To be fair, I should point out that Xiaomi and Kingsoft have a close relationship, and that Lei is a major stakeholder in Kingsoft. Finally, Sogou CEO Wang Xiaochuan has been keeping up his series of verbal assaults on Qihoo and Zhou Hongyi, also accusing both of hooligan behavior. Qihoo is certainly accustomed to these kinds of accusations, and has been sued by just about every major Internet company, including social networking giant Tencent (HKEx: 700) and search leader Baidu (Nasdaq: BIDU). Tencent even won a major lawsuit against Qihoo earlier this year, forcing Qihoo to pay some minor damages and issue an apology. But clearly that victory has had little or no effect on Qihoo.So, what's next in this ongoing war of words that is causing very real business disruptions for companies like Sohu and Xiaomi? The most likely answer is that these companies will need to keep protecting themselves as they find little protection from Chinese law against Qihoo's behavior. If they are smart, companies like Tencent, Baidu and Xiaomi should combine forces to complain to Beijing. Chinese regulators could then openly confront Qihoo with the threat of real consequences, such as confiscation of business licenses or criminal charges against Zhou. Perhaps that will finally happen, though I suspect that Qihoo's victims will simply fail to unite and business will continue as usual.Bottom line: Frustration is building among China's Internet firms against Qihoo, following the latest complaints about questionable behavior from Xiaomi and Kingsoft."

The rise came after a string of good news and excellent earnings reports. Qihoo's price performance and growth levels far exceed Baidu's (NASDAQ:BIDU), although Baidu is making efforts to remain number one in China's search market, and possibly take some of Qihoo's market share in other areas. However, Qihoo remains well positioned to take advantage of China's booming mobile market and grow its search market share.Great earnings cycle continuesQihoo's second quarter earnings and revenue exceeded analyst estimates. The company also gave guidance which was higher than the consensus estimates. This was in sync with the first quarter, when management guided revenue much higher than analysts were expecting. Second quarter revenue surged 108% to $151.7 million, while adjusted earnings per share rose 135% to $0.40.During the quarter, Qihoo gained notable search traffic share, said the company's CEO Hongyi Zhou. Mobile security was also one of the very strong segments, with total users reaching 338 million in June 2013, compared with 120 million in June 2012. Profit margins improved significantly. Net margin was 21.8%, compared with 9.6% in the same quarter last year.As a result of significantly raised guidance, analysts have increased their estimates. This year's earnings are expected at $1.29, while expectations were much lower at just $1.05 three months ago. Next year's earnings expectations were also raised from $1.68 three months ago to $2.13. This is a part of the great overall earnings cycle Qihoo is going through, with outstanding earnings and revenue growth and rising analyst expectations. I was concerned with the shrinking margins, but this is much less of a concern now after a significant improvement in profit margins.Is the price too high?Qihoo currently trades at high trailing and forward P/E ratios. Even Qihoo's price to sales ratio is almost twice as much as Baidu's. But this is all a function of Qihoo's outstanding growth. All the metrics say that Baidu provides more value than Qihoo, but Baidu is posting mediocre earnings growth in the recent quarters, and is expected to grow earnings at a far slower rate than Qihoo. Qihoo also has a much higher price to sales ratio, but Qihoo's revenue has grown at an average rate of 103% in the last six quarters, as opposed to Baidu's 57% average revenue growth rate. And Baidu's earnings expectations are trending down, as opposed to Qihoo's rising estimates. If Qihoo can sustain its growth in the next few years, as it is expected to, the current price is still not too high.However, the stock looks extended and vulnerable, and it would be better to wait for a consolidation or a pullback to the 50-day moving average line.Source: Stockcharts.comDebt offering - will Qihoo make a big acquisition soon?In late August, Qihoo announced an offering of $550 million convertible senior notes. This might be another confirmation of the earlier acquisition rumors. The company confirmed earlier this year that it is in early talks with Sohu.com (NASDAQ:SOHU) to buy its Sogou search engine. Qihoo's search market share gains are in line with the company's expectations, and Sogou might be a good addition. It would strengthen Qihoo's position and the company's search market share might surpass 25% by year's end.However, this acquisition does not seem likely now, since Tencent bought a 36.5% stake in Sogou for $448 million. This strategic partnership will make Sogou a formidable adversary to both Qihoo and Baidu, given the Tencent's plans to promote Sogou throughout its messaging and gaming services.ConclusionQihoo continues to deliver outstanding earnings and revenue growth. The company continues to gain search market share, and other business segments are also doing very well. Even without the Sohu.com's search engine acquisition, Qihoo is doing great so far with its gains in the search market. Another very positive and important development in the latest quarter is the significant recovery of profit margins. Qihoo remains very well positioned to take advantage of the tremendous growth trends in China's search market, as well as in the mobile segment. However, the stock looks extended now, and it would be better to wait for a pullback to the 50-day moving average line, or a consolidation of prior gains.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

831081,30231,2012-08-27T15:45:41-04:00,,"The following is a short update on the previous article we wrote about Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU) in June 2012. The company's Q2 2012 press release and conference call provides further evidence that the company is providing verification of its operating metrics only for its free products and does not provide such verification for the income generating products. The free products of the company include the web browser and desktop and mobile security software. Income generating revenues are the company's home page (through ads and search referrals) and web games. The company usually quotes IResearch as their favorite market share research firm.QIHU reported for its second quarter an increase in revenues of 5% over its Q1 2012 revenues and a net income of $7 million, which was down 50% from the first quarter. Even if we would trust management's numbers, the current valuation of approx. $3 billion provides for a PE ratio of 100 (based on the first half of 2012). Just for a reality check, Focus Media's (NASDAQ:FMCN) management has recently offered to take the company private at a multiple of 15.In our previous article we provided some evidence that while management highlights that the company's operating metrics are based on third party research (of IResearch), this information is provided only for the free products. When it comes to measuring the operating metrics of the revenue producing products such as unique visitors, clicks or web game players, QIHU does not provide the disclosure that a third party has verified these operating metrics. In Q2 the company continued with the same approach and did not mention any third party verification of revenue generating operating metrics.In the Q2 conference call, the Chairman of QIHU made the following comments about the free products:Later on the call, the CFO reminded listeners that the figures he just mentioned for the free browser usage are backed by IResearch:In his next sentence, QIHU's CFO was referring to the services which do generate revenues (start-up page and web game), without mentioning the verification by IResearch:Further evidence is found in the footnotes No. 3 to the press release filed with the SEC. Only the free products have been verified by IResearch. That leaves investors with the only option available to them- trust management with the operating metrics of the income generating products.There is no third party verification for unique visitors (affecting the ad rate the company can charge for ads on its site), clicks on its home page (click based income) or web games players (apparently 148,000 people are paying an average of RMB400 per month or $62 to play on QIHU's sites!).Last but not least, the company announced on January 5th a plan to repurchase up to $50 million of its shares. Up to now, the company did not report the acquisition of even a single share which suggests this announcement was merely a PR stunt to increase the share price of QIHU.To conclude this article, based on:we believe QIHU's share price is significantly overvalued and does not price the risks we highlighted. We therefore recommend to short the stock.Disclosure: I am short QIHU. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

You know that (1) this is mathematically impossible, (2) additional information would be nice, but it wouldn't be necessary, and you would also know instantly that (3) he's lying to you. That's what's so nice about deduction. It's neat; it's clean; it's done.Qihoo 360 recently changed its reported ARPU quotes from Monthly to Quarterly figures. (ARPU stands for Average Revenue per Paying User.) What was once quoted as somewhere between the impossible 380 and 440 monthly ARPU is now reported at 400 … for the quarter. Qihoo also tells us that this is gross ARPU.In Tuesday night's Conference Call:400 RMB converts to $62.96 USD. (here)Unfortunately, those numbers belong on the left side of the revenue equation and cannot possibly equal what Qihoo claims for the right side: total revenue. They said,Is this revenue net of sharing with developers?But of course, in the real world none of this matters. Even if filed with the SEC, words and definitions are constantly changing in this business ‒ with apparently little consequence. (EG, here and here.) And then we have the press at large, who resist the hardest facts in order to keep the broadest audience. So our most serious debates are left to message boards. As I write this I can already hear the ""refutation"" ‒ ""They meant gross-this, but you said net-that"" ‒ or vice versa. So I'd like to pin this squirming little bug down to the Styrofoam. Let's forget about the revenue split with developers and net ARPU. We will take the gross ARPU of 400 RMB as claimed in the conference call and multiply it by the maximum ‒ the ending user base for June. We have 148,000 users in June, up from 139,000 users last March, which means that the average user base for the quarter would be somewhere in between, but we're going to forget that. Let's count the whole 148,000 users for the entire quarter. This gives Qihoo maximum room for the math to work.148,000 x $62.96 = $9.3 million USD … versus the total $19.1 million that Qihoo claims they made. (And as a reminder, this is before revenue share with developers.)As you can see, the reported numbers are so bad that even if we gave Qihoo maximum elasticity to reinterpret ""net"" and ""gross,"" the numbers are not even close. If someone wanted to say that the $19.1 million represents revenue before revenue sharing (forget the other implications for now), then the bar chart shown here would accurately show the disproportion. The point here is not to illustrate revenue as it is, but to demonstrate the impossibility of using Qihoo's numbers and arriving at Qihoo's totals ‒ while providing Qihoo with the best possible set of numbers.Let's cover every possibility … or, impossibility rather. If we refer to the $19.1 million (left bar) as total revenue net of sharing with developers, then our calculated $9.3 million (right bar) does not correspond and is much too high, since for argument's sake it has been calculated with gross ARPU. In actuality, revenue sharing at a ratio of 70:30 with June's user base brings us to $6.5 million. The disproportion is even greater than that shown in the bar chart.As you can see, even if the revenue were reported on a net basis and the ratio of revenue share with developers were said to be 99:1, Qihoo's numbers would still be impossible. As good as it gets is real bad.To grow faster than mathematical possibility … that's really humbling for the rest of us who were born within the limits of the finite world. In fact, these guys are soooo fast that the only thing faster than Qihoo's web game growth is Qihoo's story-telling.And Qihoo needs stories. Short sellers and others have made strong cases that …This is what I meant by ""Qihoo needs stories."" It's ""web search"" makes front page news, and any questions of the authenticity of Qihoo's current revenue are rarely even mentioned. Apparently, people need to look forward and not to the very real problems in the here and now; if they did they just might sell.As it is, Qihoo's price has been going wild, as if to say, ""Tomorrow's happy story is more comfortable than today's impossible revenue."" …. Well, with a big enough crowd you can shout down good math with bad, but a person needs to be sure that the situation is inconsequential; for example, things just might not work out for those who try to drive across a 100 foot canyon on a 20 foot bridge. Bad math won't save them. With the stock market of course it's not that simple. Trying to calculate how high the irrational will carry the price is not a rational exercise. Nonetheless, I'll take my chances with the math.Disclosure: I am short QIHU. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1258991,33311,2013-03-08T09:44:33-05:00,,"I have been spending some time looking at potential bargains in Chinese ADRs, and while researching Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) I kept coming across comments from Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) about how it is garnering market share from BIDU and how it will continue to do so. This, if true, should clearly be cause for concern for BIDU. In looking at the chart of BIDU, it's clear that people are assuming the worst (although the fear mongerers were all over Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) back in the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012 and we see how well that panned out) as it is stuck below $100 and has been in a downtrend for the past 20 months. (As a side note, the stock does appear to potentially be putting in a double bottom around $85 to $90, and the weekly momentum readings are suggesting a bottom is very close. And the China search market is still a very long way from reaching maturity.) The fears are that BIDU is losing market share and that mobile search is harder to monetize, both of which are reasons why BIDU is trading at a very low P/E and PEG.With this in mind, I decided to dig into the QIHU story more to see if the fears of market share loss were true, and to see if there was a possible investment opportunity with QIHU. I didn't get very far before coming to the conclusion that I really have no level of confidence in the integrity of its management team and, quite frankly, I would highly recommend steering clear of this company.First and foremost are the company's claims about its share of the search market, since this is what has the market so concerned about BIDU and enamored of QIHU. QIHU, as most people are aware, switched its business model from directing traffic to Google China and other search engines through its Qihoo browser to generating search traffic directly from its own in-house search engine, launched in August 2012. Immediately thereafter, Qihoo was claiming that it had 10% market share and that it was taking that market share from BIDU. At first blush it appears to be quite a feat, and it might lure investors into believing that it is poised to dethrone BIDU. Investors may be left in awe, wondering how it was that it could grab such a large percentage of the market immediately when other companies, like Sohu (NASDAQ:SOHU) and NetEase (NASDAQ:NTES), have been around for years and have much smaller market shares.While it may be true that Qihoo's new search engine has this market share, I think it is incredibly deceiving to imply to investors that it simply gobbled up this market share from BIDU without acknowledging its share of indirect search that it had previously. Through its own browser before the launch of its search engine, QIHU was generating approximately 15% of the entire search market. That is, it was directing search traffic to China Google, BIDU, and a variety of other search engines directly from its own browser and that search traffic made up about 15% of the overall market. Here's how the 15% indirect market share is calculated:Click to enlarge image.Source: Michael Fu (here)While it may be true that QIHU has a double-digit share of search traffic, it is certainly not a new player in this market. Additionally, in assessing market shares I think the better metric is search revenue -- and more specifically, revenue per search.As we have seen play out in the U.S. search market, the dominant leader garners the majority of ad budgets. The reason being most advertisers gravitate to a search engine that the majority of users are using. A perfect example is Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) launch of its search product Bing. Bing's share of search traffic initially grew fairly rapidly, yet MSFT has continued to lose a lot of money in its online division primarily because it has spent so much promoting Bing and the revenue per search severely lags Google. Here are the revenues and loss figures for MSFT's online division in fiscal Q2 from the last four years:Fiscal Q2 2010Fiscal Q2 2011Fiscal Q2 2012Fiscal Q2 2013While revenues have grown each year, losses continue to rack up and its share of the search market, after initially growing, has flat-lined. Most likely, revenues grew because the overall market grew.Garnering market share initially seems to be much easier than actually maintaining it. The New York Times ran an interesting article on QIHU in November 2012, and in this article it quoted Wang Xing as follows:A perfect example of this is a related field is Sina's (NASDAQ:SINA) Weibo, a microblog service. After it launched it quickly gained popularity, yet two years after the launch Weibo's revenues are still not significant for SINA. SINA continues to lose money on Weibo.While I can understand why QIHU would want to tout its accomplishments, as David Wolf of Wolf Group Asia states about CEO Zhou Hongyi, ""Never discount how Zhou Hongyi has learned to use a professed enmity with an industry leader to bring attention to himself and to his enterprise. It's essentially combat as a PR stunt.""But again, QIHU isn't exactly a new entrant into this field and I think it is disingenuous to imply that it has captured over 10% of the market without first acknowledging its share of indirect search previously. And using MSFT and even SINA as examples, the road to monetizing market share is extremely difficult when you are a distant second in terms of market share. While touting its market share isn't a huge red flag, I do think there is a level of dishonesty that makes my antennae go up. What I find more disturbing about QIHU, though, is that it has a history of questionable ethics.In 2006, QIHU launched antivirus software that would allow users to identify toolbars they downloaded as malware and uninstall them. Not such a bad thing, right? The only problem is QIHU was making these very same toolbars for their own browser, which people would download and then pay QIHU to have them uninstalled. Both Yahoo (YHOO) China and BIDU fought QIHU in court in 2007 over this practice and won.To top it off, over the past two months QIHU has had its apps removed from the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iTunes store for violating its terms of service, and has had an official warning handed down by the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) in China for unfair competition, again with its anti-virus software embedded in its Internet browsers. Keep in mind that the company's apps were removed from iTunes in early 2012 as well.In regard to the SAIC warning, the following comments were made about QIHU's unfair practices:According to TechinAsia:Conclusion: Avoid QIHUWhile none of these actions alone are enough to call QIHU a fraud, when taken as a whole in assessing management credibility and integrity, I have zero confidence in QIHU as an investment. I also find it very odd that GOOG would partner with QIHU given how it took the higher road in its stance on refusing to sensor results in China, but considering how poorly it has fared against BIDU I can understand why it would want to support a smaller rival.While QIHU may very well go on to be a good investment, I need to have some level of comfort that management is credible. Additionally, when reading QIHU's comments about how it will continue to grab market share from BIDU and taking into account its questionable business practices in the past, it calls into question any rumors of BIDU losing market share and makes me believe that current concerns about BIDU may prove to be unfounded. And much like GOOG in the past three summers, I think this could ultimately be an attractive entry point in BIDU.So while I went into this contemplating a position in QIHU, I came away with a small position in BIDU because it is inexpensive relative to its earnings and growth, it has a business model with a very wide moat, and it operates in a compelling long-term secular growth market. Additionally, BIDU's revenue share of the search market grew six percentage points in the last quarter, according to Analysys International, based in Beijing. And to me that is a much more important figure to focus on than overall market share because ad budgets are what drives profitability.Disclosure: I am long BIDU. (I only have a small stake in BIDU after researching QIHU and coming away  with a better level of comfort about the concerns regarding BIDU's  market share.) I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

739371,24258,2012-07-23T06:11:18-04:00,,"Qihoo's games are the same; the revenue is out of line with other game platforms.First, let's clear one thing up. Qihoo's (NYSE:QIHU) games are not different from its competitors' games. Look at the identical games hosted by both Qihoo and Renren (NYSE:RENN):[1) Like pop songs, the games will eventually be replaced with newer games. 2) To simplify communication in English and to help readers independently verify the facts, I have used Google translations of the Chinese games. 3) The slide above was taken from a presentation on the same topic here.  The preceding images show identical games found on both Qihoo and Renren. But this is just one of many available comparisons. There are many other platforms offering the same games as well. For example, there is a popular web game in China written as ""神仙道"" - which Google translates as ""Immortal."" Below you will find some of the many online operators of this very same game. For each bullet below, click on the link next to the operator (as translated by Google) and you will arrive on a competitor's game platform. On arriving at the login page, look at the logo and compare it to the Chinese Characters for ""Immortal"": 神仙道. This is the same game that Qihoo is offering.Click here and you'll see that Qihoo's wan.360.cn is just one of many game operators. The CFO stated that the games were ranked on the page according to popularity. He also said that the top 10 games brought in 60 to 70% of web game revenue. (here) In the presentation I have prepared (click here), you can click through to multiple operators for each of the top 16 games (July 15, 2012) on wan.360.cn's home page.The second thing we need to clear up is what Qihoo says about its game revenue. It is not in-line with competitors.Let's step back a bit and review the key metric. How much does each user spend on web games? From a company's perspective, that's thought of as the Average Revenue Per Paying User (ARPPU technically, but with Qihoo and many others, correctly or incorrectly, it is referred to simply as ARPU).64.5 RMB, that's the average monthly ARPU I found in a sample of seven Chinese companies with online game businesses. (Source material in presentation: here)Qihoo says that their game business is ""different"" and that they don't ""compare."" Well, no kidding. Qihoo sticks out like a CEO in an orange jumpsuit.(Qihoo actually said last May that they had 440 ARPU. But ""440"" is so painfully off the chart that I'm going to help out. Let's say that the CFO meant Average Revenue per Paying User before splitting revenue with developers 70:30 ‒ so I trimmed 30% off the top. (He didn't say that, but I'm just trying to give him the best footing possible.)Alex Xu, CFO of Qihoo, Q1 2012 conference Call [Time: 47:18 ] (The emphasis is mine, here and throughout this article.)Shanda Games (NASDAQ:GAME), Renren Inc. , Giant Interactive (NYSE:GA), Changyou.com Ltd (NASDAQ:CYOU), KongZhong Corporation (KONG), Tencent Holdings (700:Hong Kong), Kingsoft Corp Ltd (3888: Hong Kong)That's an equivalent of $70…in China. What was he thinking? Certainly he misspoke?See, if he didn't mean ARPU before revenue share, then the number becomes even more difficult to believe, as pointed out by this interviewer.For those hoping for some official clarity…hoping that Qihoo surely had set the record straight in official, SEC filed documents…Well, they did offer clarity...in an SEC filing and in response to accusations that their ARPU was out of line, so you'd have to think that they got it right this time…right?This claim was filed with the SEC in December 2011 here.Then in May Qihoo says their ARPU for March was 440! Qihoo truly is a unique company. It is so unique it does not even compare to its own prior statements. Is its ARPU 260 in October through December '11? Is it a stable 380 in December '11? Did the CFO really mean 440 in March '12? But what else? When challenged with the extremity of the ARPU, he declared it to be 400 in the iWallstreet interview. If that was net of revenue share with developers, does that mean that we can have 550 gross ARPU? Who really knows? Tencent, a web game powerhouse, comes in at less than 50.Qihoo says that its number is in-line with others. Analysts have also said that Qihoo's ARPU is in-line with other web game operators in China. How is this possible? (If this is not a bluff, analysts, show your cards. Some examples are in order here. Where are they? Who are the ""others""? )The out-of-line ARPU was first brought to public attention by Citron Research. Qihoo declared in return that their revenue was in-line with others -- but without providing examples. However, at the same time they also claimed that their games were ""different"" -- they didn't do Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) games.How can this be a good thing? MMO games earn more than casual games.Shek Hon Lo - Tencent SVP and Deputy CFO:(To be conservative, I didn't take an average, but put Qihoo in the best light possible in the comparison: I took the top numbers, then divided by 3 for monthly consistency -- monthly ARPUs of MMO games came in at 43 RMB and Casual Games at 32 RMB.)Here's what iResarch has to say:As we have seen, Qihoo's ARPU is definitely not in-line with other web game operators. A ""stable"" 380 ARPU is not in the same ballpark as an average of 65. Hosting non-MMO games only makes these numbers even more painful to look at. We are not just comparing apples to apples, we are comparing this very apple to itself: Qihoo's gamers are not playing the same ""type"" of games as competitors … but the very same games.Now here's a rare chance to look under the hood. Two of the games hosted on Qihoo's wan.360.cn are known in English as ""Shen Qu"" and ""DDTank.""They are included in Changyou.com Inc.'s SEC filing:Now there are two sides to every transaction. ARPU isn't ""just revenue."" You can't just pull revenue by the ears out of a black hat. It's got to come from someone else. So ARPU also tells us what gamers spend. Take Qihoo's 139,000 gamers and as an average they only have so much money. We are supposed to believe that gamers were spending about $70 USD in March on Qihoo's games. China People's Daily Online said in 2011 that the average monthly salary for ""fresh college graduates"" was 2,500 yuan, about $400 USD. (here)Factsanddetails.com reports:There are only so many ways to slice up a budget, but the more slices you make the thinner each piece must be (unless you're just telling stories). How much would the average person spend on virtual goods through Qihoo that they wouldn't spend through Renren?Same games, same platforms,…but different revenue? Same chunk of cheese to start with … yet when you look at the pizza, you know whose two-pound chunk of cheese actually passed through the cheese grater and whose didn't.Whose cheese got grated and whose didn't?Disclosure: I am short QIHU."
1113641,39541,2013-01-15T17:20:19-05:00,,"Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) has surged +40% in the past few months due to Wall Street analysts' optimism over the monetization potential of Qihoo's own search engine. Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has declined nearly 20% during the time, but has recently regained much of those losses. I typically like to invest in stable, value stocks instead of momentum, high-growth stocks like QIHU and BIDU. However, I would like to spend some time applying the same fundamental valuation approach to Qihoo and Baidu as typically performed on value stocks, given that high growth stocks often trade too much on ""story"" and not enough on fundamentals. I will make no recommendation at the end of this article; I will just present the figures and allow the readers to come to their own conclusions.China's Online Search MarketAccording to Analysis, as of Q2 2012 the market share of each major player in China's online search market was the following: Baidu (78.6%), Google China (NASDAQ:GOOG) (15.7%), Sohu's Sogou (NASDAQ:SOHU) (2.9%), Tencent's Soso (OTCPK:TCEHY) (1.5%), Others (1%) and Netease's Youdao (NASDAQ:NTES) (0.3%).Historically, the other smaller players have not made much of an impact on Baidu's dominant market share, and Google China's market share has been on a steady decline, from 24.2% in 2Q2010 to just 15.7% in 2Q2012. Note that before Qihoo launched its own search engine in August 2012, Qihoo helped direct 65%-70% of the traffic for Google China (I'll discuss this more later in the article). Baidu's market share has increased from 70% to 78.6% during that time span.In August 2012, Qihoo launched its own search engine and by December 2012, Qihoo's market share of China's online search engine unique views had jumped to 10.5%, and Baidu's market share declined to 71.5%, according to iResearch.Qihoo's Indirect Market ShareNote one subtle but very important consideration when looking at Qihoo's 10.5% market share in December 2012. Prior to August 2012 when Qihoo did not have its own search engine yet, Qihoo's browser (2nd most popular Internet browser in China behind Microsoft Internet Explorer) would recommend and direct search traffic to Google China (and other search engines) and receive a percentage of the revenue from the search referral. Therefore prior to August 2012, Qihoo already had some indirect market share in online search through these search referral arrangements. It was not as if Qihoo's search engine captured 10.5% market share overnight. Below is a table from Wall Street research that illustrates this point:If you revised the previous market share data to account for Qihoo's indirect market share, the implied market share data would look more like this below, with Qihoo indirectly already having 15% market share in Q1 and Q2 2012, prior to launching its own search engine.By switching to Qihoo's own search engine and referring search traffic to its own search site, Qihoo can now sell its own search ads, but it will also lose previous revenue from search referrals. Net/net, there probably will be additional revenue from Qihoo launching its own search engine and directly selling its own search ads (instead of depending on other search engines and collecting search referral fees), however the revenue is not 100% incremental (because of the lost search referral revenue).Valuation ComparisonLet's now look at the valuation comparison between Baidu and Qihoo. As shown below, Baidu is approximately 10x bigger than Qihoo, whether you look at market capitalization or revenue. Qihoo is a bit more expensive at 11.1x 2012E TEV/Sales, compared with 9.4x for Baidu. On a non-GAAP 2012E P/E basis, Qihoo trades at 43.3x, compared with 21.6x for Baidu. Both companies have about 9% of their market cap in cash. Expected 2013 revenue growth is 41.6% for Baidu and 56.3% for Qihoo.China's Online Search Market GrowthHow does Baidu's and Qihoo's revenue growth compare with expected industry growth rates for online search in China? It looks like both companies are expected to grow faster than the industry growth rate of 38.8% for 2013E (which implies increasing market share, or faster growth from other revenue segments, or my industry data source is too conservative).Revenue ContributionWhen we look at revenue contribution, you will see that Baidu's revenue is almost 100% from online services (primarily online search ads). For Qihoo, its revenue contribution has changed dramatically over the years, as it has moved away from selling security software to online ads and online gaming revenue. In 2012E, Qihoo still has approximately 30% of its revenue coming from online gaming (note, Chinese online gaming stocks like NTES trade at 5-6x 2012E P/E). Note that the above mentioned search referral revenue and eventual online search revenue would both be in Online Ad for Qihoo.Number of and Types of AdvertisersAnother difference between Baidu and Qihoo is the number of advertisers and the types of advertisers. As shown below, as of Q32012, Baidu had 390,000 advertisers, compared with just 600 advertisers for Qihoo (this is up fro 300 advertisers in Q2 2012). This implies that while Baidu's average advertiser spends around $2,500 USD per quarter, Qihoo's advertisers spend almost $100,000 USD per quarter! I'll let the readers interpret exactly why that is and what that means (because I have no idea).By the way, certain data points are sometimes not disclosed in the earnings press release and you have to read through the companies' earnings transcript to find it (Thanks to Seeking Alpha for access to earnings transcripts by the way). Here are Baidu Q32012 and Qihoo Q32012 transcripts, if you're interested of how I found the number of advertisers.Now let's look at the type of advertisers. According to Qihoo's Q22012 earnings transcript, e-commerce was 40%, group-buying was 10%, and gaming was 9%, basically the 600 advertisers on Qihoo are primarily Chinese Internet companies. Baidu's 390,000 advertisers is much more diverse, with advertisers across various sectors including fashion/luxury, education, internet, travel, games, real estate, etc. (no exact percentage split that I have found).Cost ComponentsBesides the revenue and advertiser mix differences between Baidu and Qihoo, another difference that shows up is in the cost components. For Q32012, Baidu's cost of goods sold is approximately 27% of sales, compared with just 9% for Qihoo (this implies gross margins of 91%). R&D expense is significantly higher for Qihoo than Baidu (49% vs. 10%), and SG&A is higher for Qihoo than Baidu (27% vs. 10%).If you look at Baidu's COGS components, sales tax alone is around 7% of sales, with TAC, bandwidth, depreciation, operational, and other costs comprising the remaining portions. At a minimum, Qihoo has to incur the sales tax costs for operating online services in China. I'm not sure why the other costs (TAC, bandwidth, depreciation, operational, etc.) are so minimal for Qihoo (are those costs buried in R&D and SG&A instead, if so, why are they not up top with COGS, which are the direct costs associated with revenue), so I'll let the readers interpret on their own.ConclusionHopefully this article was helpful to investors who want exposure to China's high-growth online search market, in determining whether Baidu or Qihoo is the better play for investing in that sector. Again, personally I tend to invest in stable, boring value stocks, but remember that the fundamental approach to valuing stocks can and should be applied as well to high-growth, momentum stocks. Don't just read headlines and invest in the ""story,"" always do the homework as well.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

807811,24258,2012-08-14T22:46:33-04:00,,"Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd (NYSE:QIHU) has been in the news. Let's just dive right into the latest Qihoo scandal in China. News title:(The above was professionally translated and will be cited throughout this article as ""Qihoo 360 Falsely Reports."" Originals are here; you can read them in the Google translator, for example here. 8/1/2012)""Here's what happened:Now, here's a screenshot that accompanied one of the many articles (I added the Google translator and the orange lines to highlight the key points. By the way, of the screenshots I found, this was the one with the best resolution: you can find it here, click the image to enlarge it.)I've experienced the proof firsthand. Upon reading online blogs and articles, I found URLs to the patch(es) and was able to download them from Qihoo's official site. As of this writing I am still able to download them. I introduce them here, with the warning that the company has been accused of malware in the past. Here are the links.It is possible that the files will be removed and/or the access blocked upon the publication of this article. Again, I'm not recommending the files. I only present them as evidence of the counterfeiting.Take a quick look. Which files are from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and which are from Qihoo 360 ?All of them were downloaded from Qihoo's 360safe.com, AKA, 360.cn ‒ and all of them were made by Qihoo 360.(To see this System Explorer page click here.)In the image below, you can see that the icon on the left is a short-cut to Qihoo's browser; the icon in the middle is a short-cut to Microsoft's browser; and the last icon is Qihoo's counterfeit Microsoft ""security patch."" Note how there is much more similarity to Microsoft's icon than to Qihoo's.Besides using Microsoft's Icon and color, Qihoo's fake patch also takes advantage of file naming convention.Here's what they mean. Of the two filenames below the first is Qihoo's and the second is Microsoft's (found here):""Windows"" of course refers to Microsoft's most famous product and ""KB"" stands for ""Knowledge Base."" A user is supposed to be able to go to Microsoft's Knowledge Base, access the reference number, and get more information.I invite the reader to try to find Windows KB360018. Now, if there is no KB360018 entry in Microsoft's knowledge base, then Qihoo 360 has no other reason for referencing ""Windows"" in the filename other than to further a user's natural expectation that the software comes from the trusted source, Microsoft.Let's go back to the Qihoo Security Guards screenshot. You may have noticed that there were other hotfixes listed. One had a KB reference number, 2728973. You can actually go to Microsoft's website and look that KB reference number up.I did just that. Now, either somebody on Qihoo's team has a great sense of humor or Qihoo's listed hotfixes have an ironic coincidence. The KB2728973 reference for the patch next to the fake one reads: ""Microsoft Security Advisory: Unauthorized digital certificates could allow spoofing."" A Microsoft warning about ""spoofing"" next to a fake Microsoft hotfix!See illustration, or click here to go to Microsoft's Knowledge Base #2728973.OK then, with common sense certainty we know that Qihoo faked a Microsoft patch. And understandably, some users were confused. Here's a comment found on the official Qihoo 360 BBS, run through the translator.(Original, here.)Qihoo's tactics were exposed and spread through the blogosphere.This next piece was found on Weibo's ultra-popular micro-blogging site (run through Google's translator):These sorts of blogs are abundant, see some of them here. As you can see in the above Weibo ""micro-blog,"" and in others, screen shots were popular. See a very popular series of screenshots, here. Many were also widely distributed in the press.Someone even made a video of the ""hotfix"" installation process: here.I wonder how many novice users thought they not only installed a Microsoft patch but actually thought they also had a new upgraded Microsoft browser?!(Internet Explorer and Qihoo Browser Icons.)What does Microsoft think about all this? News reports in China said that Microsoft was investigating the matter, but did not have any comments at this time. (Originals, here; Google Translator, here) Here's a community response on answers.microsoft.com. The original was in Chinese, I had it professionally translated.Or perhaps there is a special arrangement between Qihoo and Microsoft for the transition from IE6?There is an interview online where someone named Huan Ren, said to be a Qihoo 360 employee, was quoted as saying:But if so, why wouldn't the file properties and digital signature involve Microsoft's name alongside Qihoo's? And why would the icon look like a cheap screenshot?The point we need to make here is that if a Hacker wanted to borrow the credibility of Microsoft to get his users to convert from the IE6 to his own browser, why not 1) copy the Microsoft icon and the 2) filename conventions (complete with Knowledge Base reference) and then take another important step: 3) scare the users. Tell them that they're in a high risk situation.Here's an excerpt from an article published on Zdnet.com.cn. This one is translated by Google:A novice user wouldn't know the difference either way and a knowledgeable user would expect a Microsoft ""patch"" to contrast with Qihoo's look and feel ‒ which this one did. (Of course, reports tell us that this wasn't a patch at all but a conversion from Microsoft's to Qihoo's browser).This next micro-blog appeared just before the scandal entered the mainstream media:(Google translated.)""Hooligan?"" I think US investors are the last to learn. This kind of association with Qihoo is nothing new to the Chinese reader.In fact if you just do a raw search for ""The father of rogue software"" (That is, don't even mention Qihoo or the CEO) you come up with … the CEO of Qihoo.

But in general this is the way it is… not just in China but in the browser business at large: bigger players trying to limit their smaller rivals with ""innovation"" and ""security."" As a consequence, I don't think Qihoo's number one revenue driver ‒ the advertisement laden default page to the browser‒ will survive the next technology cycle.It's the law of the jungle over there. Over here too. Here's Apple locking out major browsers with impunity, because, well, everybody likes 'em … that, and, oh yeah, they're really big.Now that Micrsoft, with its Office Suite, is set to enter this arena with its new tablets, the future of third-party browsers is being debated. Will Microsoft create so much friction for rival browsers that users just follow the path of least resistance … resulting in Microsoft's inevitable retrieval of browser market share? If they can copy Apple's strategy, you can bet they will. And I do believe that Qihoo will not be spared.Here's what everyone is saying about the next browser war:Why Is Microsoft Trying to Hobble Firefox on Windows 8 Tablets - and Why Does It Matter?Whether one agrees with Microsoft here or not, one has to admit that Qihoo did not help the counter-argument with recent ""events.""So, it is a jungle out there, but the problem with the law of the jungle is that you have to be the Gorilla to win it.

672311,30231,2012-06-20T12:00:50-04:00,,"A lot of criticism has been heard regarding Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU), mainly from Citron Research. Citron claimed QIHU committed fraud and that the company's portal cannot generate the revenue the company claims. The company, on the other hand, claimed that it is able to generate tremendous growth in its income as the user number of its website is increasing rapidly and, as such, it is able to charge higher and higher amounts for its banners every quarter. We don't believe this is true.We believe QIHU might be creative in measuring its size in the directory market (73% of income), income and growth rates. Our belief is based on the following:1. QIHU ceased in Q1 2011 to use IResearch to quote its market share for its main income generating products and continues to quote IResearch only for market share for its free products. No third-party verification since Q1 2011.2. IResearch's own research claims the directory market is saturated and that QIHU's directory site grew by 2.9% in the first 10 months of 2011, while QIHU claimed growth of approximately 100%.3. Major Chinese websites appear not to generate traffic from QIHU's websites, indicating its actual market share might be less than what it claims.QIHU claims to use its free security software and browser to attract users to use its other products in order to generate ad revenue. One of these other products is QIHU's Personal Start-Up Page (hao.360.cn), which generated about 73% of the company's income in 2011.Many investors feel comfortable with QIHU's financial reports as QIHU routinely quotes third-party research to confirm its market position and user growth rates. In its registration statement in 2011, QIHU relied heavily on market research conducted by a company named IResearch Consulting Group -- a company owned by Focus Media (NASDAQ:FMCN) -- in order to confirm the following information (as of January 2011):Note that the only significant revenue generating product in this list is the Start-Up Page (to be more precise, the company used to sell the security product but changed to a free distribution model a couple of quarters ago).In its Q1 2011 report, QIHU still used IResearch to quote its Active User Numbers. Starting with Q2 2011, the company ceased to mention that the Personal Start-Up Page (its main income driver) figures are based on IResearch, but only quoted IResearch for its active browser users and the browser penetration rate (which are not the big income generators). The information on QIHU's Unique Visitors on QIHU's website and the clicks on the website have since Q1 2011 not been publicly verified by IResearch. In addition, the company stopped to use ""Active Users"" as a reference to its growth and changed it to ""Daily Unique Visitors"": Click to enlarge images.We believe many investors seek comfort in the IResearch ""confirmation"" when investing in the stock. However, it is important to note that this ""confirmation"" is only for the market penetration of the web browser and security products (free products) and not for users on its revenue generating Start-Up Page (73% of income as of 2011). There is no third-party confirmation for QIHU's growth rate in its revenue generating income sources.In addition to these findings, IResearch published in December 2011 a report titled ""China Directory Website Market Research 2011."" In this report IResearch cover the directory market (from which QIHU generates most of its revenues). As IResearch is quoted all over QIHU's PR announcements and reports, this report provides an interesting, and somewhat different, picture of QIHU's growth in the directory market.On page 14, the report claims that based IResearch information, from January 2011 to October 2011, the monthly Unique Visitors of the directory sites in China increased slowly. It's still growing, but at greatly reduced rates than in the past. In addition, it claimed that hao.360.cn (QIHU's Personal Home Page and main source of income) grow in this period by only 2.9%. It is important to note, that the number of Chinese Internet users grow by 12% in 2011. So If the total Internet market grow only by 12% and the company on which investors (and QIHU) base their Due Diligence claims the number of users on QIHU's portal grow by only 2.9%, how do we reconcile the explosive growth in users and revenue the company claims?No wonder QIHU stopped using the IResearch information in Q1 2011 on the growth of its Personal Home Page and kept quoting IResearch only for information relating to non-revenue generating products.Furthermore, Citron has also provided information from Alexa as for QIHU's market share in the Chinese Internet market. As a response, QIHU claimed that Alexa is unable to count the user numbers of QIHU as they mostly use the company's own browser that prevents Alexa from gathering information. Let's assume this is true. We have prepared the following table, which presents information gathered through Alexa on some of the most popular Chinese websites and provides on the rank in China, the number of links linking to the website and the 10 largest sites where users came from to the website. Even if a significant part of the users of QIHU surf with the QIHU browser, some will probably surf with other browser that would be tracked by Alexa.We believe the fact that only one of the 16 sites even mentioned QIHU's website as a source for traffic (and only at 10th place) provides more evidence that QIHU exaggerates its market share in the directory business. If they had such a dominant position as they claim, significantly more users using other browsers would have used QIHU's site to surf to these popular sites. If the company will counter-claim that other browser users don't use QIHU's website and only QIHU browser user do, its just a demonstration of the fact that their website is more like spam than a source for content and revenue.Also, the company announced in May 2012 a buy back of $50 million, clearly to bust the share price. Since then the company did not report even a single share purchased.We believe QIHU's revenues are overstated and therefore recommend selling short the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
649991,24258,2012-06-11T06:38:38-04:00,,"Just under two weeks ago, on May 30th, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd (NYSE:QIHU) was found to be in contempt of court.See the full judgment through the professional translation in the following image, the Google Translator, the Microsoft Translator, or in the original Chinese.The original verdict was for unfair competition (see below), and now in contempt of the previous court order, Qihoo has until the end of June to post a court approved mea culpa on its web site.Along with this ruling comes a threat of additional, more detailed exposure:The judgment in which Qihoo was found to be in contempt was the one involving Kingsoft.We find the judgment itself on the ""People's Court Daily,"" hosted on Chinacourt.org. It is one of China's ""Official Government Resources,"" as the U.S. Library of Congress puts it.In Qihoo's SEC filings, we find the following verdict, with the same dates and awarded damages as in the relevant PRC-based Qihoo case:Here is another piece of litigation involving Kingsoft:Qihoo is not a stranger to litigation and public controversy … in China; rather, Americans are a stranger to Qihoo's past and present. Here is how Caixin Online put it, ""But beyond the market buzz, Qihoo has also come under a harsh light after major competitors accused the company of unethical business practices last fall."" (See ""What's behind Qihoo 360's squabbles with rivals in the past year?"" April 2011, written in English)Very little of this news made it across the ocean. At precisely the same time Qihoo was approaching American capital markets, its reputation in China was in a fight for survival. In short, there was an internet war going on in China throughout the year 2010 and reaching a climax in November, just months before Qihoo's public offering. Major internet companies joined together, accusing Qihoo of unethical business practices … and even accusing Qihoo of putting ""backdoors"" in its software. (The Qihoo ""backdoor"" controversy has been dragged out into the open again these last two weeks, here ‒ I've put some excerpts in a blog, here.)The aforementioned ""major competitors"" formed a union and declared a boycott of Qihoo's software, even going so far as to declare their software incompatible with Qihoo's ‒ forcing users to choose between them. Among those in a united voice against Qihoo were Tencent (0700.hk), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), Kingsoft (3888.hk), Keniu (later merges with Kingsoft), and Maxthon (English website).So, what was happening in the Chinese press at this time? Here's a screenshot from an article in Sina Technology which I ran through the Google Translator:(Article in the Original or Google Translated. Google sometimes translates Kingsoft phonetically as ""Jinshan""; the phonetic ""Keniu"" is sometimes translated literally as ""can cattle"" or ""to cattle"")This was a very big event for netizens in China. Here is a news search in Chinese; a Google translated search, here.In response to Qihoo's latest court judgment, an article put it this way,Follow up: You can see the above article,""360 Defies Court Judgment, Forced to Accept,"" here (in Chinese); through the Google Translator, here. For other articles on Qihoo's being in contempt of court, see the search hits through the Google Translator, here; in original Chinese, here.]Disclosure: I am short QIHU."
590451,24258,2012-05-15T11:32:12-04:00,,"Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd (QIHU) was at ""war"" with Tencent Holdings Ltd. (0700.HK) in the fall of 2010. Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) ‒ often said to be the Google of China ‒ has a Statistics page, and on it Qihoo's browser market share apparently falls off a cliff.However, at precisely this time period, Qihoo was approaching US capital markets with claims of strong growth.(Prospectus March 2011: All emphasis here and in other citations are mine.)Which is it? A market share disaster or stronger than expected growth?And the ""Personal Start-up Page"" is the default page for the browser. If the browser gets hurt, doesn't the other feel the pain?Could it be that I misread Baidu's statistics? That my paid translator and the Google translator both got the description wrong? Or perhaps there is some data-gathering quirk on the part of Baidu?It's a small matter, because even if we discarded Baidu's statistics, it would still be difficult to draw a different conclusion: the fact that there was a disaster and that it affected revenue is supported by other sources … including Qihoo itself.Here is a mention of the October 2010 fight in Qihoo's latest SEC 20-F filing.So there was definitely something going on here. News reports out of China also mention a tit-for-tat battle, with legal suits, public smearing, and some technical dirty tricks. It was widely reported in Chinese, but you can read about it in English in the 2011 QIHU SEC filed 20-F (from page 81) and at Caixin Online. (Put ""Qihoo"" in the search box.) The war reached a climax with Tencent's popular messaging product, ""QQ."" According to Caixin Online,What had begun as a spat between a messaging service and anti-virus software apparently escalated into an attempt to shut all of Qihoo down. As the Wall Street Journal reported:According to Baidu's statistics page the damage lasted until April 2011. And what was Qihoo saying in its prospectus? The browser (and its default startup page) played a ""key"" role in the prospectus and supposedly, the business. (emphasis mine) snapshot of the above SEC filing)We have heard very different messages from Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd when it finds itself under contrasting circumstances.For example, when Qihoo needed capital from the US markets it needed to present itself as strong and growing. They ""achieved stronger growth in their active user base than what had been expected for the January 2011 valuation.""But now in the ongoing legal battle with Tencent, Qihoo needs to present itself as vulnerable and damaged. From the current legal battle, information is just now emerging about Qihoo's apparent catastrophe at precisely the time it was also preparing its prospectus. Here's an article that appeared in the Chinese media April 20, 2012 and which sums up the situation:The only difference between the two accounts is the extent of the damage. Did they lose 15 million users or 20 million? The fact however that severe damage was inflicted is affirmed by both parties. How does Qihoo reconcile this damage with the prospectus?This is not the only confusion surrounding Qihoo's browser. Wasn't Qihoo supposed to have dominated the market last September? Qihoo, in their 2011 third quarter announcement:What does Baidu's statistic's page have to say about Qihoo's market share for September 2011?Not even close. Qihoo's misleading claim was first brought to my attention by Citron Research, using different sources. However, if I played the Devil's Advocate, the only explanation that makes sense to me is that Qihoo's browser statistics were supposed to refer to software sitting on the hard-drive along with other bundled software, most of it unused -- while Baidu's statistics refer to actual use.The title to Baidu's statics page reads, 浏览器市场份额. Google translates this as ""Browser market share"" (here) while Qihoo often speaks of ""user penetration."" If ""user penetration"" means ""market share,"" it is difficult to see how Qihoo did not lie to investors. If it does not mean market share, Qihoo has still misled investors with their September statement.I have to say this because the latest 20-F filing puts the matter differently:This is a very different statement from the one made last September. First, Qihoo and Microsoft cannot both have more than 50% market dominance -- which brings us to the question: Was Qihoo referring to data other than market leadership last September? ... while claiming market leadership? Also note that Qihoo now drops the claim of being the market leader and leaves open the possibility that we are speaking of software sitting on hard drives, unused. But there are still problems with this attempt to excuse Qihoo:First, it would mean the actual use of their browser is not anywhere near what investors at large believe it to be.Second, just as no software brags about being a ""memory hog"" how can you brag about hogging space on the hard-drive?And then, if the word ""penetration"" does not mean ""usage"", why should we trust what they have to say about the market ""penetration"" of their other products?And lastly, the September statement did not leave much room for ambiguity and which clearly aided the belief that we were indeed talking about market share.""Market leader"" ... means market leader, and not software sitting dormant on a hard drive. Qihoo needs to explain exactly what they mean by ""user penetration"" and ""market leader."" Microsoft was clearly the market leader at this time.The second half of this sentence is simply untrue, and it renders the first half not merely incomplete, but clearly misleading.And if we dial the clock back a bit more, we remember the statements made in the prospectus, where Qihoo had clearly been referring to the ""Monthly Active Users"" of its browser and claimed that its ""percentage of the then total Internet users in China"" came in at 44% for January 2011:This is difficult to reconcile with Baidu's statistics.Disclosure: I am short QIHU."
1167681,42041,2013-02-08T10:04:42-05:00,,"Though not widely reported, the Chinese government has issued a warning letter to Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) for unfair competition. The letter alleges that the company used its '360 Defender' security software to trick users into downloading its browser.The official warning letter, which was handed to Qihoo last week, has been made public by China's State Administration for Industry and Commerce (NYSE:SAIC).The warning letter reveals all the tactics Qihoo tried to trick people into installing its software. Here are some of the examples, all from the SAIC warning statement:Qihoo pulled the Microsoft-patch trick this past August. Through its '360 Defender' security software, it sent users what claimed to be a Microsoft Internet Explorer update patch titled KB360018 to fix an extremely dangerous security leak. Users who downloaded the patch were then forced to install Qihoo's 360 Browser.A warning letter from the government is better than nothing, but pretending to be Microsoft in order to spread your own software doesn't just sound like an unfair competition to me, it sounds like a deception.The government is not the first to raise issues over Qihoo's anti-competitive moves. Another Chinese Internet company Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), also sued Qihoo for unfair competition in the September last year, claiming that 360's release of Qihoo's ""KouKou Bodyguard"" security software in 2010 targeted and made modifications to its QQ instant-messaging software, causing the company to lose income from its value-added services and advertisements. Qihoo was also accused of deliberately overstating the volume of traffic to its website in order to attract more advertisers. Even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) decided to remove Qihoo's apps from the iTunes store for violating its terms of service.What's even more shocking is that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has set up a sales partnership with Qihoo. It will let Google, run ads alongside Qihoo search results. I can understand where Google is coming from; Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has been its main competitor in China, so Google is likely looking to work together with Qihoo to take on Baidu, but that strikes me as very shortsighted. In the long run, Qihoo will be another competitor for the search giant. Google has attained a respectable ground in China's search market by refusing to censor its results, but the partnership with Qihoo, could potentially wash all of it away.Regardless of what Google does, Chinese regulatory authorities should do more to safeguard users and shareholders from the trickery that is being perpetrated by Qihoo and other companies like it. I can understand that Qihoo is certainly not the only company that's pushing the regulatory envelope in China, but what Qihoo did in this particular case, was pretty aggressive.To be honest, I can't think of a case where the Chinese government has shut down a whole corporation, and I doubt that the government will want to go that far, but there is a first time for everything and investors should be wary for any signs that China may shut down Qihoo and put them in the red.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

627991,24258,2012-05-31T06:19:25-04:00,,"Last week Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd. (NYSE:QIHU) updated investors with its 2012 first quarter announcement. We now have key numbers to the revenue engine ‒ browser usage.That's monthly active users … and there are supposed to be 273 million of them. This is a tough one. China ended 2011 with 513 million Netizens, growing about 12% from the prior year. Can we then estimate that it grew 3% last quarter and not be too far off? If we were to believe Qihoo, then the percentage of monthly active browser users to the total number of Netizens in China would be 52% ‒ while Baidu statistics is reporting Qihoo's browser market share to be only 21%. And if we do not adjust for China's growth, then the gap is even wider.(click on charts to enlarge)Note that we are comparing Qihoo's ""monthly active users"" to the total number of internet users in China ‒ the same ratio that Qihoo presented in its prospectus:This SEC filing then shows Qihoo's 360 Safe Browser in the table. As you can see in the illustration below, its number was said to be 44% for January 2011; Baidu's statistics reports it to be 1%.I explained this market share crisis in my previous article: Qihoo's Browser: Rosy Claims In The Middle Of A Crisis. In short, there was a ""browser war"" in China and Qihoo got the worst of it. Here is a recap:Crisis? What Crisis? From Qihoo's prospectus ...No one is denying that market share was lost. Not even Qihoo. Here's what Qihoo had to say in their prospectus and 2011 20-F (emphasis mine):This was widely reported. Tencent is very popular and Qihoo got beat up. Caixin Online reported,However, the questions that concerns us right now are, Did Qihoo lie in its prospectus about January 2011?And crucial to answering that question is the answer to this one: How fast did Qihoo's user base return ""to its prior level""?I ask because ... Baidu and CNZZ both provide evidence that Qihoo's browser user base did not recover in time for the crucial month in the prospectus: January 2011. Here is a chart from CNZZ.How can we be sure that Qihoo's browser market share had not returned by the key month in the prospectus ‒ January 2011? Look at the simultaneously inverse gains and losses of market share for Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) IE browsers and Qihoo's 360 browser:As you can see, a large share of the market was suddenly available for Microsoft to pick up at the precise time that Qihoo's numbers drop. No surprise there; Qihoo itself admits to the date of this drop. But note that Qihoo takes back the numbers at precisely the same time that Microsoft loses them.According to Qihoo, the 360 Safe Browser eventually regained its market share. According to CNZZ, Qihoo picked up 18% in March 2011 … which means that someone else had to give up their share. Who had 18% to lose? Microsoft.In fact Microsoft and Qihoo combined had 85% of the market; all other browsers were only about 15%! Not enough for all of Qihoo's 18% market share recovery. But in any event these other, smaller browsers not only survived but their market share was relatively flat during this period. (here and here) There were no other players -- there was a nearly direct trade off in market share between Microsoft and Qihoo.And this trade off did not happen in January 2011.Microsoft sheds 20.5% in March 2011, while Qihoo picks up 18% this very same month. The simultaneous … mirror image trade off in market share gains and losses between Microsoft and Qihoo serve as an independent verification of the date of Qihoo's recovery. And it was not January 2011.To believe otherwise you have to say that Microsoft and CNZZ and Baidu were all in a conspiracy against Qihoo.Do we still need to ask if Qihoo lied in its prospectus about January 2011?If ""monthly active users"" ""as a percentage of the then total internet users in China"" means market share, then Qihoo's presented numbers cannot be true. If the words do not mean market share, then the numbers are not useful and, given the absence of an adequate explanation, they are misleading. Qihoo said they had 44% in January 2011. Baidu and CNZZ put them down for about 1%.Is this comedy or tragedy?

304064,20335,2011-11-01T13:46:04-04:00,,"Recent Market Cap: $ 2.5 Billion USD Last Quarter Revenue: $35.1 million Management: Disturbing Record of Deceit Outlook: Destined for Single Digits On May 2, 2011, Citron reported on Sky-Mobi (NASDAQ:MOBI) when the stock was $18. Citron placed a price target of $3 on the stock, pointing out the company's outdated business model and documenting its gross representations of itself to Wall St. Well, Sky-Mobi kicked and screamed. They held a conference call to refute our critique, and multiple analysts upgraded their stock ratings and raised targets. Not more than 4 months later, despite the protests, the MOBI traded at $3 — not because of Citron, but rather the inevitable fate of their business model's value.Citron explores today a company with many similarities, Qihoo 360 (NYSE:QIHU). We estimate that it is headed to $5 per share, more than 75% below its current trading range. Sky-Mobi and Qihoo have both intentionally misrepresented their businesses to Wall St in the hope of sustaining exaggeratedly high market capitalizations, but in both cases Citron's analysis points decisively to the conclusion that their best days are behind them, not in front of them.Qihoo went public at the right time. In the spring of 2011, all Chinese Internet stocks were entering bubble territory. Sina Corp. (NASDAQ:SINA) was approaching $150 per share and Yoku.com (NYSE:YOKU) was over $50. With scant revenues, Qihoo claimed some bold benchmarks in their prospectus and their most recent quarterly statement. Once you have read our findings, you will see those claims in a different light.Corporate HistoryQIHU publishes a browser that has gained considerable market share in China over the years because it is bundled with anti-virus software (In reality, this was simply a customized version of Google's Chrome, bundled with anti-virus technology mostly licensed from 3rd party providers, Qihoo's R&D has been historically minimal). In fact, 2008-2009 the company had generated the bulk of their revenues selling anti-virus protection, a revenue stream that rapidly dwindled to zero. After realizing that this was a dead-end business model, in the Q4 2009, QIHU began to give away its software, selling ads on its default home page and referring search requests to Google for a revenue share, as do thousands of other websites.So this is where they are today, a web 1.0 brand with a web 1.0 business model that is hoping (and claiming) to be moving into mobile, cloud computing, and search — all businesses in which they are years behind and have zero present-day market share.Before going into their revenues and business model, let's address those big market share numbers that are thrown in the face of the investment community on page 1 of their prospectus. Those numbers are greatly exaggerated or misleading to say the best. According to their prospectus and recent filings they claim :(Click to enlarge) It sounds impressive, but the problem is that it is so far from the truth.The Numbers That Really CountThe company boasts they have ""over 300 million active users"", ""80% penetration"", and are ""the 3rd largest Chinese internet company by active user base"". We find that, based on independent metrics, the truth shows no resemblance to that.What does their biggest customer think?More than 21% of QIHU's revenues are derived from Google, primarily be referring search queries. According to Doubleclick ad planner as powered by Google, 360.cn is the 21st most visited site in China with a reach of only 10%.(Note: There are many companies with higher rankings and dramatically lower valuations on this list. )For the sake of comparison in this report, we will compare Qihoo to Sohu (NASDAQ:SOHU) and PhFENG. Two publically traded Chinese Internet Companies who have ad based models similar to Qihoo.This 10% reach estimate would take 360.cn into only 30 to 40 million Chinese homes, not anywhere near the 300+ million they claim.But Google's AdSense ranking for QIHU's site is actually high next to Alexa, which shows 360.cn as the as the 35th ranked site in China.(FYI…for those of you who might be confused, 360buy.com is not related to QIHU, they just have similar names. )Further, SOHU also owns SOGOU.com (search dog), a site that also outranks QIHU's 360.cn on its own. (13th on Doubleclick ad planner, ranked 25th on Alexa).Valuation Comparison QIHU and SOHUNow look at the comparative valuations of SOHU and QIHU. SOHU is widely acknowledged as direct competition to QIHU. The below chart shows how ridiculous their comparative valuations are. We'll also look at FENG, which outranks QIHU on every metric, but in the same ballpark.* When comparing to SOHU, we have to credit SOHU's 67.1% ownership of CYOU, worth $600 to $885 million (enterprise value / market value times SOHU's percentage owned) in addition to SOHU's enterprise value for the balance of its business.CYOU's value to SOHU* What makes comparing these 2 companies even more ridiculous is the mindshare perspective. SOHU is number 7 on the Google Doubleclick ranking and number 9 on Alexa respectively. From point of few of internet ranking, the gap from #7 to #21 is massive – about 3 to 7-fold in terms of overall web presence. And in addition, SOHU owns 65% of SOGOU.com, a search site which on its own outranks QIHU in both Alexa and Doubleclick.Even the Mirae analyst admits when it comes to 360.cn growth:So when these numbers are reduced to a bottom line, here's what you get when you invest $1000 in each of these companies' stock:(Click to enlarge)For those of you who want to bang the table and say that QIHU should be given premium because it is not just an ad seller but rather they have security products, we included their arch nemesis Kingsoft.When comparing these companies, QIHU should be trading at $5 a share, if we are being generous .. very generous.In Management’s Own Words!I am sure many of you are saying, ""OK, Citron, that is the bear case, but what does management have to say about this?""Here is a link to an interview given by Zuoli Xu, CFO of QIHU along with Yu Yao, their VP, in which management admits their lack of a current compelling business model and describes their hopes for the future. When Citron reads this interview, it seems more like the banter of an internet startup company knocking on doors to raise money – not that of an established $2.5 billion dollar internet standard bearer.Can you Trust Top Leadership ? MUST READQIHU's CEO is a gentleman named Zhou Hongyi. Before he founded Qihoo, he founded a company called 3721 which became one of China's first search engines that he sold to Yahoo in 2003 for $120 million. "" But 3721′s software had become popular by lodging itself in computers as spyware. It introducing pop-windows, bedeviling its users — and some would say it introduced spyware into China.""Because of his ""arrogance"" and inability to hire English speaking workers and be trusted Zhou was forced out of Yahoo (YHOO), which as you can imagined ended in a series of lawsuits. Zhou Hongy's reputation to be trusted got so bad that in late 2010, before China Internet mania struck, it was though that Qihoo would never be able to go public because of their CEO, and the possibility that they have not left their spyware roots behind them. In something that we have never seen, Zhou's reputation got so soiled that Yahoo CEO encouraged western investors as recent as December 2010 ""not to trust his old acquaintance from China"".If Qihoo was a U.S. Internet company, it could never have gone public because of its litigation history and questions surrounding its business model. Citron's $5 is generous. Qihoo should actually be trading at a considerable discount to any comparable valuation strictly on the questionable nature of management's judgment, as described by Citron, but rather by many internet business leaders in China as well as the courts.As QIHU was preparing for its IPO, there corporate actions resembled those of a company fighting for its survival. The browser was losing market share and they were becoming insignificant in the rapidly changing face of the Chinese internet market. QIHU's choice of action was to try to muscle competitors off the desktop. Its installations forced users to uninstall competitor’s products, sometimes with misleading prompts. This led to a very ugly public squabble, with accusations of spying and leaking users private information, as well as deliberately releasing malware. As the attached link shows, QIHU went to war with leading instant message platform QQ (Tencent), a major anti-virus competitor Kingsoft, and search leader BIDU.Despite all of their public complaints, they wound up on the losing side of all three battles.The one lawsuit that foretells the desperation of management is one in which the QIHU CEO was sanctioned by China's courts for defaming Kingsoft's CEO on his personal blog in over 45 entries. The court ruling required him to pay damages and publish a letter apologizing and recanting his libelous claims.If these had been the actions of a U.S. company, it would NEVER have been allowed to IPO!RE Management — The bottom line is this: Given the utter lack of reach for U.S. regulatory agency protection of shareholders interests against malicious and deceptive corporate actions in China, can this person be trusted as the basis of an investment at all?Qihoo's “mobile” businessThe only thing more disturbing than skewed numbers are boldfaced lies. In both the prospectus and quarterly filing from the company refers to themselves as ""the leading mobile security provider in China"".Does anyone believe this?. Qihoo is not even a current participant in the mobile security space, aside from a claim last month to have launched mobile internet browsers. The fact is to date it has generated 0 revenue from mobile services. This fact is indisputable from the company's most recent 10-Q.We see no less than nine marketshare combatants in June 2011, with Qihoo nowhere to be seen. Is this a picture of ""leading China's nascent mobile device security market?So what is left here?Once you get past all the rhetoric and “netspeak,” you are left with a web 1.0 company that publishes a browser that at one time was getting a lot of installs, but is now hustling to try and find its place in a brutally competitive and fast changing internet landscape, out-invested and out-gunned by larger competitors.With no disruptive technology and no fast growing properties (such as Weibo, Yoku, or Q+) Qihoo has ... a browser ... that is it … plain and simple.For those of you who need a history lesson, a browser is not a business, it is a tool. The grandfather of all browsers Netscape is now shut down, and a non-profit company now owns its browser.A browser is not a business in the U.S. and it is not a business in China. Dong Xu, a researcher with Analysys International, states:""With the move from the wide-open web to semi-closed platforms in the digital world, web browsers, which don't tend to make money, are regarded by vendors largely as a means of making their main products available.""Qihoo's problem is that it doesn't have ""main products"". It simply tries to hustle sales of games and other links from its web traffic. And 3rd party statistics cast substantial doubt on Qihoo's claims of anywhere near as much browser penetration as they claim.And even for their one standing business being the browser, the bad news is that competition has come to town. Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), a company with over 75% of the search market has recently launched their own browser that has a focus on internet security.BIDU's new browser is being released to cement its position as the unquestioned leader in search, much as Google developed Chrome to make sure it had a foothold with web surfers, not to generate a revenue stream, but to assure Google's hold on the search business.ConclusionCitron plans to follow up this QIHU story with a part 2 that will focus on the plethora of misinformation presented to the pubic from the many investment banking firms covering QIHU. Much like MOBI, we were amazed to read the many analysts reports that have simply repeated management's hopes for the future as though it were independent analysis.We look forward to their strident defense of this name, and hope they present some data more substantive than management's hopeful narrative. We suggest independent investors seek out and give more weight to independent data points especially those that would verify the range of Qihu's real revenues, and less to company stated ""future plans,"" expecially where those plans have generated no revenues.Cautious investing to all."
308253,20335,2011-11-16T05:20:57-05:00,,"For those of you who read part 1 of our analysis on Qihoo (NASDAQ:QIHU), we compared the company to Sky-Mobi (NASDAQ:MOBI) as operating a web 1.0 business that is presently misunderstood by the marketplace. From the company's rebuttal, we conclude Qihoo is not so much like MOBI; it might be a lot more like China MediaExpress (OTCPK:CCME).Our intended part 2 on QIHOO was planned to focus on the naïve analyst commentary and the dubious history of management. But all that has become a sideshow to what our research found, so hold on to your seat and call your class action attorney.While Qihoo does in fact have penetration in the free anti-virus software business — that we do not question — the rest of the business seems to be nothing more than an illusion that defies validation by any third party source. Either Qihoo has some magic pill that neither we nor the major players in the China internet space know about, or this is a fraud.There are a number of chilling parallels to China MediaExpress in QIHU's current business model. We suggest that investors and analysts — especially those who are quick to proclaim ""Citron doesn't get it"" — read this report with an open mind.The main criticism of the initial Citron report was that we did not understand Qihoo's business model and therefore we could not draw a comparative valuation to any other business. The analysts describe Qihoo as a ""master aggregator."" We get that. They say they generate a lot of web traffic.Giving away free software is not a business…let's call that a hobby. A business generates revenue. If you don’t believe us, just read QIHU's prospectus:So advertising is how they generate their revenues, and that is consistent with their revenue mix disclosure last quarter.The company states that they generate this advertising revenue by posting links through their portal site.Qihu's homepage, shown below, resembles dozens or hundreds of other web directory / navigation sites which are very popular in China. Here are just a few:http://www.2345.com/http://www.265.com/http://www.1616.net/?www2http://www.tao123.com/ (taobao)http://www.wu123.com/http://www.0460.com/http://www.91913.cn/http://www.44244.com/default.htmlhttp://www.9991.com/http://www.537.com/http://www.5566.net/http://www.zgwdq.com/http://www.46.com/http://www.176176.com/http://www.155.com/http://www.haokan123.com/http://www.129139.com/http://www.wndhw.com/You can see they're all very similar (English speakers can get a pretty good sense of these using Google translate). In fact there's a fierce battle for domain-brand identity. In Qihoo's case, their portal is hao.360.cn. It is not hao360.com or hao360.cn, which appear to belong to others.These sites typically focus on link traffic, not brand (display) advertising. Companies that pay for links on these are paying out of their advertising budgets - their online advertising budgets. Qihoo classifies this as ""advertising revenue."" We get that - do you?Some analysts and commentators have been comparing Qihoo to Baidu. This is fatally flawed logic. Baidu also operates a directory / portal (hao123.com), but it is such a small part of the business that they don't break out its revenues or costs separately. Baidu's primary business is search, which is proven to be a highly profitable business model — at least for the winner in a winner-take-all category.Qihoo's pre-eminent revenue generator is their flagship portal and within that domain, their PSPs (users can personalize their own start page). Linked to that are their vertical niche portal pages. Together, these sites generate 100% of Qihoo's current revenue.Below is a screen shot of Qihoo's flagship revenue driver HAO.360.CN :There are appx 200 links on this page. But how much revenue is generated from this site, and who is paying what? We are supposed to believe that this site is generating over $40 million revenues this quarter, and further, is growing at a rate that outstrips all the major players in the China internet space, raising serious questions about its credibility.Below is a screenshot of the same site 21 months ago when it was generating less than $10 million per qtr. in revenues:Feb 12, 2010 (QIHU revs of $9 million in that quarter):And last, the same page from early 2009, when it was generating only $3 mil a quarter in online revenues:A few less links, but essentially identical in structure and function. So exactly how did revenues increase 400% from last year and 1200% from two years ago? The quantity of links certainly hasn’t increased 400%. We have no verification that traffic has increased anything near 400%. Have the ad rates gone up 400%?For that matter, are there even verifiable ad rates for this page? Below is a list of advertisers on the front page of HAO.360 that we believe do not pay QIHOO one dime.Further, of these well-known Chinese brands, some of whom directly compete with Qihoo for games or traffic, isn't there a serious business issue requiring disclosure as to how much they are paying for links?Our favorite of the ""advertisers"" is West Point Military Academy (look in the ""Military academies"" section, left column, 4th row). Yep, that's it, right next to the link to the ""U. S. National Defense University.""Qihoo recently launched an ""e-commerce aggregator page"" which sounds exciting.OK, so let's look under the hood at this page. It is filled with logos of global companies you will recognize: Nokia, Samsung, Motorola, Sony, Sharp, Giordano, Reebok, Converse, Puma, Nike, Lee and many others. Ask on the conference call how much revenue this page generates for the company. We did.Despite the lack of revenue, here's a selection of logos displayed on Qihoo's ""mall"" page:The creepy thing is this is exactly what CCME's strategy was. In order to convince investors that it was a huge advertising channel, it produced a small number of copies of a very glossy catalog filled with logos from top-name brands like Coach, Lexus, and Coca-Cola.Here are some screen shots from Citron's 3 favorite pages out of CCME's ""Investor Presentation, October 2010:""Qihoo’s other sites are the following 4 vertical portals, for group buying, video, games, mini games, and literature. They are merely aggregators and the company has told us that none of them except games represents more than 3% of revenues:Wan.360.cn - GamesTuan.360.cn - Group BuyingXiaoyouxi.360.cn – MinigamesXiaoshou.360.cn – LiteratureAn early sign for us that China Media Express was a fraud was simply the incredible pace that they were growing revenues and profits compared to their well-known competition.During the trailing twelve months, both SINA and SOHU have grown their top line revenue around 23%. Both companies have diversified revenue streams and a PROVEN internet footprint. During the same trailing twelve months we are supposed to believe that Qihoo has grown their revenue 400%?Yet, just like China Media Express, none of their pre-eminent competitors even considers them competition. Qihoo fancies themselves as competition for BIDU. Yet in its own filings, BIDU describes their competition as:SOHU, who recently launched a popular browser and who also sells games, lists their competition this way:SINA, who describes themselves as an internet portal and fights for ad dollars as well, voluminously defines their competition as:What sticks out like a sore thumb is that Qihoo says they are the #3 internet company in China by active user base, the #1 provider of internet and mobile security solutions by active user base, and sport a user penetration rate of 92%, yet the aforementioned companies list everyone as their competition except Qihoo, of course.So we are supposed to believe that the 3rd largest internet company in China with revenues growing at 400% a year has just been forgotten about by their competition? Sounds very CCME- like to us.Exposing CCME was difficult because nowhere online was there ever a compilation or ranking of their competitive sector (video advertisers on intercity buses in China). In the case of Qihoo, there are plenty.We scoured the internet to try to find just one list that would have hao.360.cn or any Qihoo site in their top rankings of internet traffic, to no avail. Look for yourself:http://www.chinarank.org.cn/http://www.edu.cn/20010101/22272.shtmlhttp://371.li/cn/http://top.chinaz.com/In Qihoo's rebuttal, we learn that we cannot use Alexa or Google Doubleclick to judge Qihoo's traffic, because their toolbar is incompatible with Alexa. Then who are we supposed to use? We challenge anyone to find one independent piece of research that would rank HAO.360 as a significant player. We cannot, and neither can their “competition.” Besides the commissioned iResearch report, prepared for Qihoo's IPO, are there any other lists that rank Qihoo's sites in the top 5 in China in terms of traffic?What makes all of this even more ludicrous is just like CCME, Qihoo doesn’t even have an online media kit. Sina and Sohu both have online media kits to be explored by potential advertisers, but Qihoo’s link tells potentials to just “send them an email” - very CCME like.SOHU's: http://ad.sohu.com/adprice/SINA's: http://emarketing.sina.com.cn/But QIHU's is only this: http://hao.360.cn/mkt.html (eg. ""Send us an email"")We have made a strong case why the advertising revenue volume at Qihoo just does not add up – either to their competitors or us. Yet, it is in an SEC filing so it has to be true, no? In our last but most telling comparison to CCME we have the auditor.Qihoo is audited by none other than Deloitte Touche in China. Deloitte was also the auditor of CCME and most notably, Citron-exposed fraud Longtop Financial. Anyone who follows the saga of Chinese stocks knows that Deloitte China recently refused to cooperate in an investigation by the SEC of Longtop and is being taken to federal court by the SEC.We will follow through with Deloitte Touche and make sure their auditors are aware of the many ""holes"" in Qihoo's story.Today, QIHU reports earnings. We are confident that, despite the warnings and cautious guidance from the pre-eminent Chinese internet companies, whose revenues are largely dependent on advertising, they will put up a topline number that will beat analyst estimates. This is reminiscent of CCME’s last Q in 2010 when they put up record numbers and raised guidance.All this will be oblivious to the strong headwinds in the online advertising space in China. No one questions that SINA's Weibo is among the “hottest” internet properties in China. But last week SINA CEO Charles Chao was cautious on online ad spending as he said on a conference call, ""Overall, the sentiment is good but not great based on our assessment … There may be some increase (in advertising spending), but not significant.”So we are supposed to believe that SINA is not seeing significant increases in online ad spend yet Qihoo is able to grow their top line 30% per quarter, but no one in China seems to know about it? Which leads us to our next point.As investors, we are fortunate that QIHU will host a conference call today. Here are some questions that must be addressed as the company needs to give more transparency to their “business model”:In order to justify its current market cap, Qihoo must both make transparent its revenue growth to date, but also justify 300% — 400% revenue growth over the next year.Citron acknowledges that Qihoo found a niche when it offered anti-virus software for free in China. Its product was downloaded by a remarkable number of China's internet population. But to become a business, it had to establish true cash flow out of something it gave away for free. Qihoo's current efforts resemble more a hall of mirrors than a roadmap to the future. Investors should be extremely wary of investing in a multi-billion dollar valuation to a story as thin as this one.Cautious investing to all.Disclosure:  As of the date of publication, Citron is short QIHU, long SINA and SOHU. Its positions can and do change at any time without further disclosure."
261529,24145,2011-04-03T09:24:24-04:00,,"On Friday, April 1, 2011 Qihoo 360 Technology’s (NYSE:QIHU) closing market cap was $3.5 billion, up 159% from the price range mid-point market cap on Monday of $1.35 billion, at an $11.50 share price.  On Wednesday, QIHU IPO’d at $14.50 and later in the day almost touched $36.  The stock closed Friday at $29.50Perhaps QIHU will ask how their underwriters could make such a big pricing error.  The answer is supply and demand, of course.Moonshots seldom, if ever happen, with IPOs in the $500 million and higher range. That’s because with larger IPOs, investment bankers can more easily judge institutional demand.  QIHU’s IPO on Monday, at the price range mid-point, was only $139 million, on the smaller side.Three previous China deals are still trading below their IPO prices, Zuoan Fashion Ltd. (ZA), Trunkbow  International Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:TBOW) and BCD Semiconductor Manufacturing  Ltd. (NASDAQ:BCDS).  Plus, there have been well publicized accounting issues with some Chinese companies.So investment bankers wanted to make sure the QIHU IPO got done.  Their initial price range mid-point valued QIHU at 84 times annualized earnings for the December quarter and 154 times earnings for the 12 months ended December 31, 2010, which seemed reasonable at the time.However, at Friday’s closing, QIHU sold at 407 times trailing 12 months, and 216 times annualized earnings for the December quarter.  What happened?The initial spike the day of the IPO (Wednesday) was probably generated from ‘buy at the market’ orders, in general not a good idea in the immediate IPO aftermarket.  Holders of the stock at the end of the week were apparently willing to pay a very high price for a Chinese Internet market leader.QIHU knows how to monetize Chinese internet eyeballs through advertising and, at the same time, maintain very high gross profit margins and net profit margins, 88% & 20% respectively for  the December quarter -- a tough proposition.  QIHU also impressed investors with 71% of its December quarter’s revenue generated by advertising.What’s next?  QIHU is walking on a very high wire, where a misstep can be costly to investors.  It will be interesting to see March quarter results.  Based on how QIHU’s stock is acting, results better be on the blowout upside.  If not -- look out below.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
328832,25070,2012-01-31T13:42:24-05:00,,"With the public announcement that the long awaited IPO of Facebook is finally imminent, there has been a sudden irrational enthusiasm for stocks in the Internet space. Frankly, in our opinion, it is somewhat frightening and it could be a trap for the less than savvy investor. For Facebook is the primo and arguably most used social networking website in the world. The sympathy rally in this market space in anticipation of one particular IPO would be akin to saying that Mercedes Benz is related to Schwinn bicycles simply because they both manufacture forms of personal transportation.As with all herd mentality trades, there are opportunities to short over priced, under-performing, irrelevant Internet companies. Starting from the bottom up, we would like to point out Qihoo 360 Technology Co. (NYSE:QIHU) and recommend this as a short sell. This is an Internet company that operates solely in China as a third party seller of software products. The holding company is based in the Cayman Islands and has three subsidiaries in Hong Kong which are listed and traded here in the U.S. via reverse merger. If this does not cause a raised eyebrow please keep reading because the auditor associated with Qihoo is the same one used in two other reverse merger investor disasters, China MediaExpress (OTCPK:CCME) and Longtop Financial (NYSE:LFT).Qihoo's core product is Internet security software. That industry is perpetually re-inventing itself as newer more sophisticated threats come on line. The chance of its core revenue product becoming irrelevant in that market place is significant. If you look at its website the home page is about as mish-mosh as Craigslist and about as engaging. Thus traffic it claims to be generating by selling advertising revenue is completely suspect.Looking at the financial statements closely, the revenue growth is much higher than would seem possible given this economic environment. From the year ending 2008 through 2009 they claim total revenue growth of 91%, and then a 79% increase from 2009 through 2010. Any revenue growth of this type should always be questioned yet somehow is not, nor is it explained. These rates of growth are unreasonable given the economic climate, even if this sector were growing faster than the overall economy. During these same periods, cost of revenue grew a mere 2% the dropped 20% respectively.As well, R&D expenses increased 130% from 2009 to 2010. Some increase in R&D expenses is justifiable when trying to grow the business, but this magnitude of increase does not on the surface appear to be reasonable, and again there is no material explanation. We would ask that the auditors look at this closely. Perhaps regular operating expenses have been misclassified in order smooth out cost of revenues (not including SG&A and R&D). The R&D expenses could be viewed by some as nonrecurring and not factored in certain valuation models used by investors.Finally, gross margin is -18% in 2008, whereas it is curiously similar in 2009 and 2010 at +14% and +16% respectively. Any remarkable improvement in gross margin should be scrutinized particularly when the company issued an F1 filing seeking to issue more shares. Even with a sudden, drastic shift of business model, it would be unreasonable to expect these kinds of improvements in numbers.We are not the only people to question this. Having no relationship with the group Deliotte-Watch; its website here poignantly illustrates concerns regarding material overstatements of revenue and understatements of expenses.Additionally, the author having no relationship with Citron Research finds the answers to questions directed to the CFO Alex Xu from shareholders on the recent conference call do nothing to quell insecurity regarding the lack of integrity that is highlighted (here).Unfortunately, getting a feel on this stock to short can be tricky. However as we went to print on this story, option volatility was at 68%, which is on the steep side historically, thus the risk of a volume explosion and premium pop out is muted. Selling naked calls is not everyone's cup of tea, however, it is an easy collection of premium as the markets sort out value and prices regain sanity. If selling calls is beyond your risk appetite, in the money puts will be a safe bet to profit from the correction as the price begins to spiral lower.The stock has been trending lower in almost a perfect trend channel since last June, and is recently melting up toward the top of its resistance channel. After failing and stalling if it is lucky enough to trade near $19, we would recommend short selling what you can. We believe the fair value of this stock to be somewhere between $6-$7.50 share and not the $18.11 it settled at on last Friday.With a price to book ratio of $951 and price to sales ratio of $36.55 when compared to the single digit ratios in of its counterparts in China such as Sohu.com (NASDAQ:SOHU), Sina (NASDAQ:SINA) and Shanda Interactive (NASDAQ:SNDA), we cannot understand how the price of this stock can remain at these levels.We recommend short selling of QIHU.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in QIHU over the next 72 hours."
1256961,40031,2013-03-07T15:39:27-05:00,,"Qihoo 360 Technology Co Ltd (NYSE:QIHU) has been a high flyer in last six months. It is up 130% since early August 2012, when it reached its all-time low price. The rise came with the announcement that the company is entering the search market to rival Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), which practically had a monopoly in the Chinese search engine market up to that time. Qihoo 360 released earnings this week that beat estimates, but the stock went down sharply, because the management said that the company faces margin pressure, because they will invest heavily to gain share in the Chinese search market.Q4 2012 highlightsThe year 2012 was very successful for Qihoo 360. The company introduced new performance-based advertising services and launched a search engine. At the end of 2012, they launched an internal search monetization system, and in early January 2013 the company began to cooperate with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in search monetization. At the same time, they are building their own search advertising network and a search traffic union.Total monthly active users of Qihoo 360's PC-based products and services reached 456 million compared to 402 million a year ago. Total smartphone users of mobile security products reached 207 million compared to 53 million a year ago, and the management said in the conference call that they hold over 70% of the marketing share.Revenue in the fourth quarter was $103 million, an increase of 65% over the same period last year, and well above analyst views of $93.68 million. The strong growth was driven by growth of both online advertising and internet value-added services. Adjusted EPS was $0.22, and analysts were expecting $0.17.Revenue guidance for the next quarter was also above analyst estimates. The company expects $104.5 million to $106.5 million revenue, which is above $98.88 million analysts are currently expecting.The main culprit for the share drop after reporting earnings was shrinking margins. The management stated that this is due to heavily increased investment in the mobile internet and search, and that they aim to reach 20% search market share this year. Adjusted net margin was 29.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 37.9% in the same period a year before. The management expects gradual margin improvement with the development of the search business. They expect to reach the long term adjusted net margin target of 40% in a few years.Qihoo 360 currently has an 84.05 trailing PE; forward PE is 19.58 with a PEG ratio of 0.71.ConcernsChinese government has issued a warning letter for unfair competition in late January. The letter says that Qihoo tried to trick people into installing its software.At the same time, Qihoo's apps were removed from the iTunes store with no explanation supplied. This is not the first time for Qihoo's apps to be removed from iTunes. They were removed last year for several days because of ""unusually high numbers of positive/negative feedback by unknown sources"".Muddy Waters and Citron have attacked Qihoo's business practices. Muddy Waters accused Qihoo for diverting commissions to other accounts within its 360 browser.CompetitionBaidu Inc. is in a downtrend since its peak in mid-2011. Main cause for the drop is a deceleration of growth, as shown in the chart below. Baidu has a trailing PE of 18.99; forward PE is 13.34, with a quite low PEG ratio of 0.58. Baidu also has great potential, but it must end the downtrend it is in since mid-2011. It presents a tremendous value opportunity for long term investors. The growth levels have come down, but it is still growing at quite higher rates given the current valuation. You can read more about Baidu in my December article.BIDU data by YChartsPrice actionQihoo's share price came close to its all time highs before reporting earnings. It cleared a recent consolidation at the same time, but quickly came back to the $30 to 33$ range it was in since early January. It is now for the second time in two weeks at the key support level - the 50 day moving average line. A bounce of the 50 day moving average line in above average volume would be very positive for the stock, and then it might try to reach new highs for the year and new all time highs it reached at the time of the IPO in late March 2011. At the same time, the $30 price level seems to be really significant, and it would not be good for the stock to breach that level, at least in the short term.Source: StockchartsConclusionQihoo 360 made significant progress in 2012, and continues its growth efforts in 2013. Search market penetration might prove as crucial for the company in 2013, and will determine if the company can compete with Baidu after getting the starting market share in search. It is very important to do so, in order to monetize and leverage the vast investment efforts it plans to make this year. It also must put the fairness concerns behind it in order to gain investor and user trust. On the technical side, support at the 50 day moving average line, and the $30 level might prove as key areas of support in the near term.Disclosure: I am long QIHU.

312597,20335,2011-12-08T07:59:23-05:00,,"Note to Readers: The intent of this research is not to cause short term volatility in the trading of the stock. Citron believes the following research is worthy to be placed in the public domain so all investors can make investment decisions based on reading and considering carefully all available information.Citron has developed a tremendous volume of forensic research on Qihoo 360 (Nasdaq:QIHU), and has concluded that the company has either not been forthright about their revenue model to Wall St., or there is a financial fraud unfolding. Citron has received numerous comments on its previous writings on Qihoo, mostly to the effect that ""Citron doesn't understand, "" ""Citron doesn't understand China,"" ""Citron doesn't understand the internet,"" ""Citron doesn't understand the future,"" etc.One thing Citron does understand is math. Math is universal: 1 + 1 = 2, in the US, Antarctica, Mars, and yes, China. And Qihu's numbers don't even come close to adding up … in any universe.QIHU reported 47.5 million USD in topline revenues and guides next quarter to 55 million USD. What do we know about these revenues?The company states that 75% of its advertising revenue is generated on its homepage hao.360.cn. It further states that appx $4 million was generated from referring search to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).Qihoo Revenue Analysis for its Most Recent Quarter What we know: Homepage advertising link revenue is the largest component of Qihoo's revenue. The Company sells links on this page on a fixed fee per month basis. The company states that the fees vary based on the customer's business type. Yet it was extremely challenging to find the single most important metric : The average advertising revenue per paid link.We read everything we could find on Qihu, to no avail. But finally, in a single analyst report by Macquarie (the only one that seems to reflect any detailed knowledge of the company's actual business model) we read:This was published on August 29th, and notes it was after ""the company raised its ad prices by 20% – 25% sequentially in Q1 2011"". Of course an average is an average — some links will be be priced higher, and others lower. To make the math easy we will run the estimates on $225,000 RMB per month, a little more than $100,000 USD per paid advertiser per quarter.It is easy to see what sites are paid because they have tracking URL's attached to them; thereby the advertiser can judge the effectiveness of the campaign. Links such as Hotmail, Vogue, CNTV sports, are displayed, as in all the Chinese directory home pages, for free, for user convenience. Citron has made a heat map so investors can see how many links on the HAO.360.CN page are tracked, untracked, or lead to another 360 company page. Here is the current hao.360.cn homepage, which generates for 75% of Qihoo's ad revenue.GREEN: Tracked Link to a 3rd party website.RED: Link to another 360.cn or qihoo.com page – a Qihoo company pageYELLOW: Untracked link, presumed free.With this key, let's look at QIHU's homepage again [ images]:There are about 92 green links on this page; however many are duplicates and dispatch clicks to the same domain. Eliminating links to Google (paid separately) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), there remain about 60 – 65 links with tracking IDs to the websites of 3rd party entities. (There are about 9 links to Taobao.com, which Qihoo claims is now about 10% of Qihoo's revenue; presumably these are at the high end of the scale of revenue per link.)This is what we assume are the paid links. UBS verifies this by publishing a list of Qihoo's paid links in its Nov 17th note, totaling about 65. UBS includes several untracked links in their list, but for now let's not quibble about details. UBS's list very closely matches the spreadsheet we compiled with all the links from the hao.360.cn homepage here.An interview with competitor 2345.com confirmed that around 60 links on their homepage are sold and they believe the same to be with their competition.This is a very similar pattern to Baidu's directory page hao123.com:So now we try to construct a picture of Qihu's homepage revenue:Exactly where is the $20 million in advertising revenue from the home page, or anything even close to it?We expect the company will now claim that many of the non-tracked links are paid. This would be very challenging to believe, as anyone paying real money for a link would want to track the traffic generated. And we would need an additional 130 paid advertisers on the home page. Who are they? (We wanted to ask this pivotal question on the conference call but the company would only take questions from their “cheerleading” analysts.)Or calculating in the reverse direction:Neither the company nor any of its analysts, nor any of the numerous mainline ad agencies in China nor any of Qihoo's competitors, have ever quoted an advertising rate for a web traffic link in China within an order of magnitude of this astronomical number.Now we try to construct a picture of Qihu's non-homepage and non-game revenue (the other 25% of advertising revenue): Citron was able to procure a contract for a non-home page link. We were quoted a rate of $20,000 RMB per month, which seemed reasonably within expectations, as rates fall off rapidly because traffic is much lower by any measure on pages only linked from the home page.Who are these customers? Citron has searched all pages on 360.cn and QIHOO.com and cannot come anywhere close to a number approaching 700. Some of the 360.cn linked pages have only one customer…or none.Qihoo runs a game directory page, which is extremely similar in appearance to those run by many major competitors, for example Sohu (NASDAQ:SOHU) and RenRen (NYSE:RENN):What isn't similar is the astonishing revenue per customer Qihoo claims in their last quarterly report.These revenue numbers are simply absurd. Nobody in the games business, in China or the US or anywhere, generates $53.00 per month per paying customer – not NetEase (NTES), not Changyou (CYOU) and not Shanda Interactive (SNDA). Other Chinese games vendors report ARPUs about $3 to $8 per month USD. Zynga generates about $1.00 to $4.00 per month per paying customer, depending on which number you compute. Even the ""gold standard"" Blizzard International, whose World of Warcraft is in a league of its own for online gaming, charges US and European gamers, who typically pay far more than Chinese gamers, $15/month for subscription.And nobody in China is growing games revenues at 47% quarter over quarter. For comparison, RenRen, one of the hottest properties on the internet, grew games revenue at 26.3% year over year, and Shanda, one of China's largest game companies, increased revenue just 3.7% quarter over quarter.Like the advertising revenue numbers, these numbers are simply not believable either. Yet the analysts simply nod and offer the perfunctory ""great quarter, guys!""Citron has no idea how the company will even attempt to explain this glaringly unbelievable revenue per player number. Too bad not one analyst on the call even asked about it!Citron has presented a compelling case as to why the current business of QIHU can be questioned. Yet, the multiples afforded to the stock by analysts are obviously not based on their current business but rather their future business, which is all predicated on the web traffic generated from their homepage — both in its generic and ""personalized"" forms.Even though the analysts don't agree on how Qihoo will generate money in the future, the one thing they all agree on is that its current revenue depends solely on internet traffic generated through its website. Therefore the company should be taking extra steps to clarify and make transparent 3rd party verification of the reach, penetration, and page views they claim. But instead, the company does the opposite.Citron first challenged Qihoo's hao.360.cn homepage traffic claims because the industry standard measurements of internet traffic – including Alexa, Google, CNZZ, and Comscore — all report ranges of lower penetration, reach and traffic rankings than the company's paid-for statistics from iResearch. The company's defense was that ""Citron doesn't understand"" the internet – because the company's anti-virus software prevents all analytic tools from being installed on a user's computer.All tools except of course those from iResearch and their 200,000 sample size.Wait a minute! What kind of excuse is this? How is it that Qihoo's software coexists with iResearch's monitoring tool, but can't coexist with Alexa? Does anyone seriously consider Alexa's voluntarily installed toolbar to be malware? Like all anti-virus software, Qihoo's anti-virus updates the desktop without user intervention, so the company could easily change its software to make it Alexa compatible any time it wanted. The fact that the company actively prevents any independent verification of web traffic metrics remains a huge red flag for this company. This is not Citron's issue, it is Qihoo's issue. In the real world, this limitation would impose a huge obstacle for a company trying to sell web advertising.This should make any interested investor question the depth of the relationship between iResearch and Qihoo.Each of the analysts covering Qihoo seems to present a different idea of what business Qihoo is in and where the company is headed. One says its ""mobile"" (which won't be monetized before 2014), one says it's ""search"" as though they operate in a fantasy world where they could turn on a switch and compete with Baidu. Another says it's going to operate an app-store with an interface copied from iPhone. The only thing these three strategies have in common is that all of them currently generate zero revenue for Qihoo.Citron will not address search, mobile, or desktop platform because the company has generated no revenues nor presented any notable proprietary technology. The analysts involved in the name do not even have a cohesive story as to where this company will be in 3 years — every analyst describes the company's future differently.The truth is Qihoo's revenues come nearly 100% from what can only be called ""Web Directory Services"". They devised a clever low-cost strategy to give away anti-virus software as an indirect method to entice internet users to their home page. But they generate no revenue from the anti-virus software, and no revenue from their browser.But this model — ""get in front of the eyeballs"" — is hardly new. We can observe the same in the early days of the internet in the US, where the gold rush was on for eyeballs and clicks, and of course Wall Street's dollars.AltaVista, Lycos, Excite, anyone? Does anyone even remember these web directory businesses? Billions of investors' dollars went into them, all of which was vaporized. Why? Because they provided neither durable content nor services, they quickly ebbed into the background. They were mostly a short-run and shallow land rush to ""get in front"" of the user's internet experience. Look at what happened to the US Web Directories — they are a virtual internet graveyard. Even Qihoo's biggest cheerleader Mirae says:So where does that leave Qihoo?Citron has commented on the incredibly shoddy analyst work on this stock, but in our opinion, the work of Mirae goes even farther, to professional malpractice. For a firm that writes glossies on QIHU nearly every week, we find the most disturbing pattern of promotional claims without foundation that we have ever seen from an investment banking firm.Mirae will probably want to comment on this piece as well, so we thought we'd offer them some topics to address. Mirae has raised its 2013 topline revenue estimates for Qihu twice just in November.This topline number which includes no breakdown or financial basis looks like this:The Mirae analyst's work reveals the following gross deficiencies:Instead of analysis, Mirae publishes screen shots of a mockup of a yet-unreleased Google product and claim that because Qihoo has hired an unidentified former senior Google employee, that Qihoo will be able to monetize this unreleased technology in 2012. Note that the product sketch simply clutters up the user's screen with more ads – exactly the opposite strategy of Qihoo's homepage. The mockup's main feature is a product price comparison, which would itself be an anathema to Qihoo's main e-commerce advertising customers.Don't believe us? Have a look here: Mirae Nov 15th.The US Securities and Exchange Commission has a long history of regulatory enforcement actions against analysts and other 3rd party enablers of stock promotion who issue ""baseless or unfounded revenue projections"". Literally dozens of regulatory links against firms and individuals for this practice have been filed over the years. Here are just a few examples:http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2008/lr20644.htmhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp17674.htmhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2007/comp20375.pdfhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16456.htmhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr17050.htmhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2010/lr21565.htmhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/complr17300.htmhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr20940.htmhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16924.htmhttp://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/comp18652.htmCitron believes Mirae Research is publishing thinly disguised reports on Qihoo that are in fact promotional materials masquerading behind the appearance of ""analyst coverage"", and is worthy of immediate SEC enforcement scrutiny for stock promotion activities.Based on the data presented above, and the interviews we conducted to gather it, it is Citron's belief that Qihoo's current web directory business is generating far less in revenue than the company is reporting.Its presence in China's web market is, by the company's own choice, opaque to third party metrics. Its advertising links are sold only by a small sales staff, not any of China's many agencies that would represent major advertisers. There is no pricing transparency. There is no media kit, typical of major online advertising providers. We are told that their rates are soaring, but e-commerce revenue and investment in China is currently being crushed due to brutal price competition and logistics pressures. We are told there is an ""auction process"" driving ad rates higher, but there is no auction functionality. In short, nothing about Qihoo's main line of revenue is independently verifiable. That was a common problem among several dozen US-traded China stocks halted and delisted in the last year.But even if Qihoo's revenues were reported accurate to the penny, the company is still overvalued by a factor of 4 or 5 x.Analyst claims that Qihoo could be in search, or could be in mobile, or could be a leading app store, are patently ridiculous. Qihoo has no more claims on those highly competitive spaces than Citron. It is pure fiction. Qihoo is no more likely to be able to compete with Baidu in search than Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) money-losing attempt to compete with Google.What Qihoo does have is a web directory, which competes with other web directories for advertising dollars. The company's topline would have to double and double again just to grow into its current valuation.You could say that the last standing monetizable ""directory"" in the US is Yahoo. Of course Yahoo offers a lot more than a menu to web services, it has tons more content than Qihoo. But even so, when you strip out its other equity positions, the multiple afforded by the market for its advertising revenue is about 1:1. For Qihoo, we're talking 14:1 or higher (even if you believe their highly questionable numbers).If Qihoo makes sufficient metrics available to allow independent verification of its claimed web penetration and reach, and if Qihoo were to provide transparency to its advertising revenue sources so that a credible revenue model could be built, Citron would generously afford a 2:1 multiple on its current revenue run rate to the company. This plus the company's cash yields a price target of about $5.00 per ADR.Cautious Investing to All.Note to all readers : This report is not to be misunderstood as Citron holding any antipathy toward China or China investments. Citron believes the China investing space (especially China-domiciled companies trading in US markets) is subject to extreme risks due to the absence of independent 3rd party verification and regulatory remedies for corporate misbehavior at all levels. This condition is similar to the US market before the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934, which set the standard for investor protection that underpins the US equity market. There will be successes and failures in this space, and as the market matures, the worst ones will tend to be washed out.Disclosure: As of the date of publication, the editor of this report is short QIHU for the reasons stated above, and long SINA and SOHU."

QIHU priced their 12.11 million share IPO at $14.50, well above the expected range of $10.50-12.50. All of the shares being offered are primary shares, which the company plans to use for development of new internet and mobile security products and services; for the enhancement of their research and development capability to further develop technologies; the acquisition of technologies, products or businesses; and for working capital purposes. The $14.50 IPO price values the company with a market capitalization of approximately $1.69B. The offering was led by UBS and Citi.Founded in 2005, the company has grown rapidly through the offering of internet and mobile security products free of charge. They have grown their monthly active internet users from 122M in Dec. 2008 to 339M in Jan. 2011, representing a user penetration rate in China of 85.8%. They monetize this large user base through offering online advertising and internet value-added services. Their products and services are supported by their cloud-based security technology.Competitors include anti-virus companies such as Beijing Kingsoft Security Software Co. and Beijing Rising Information Technology Co. Their biggest competitor in the value-added services and online advertising is Tencent Holdings (OTCPK:TCTZF), the largest instant message service provider in China. As of Jan. 2011, Tencent’s instant message software had a user penetration rate of 89.3%, while Qihoo’s 360 Safe Guard had a penetration rate of 76.9%.Revenue has grown from $16.9M in 2008 to $57.7M in 2010. Online advertising service accounted for 67.3% of their total revenue in 2010. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) was their largest customer in 2010, representing 21% of their total revenue. Net margin in 2010 was 14.7%, up from 12.9% in 2009.While the few Chinese companies to come public in 2011 have had lackluster debuts (CDM, BCDS, TBOW, and ZA), many of the Chinese internet companies to come in the last 6 months of 2010 were some of the top performing IPOs of the year. This includes such names as CCIH, DANG, SFUN and YOKU, which were up between 73% and 161% on their first day of trading. With enormous demand on this offering (we are hearing books were north of 30x oversubscribed), QIHU joins the ranks of these other top performers on day one of trading.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in QIHU within the next 72 hours."

260994,23395,2011-03-30T15:47:18-04:00,,"Founded by former executives of Yahoo! (YHOO) China, this  young company offers Internet security products free of charge to a  massive user base, which has more than doubled in two years to over 300  million.  Qihoo's key product is a safe web browser in China that is  rapidly gaining popularity as Internet users search for protection  against increasingly pervasive and complex security threats.  Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU)  plans to raise $139 million by offering 12.1 million ADSs at a range of  $10.50 to $12.50.  UBS Investment Bank (NYSE:UBS) and Citi (NYSE:C) are the lead managers on  the deal, which is on the IPO calendar for the week of March 28.Originally a reseller of  third-party anti-virus software, this young company now offers a suite  of proprietary Internet security products under the ""360"" brand.   Qihoo's strategy is to attract users by offering free security products  and monetize them by driving traffic to its secure web browser, which is  second only to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Internet Explorer in usage.  360 Safe  Browser, which was launched in late 2009, is based on an ""open"" platform  and therefore able to host applications from third-party game  developers and e-commerce firms.  It generates revenue from online  advertising (paid links, automatic search referral fees; 67% of 2010  sales) and additional Internet value-added services (web games,  technical support; 26%).  Qihoo's top-line jumped 79% to $58 million  last year, driven by a 179% increase in online advertising to $39  million and a boost in Internet value-added services to $15 million  (from $2 million).  Adjusted operating margins improved modestly to 23%  as a favorable mix shift from the discontinuation of its lower-margin  reselling business was offset by heavy R&D investments.Qihoo carries execution risk  as a young company that only recently transitioned from a traditional  software reseller model.  Continued growth hinges on its ability to  monetize a higher percentage of its 328 million security product users;  only half (172 million) employ 360 Safe Browser, its only  revenue-generating product.  Other concerns include the company's  increasing dependence on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (21% of 2010 revenues vs. 11% in 2009)  and current involvement in several lawsuits mostly related to unfair  competitive practices with other Chinese Internet companies (e.g.  Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU)).Going forward, Qihoo targets  aggressive growth by adding further capabilities to its browser,  expanding security product offerings, growing its mobile segment and  entering new geographies.  Though Qihoo is still a small player in a  competitive industry, its unique method of leveraging its dominance in  security to segue into fast-growing Internet services has proven highly  effective thus far.  The company is also led by experienced executives,  and its reputable venture backers (e.g. Highland Capital Partners,  Sequoia Capital, CDH Venture Partners) plan to invest another $50  million in a concurrent private placement.  Coupled with a valuation  that appears reasonable for a high-growth company (49x 2011 earnings),  Qihoo 360 has the potential to follow in the footsteps of recent Chinese  Internet IPOs Youku.com (NYSE:YOKU) and E-Commerce China Dangdang  (NYSE:DANG)."

QIHU is based in Beijing, China.  Conclusion: As the No. 3 internet company in China, QIHU offers a way to participate in the growth of the internet in China.  QIHU itself is on a rapid growth path.In the December 2010 quarter the annualized sales rate was $80 million, with 71% of revenue generated from advertising.  The December quarter profits of $4 million equaled all the profits generated in 2009.  Reasonable Price: Annualizing December quarter's profits, a QIHU IPO at the price range mid-point of $11.50 has a P/E of 84, which is reasonable for a fast growth company with a high gross margin in a rapidly growing segment in China. Look here for QIHU valuation metrics.Yes, it's true, there has been a downdraft in Chinese stocks and there have been accounting problems, etc.   Therefore, investors are not as interested as before.  QIHU, however, generated very good recent sequential quarterly results and seems to have good growth momemtum.  Business: QIHU is the No. 3 Internet company in China as measured by user base, according to a report QIHU commissioned from iResearch. In January 2011, QIHU had 339 million monthly active Internet users, representing a user penetration rate of 85.8% in China, according to iResearch.  Chinese Market: According to iResearch, the number of internet users in China grew from 137 million in 2006 to 457 million in 2010, representing a CAGR of 35.2%, and is expected to grow to 667 million in 2013.   China users are also increasingly conducting internet activities through mobile devices, including mobile-banking, mobile-commerce, mobile-gaming and mobile social networking, among others.   According to iResearch, the number of mobile Internet users in China increased from 17 million in 2006 to 303 million in 2010, representing a CAGR of 105.3%, and is expected to grow further to reach 658 million by the end of 2013.  Primary Product and Users:  QIHU recenty had 172 million monthly active users with the No. 2 web browser in China (360 Safe Browser).  Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Internet Explorer is the No 1 browser.  QIHU’s browser has a user penetration rate of 44.1% in China in January 2011, according to iResearch.  QIHU recently had 98 million monthly active users of the 360 Personal Start-up Page, the default homepage of 360 Safe Browser and a key access point to popular and preferred information and applications.  QIHU's No. 1 mobile security product in China (360 Mobile Safe) has a market share of 58.2% as measured by the number of active users in January 2011, according to iResearch.  QIHU is also the No. 1 provider of internet and mobile security products in China as measured by user base, according to iReseach.   Other products include 360 Application Store, a key access point to securely obtain and manage software and applications; and 360 Safebox, a solution that protects users against thefts of personal account information.   Business Model:  QIHU charges customers advertising fees for providing links to their websites or online applications in prominent positions on QIHU websites and secure platform products.   QIHU generally charges customers a fixed fee for an agreed contract period and occasionally also charges customers on a cost-per-sale or cost-per-action basis.   QIHU began offering web games developed by third parties in 2009 under revenue sharing arrangements with the game developers.   In 2010 QIHU began to offer Internet security services such as remote technical support to paying customers. When computer users encounter security issues, they can request QIHU’s staff for live technical assistance and remote troubleshooting for a service fee on a per-case basis. QIHU also provides monthly and annual subscription for this service.  QIHU offers web games developed by third parties and generate revenue from selling in-game items online. All of the web games are developed by third-party game developers and can be accessed and played by end users on QIHU’s website without downloading separate software.  QIHU collects payments for the sold items from end users and remits certain percentages of the proceeds to the game developers. QIHU recognizes revenue from these sales primarily on a net basis since because QIHU acts as an agent in the transactions.  Competition: The primary competitor in this market is Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), the largest Internet value-added services provider in China. In January 2011, Tencent's QQ instant messaging software had a monthly active user penetration rate in China of 89.3%, while QIHI’s 360 Safe Guard had a monthly active user penetration rate in China of 76.9%, according to iResearch.According to page 14 of the S-1 filing:As a result, a significant number of users stopped using Tencent QQ, or QIHU’s Internet security products, or both.  Due to the large number of internet users that were affected, this incident was extensively reported in the media and attracted government scrutiny.   On November 21, 2010, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, or the MIIT, ordered that Tencent and QIHU end the dispute, apologize to affected users and ensure the compatibility of products concerned.  Use of Proceeds:  $172.8 million from this offering and from the concurrent private placement. $51.8 million for development of new Internet and mobile security products and services; $51.8 million for enhancement of our research and development capabilities to further develop technologies; $25.9 million for investment in and acquisition of technologies, products or businesses; balance for general corporate purposes.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Its deep partnership with Avaya will only accelerate market share gains.RingCentral saw a triple-digit increase in activities for its differentiated MVP platform. We expect to see similar traction for its Avaya Cloud Office offering in and beyond Q2.","RingCentral's (RNG) shares have been up by over 50% since our first coverage six months ago, where we highlighted the secular growth opportunity considering RingCentral's strengthened market leadership in UCaaS (Unified Communication as a Service), due to its deep partnership with legacy player Avaya (AVYA). Currently, we see some near-term as well as long-term catalysts around the stock. Overall, we believe that RingCentral should continue to benefit from the partnership and the secular tailwind in the unified and contact center markets across the mid-market and enterprise. We maintain our overweight rating on the stock.Secular growth in cloud communications will continue to drive mid-market and enterprise market share gains, with shelter-in-place trends further accelerating adoptions across healthcare, financial services, and education sectors. RingCentral's outperformance in Q1 despite the COVID-19 situation indicates that it continues to benefit from the secular tailwind in cloud communications. In Q1, revenue grew by 33% YoY, driven by a staggering 52% increase in the mid-market and the enterprise revenues. Furthermore, the total value of >$1 million ACV deals was also up 30% YoY, driven by deals like Mutual of Omaha and Aveanna Healthcare, both are amongst the largest players in insurance and healthcare consecutively.(source: Q4 2019 slide)Moreover, RingCentral has also been conservative in its guidance, noting last quarter that Q1 revenue growth would only be between 28% and 29% instead of 33%. With that in mind, as the company recently revised the growth guidance for the FY 2020 to be between 24% and 25%, we think that there is a possibility for more surprises in the next few quarters as the secular tailwind continues, with the company expecting to land more Avaya-related deals in Q4.Furthermore, RingCentral's differentiated offerings and Avaya partnership will well-position it to continue leading the UCaaS market. As we have discussed in the first coverage, the Avaya partnership should continue to be the key growth driver for the business.(Avaya Cloud Office. source: Avaya x RingCentral partnership presentation)Given the joint go-to-market and product development of Avaya Cloud Office, RingCentral has a differentiated offering in a captive market as it leverages Avaya's client base. As it stands, 90% of Fortune 100 are Avaya's customers. It also has over 4,000 sales reps, service reps, and partners across +180 countries. Avaya will also be very determined to succeed in the partnership, considering its declining market share in the legacy communication. Having seen the onboarding of over 1,700 channel partner agents to sell Avaya Cloud Office in Q1, we feel optimistic that adoptions should further accelerate beyond Q2 as well.(MVP - Source: ringcentral.com)On the other hand, adoption for the MVP (Message Video Phone) platform has also been solid. The differentiated platform has a built-in enterprise-grade team messaging and video meeting features. In Q1, RingCentral landed Cornell University, which has +15,000 users, as an MVP client. Detroit Lions also came on board as it leveraged RingCentral MVP for its virtual NFL draft in April. Furthermore, the increased usage volume in Q1 has also demonstrated the offering's strong enterprise product-market fit, which we believe should increase the net retention and expansion longer term. As CEO Vladimir Shmunis commented, RingCentral saw a triple-digit increase across all the key usage metrics in Q1:There are minimal risk factors in RingCentral, which we believe are significantly overshadowed by the overall growth prospect. The guidance for FY 2020 took into account further churns in the SMB segments across retail, travel, and the hospitality sectors, which have been impacted by the pandemic. In Q1, RingCentral saw elevated churn in these sectors, with some of the clients also requesting to renegotiate payment terms. Compared to the previously given guidance, the management will expect a 100 bps decrease in the expected FY 2020 revenue growth.Considering its deep moat and disruptive offerings, RingCentral is well-positioned, in our view, to be the market leader not only in UCaaS but also in CCaaS longer term. In CCaaS, it should see strong competition from Five9 (FIVN), which also has seen the secular tailwind in the business and recently landed AT&T (NYSE:T) as a client. Five9 has been trading at ~18x P/S in recent times.(P/S upward trend, driven by the secular tailwind for FIVN. source: stockrow)At the current 22-23x P/S, we think that the price is fair, as it reflects not only RingCentral's strong moat and fundamentals but also the secular tailwind for cloud communications and the business's resilience amid the pandemic.(P/S upward trend, driven by the secular tailwind for RNG. source: stockrow)Given the catalysts, we believe that the 24-25% growth guidance for the full year is conservative and that the expected non-GAAP operating margin of 9.6-9.7% is realistic. The stock may trade at +24x P/S upon the likely outperformance in Q4, driven by the Avaya-related deals. Considering the ~88 million shares count, ~$1.1 billion of revenue, and maintained ~24x P/S, we maintain an overweight rating on the stock, with a target price of ~$300."

Even under a favorable scenario, shares offer little to no margin of safety.We are likely to be more interested in the stock below $200, amid higher expected returns.","The beauty of recurring cash flows allows both management teams to better execute their plans based on their predictability, and investors to more accurately project their future returns, based on a more narrow range of potential future financials. As a result, subscription-based companies have always been expensive, trading at a significant premium. Add in the factor of rapidly growing revenues, and valuations can easily break through the roof.While rushing towards such stocks to get behind their ongoing rally is a risky investment strategy, completely avoiding SaaS growth stocks just because their valuation is ""high"" is also wrong. Investors have missed out on numerous opportunities on the grounds of a pricey valuation multiple. At the same time, pricing rapidly growing companies is hard. A single variable can easily change their long-term growth trajectory, and hence their expected returns.One such company we want to take a look at today is RingCentral (RNG). Thankfully, the company has been on the path of delivering a more substantial bottom line, which should make it easier for us to assess if shares remain investable at their current price. Despite dipping by nearly 40% during March's COVID-19 selloff, shares have rebounded to new highs, trading at around double their price compared to last year.Source: Google FinanceIn this article, we will:Capitalizing on the ever-increasing demand for better and more efficient communication and collaboration software solutions for businesses, RingCentral has been on a prolonged expansion trajectory, continuously growing its client base. As we mentioned earlier in regards to cash flow predictability, RingCentral has posted no single quarter whose turnover is not higher than the one before it, since its IPO. Moreover, while many SaaS companies' growth gradually declines, amid maturing, RingCentral's sales growth levels have remained robust, currently featuring an LTM (Last Twelve Month) revenue growth of 32.4% YoY, with little to no signs of a slowdown.As the company keeps on refining and enriching its ecosystem, its revenues should keep on expanding both from selling additional services and adding new customers. For example, during Q2, the company announced RingCentral Video (RCV), a reimagined video meeting experience, to benefit from the current working environment's needs for distanced communication. The argument that the space is highly competitive and saturated can be made, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams and Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), for example, dominating the space. However, RingCentral's management is aware, and thus not directly competing, but rather integrating its suite of solutions. For instance, by launching RingCentral PBX for Microsoft Teams, with Direct Routing integration, Microsoft Teams users can have access to more robust cloud PBX capabilities without ever having to leave the Teams interface.Due to strong contributions from mid-market and enterprise customers, the company's Q2 results beat its very own guidance. The company expected revenue growth of around 27%, which would still be quite impressive. Instead, the actual figure at 32% further reassured investors that the company's growth rate remains robust. As a result, management updated its guidance, pointing towards FY2020 Revenue growth of 28%, which, based on its historically prudent estimates and past performance, is more than likely to, again, beat. Further, this financial year also marks the first in which the company is about to deliver a solid bottom line. RingCentral has technically always been profitable, though by reinvesting the entirety of its gross profits towards operating expenses and R&D, its income statement has been mostly breaking even over the past few years. A substantial EPS guidance should indicate that investors are to start enjoying tangible returns, driving value through higher free cash flow due to higher net income. Source: Investor PresentationNow let's assess this updated data, along with reasonable growth estimates, in order to assess whether the stock remains investable, despite almost doubling YoY.Over the past few years, management's guidance, which influences consensus estimates, has been humble, which has resulted in the company beating every single quarter in terms of revenue growth. As a result, it's quite likely that RingCentral's revenue growth guidance of around 27% is too prudent, considering the company's current growth.Source: Seeking AlphaStill, we are going to estimate two different, gradually declining revenue growth rate scenarios. The first assumes a more prudent case, in which revenue growth starts decelerating from around 28%, around in line with management's guidance. In the second one, we assume an overall more favorable case to compare the difference in the possible investor returns.Assuming that revenues decline, as shown in the graph, investors are likely to see the following revenue growth:Keep in mind that these estimates indicate considerable deceleration, which is not in line with the company's current performance. However, it's better to retain reserved expectations, in our view. Source: AuthorConsidering that the market is valuing the company based on its future potential profitability, the current forward P/E of 276, based on the company's EPS guidance, is altogether not meaningful. Instead, let's assume a probable net income margin of around 10%. In 2025, that equates to around $326M. We believe that this is quite a reasonable estimate, considering that RingCentral's gross margins have been well above 70% since 2015.Further, we assume that the company will not issue any additional shares since its cash pile should start growing organically. Our net income estimate equates to an FY2025 EPS of $3.70. Based on our growth rates, net income margins, different future valuation multiples, and the stock's current price ($250), current investors are likely to see the following annualized returns:Shares would have to trade at a sky-high P/E ratio in order for investors to see any meaningful gains. A sky-high P/E ratio is quite likely, as investors could be pricing the stock for a net income margin expansion towards 20%. However, it's worth noting that amid a lower valuation, current investors face no margin of safety.Source: AuthorNow, let's consider a more optimistic scenario, where RingCentral beats its own guidance, as usual, and delivers a slower revenue growth deceleration, as displayed below:Source: AuthorFurther, along with a more optimistic scenario in which we assume net income margins of 15%, FY2025's EPS comes out at $6.17. Plugging in the rest of the numbers, and we get the following potential returns, this time:As you can see, while the total investor return potential significantly improves, shares offer, again, a poor margin of safety, under more humble valuations. Investors are likely to see limited returns amid a future (2025) P/E below 60.Source: AuthorRingCentral is a rapidly growing company, beating its top-line estimates consistently. Its Q2 results were promising, showing less deceleration than expected. We believe that the company's path to profitability is a positive advancement, as dilution should cease, amid positive, organic free cash flows.At the same time, the stock's current valuation is a bit hard to justify. Even under the more favorable scenario, as we projected, shares must be trading at a P/E ratio of 70+ in the medium term for investors to be adequately rewarded. That's quite a risky bet since the company is operating in a very competitive sector, with companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft, Zoom, Slack (NYSE:WORK), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and others, offering similar suites of products. Should the company's growth lag amid increased competition, current investors have no tangible capital returns to hang on too, and hence no margin of safety.Overall, we like RingCentral's growth and future profitability, but we don't feel the same about the stock's current valuation. Its future surplus of extraordinary returns seems to be already captured, as shares are priced for perfection. In fact, despite Q2's excellent beat and raise, RingCentral's stock remained flat over the next few weeks days, as such a robust performance seems to be already priced in. Hence the minimal margin of safety going forward. We believe that shares offer a limited upside in the medium term, despite the company's rapid growth. We are likely to be more interested in the stock below $200, amid higher expected returns."
4381091,103373,2020-10-23T15:16:20-04:00,"Sustainable growth, solid subscriber metrics, and new partnerships being formed by RingCentral present a potential upside to the current high valuation.The extremely volatile geopolitical environment will continue to be a risk factor until after the results of the 2020 Presidential Election in the United States are announced.Notwithstanding a broad sell-off, RNG remains a compelling investment opportunity for long-term investors in the tech space.","One of the key components of investing in a Software-as-a-Service company like RingCentral is understanding the dynamic of SaaS vs standalone software. The very fact that revenues are typically recognized on a monthly recurring basis and locked-in to an annual plan makes investing in such a company an attractive proposition. On the other hand, the investor must closely watch metrics like new subscription, renewal, and churn rates, which, if not at optimal levels on a consistent basis, could spell trouble down the road. This is amply evident in the case of companies like Netflix (NFLX), where these metrics are the primary drivers of the stock's price over time.In all such cases, the value of the service provided is of primary importance. In my last Netflix article called Netflix: Look At The Content, Not Subs, ARPU, Or TAM, I highlighted content as being the core value driver for the stock, with the other metrics merely being symptomatic indicators or ""effects"" that the core growth engine exhibits. In the case of RingCentral, it's the increase in the width and depth of the offering through feature additions, new product cross-selling opportunities, and a continually-expanding partnership ecosystem.Thesis: Sustainable growth, solid subscriber metrics, and new partnerships being formed by RingCentral (RNG) present a potential upside to the current high valuation.On all fronts, RingCentral appears to be doing well; hence, the ""effects"" in the form of a strong metrics profile. Let's go through each of these growth drivers to see whether RingCentral makes a compelling investment case.One of the early feature additions that still benefits RingCentral is its API (Application Programming Interface) ecosystem that allows developers to integrate the platform's capabilities into their own products and other third-party applications. In addition, the growing list of readily-available integrations with other SaaS platforms such as Office 365, G Suite, Zendesk, Salesforce, and Slack makes it easy for businesses to 'plug and play' RingCentral's core Office platform while enhancing their business workflows with a simple subscription-based model.Once a business is engaged in this manner, it's hard to extricate RingCentral from the overall equation, leading to high renewal rates. This is reflected in their consistently-growing ARR, which is an internal abbreviation of Annualized Exit Monthly Recurring Subscriptions, and Office ARR, a subset metric that only covers the flagship RingCentral Office product and the Customer Engagement offering.The effect of this integration feature can be seen from the December 31, 2019, ARR figure of $960.1 million compared to the prior period's figure of $725.8 million, which represents a growth rate of 32%. Three months later, as of March 31, 2020, ARR stood at $1 billion and, as of June 30, 2020, ARR was reported at $1.1 billion for a YoY growth rate of 33%.In addition, over the years, RingCentral has added more features and product offerings to cater to niche requirements, which now includes the RC App, a desktop application for RingCentral subscribers that unifies messaging, video, and call capabilities. The company also sells pre-configured phones, phone rentals, and professional services to complement its core offerings, but these only contributed to a little over 3% of total revenues in Q2-20. Nevertheless, these product and feature additions perform an essential support function for overall revenue growth.The takeaway here is that the company continually keeps adding new features to its existing products to enhance user experience. For instance, the RingCentral mobile app saw the launch of file sharing options, message reply actions, and a guest indicator, while the desktop app recently introduced GitHub and Jira integrations, a new workspace, video upload previews, and a calendar presence setting. These initiatives are essential because they draw the user deeper into the RingCentral ecosystem, eventually making it an indispensable part of their business workflows. That lock-in is the virtual moat that most SaaS companies rely on to keep their renewal rates at high levels.The other major component of driving growth is the vast spread of partners in RingCentral's ecosystem. On the one side are strategic consumer-facing partnerships with communications operators like Alcatel-Lucent Enterprise, Atos (OTCPK:AEXAY), Avaya (OTC:AVYA), and others; on the other side are partnerships with software developers (independent software vendors or ISVs), channel partners, carrier service providers, affiliates, software-defined networking and a wide area network or SD-WAN, etc.Together, these vendors and partners make up a crucial ecosystem that tremendously increases the reach of RingCentral's presence across the world. The reason this is so important for growth is that the company currently earns over 92% of its revenues from the North American market. As these partnerships grow, we should see key growth coming from relatively new markets like Europe, where RingCentral's presence is complemented by these partnerships. Much of the stock's upside now comes from this key market segment, where the company has low penetration.One important move that RingCentral has recently made in Germany is to open a new data center in Frankfurt and an office in Hamburg. This will give it a big boost in the EU market because it is now compliant with regulatory mandates around cloud-based offerings and gives German businesses access to local storage, local phone numbers, and local endpoints. It's definitely something to watch in the short-term, and we could see some related launches in other key EU member states as well. The recent expansion of Avaya Cloud Office by RingCentral in Ireland is another move to capture the European market, and service availability now includes Ireland, France, and the Netherlands. RingCentral with further expand its presence into ""Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Ireland, U.S., UK, and Australia"" through its partnership with Atos and the new product, Unify Office by RingCentral, by the end of FY-20.Another significant takeaway from the Atos partnership is that Unify Office targets the hybrid segment of the business communications market. This enables companies with large legacy on-prem communications investments to leverage the power of cloud-delivered products to modernize their communication systems and make them more flexible and scalable for the future. As the pandemic drives digital transformation and the work-from-home culture, this needs for flexibility has come to the forefront, and it bodes well for RingCentral because that's exactly what the platform was designed for.From a higher-level view, the overall UCaaS or Unified Communications as a Service market was estimated at $15.8 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.5% through 2024. RingCentral's revenue growth rates for FY-19, Q1-20 and Q2-20 were reported at 34%, 33%, and 29%, respectively. Despite strong YoY growth rates in the prior periods of +33% each, the company has matched it again in the first two quarters of FY-20. This despite macro headwinds during the majority of H1-20. As a leader in UCaaS, RingCentral is growing at more than three times faster than the overall segment, indicating high engagement with its customers versus the competition.Moving forward, this slew of new partnerships and the expansion of existing relationships with other major players in the communications space represents a significant upside for RNG. And analysts are taking note of that. Morgan Stanley recently raised RNG's price target to $300 from $280, while Mizuho set a price target of $350, even higher than sell-side analysts' average price target of $340. That represents a current as-of-writing upside of between 3% and 20%. One of the reasons for this large variance could be the high level of competition in the space, which Morgan Stanley analyst says could impact valuation and ARPU (average revenue per user) if ""pricing pressure were significant enough to limit RNG's ability to continue growing at ~30-35% rates."" Interestingly, Marshall also noted that recent partnership activity could make the competition narrative an ""overblown"" one.To extend that argument further, I believe RingCentral has found a way to neutralize much of the competition by forging long-lasting partnerships with key players in the communications space. Rather than battle competitors like Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco (CSCO), and others head-on, which would have involved a possibly insurmountable hurdle in the form of infrastructure investments, RingCentral is finding synergies with larger companies like Avaya and Atos by offering a win-win alternative to collectively deal with the competition. And at the heart of that is the core RingCentral Office platform and its huge integrated ecosystem. That's not a moat that's easy to break, and RingCentral has built that moat in the SaaS world, where moats are probably the hardest to create. That assumption is validated by the company's consistently-high retention rates over the past several quarters.Source: RingCentral FY-19 Annual ReportThis combination of high retention rates and potential growth through new features, new product offerings, strong partnerships, and acquisitions clearly points to sustainability in terms of top-line growth.As with most growth companies, RingCentral has been spending aggressively on core growth drivers such as sales and marketing (near-50% of total revenues) and R&D (15%), resulting in consistent net losses until Q2-20, when the company posted net income of half a million dollars. But profitability is not really a measure we can use to value a growth company, especially in the fast-moving SaaS space.Instead, software companies often use what's known as the Rule of 40, which essentially states that in order to be considered financially healthy and sustainable, a company must have a combined revenue growth rate and profitability rate of 40% or higher. As of FY-19, RingCentral's growth rate of 34% combined with an operating margin of 9% placed it in the 'financially healthy and sustainable' category of SaaS companies. Even using the current TTM FCF margin figure of 7.4%, it's above the 40% mark, if only barely.What makes this level of sustainability acceptable in the eyes of investors is the consistency of its revenue growth over recent years, and we've just seen that the runway for continued growth is considerably long.In terms of its financial standing, RingCentral has a strong cash position, with cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $774 million against convertible senior notes of $1 billion net of current portion.While the Rule of 40 is by no means an indicator of future performance, it does reflect the current level of sustainability of a company's revenue growth rate to a great extent. And when you add future gains from the frenzied partnership activity in recent quarters, it's easy to see why RNG is trading at such high valuation multiples.Source: Seeking AlphaAnother key indicator of market sentiment is stock price movement after earnings beats, and there's little to speak of on that front as RNG continues to trade around pre-Q2-earnings levels, give or take. That could mean that the market has already priced in future growth and is hesitant to take valuations to even higher levels. However, that also represents a solid window of opportunity for long-term investors because RingCentral will continue to forge partnerships and strengthen existing ones in its quest for growth. The markets outside of North America only represent 8% of overall revenues, which gives it a long runway for growth in those geographies. The recent moves in Europe are evidence that this is now the new growth battleground for RingCentral.As such, even though valuation is sky-high at the moment, I believe it will continue to remain so, leaving ample room for a short-to-medium-term price return for new investors and even more room for investors with a long-term view.I also don't see any significant risk from a prolonged pandemic because RingCentral's core platform offers a viable solution for a work-from-home future for most companies in countries that are still struggling with high infection rates, both in North America and Europe. As a matter of fact, there are ample signs that new businesses are flocking to RingCentral's platform across different company size segments. Per RingCentral CFO Mitresh Dhruv at the Q2-20 earnings call:One factor to keep in mind at this particular point in time, though, is that the extremely volatile geopolitical environment will continue to be a risk factor until after the results of the 2020 Presidential Election in the United States are announced. Prudent investors might want to wait for a possible overall sell-off similar to the one that happened in early September that hit the broader market. Notwithstanding those considerations, RNG remains a compelling investment opportunity for long-term investors in the tech space."

I believe that Ringcentral has shown decent revenue growth and evidence of switching costs. However, at $219, it is overvalued by roughly 35% based on my base-case assumptions. (Source: Google)With a strong value proposition, RingCentral has achieved revenue growth above 30% in recent years. Revenue has grown from $115M in 2012 to $817M in 2019. Within the same period, gross margins have also expanded from 60% to 75%. Growth is also likely to continue, with a focus on the expansion of its product portfolio. In their Q2 2019 transcript, RingCentral CEO Vlad Shmunis highlights their growth prospects:(Source: RingCentral Q2 2019 Earnings Call Slides)The company also has a large total addressable market of $30 to $35B. At its current revenues of $817M, it has penetrated roughly 2.3% of its total market. Hence, RingCentral still has a long runway for growth.(Source: RingCentral Investor Day)Moreover, RingCentral has been named a leader in the 2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Unified Communications. Being a leader helps RingCentral acquire new customers in trying out at least one of its services before potentially expanding to other services. This helps to drive growth more efficiently than other companies in this space.(Source: RingCentral Q2 2019 Earnings Call Slides) RingCentral's flagship offering is RingCentral Office, which is making up an increasingly large mix of revenue at 88% of subscription revenues in 2018. RingCentral Office gives users a unified application for communication and collaboration that supports all communication types such as text, voice, fax and video with a single business number. RingCentral also supports integrations with many other software providers through its Connect Platform.(Source: RingCentral Investor Day)As companies adopt RingCentral's services along with its integrations, they become more entrenched with time. Once Ringcentral proves that they are able to meet the communication needs of companies, companies become increasingly unlikely to switch even if cheaper competing services emerge. With the rate of innovation and disruptive changes across industries, companies are likely to trust RingCentral for their mission-critical workflows. This is reflected in RingCentral's high retention rates over the years. (Source: RingCentral Investor Day)One risk is the speed of adoption towards cloud solutions. On-premises solutions for communications are usually sticky and it might take a longer time for companies to begin adopting RingCentral's solutions. This might give competitors time to develop competing products before companies become entrenched with using RingCentral's offering. For example, RingCentral might be forced to develop its own competing video product once Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) perfects zoomphone.There could also be potential security flaw issues with leaked communication data. Data security is one of the most important aspects of organizations so RingCentral has to constantly invest heavily in this aspect. Even one slip-up might have a permanent damaging dent on its reputation. 1) Revenue growth at 30% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Ringcentral's track record of steady sales growth and its ability to expand its total addressable market. However, intense competition might put a cap on high sales growth in the future as Ringcentral continues to expand its offering.2) Operating margin of 30% from 2024 onwards. Software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Once Ringcentral scales further and profitability becomes a priority, the company should experience a high level of operating margin expansion through operating leverage. Ringcentral's gross margins have exceeded 70% since 2015, which makes 30% operating margin seem reasonable. However, if Ringcentral has to incur higher customer acquisition costs due to strong competition, there could be some downward pressure on its margins in the near term.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Ringcentral will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Ringcentral has an initial weighted cost of capital of 9%, which drops to 8% in the terminal year. The higher cost of capital reflects the higher risk of Ringcentral having negative operating income and losing money. However, once the company achieves profitability and higher free cash flows, the risk should be reduced as reflected in the lower cost of capital.(Source: Author creation using Ringcentral financials) (Figures are in $millions except per share data and percentages)The value I derived for Ringcentral is roughly $11.7B for the entire company. This represents a 35% downside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high-growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $141.3 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against other software companies.(Source: Author creation using data from Seeking Alpha)Compared to other high-growth peers, Ringcentral's pricing looks fairly reasonable in terms of price/sales and EV/sales ratios. Ringcentral is priced cheaper than Zoom and Coupa which have higher growth rates. Ringcentral is more expensive than Zendesk which have similar growth rates but worse operating margins.Potential investors have to decide if they believe Ringcentral will be able to execute better than my base-case assumptions in the long run. If competition turns out to be stronger than expected and pushes down future sales growth, it makes it difficult to justify buying Ringcentral at current prices."

My target price is $132.","The move to remote working and video conferencing has been fast forwarded in the past few weeks. Microsoft Teams and Zoom have built an insurmountable lead over RingCentral as evident in multiple sources of data. The lead is, by many measures, larger than the lead Facebook had over MySpace when it went into receivership.RingCentral has limited feature advantages versus incumbent players and can't afford to invest as much in advertising. The competitive environment has also accelerated due to Google's more aggressive actions regarding Duo marketing.Now that video has hit mass market adoption, it will be difficult for use cases like support to work. Imagine asking an upset customer, or potential new client, to install RingCentral if they already have Zoom and Teams installed. These issues are compounded because both Zoom and Microsoft have launched phone systems (found here for Microsoft, and here for Zoom). Because of its extreme multiple versus gross profits and lack of free cash flow support, and imminent negative technical catalysts (convert hedging, and sales from Avaya) -- RingCentral stock has enormous imminent downside. There is a reasonable chance this $18 billion company is in fact, worthless.Many people would be surprised to learn that RingCentral is worth the same amount as Twitter ($18-19b). But the company has a long history of growing revenue above 20% and near 80% gross margin which has excited investors while Twitter has a patchy execution history financially.Extreme outperformanceSource: Tiingo DataThe above chart shows that RingCentral has outperformed the S&P 500 by 630% since 2017.Source: Tiingo DataYear to date, this outperformance has accelerated due to a boom in Remote work stocks.

These companies have relatively long history so are useful to consider for multiple comparison. I use Gross Profit as the primary metric for valuation because of the inconsistencies in RNG's free cash flow. Here we can see a chart of RNG's valuation versus these peers over timeSource: Historical EV data from Sharadar, gross profit data from SEC edgarThe chart above shows that RingCentral's current gross profit valuation in Blue tells us 3 key points:How we got here in a nutshell: the SAAS hockey stickSource: Edgar, Historical 10qsRingCentral has a classic software hockey stick growth pattern. There are two things to note on the above chart, however. First - the trough growth rate of the company was 25% in early 2018. This is relevant because it roughly corresponds with management forward guidance for 2020 revenue growth. Second, revenue growth has not moved above the 35% peak rate in 2016. This is significant insofar as RingCentral's valuation has moved to more extreme levels without a corresponding acceleration in growthAnalysts were very excited about RingCentral's most recent quarter- Bob Ansari, William Blair, Feb, management call.The very exciting thing about the February quarter was this chart:The idea that Enterprise is growing at 71% implies big margin expansion for RingCentral and the potential of a move into Microsoft's customer base for Teams, and integrated cloud products.It is indisputable that RingCentral has executed historically. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, they have lost marketshare to their key competitors in what is most likely a permanent fashion. What the market has perceived as bullish for the company (a shift to remote work) is actually terrible bearish (accelerated Network effects for competitors).Exhibit 1: Severe Web Market Share lossSource: Alexa, SimilarWeb, Web Panel DataExhibit 2: A failure for RingCentral reach new highs in traffic even with the virusSource: Alexa, SimilarWebExhibit 3: Crushing market-share losses to Zoom in the Apple App storeAt the time of writing, RingCentral is rated #1,268 in the overall app store. Zoom is rated #1. Based on log effects, the number of downloads today for Zoom are approximately 6000x higher.Visual of Zoom App rank over timeSource: App AnnieHere is a brief timeline of the rank history. It is hard to digest when shown on the AppAnnie Chart because of exponential functions:Exhibit 4: The Share Loss isn't Just to ZoomSource: Google TrendsExhibit 5: This type of share loss has been terminal to many industries and companiesThe chart above uses Google trends data. The ""First Crossover"" is the date when Google Trends for a term first crossed over. For example, Searches for Netflix first crossed Blockbuster in August 2007. Searches for ""Kindle"" crossed over Borders in June 2010.Due to its popularity in the tech industry, Zoom actually first crossed RingCentral in February 2016 but has become super charged during the CoronavirusAt the time of writing Zoom has about 250-300x the search traffic as RingCentral (higher than the 96x shown on the chart)You can see that the average multiple of companies like Blockbuster, Myspace, Pebble, Jawbone, CD Players, Zara, Borders, or Palm pilot on Google trends at the time of company bankruptcy / trend irrelevance was 24x.Seeing this visually in a famous example:Exhibit 6: RingCentral's product has no advantages versus Zoom or Microsoft TeamsFacebook ultimately destroyed MySpace because it was an incrementally better product with a larger network effect. This likely could not have happened if Facebook weren't good.I wanted to do a deep dive on RingCentral's products to see if they have a hope of beating Microsoft, Zoom, Google and Slack.Source: RingCentral Demo VideoHere you can see that RingCentral's most recent product looks a lot like Slack or Microsoft Teams but supports both video and phone meetings. This makes comparison to Microsoft Teams and Slack important --On March 19th Microsoft updated us that Teams was adding 12m DAUs per week and had reached 43 million DAUs. Assuming that growth rates have dropped off (probably have not) - let us assume that as of April 2 Microsoft has about 50 million DAUs for Teams. The main argument RNG bulls make is that RingCentral can survive the Zoom onslaught because Zoom is not primarily a B2B use case.Microsoft pretty much blows that out of the water, as it is entirely B2B with extensive office and Cloud computing integrations.Just as a reference, here's what Microsoft Team's interface looks like (hint, it's the same as RNG)Source: Microsoft Demo VideoAnd finally, Zoom meetings, which are also more or less the same and have feature parity (file sharing etc)Source: Zoom WebsiteA summary of RingCentral's video meeting can be found hereOne of the cool features is ""Document Mark Up""Unfortunately, both Zoom and Microsoft have this feature. Here is a screenshot from Zoom enabling collaborative mark up:It's not really clear what RingCentral can do to dig itself out of this hole from a feature perspective. After reviewing 100% of their feature demo videos, and speaking to sales, RingCentral's most current unique feature is ""mute while driving"" which should be trivial for peers to implement.Exhibit 7: It will be very hard for RingCentral to deploy marketing dollars to fix the problem because of ad saturation and bad SEOTop of the fold Google searches for ""conference call""Source March Google search cacheThe Duo news shouldn't be discounted because there's been a regime shift in Google's favoritism towards its own product:Here's what Google search results for ""Video Call"" looked like in March of 2019Here's what they look like in March of 2020:This is even more significant because it has translated in a giant relative share gain for Google DuoGoogle Duo App store rankings:Source: App AnnieThis is quite similar in nature to what Google did to TripAdvisor, that I highlighted last year before the stock dropped 50%+ (note it's my only other Seeking Alpha article)Exhibit 8: The companies RingCentral highlighted as customer wins have dropped severely since the Feb callRingCentral has large strategic partners and enterprise customers that ultimately determine its billings curve. Equity prices and macro environment considerations shape the spend outlook for most companies - especially as commitments to Enterprise service contracts is a long-term commitment. RingCentral management highlighted companies in the financial services, small business and banking sector that have come under strong pressure since earnings were released in February. A weakened equity environment for key customers and small businesses (Avaya's focus) will tilt away from using RingCentral and instead using free tools such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams.Source: Quarterly Earnings Call, Feb 2020The above chart shows that both AT&T and Avaya have struggled heavily since the quarterly earnings call. It is unlikely that companies down 30-40% would heavily prioritize a RingCentral partnership.Regarding the ATOS partnership, management sounded initially excited...Before throwing cold water on the company's materiality to 2020 earnings:...Many of RingCentral's customer wins have heavily decelerated since the quarterArch Capital:Arch Capital stock has dropped nearly 40% since signing up for RingCentralCreditHuman:Source: feb earnings call.CreditHuman, as a credit union heavily exposed to Texas (which is in turn to oil, which has collapsed) -- is not publicly traded. But a realistic comparable would be the Regional Banking ETF, KRE, which is down about 50% since the Feb call.RichemontSource: Feb CallRichemont has dropped over 30% since the Feb call as luxury good demand has collapsed globally.Exhibit 9: Dicey financialsConcerning gross margin trajectorySource: Edgar, Historical 10qsThis failure to crack 35% is more concerning because RingCentral's gross margins have inflected negatively. Year over year changes in gross margin are below -200 bps. This is concerning because RingCentral has highlighted big enterprise wins, which normally would cause your Gross Margin profile to accelerate, not decelerate.Extremely concerning free cash flow margin trajectorySource: Edgar, Historical 10qsCompounding the gross margin issue is a much more concerning issue regarding the company's free cash flow - a key metric for enterprise software. RingCentral's FCF margin cracked through 0 in 2017 and was on a continuously expanding trajectory until the most recent quarter where there was large free cash flow margin deceleration - the largest in the company's history. This compounds concerns highlighted in the gross margin narrative - that enterprise deals are not flowing through to the bottom line.Guidance implies trough revenue growth rates with no GAAP margin expansion and extreme share dilutionDespite extreme valuation the company did not guide GAAP operating margin expansion for 2020, and its revenue guidance is 25-26%, a deceleration from Q1 2020's guide at 29% and matching its historical trough growth rate in 2018. During RNG's trough growth rate highlighted earlier, its valuation was 60-80% lower.Source: SEC EdgarThe company did guide ""Non GAAP"" operating margin expansion, but per the above chart notes this non GAAP guidance includes both amortizations of acquisitions which management repeatedly highlighted as important bolt ons to operating capabilities, as well as share based compensation. Paying employees to work does not seem optional for a software company. Thus, I feel it is more appropriate to look at their GAAP operating margin guidance as there is no lumpy event that particularly demands adjustment.Excessive forward dilution and dubiously large payments to a ""channel partner"", AvayaIn small print management highlights a large ramp in share count due to exercise of a convertible note as well as shares based payments to a small company called Avaya (AVYA, publicly traded). The chart below shows the effect on dilutionSource: Edgar, Feb Mgmt PresentationDilution at RingCentral is ramping from a trailing 6% (already high) to a rather stomach churning 13%. The 4 quarter trailing share count is 83.1 million. The guided share count is 94.5 million. That's an incremental issuance of 11.1 million shares. That's about $2.3 billion of issuance over 12 months at April 1 share price.This issuance and dilution is more concerning when viewed in the context of the following Forbes article:There are 3 points I want to make about Avaya.Catalyst #1 Peaking ICU numbers in Italy and NYC combined with Abbott Labs (ABT) test will get investors thinking ""outside the Virus"", causing RNG to derateSo far RingCentral has seen a strong bid because investors do not want to ""overthink"" COVID-19 because of panicky price action and clear narrative shifts to remote work. Logically, as things calm down - investors will reassess what they bought (and sold). The timeline for this is relatively clear given recent developments. It should happen over the next month.Source: Italian COVID-19 dataThe chart above shows that new ICU patients are substantively decelerating in ItalySource: New York Governor's office dataThe chart above shows that net ICU patients are also decelerating in New York City, the epicenter of the infection in the US.Abbot Labs recently launched a machine that can return coronavirus tests in 5-13 minutes. This has some important implications regarding viral control and RingCentral. Namely:""The city of Detroit received the Abbott Labs tests today, April 1. They will be available for use within the next 24 hours,the mayor said.""Catalyst #2 The rate of news flow around COVID-19 vaccines is likely going to accelerate, lowering 2021 RNG EPS growth estimatesHere are some large companies that have made announcements regarding COVID-19 vaccine timelinesChina is also in an arms race to develop a vaccine, with the government ordering scientists to beat other countries in the race to the solution.While somewhat dystopian, China likely has less reticence testing vaccines on live subjects versus the west -- which should move forward the time table of human testing - one of the key elements cited on delay. China immediately began treating patients with Remdesevir (Gilead's drug) with minimum clinical study, just as a recent example.Fauci and other CDC officials have expressed excitement about the rate of vaccine development versus past epidemics, such as SARs. Because many of the viral treatments are focused on RNA replication, new CRISPR technologies have high promise. While it is impossible to predict how quickly a vaccine is developed, it is possible to measure how much it costs to sequence a genome (one of the key ingredients in RNA based vaccine research).Currently, Wall Street Consensus sees RingCentral growing EPS from 20-30% from 2020 to 2021. As it becomes increasingly clear we won't all be working remotely in 2021, it is likely analysts will take these #s downCatalyst #3 Analyst downgrades due to the price run up untethering from fundamentalsCatalyst #4 Avaya share sales, a huge convert that needs to be hedged compounded by a potential wave of employee sellingThe Avaya Sale Issue: ~390m$ of salesAssuming Avaya got paid $300m in stock in October of 2019, since then RingCentral has risen about 30%. So back of envelope if Avaya has $390m of RingCentral shares locked up (unlikely it was instant vest) -- and their market capitalization is only $600m as I am writing this -- it seems likely they'll be selling to keep their business afloat. This is confirmed / implied in their March investor disclosure:Source: Avaya March investor disclosureThe Convert Issue: ~$758 million of salesSource RNG 10kSo $929.2 - $386.9 = $542.3 million of equity overhang from converts at $168 per share (when they were last marked on 10q).Implied volatility has more than tripled since December 2019 on the overall market -- so it is safe to assume that the calls are worth 20% more from that on a mark to market basis from that factor alone. When you include the run up in price of 31%, I believe a 40% increase in call value is extremely conservative. This gets you to about a $758 million overhang.It is certainly not guaranteed the debt investor will delta hedge their exposure, but -- I would humbly suggest that they do so.The Share Based Comp issue: ~500m of salesIn normal environments it might be far easier for a company like RingCentral to absorb $1b of fundamental selling. This is no longer the caseThe chart above from Goldman Sachs shows that the equity market's ability to absorb block trades is the worst it has been since 2008. High frequency traders without a fundamental view on underlying securities who have become an increasing share of trading volume are simply stepping back.The essence of why this trade has excellent risk reward, is that the market is assuming that RingCentral enterprise spend will hold up while the market is imploding and there is mass unemployment. This would be unlikely even IF RingCentral had not just lost 90 points of marketshare to entrenched competitors with superior product development teams and better capitalized customers.There is a range of outcomes for RingCentral based on different assumptions around1) Progression of the Virus and remote work2) The spend outlook for RingCentral customers'3) The specific market-share of RingCentralI outline my thoughts around scenarios for RNG below:Enterprise Software Comparison TableScenario Analysis for Multiple and Target Price of 132Visualizing these scenarios on the RNG chart, you can see that most of the prices have actually traded since 2016.Due to the possibility of the situation spiraling, but also the potential for a massive acquisition, I believe an appealing risk reward trade in options is to own December put options on RingCentral with a strike price of 160. The current price of these options is $18. If RingCentral traded to $79, for example this would result in a $63 gain representing a 250% return. Unfortunately for many participants these options will be insufficiently liquid to trade.Disclosure: Author is short RingCentral stock"
4340230,35181,2020-04-27T11:57:12-04:00,RingCentral's stock appears to be preparing for a breakout above the $250 level.The company has strong annual revenue growth of 34% and positive free cash flow. The long-term prospects for UCaaS are good. RingCentral is the leader in this industry.The stock price is very overvalued and being long going into the next earnings release is risky.,"These are difficult times, not only for people and companies but also for analysts such as myself who must evaluate companies with little information to work on during the pandemic. Today, I am covering RingCentral, Inc. (RNG), a leader in Unified-Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS), a field that is strong. We are still in the early innings of this digital transformation play as enterprises begin to focus on upgrading legacy PBX. RingCentral is certainly the undisputed leader in cloud-based UCaaS and stands to gain on a long-term basis.(Source: RingCentral)But the short term is another matter. The COVID-19 pandemic is driving up valuations of video conferencing stocks such as Zoom (ZM) and contact center stocks such as Five9 (FIVN). These are stocks that are expected to be beneficiaries of the recent work-from-home (WFH) directive.Some analysts believe that RingCentral will also be a WFH beneficiary. In my opinion, RingCentral will likely have a difficult quarter and perhaps year as companies not already employing RingCentral's products will probably not begin to use them, at least not immediately. Unlike free offerings from Zoom and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Teams that are easy to install and use, UCaaS requires some effort in terms of research, planning, and budget approval. These are activities not likely to be taken on while IT departments make the nearly instantaneous switch from office to WFH for most employees.RingCentral recently announced its own free video conferencing product, but it can only be used within RingCentral Office or as part of AT&T Office@Hand or Avaya Cloud Office. I don't expect that RingCentral's video conferencing entry to be a significant catalyst for product adoption during the pandemic.The stock prices for Zoom and Five9 are flying high and rightly so. The usage of their products has skyrocketed due to WFH. It appears that RingCentral's stock may soon join them as it threatens to break out to an all-time high.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)But if it breaks out, it will likely be in sympathy with other stocks that are truly benefiting from the pandemic this quarter. RingCentral stockholders may want to be cautious going into the earnings announcement scheduled for May 6th. If the company disappoints, there could be some pretty substantial downward price action.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The metric sidesteps the valuation dilemma for high-growth companies that generally don't show profits. The Rule of 40 allows for both revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) in combination such that they must add up to at least 40%. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can turn a blind eye to negative free cash flow to some extent. On the other hand, if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth.This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. Young companies tend to have high revenue growth but are burning cash. Mature companies have lower revenue growth, but they make up in terms of free cash flow. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In RingCentral's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 34% + 2% = 36%RingCentral's score is just shy of the 40% needed to fulfill the Rule of 40, but not short enough to be overly concerned. I should point out here that the company management is familiar with the Rule of 40 and uses it as a guide. They calculate it using the company's operating margin instead of its free cash flow margin. According to the Q4 2019 earnings call:There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher growth stocks are valued more than lower growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how RingCentral stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, RingCentral is situated well above the best-fit line. This suggests that the company is very overvalued on a relative basis, likely in anticipation of increased product usage driven by the pandemic and WFH.RingCentral is the leader in UCaaS, an area that will do well in the long term as enterprises convert from legacy phone systems to cloud-based communication platforms, increasing flexibility and driving down costs. In my estimation, investment in RingCentral is a good long-term investment, provided one gets in at a good price.The short term is another matter, however. The stock price is quite overvalued on a relative basis, likely due to the expectation that RingCentral will outperform during the pandemic. I doubt that RingCentral will see significant benefits from the WFH environment, at least not like Zoom and Five9. Companies not already using RingCentral will likely employ a fast and easy, low-cost solution for immediate transformation to WFH.In addition, many companies are struggling and may default or cancel subscriptions. Potential customers may put off acquiring UCaaS due to tough times.At present, RingCentral's stock price is extremely overvalued on a relative basis, and holding this stock going into the quarterly earnings report on May 6 may be a very risky venture. Therefore, I am giving RingCentral a neutral rating. The company has strong annual revenue growth of 34% and I expect that strong growth will continue once the pandemic has subsided. I look forward to revisiting the rating in the near future."
4336205,98236,2020-04-06T11:32:24-04:00,"Ring Central has announced its own video conference offering-called RingCentral Video.The video conferencing business is one of those whose prospects have blossomed in this era of the Covid-19 virus and shares of the industry leader, Zoom sell at extraordinary valuations.Ring is the leader in the UCaaS space and its leadership has been growing with a 71% in enterprise ARR last quarter.The company has shown rapidly increasing sales efficiency in selling to the enterprise and through the channel.The issue for investors is that these positives have been recognized and the current EV/S ratio of just below 18X is far above average for the company's growth cohort.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.In the last few months the shares of Ring Central (RNG) appreciated noticeably to a new high, then fell noticeably at the start of the pandemic influenced trading, and then spiked again before backing off to a level around 15% below the company’s all time high that was set on February 19th. The reasons for the spike through February had to do with a recognition of the company’s strong growth: the last quarter showed total revenues rising 34% and enterprise ARR growing 71%. The company has reported positive non-GAAP earnings with an operating margin of about 9.6%. The company’s guidance at the time it reported earnings back in mid-February had been for growth of about 26% with non-GAAP operating margins consistent with prior levels.The quarter that was reported in mid-February was a noticeable beat. Revenues were about 4% greater than the prior consensus forecast. The EPS upside was about 15%. The company raised its forecast for full year revenues by about 3%, and left its EPS guidance unchanged as its outstanding share calculation ticked higher due to its share price appreciation, and the shares issued to Avaya as part of the partnership agreement between the two companies.Needless to say the world has been turned upside down since February 19th. What was good then means nothing to many investors at this point. But investors have gravitated to companies that in some way are involved with the “work-at-home” paradigm and have rebalanced portfolios toward companies that are benefiting from that trend and away from other investments that will be seriously damaged by the economic upsets engendered by the Covid-19 virus. The most recent spike in Ring Central shares relates to the company’s partnership with Avaya (OTC:AVYA) and the release of what is called the Avaya Cloud Office.Until recently, RingCentral had a partnership with Zoom (ZM) in which RNG resold the Zoom teleconferencing solution. Zoom has had a number of other partners, and this partnership was not terribly important for Zoom’s go to market strategy. The video conferencing partnership, which had been on-going since 2018 had various limits on meeting attendees that made it not terribly useful in the real world. Earlier this year, Avaya and Ring announced a collaboration and as of April 1st, the Avaya Cloud Office became generally available. The solution is based on the RingCentral open platform and provides users with numerous services including video conferencing, messaging, calling, file sharing and collaboration across any device or user location.The launch, in this time of limited public events due to the Covid-19 virus precautions, did not offer the level of detail and marketing pizzazz that might have been anticipated from such an important announcement. There have been some details that have been made available from the 800 channel partner agents that have been trained and signed up for the launch. RingCentral will probably wind up with more value than Avaya as the partnership is structured, although given Avaya’s current valuation, it probably has more percentage upside potential, particularly after its negative share price reaction to the specific release of April 1st.In addition to Cloud Office, RNG has announced what it calls RingCentral Video (RCV) a re imagined video meeting experience. RingCentral Releases RingCentral Video to Address Work from Anywhere Demands; Completes Message Video Phone Solution I have linked here to a high-level overview of the functional capabilities of RCV. Video Conferencing, Screen Sharing, and Team Messaging | RingCentral Let me be pointed and suggest that I do not anticipate, regardless of specific points of functionality, that RCV is going to dent Zoom’s ascension. It is somewhat possible that the encryption flaw discovered in the Zoom app will have some impact on Zoom short-term. But the advent of RCV should not be a problem for Zoom’s growth pattern. And RingCentral is not known for being aggressive in terms of pricing. In the overall UCaaS space, in fact, it is the premium priced solution.What might be anticipated, at least over some period of time, is that RCV will enable RingCentral to achieve significantly higher growth rates than would otherwise be the case.A significant component of the Ring Central offering relates to its integration With Google Chrome’s Web RTC. While Chrome is the inaugural launch platform for RingCentral Video, essentially the strategy is to make the service universally available.Given what has been released, which is more promotional than totally substantive, see attached link (Video Conference and Online Meetings in One Click | RingCentral): it is not really feasible for analysts to do a comparison of feature/function of Zoom vs. the new RCV offering. One can see a 1 hour video on the RCV capabilities in the attachment. The commercial is more than enough for analysts like this writer to get a sense of the capabilities and ease of use of the offering, and not nearly enough for the third party analysts who tend to guide most of the selection process in larger enterprises. The product is not intended for individual consumers and is focused on enterprise capabilities. I would have to suggest that given the management team at RCV is only too aware of the challenges they face in competing against Zoom, that from the standpoint of cost, features and ease of use, that their offering is at least equal to, and perhaps better than what one can find in the Zoom offering. I imagine that many larger users will at least try RCV to determine if the service has specific benefits for their organizations.But the use of Zoom has become so ubiquitous, and obviously a standard in many organizations, that it will be difficult to displace the service. Ring has built up a formidable distribution capability with both a highly productive direct sales force, and with channel partners, in particular, and the ease of use features of its new service are such that it will get trials and usage. Overall, the opportunity, is large certainly large enough, such that I think Ring will be able to achieve goals consistent with improving its long-term anticipated growth rate-and I have used such expectations in my valuation analysis.Ring Central has been defined as a company that sells solutions to enable messaging, collaboration, conferencing and online meetings through a variety of devices including smartphones, tablets PC’s and old-fashioned desk phones. Most people describe their category as UCaaS (Unified Communication as a Service). At this point, RNG is the largest and probably the fastest growing of the major companies in the UCaaS space. The best recognized competitors in the space are Vonage (VG) and Jive now owned by LogMeIn (LOGM) now in the process of being taken private by a consortium of P/E firms including Elliott and Francisco partners. Besides these two, there are certainly other competitors with significant offerings in the space.I will discuss what has been and is likely to remain the core business of Ring Central in some detail but these days, investors are looking for the next Zoom, and some investors have concluded that Ring Central will be it. If nothing else, offering a full suite of video conferencing services to a broad range of potential users within the Avaya base is a timely undertaking. I think it would be hyper-optimistic, to coin a word, to expect that RNG’s penetration of the video conferencing market to be more than a small fraction of that of Zoom. That isn’t necessarily a function of the capabilities of the Cloud Office and RCV. But this is a product self-evidently aimed at business and the Avaya base and not the millions of Zoom sessions that anxious parents and family members have initiated to speak to their loved ones.At the moment, as is known by most investors/readers, Zoom’s business is on an extraordinary trajectory that might well be described as an act of nature. In this environment of mandatory lockdowns and panic, a Zoom video conference has become balm to many a troubled parent worried about the well being of their family. I have seldom, if ever, seen a service such as that offered by Zoom become such a standard in the IT space in such a short period of time. I do a fair number of virtual meetings with the CFO’s of companies on which I write. It is simply amazing how many of those companies now use Zoom as their defacto standard for conferences. Whether or not Zoom’s valuation will ever make sense is not really the topic of this discussion. But the fact is that investors are clearly hungry for Zoom alternatives that are in the space.On its last conference call, Ring forecast revenue for the current year to be in the range of $1.13 billion, or growth of 25%. Almost inevitably, at this point, the economic impact of the virus, i.e. the adoption of the work at home paradigm by many, and possibly through the impact of the company’s new video product, I expect to see revenues higher than forecast-certainly a rarity in these times. I am using a revenue estimate of $1.25 billion for the next 4 reported quarters which would be growth of 38.5%. The company is estimating 94.5 million outstanding shares for the current full year. That yields an enterprise value of about $20 billion based on the current share price of around $215/share, and an EV/S ratio of almost 18X. Not terribly surprisingly, this valuation is noticeably greater than average for the mid-thirty percent growth cohort-presumably because investors and some analysts think that the new self-developed video conferencing offering will accelerate growth to a higher level than the consensus expectation by a meaningful level. What is really at work here is that ZM shares are currently valued at more than 40X EV/S and will need years of hyper-growth to justify their valuation. Ring is over-valued based on the consensus, but not by a factor of several times, and although its free cash flow margin is small, it is positive, and about average for its growth cohort.Competition offered by Ring is not likely to be a material factor in Zoom’s current trajectory of operational performance. But the potential a Zoom alternative might have to boost Ring’s growth, and the overall cachet in terms of investor perceptions regarding Ring’s potential growth cadence is far from minimal and that was seen in Friday’s trading when RNG shares rose by 10% or so in the context of a falling market.This is not an article about the prospects for Zoom. Zoom shares have been a force of nature in this pandemic as investors seek to find safety in equities whose demand is being accelerated by the conditions wrought by the impact of the virus. Today, with the formal announcement of a competitor to Zoom, at least in the enterprise sector, the shares have pulled back a bit. I have suggested that buying almost any name based on how its business is going to evolve during this lock-down period makes little sense. When Zoom was in its gestation phase, prior to its IPO, I felt positively about its prospects. I still do.But there is little to justify an EV/S of 36X, and I would have written that regardless of the impact of RNG’s offering. It is just another risk that investors assume in buying such highly valued shares.Should investors buy these shares? I confess to be a “Johnny come lately” to this story. I don’t get to investigate everything I want to look at when I want to look at it. At the current price of about $210/share, I am inclined to think that the upside is relatively modest -- the shares have compressed as have most shares because of concerns about the economy -- they just haven’t compressed all that much.That said, I wouldn’t be surprised if the shares spike in the future on any kind of news relating to the success of the new offering. There may be some readers/investors who are looking to get on the video conferencing train, without paying for the valuation of the leader in the space. Despite the fact that it is difficult on just a quantitative basis to recommend the shares -- especially without any guidance relating to an anticipated ramp for RCV -- some readers can justify holding a relatively small position in the name regardless.The latest market analysis for UCaaS shows that the overall market is currently worth a bit more than $16 billion with a CAGR of 9.5%. That growth rate is depressed because the definition of UCaaS includes telephony -- which is not showing rapid growth. The reason that Ring Central can grow rapidly is because its offering and its revenues are centered on capabilities in conferencing and collaboration platforms.The company has been able to outgrow its market for several reason --perhaps the most important factor in its success has been its platform approach that enables users to enjoy the benefits of something more than 3000 integrations. The company has also developed a highly verticalized strategy that differentiates its offering from many of its competitors. Key verticals include financial services, healthcare and education. While RingCentral is not perhaps as focused on developers as are companies such as Elastic (ESTC), Twilio (TWLO) and MongoDB (MDB) it does have an eco-system with 30,000 developers, and this is important in terms of how the company wins business. The company does sell directly to larger enterprises, and it typically has been successful in selling 7 and occasionally 8 figure deals in a typical quarter. UCaaS by itself is not much of a game changer at this point; most enterprises have some form of integrated communications capability installed. Many users buy UCaaS these days to enhance the efficiency and cost levels in corporate communications and to provide capabilities on a corporate basis.. What is a game changer is the integration between UCaaS and business applications, and this is perhaps the key to understanding the success this company has enjoyed.Last quarter was kind of a halcyon period for RNG -- along with many other enterprise software companies. Many things worked, and large deals were plentiful. For a company of this size, closing 30 deals greater than $1 million in a single quarter was a significant attainment. The company actually grew its ARR in the enterprise by 71% and grew ARR in in the channel by 53%. Those results showed growth at several time the market rate. Management spoke about booking linearity during the quarter, and my guess is that the momentum in Q4 carried over into the first couple of months of the company’s Q1. The company had a significant level of success with its channel partners. And of course the company developed some interesting partnerships with other companies in this space including Avaya, AT&T (T) and Atos. The company achieved a rather strong increase in sales productivity within the enterprise, with very attractive unit economics.The UCaaS space has many competitors, some fairly familiar and others quite small. I have linked here to what are said to be the top alternatives to the VoIP business phone services that are offered by RingCentral. 6 Best RingCentral Alternatives 2020 To sum up what the article had to say about RC, this one line is more than enough, “ RingCentral is a fantastic service, but there are also many worthy alternatives on the market today.”Like many other category leaders, RingCentral has put together a package of services, and an open platform, with a very strong and efficient selling motion -- it isn’t the kind of classic moat that some investors look for -- but it is obviously strong enough for this company to take share in its space consistently.Gartner rates the RingCentral offering as 1st in the UCaaS space-and that was before assessing the impact of the recent partnerships with Avaya and AT&T and the introduction of its own offering in the meeting space. I have linked to the Gartner study here for readers interested in more details about that company’s evaluation.That Ring Central has the pole position in the UCaaS space seems hard to deny. Its growth in the space has been impressive and its last quarter was most impressive of all. But that is not why investors have chosen to buy shares at this valuation.Unlike many other high-growth IT companies, RingCentral has reached non-GAAP profitability, and it generates a modest level of free cash flow, with free cash flow margins last year of 4%. This ratio was depressed by about 400 bps because of payments associated with the initiation of the company’s newest technology partnership with Avaya.RingCentral is a cloud based service and more than 90% of its revenues come from subscriptions. Overall non-GAAP gross margins on subscription revenues have been in the lower 80% range for some time now. The gross margins on other revenues are far less, and drag down reported gross margins about 600 bps. At this point, the company has not made any projections with regards to the revenue or margin expectations for RCV or the other new services it is now offering. According the following study which is linked here, the market for on-line meetings in the enterprise space was projected to reach $6 billion by 2024 (Online Meeting Software Market-key Vendors, Trends, Analysis, Segmentation, and Forecast to 2019-2024). This study was compiled prior to the outbreak of the virus and the necessity of developing an on-line meeting paradigm in the business world. The market, will probably be larger than $6 billion-but just how much larger is difficult to guess.Regardless of the uncertainties, it seems highly likely that Ring will be able to achieve significant market penetration now that it has its own product and is not reselling the service of a competitor. Again, just how much the new RCV offering might change the business model is not currently knowable.This company has a business model that is somewhat different from a typical software company. It spends quite a bit less on research and development and somewhat more and sales and marketing. Last quarter, overall, the non-GAAP operating margin rose to 9.6%. Within that figure, the company spent a consistent 12.3% of revenues on sales and marketing expense which in total was up 33% year on year. It did achieve some very nice productivity gains in sales and marketing with a 230 basis point improvement in expense ratios, to 41.9%. Total revenues rose by 34% year on year, while non-GAAP sales and marketing costs rose by 27%.The company had been forecasting that its non-GAAP operating margin would be unchanged this current year. With so many marketing activities currently constrained, it is difficult for anyone, I imagine, to project the specifics of sales and marketing spend. Typically some of the new services would be launched at very expensive events and there would be significant follow-up. Just what the cadence of those kinds of expenses will be is really hard to know. My guess is that there will be a lower level of sales and marketing expense both absolutely and as a ratio in both Q1 and Q2, followed by some kind of spike in Q3 continuing into Q4.Ring Central has built a very attractive franchise in a crowded market. It is clearly the dominant player in the UCaaS space and its 71% growth in the enterprise last quarter was an exceptional attainment given the overall growth of the market. The company has now introduced its own offering in the video conferencing space. That the video conferencing space is hot, and is likely to remain so, is unquestioned. It is a bit more difficult to assess the ramp of the RCV product without some specific guidance from the company-but given the company’s success in UCaaS there is no reason not to anticipate a healthy ramp.I have a process for evaluating companies. It is not always correct, to be sure, but it is one I find helpful. Basically, I look at growth vs. valuation and profitability vs. valuation. At the moment, Ring Central is something like 40%-50% higher than the average EV/S ratio for its growth rate. Of course, there are those who will say the growth rate I am using is too low-that the opportunity in terms of the RCV service is larger than forecast. The company is just about average in terms of free cash flow margins for its growth rate.I would suggest that investors be patient and disciplined an await a more attractive entry point. I understand that the shares could and probably will spike if and when the company reports some decent mileposts on RCV. But for now, I am leaving the name alone with a strategy of watchful waiting."

The difference is mainly produced by share-based compensation and ""acquisition-related matters"" (from the earnings deck):We're not worried about the GAAP losses as the company isn't burning cash (although free cash flow plunged negative in Q4, see below).The company is the undisputed leader in UCaaS (unified communications as a service), witness the Gartner Magic Quadrant (from the earnings deck):What makes the company special, well, a host of integrated services (earnings deck):But one feature stands out perhaps above all others, which is the ability for users to integrate Ring with a host of other software and systems they are using (Q4CC):The company has numerous growth avenuesIn the slide below one can gauge the strength of the enterprise, mid-market and channel partner channels; from the earnings deck:Very large deals were especially strong (Q4CC):The sales also manage to stay quite efficient despite the company moving up-market where sales cycles tend to be considerably longer, which creates a bit of a virtuous cycle for the company as these deals rake in more money which the company can then invest in its three channels (direct, channels and partners).Ring focuses especially on several verticals like financial services, healthcare and education. During Q4, these verticals were responsible for 40%+ of its $1M+ deals with financial services coming in particularly strong with deals with Arch Capital and Credit Human.One of its newer initiative is Contact Center, which offers additional up-sell opportunities (Q4CC):Over 40% of new business came from existing customers in Q4, another strong quarter for land and expand.Revenue from channel partners is growing at 60%+ and is responsible for 35% of the gain in ARR. More than 70% of the $1M+ deals also come through the channels, and the channel business has sound fundamentals (Q4CC):The company also continues broadening the channel network and deepening relationships with key partners, such as Carousel, Solaris, and Westcon.The company is launching three strategic initiatives:Of these three, the expanded strategic cooperation with AT&T (T) is most advanced and already generating revenues, from the Q4CC:AT&T could be a materially new driver for the company this year, expanding on the $15M a quarter it is already bringing in (Q4CC):Atos is helping customers with their digital transformation, more especially the digital workplace. So hooking up with a UCaaS platform, as like with AT&T, involves introducing a co-branded UCaaS solution to Atos customers, makes sense for both parties (Q4CC):While there are up-front investments required, the relationship is going to be accretive from the start. Ring also acquired some IP regarding messaging, communications and collaboration space in the deal.The potential for the Atos deal is a little hard to gauge for management at this early stage but given that it's directed mainly at large enterprises and given the long sales cycles, management isn't assuming much contribution from the Atos partnership in 2020.Ring has also entered into a strategic partnership with Avaya (OTC:AVYA), involving Ring to build Avaya Cloud office. From the PR:While ACO (Avaya Cloud Office) is going to launch on March 31 (Q4CC):However, that doesn't mean instant migration of Avaya customers and there is some confusion here with respect to the previous quote directly above (Q4CC):This is a curious disconnect with the earlier quote but what seems certain is that migration is going to ramp slowly as management has figured little in terms of revenue contribution for 2020 from ACO; so we stick to the second, not the first quote.We advice investors to read SA contributor Stamina Capital's take on this partnership:Basically Stamina Capital argues that growth will re-accelerate and this just on the Avaya partnership, there are two others which will also contribute considerably. So while this year apparently the contribution of these partnerships will be slim (with the likely exception of the AT&T partnership), the potential is enormous.The Q4 results were a blast, beating guidance (and expectations) handsomely, from the earnings deck:During the Q4CC, management was asked where the strength came from and the answer was ""across the board,"" an assessment with which one can only agree (Q4CC):From the earnings deck:The guidance only assumes some minimal contribution from Avaya.Data by YChartsIf there is a negative it's the falling GAAP margins but most of this is related to investments in partnerships, share-based compensation, amortization and acquisitions. Non-GAAP operating income rose from $17M a year ago to $24M in Q4.Data by YChartsThe reason for the slump in Q4 is simple (Q4CC):In fact, it looks to be considerably worse, from the earnings PR:But actually, with $65M in operational cash flow in 2019 (down only a little from the $72M in 2018) there are no reasons for worry.Share-based compensation isn't negligible at 10% of revenue, and it has been rising pretty fast. Dilution while not dramatic, the share count has risen substantially with the fully diluted count at 94.5M:Data by YChartsData by YChartsAnalysts expect a non-GAAP EPS of $0.94 this year rising to $1.23 in 2021. Needless to say, the valuation multiples are terrifyingly high, although not as high as those of Shopify (SHOP), but that company is growing considerably faster still.The company is the market leader in what is a $50B UCaaS market and it is cementing its position through investments in products, partnerships and integration with a host of other applications.There is also no doubt that the company keeps on exceeding expectations which it did again with a bumper Q4. But what makes us pause is the tremendous valuation multiple expansion that the shares have benefited from.While we would prefer to advice to buy on dips (which is basically not now), the potential of the company is so substantial and its position as a leader so well established that we think investors are still getting a good deal at today's prices, despite the tremendous valuation."

        Stock is overvalued relative to peers but price action suggests that stock price will move higher from here.
        Fundamentals are good and I give RingCentral a very bullish rating.","I last wrote about RingCentral, Inc. (RNG) five months ago, giving the company a strong buy rating. The only thing that has changed since then is its stock price, up 32%.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)After a strong gap up in October as a result of the announced partnership with Avaya Holdings Corp. (AVYA), the stock has consolidated and using technical analysis terminology, has formed a continuation pattern called a pennant, signaling higher prices yet to come.Early this year, the stock price broke out to all-time highs. Given that the next quarterly results will be out in early February, I am anticipating more bullish action. RingCentral has strong revenue growth, meets the software Rule of 40, and consistently beats analysts' estimates on both revenues and earnings. For these reasons I am giving RingCentral a very bullish rating.An excellent bullish case was made for the Avaya partnership in this article.I won't attempt to speculate on the numbers, but this partnership should drive RingCentral's revenue much higher.Despite strong competition in Unified-Communications-as-a-Service (UCaaS) from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), 8x8 (EGHT) and Cisco (CSCO), RingCentral is holding its own and then some in this $35 billion Total Addressable Market (NYSE:TAM).(Source: RingCentral)As I have explained in a recent article, high-growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, such companies often confound analysts who inevitably attempt to apply their beloved value metrics, with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, free cash flow margin and the software company ""Rule of 40.""RingCentral had a good year with annual revenue growth of 34%, consistent with the 5-year annual growth rate of 33% is very good.(Source: Portfolio123)RingCentral’s free cash flow margin TTM is 6% of revenues. It has been rising since 2014 and positive since mid-2016.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In RingCentral’s case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 34% + 6% = 40%The calculation comes out to 40%, and therefore, RingCentral fulfills the Rule of 40.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, RingCentral is well above the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is higher than its peers', given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that RingCentral is valued significantly higher than the average stock in my digital transformation universe.Now I am going to explore another way of evaluating RingCentral stock valuation, also relative to its peers. In this plot, the Next Year Earnings Estimate is substituted for Next Year Sales Estimate.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)From the second plot, it can be seen that RingCentral sits right on the best-fit line, suggesting that the stock is fairly valued.Based on the forward sales multiple, RingCentral is significantly overvalued. Based on the forward earnings multiple, it is fairly valued. My compromise is to declare that RingCentral is somewhat overvalued relative to its peers.One area that I monitor and use to judge company management is revenue and earnings beats. When company management gives out conservative guidance, the company generally beats analysts' estimates. RingCentral has an outstanding record in this area, handily beating estimates for both revenue and earnings for the last 5 quarters.(Source: Portfolio123)This leads me to believe that RingCentral management provides very conservative guidance and has a higher probability of beating estimates in future quarters.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still high on a historical basis. Uncertainties, such as the rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes and President Trump's impeachment, could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.RingCentral does have significant competition from companies such as Microsoft, 8x8 and Cisco. Competitors could eat into RingCentral's market share, causing revenue growth to slow and the stock price to drop.The partnership with Avaya is expected to boost revenue significantly. If this relationship does not pan out then RingCentral could suffer as a result.RingCentral is another strong SaaS company at the heart of the digital transformation revolution offering UCaaS. RingCentral stock price is experiencing new all-time highs, due to its outstanding revenue growth and recent partnership announcement with Avaya.RingCentral is starting the new year off with a bang, fulfilling the continuation pattern that was initiated with a price breakout back in October.The stock movement is supported by strong company fundamentals, including 34% revenue growth and a 6% free cash flow margin, satisfying the Rule of 40.While the stock price is valued significantly higher than other stocks in my digital transformation stock universe, the higher valuation is tempered by estimates of next year's earnings. I believe that the higher valuation is justified based on strong revenue growth and the announced partnership with Avaya.I don't believe that investors should hold back based on this higher market valuation. The stock is moving now, and I suggest that investors embrace this. I am giving RingCentral a Very Bullish rating."
4313836,104059,2019-12-24T08:00:00-05:00,"We believe that RingCentral fits our early stage compounder framework with ~100% upside over the next 24 months and could triple over five years.RNG is the de-facto winner in the highly under-penetrated Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) industry, representing twice the size of its closest competitor while also growing twice as fast.The recent Avaya partnership has the potential to scale RNG's seats from 2.5m to 20m over the next 5 years, driving revenue to >$5b vs. the Street at $2.5b.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ subscribers - find out more here.We believe that RingCentral (RNG) fits our early stage compounder framework with ~100% upside over the next 24 months driven by an inflection in revenue growth from the mid 30% range to >40%, resulting from the recent partnership announced with Avaya. Longer term we believe RNG has multi-bagger potential as the Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) industry is still under 10% penetrated globally and RNG is the de-facto winner as it is nearly twice the size of its closest competitor, growing nearly twice as fast and investing multiples of industry competitors in R&D to maintain their lead.We estimate that RNG currently has ~2.5m seats today growing ~30% per annum[1] while Avaya (a legacy on-premise provider) has ~100m active endpoints in its installed base. The industry is rapidly moving to the cloud and Avaya was unable to pivot from on-premise to the public cloud. In October of 2019 RNG and Avaya announced a partnership whereby Avaya will exclusively sell a “white label” RNG product to its customers effectively becoming a Master Agent (where they receive a portion of the monthly revenue for each seat they sell).[1] Company filings and equity research.Primary research suggests this is a game changing partnership and that RNG has the potential to scale their seats from 2.5m to over 20m in the next 5 years which would drive revenue to >$5bn vs. the sell-side at ~$2.5bn, implying an EV/Sales of ~2.75x.We believe Street estimates are far too low as analysts assume the normal fade of growth off a high base. We believe that revenue is set to accelerate starting in H2 2020 as the Avaya partnership ramps.While RNG has had a strong run over the past 2 years, we believe the price action was justified as the company has established itself as the industry leader (similar to Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY)) in an industry that is at the start of the “S-Curve” of growth.RNG is a subscriber model that also falls into our early stage compounder framework in that it has an exceptional value proposition relative to the price, strong unit economics that generate high incremental returns on capital, positive externalities for the ecosystem and an unconventional leader that is investing aggressively to grow the company’s moat. RNG is a software-as-a-service company that provides unified communications (“UCaaS”) across telephony, video, text, fax, contact center and collaboration. For ~$30 per seat per month businesses of all sizes can cheaply and flexibly establish or replace mission-critical infrastructure with a secure and scalable solution.RNG is one of the winners in the transition from traditional communication (landline telephony and email) to unified collaboration whereby employees communicate across platforms seamlessly (using landline, mobile, video, text, chat) and enterprises want greater flexibility with a lower price that only the public cloud can provide. RNG’s core Total Addressable Market (TAM) was historically small and medium-size businesses that were looking for enterprise scale communications (which typically cost $100-500/seat per month from incumbents[2]) at a reasonable price (on average $30/month from RNG). Over the past two years RNG has successfully penetrated larger enterprises (1,000-50,000 seats) expanding to an ancillary TAM with significantly better unit economics which we believe is under-appreciated by the market. If we are correct, we believe that RNG can double in the next two years and potentially triple over five years.[2] Company filings and equity research.RNG competes against both legacy telecommunications companies like Avaya (OTC:AVYA), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Mitel (NASDAQ:MITL) and the telcos/broadband companies as well as other UCaaS companies like Vonage (NASDAQ:VG) and 8x8 (NYSE:EGHT). Legacy telecommunications companies typically charge a significant upfront cost for both the desk phone and routing/network/server equipment that can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars per seat. They require a large IT team to maintain the network and computer programmers to customize the product for company-specific use cases. Many of these companies offer telephony exclusively (nothing for mobile, text, chat) and charge separately for video conferencing. There are also extensive recurring maintenance and upgrade costs. In contrast, RNG and its UCaaS peers offer their service as software that utilizes either the customers broadband or offers a private network where the UCaaS company bears the capital expenditures.A couple of notes on the above. First, the upfront cost of legacy telecommunications largely prices all small and medium-size businesses out of the market as they’d rather deploy capital to their core business. By significantly reducing the up-front costs, the UCaaS companies were successful in addressing the SMB market in a way that the legacy players couldn’t. This was particularly important for multi-office locations or those that have remote workers. The lower prices offered by the UCaaS companies significantly undercut the legacy providers causing an innovators dilemma whereby they could not offer a similar product for risk of killing their cash cow. This was one of the factors that drove Avaya to bankruptcy in 2017.Second, the UCaaS companies are offering a one-stop shop for all communications under a single plan. Not only are they cheaper but they are also better in that they offer a broader product suite. Third, unlike traditional software license models, the software-as-a-service model provides a much higher opportunity for revenue generation. As an example, most of the Adobe and Microsoft products have transitioned from a one-time up-front fee to a recurring annual fee effectively tripling their lifetime revenue potential (one of the reasons for their explosive stock prices). Fourth, after proving their product with SMBs, RNG was able to transition its product to the enterprise market employing a blue ocean strategy (now approaching 50%[3] of the business, up from ~0% in 2015) which is significantly improving unit economics as pricing is comparable and churn is lower. In this case the ancillary TAM of medium and large enterprise is more valuable than the core TAM of SMBs.[3] Company filings.Back to the subscriber model and the key investment factor – churn. In 2013 RNGs gross dollar churn rate was 18% implying that the company would need to replace ~18% of its customers per annum all else being equal. The ~18% churn makes sense when dealing with the SMB market as many companies fail and or reduce seats to reduce cost. RNG started to win business in the medium-size market in 2014 with its first enterprise client (over 1000 seats) in 2015. The critical piece of analysis was understanding the TAM.While many assumed all customers were created equally, the medium and large customers had much lower churn. As RNG has scaled in enterprise, churn has fallen to ~9%! In order to replace the 9% of customers that churn, the company spends ~50% less on sales and marketing (as a percentage of revenue) to maintain the base, which allows them to more aggressively channel those dollars to new customers which has accelerated growth.As an aside, 9% seat churn is remarkable in and of itself as it is incredibly low AND it does not tell the entire story. Revenue retention is >130% implying that the “comp store sales” customers grow on average ~30% per annum providing incredible visibility into future revenue growth. More importantly, customer lifetime value has increased by >50% as SMB customers typically generate $7 of revenue for every dollar of sales and marketing, while medium-size generates $12 and enterprise $15.The last two years we attended the Enterprise Connect conference in Orlando and spoke to both the UCaaS and legacy telecommunications providers. The primary research gave us increased conviction in both the size of the TAM as well as acceleration up the “S Curve” of adoption. It also provided insights into why RNG has won (and we believe will continue to win) in the medium and enterprise markets. While SMBs typically purchase services via e-commerce, medium and large businesses outsource IT and administration to the channel (value added resellers). Historically, the channel sold large hardware packages and received an upfront commission of 15-30%. They valued the fast payback that Cisco, Avaya and Mitel offered for selling their products and installing them.Beginning in 2015, RNG made a strategic shift to aggressively pursue channel partners yet faced significant pushback as the low upfront cost and recurring revenue streams of SaaS offered a different income opportunity to channel partners. They struggled with the slower payback periods and the impact it would have on investments and business planning. Throughout 2015 and 2016, RNG and the channel partners (of which there are now thousands) negotiated a new incentive structure whereby RNG would provide a modest upfront payment of ~10% and offer a recurring revenue model for as long as the customer stayed with the RNG product. The combination of better economics and the bankruptcy of Avaya (the largest legacy provider) drove a massive shift to RNG and tipped the channel in favor of cloud which is driving accelerating adoption of UCaaS in enterprise.RNG is a platform that is creating double-sided network effects. RNG has employed the channel to rapidly grow customers, increasing its “demand.” The channel partners understand the product and the economics and their comfort has increased brand perception with the end customer. A second means by which RNG is increasing demand side network effects is through their Glip collaboration tools (think of Glip as a social network that allows for communication internally like Slack and externally like email). As more users opt into Glip, the value of the network increases to each member.RNG is also growing “supply” network effects through offering third party services like contact center solutions from inContact and video from Zoom as well as providing integrations with CRM, ERP, enterprise productivity and cloud storage tools (among others). The RNG app developer community has expanded to ~23,000 while the number of integrations/apps has increased to ~2,300.[4] RNG is leveraging the best products and services of its ecosystem to improve its products which in turn increases ARPU, reduces customer acquisition costs and further lowers churn.[4] Company filings.In short, RNG offers a lower-priced product that is superior to legacy systems as they continuously innovate on new features and offer interoperability with the majority of cloud software providers (a key value add that customers highly value).Avaya exited bankruptcy in late 2017 with the goal of re-establishing itself as a viable long-term competitor in the Unified Communications market. Between 2017 and 2019, Avaya struggled to make the transition to the cloud driving them to announce strategic alternatives in mid-2019 which included a potential sale of the company. In Q3 2019, Avaya concluded its process without finding a buyer and in October they announced the partnership with RNG. The deal was structured such that RNG would pay $375m (through stock issuance) for up front commissions (fully refundable if Avaya doesn’t perform) and buy $125m of preferred stock in Avaya. The stocks were both up ~20% on the news as the market recognized that both parties would gain dramatically from the partnership. Source. Avaya historically was an equipment manufacturer that sold hardware to a very large installed base through both its ~4,000 in-house sales/service team and ~5,000 channel partners. Once the sale was complete, Avaya generated limited revenue from the customers with the channel driving most of the incremental service and maintenance. Accordingly, Avaya was not monetizing its ~100m seats and by partnering with RNG to create Avaya Cloud Offering (ACO) they now have the opportunity to monetize the base and create a recurring revenue stream. We estimate that the commission rate will be in the ~20% range with 5-10 months paid upfront by RNG and then a recurring revenue of ~$6 a month per seat. This will dramatically improve the long-term revenue and earnings stability of Avaya and the upfront ~$500m in cash will be used to pay off debt and buy back stock.We believe RNG got an even better deal as they now have advantaged access to the 100m customer installed base. A large portion of the installed based has been waiting for Avaya to offer a public cloud solution. Customers had invested significant upfront capital for Avaya’s hardware and did not want to rip and replace it. Avaya will now offer RNG software on the majority of legacy endpoints dramatically reducing the switching cost for customers. Avaya will also lend its brand credibility to RNG which we believe will ease the transition for large enterprises that may have feared partnering with a younger less established UCaaS provider. RNG has ~90% of its revenue in the US with a nascent international presence. Avaya will help RNG expand globally as ~50%[5] of its installed base is outside the US offering RNG a dramatic serviceable addressable market expansion.[5] Company filings and earnings transcripts.While we are generally skeptical of legacy/innovator technology partnerships, we believe that incentives are aligned as both Avaya and RNG benefit from the deal. Primary research suggests that Avaya has already changed their sales compensation structure to prioritize selling the ACO solution which will go a long way towards accelerating the transition. Primary research also suggests that the channel will also generate comparable to better returns for selling ACO relative to other UCaaS solutions.The partnership allows RNG to leverage ~4,000 Avaya internal sales/service reps and tens of thousands of channel partners effectively tripling the selling power and reducing the need for RNG to scale its internal salesforce driving superior unit economics which we believe will result in higher incremental margins.Thesis Point 1: The cloud is winning.UCaaS is at a tipping point for Enterprises. We estimate Enterprises are <5% penetrated globally. Over the past decade Enterprises have slowly gained comfort with the public cloud initially for “non-core” services and later for core workstreams. For many companies, communications were considered a core workstream and accordingly took more time for companies to warm to the idea. In 2018/2019 we have seen an inflection where all customers are now mandating a public cloud alternative and all companies (including the legacy on-premise players) are formulating public cloud strategies.RNG went from signing ~1,000 seat customers at the top end to ~50,000[6] seat customers this year with the number of 7 figure deals increasing dramatically.[6] Company filings and earnings transcripts.Avaya “threw in the towel” and partnered with RNG as they could not establish a viable public cloud option.AT&T, Telus and British Telecom have all partnered with RNG as resellers providing evidence that even the largest and most established TelCos see a strong value proposition. As an aside, we do not believe there is a better way to prove a moat than to have the largest legacy players decide not to compete with and rather partner with the innovator in the industry. Cisco acquired BroadSoft in an attempt to enter the UCaaS industry.Mitel went private and acquired Shoretel with the hopes of fixing their UCaaS problems away from the public markets.Thesis Point 2: Ring is winning in the cloud.RNG is driving accelerated organic revenue growth even before the Avaya deal.We estimate that RNG is currently driving billings growth in excess of 50% while core organic revenue growth is ~34% implying future revenue growth is likely to remain strong and has the potential to move to the high 30% range on a standalone basis.RNG reported core subscription revenue growth through Q4 2018 (no longer reporting in 2019) which showed a ~600 bps acceleration year over year. We believe the same statistic is at least 38% in 2019.Further, the remaining performance obligation (“RPO”) which is effectively the short term backlog has grown ~50% since the beginning of the year (from $600m to $900m) vs reported subscription revenue that has grown ~23% with modest changes to contract length.[7][7] Company filings. Source: Company filings and author.Source: Company filings and author.Thesis Point 3: The Avaya partnership is a game-changer, which Street estimates do not reflect.Primary research from ex-employees of RNG/Avaya and channel partners suggest that ACO has the potential to scale to 20m seats in the next 5 years for a potential 10x increase in RNG’s seats.RNG is going to add ~500k seats in 2019 pre-Avaya. Consensus estimates assume that the number of new seats is roughly flat over the next two years with revenue growth decelerating from the mid 30% range to the low 20% range.[8][8] Sell-side estimates.We expect revenue growth to accelerate to the mid to high 30% range by H2 2020 and to the high 30 to low 40% range by 2021 which implies RNG adds ~500k base seats and another 200-300k seats from the Avaya partnership.ACO is being launched in mid Q1 2020 and will likely take 1-2 quarters to ramp. That said, we expect by Q4 the organization will be able to drive significant adoption as many of our primary research calls suggest there is significant pent up demand (Avaya customers waiting for a public cloud product).In line with our view, we estimate that the upfront payment from RNG to Avaya of $375m implies that RNG is “buying” 2-3 million seats.We recognize this is very back of the envelope math and only present it as a rough estimate.Source: Author's estimates.Source: Company filings and author.We value RNG as we do with all positions, based on a discounted cash flow model. While the company is generating a 1% FCF yield today, they are investing aggressively to grow their customer base as they believe the industry is currently in land grab mode. We agree with their assessment and support the aggressive investment in customer acquisition and believe that revenue can more than double between 2019 and 2022 driving a double in the stock. By 2022, RNG (and UCaaS) will be ~10-15% penetrated in North America and 5-10% penetrated globally (total seats combined are ~450m) which leads us to believe that RNG can continue to grow revenue at 20-30% per annum through much of the next decade.Our base case implies a value of ~$260 (+60%) per share based on a discounted cash flow model where we assume:1) Mid 30% revenue growth through 2025 driven by accelerating UCaaS adoption and the Avaya partnership (implies ~17m seats by 2025)2) Implies penetration of <5% of global TAM or 12% of the US TAM3) Non-GAAP operating margin grows from ~10% in 2020 to 20% driven by declines in SG&A as a % of revenue (flat gross margins)4) An 8% weighted average cost of capital and a 4% perpetuity growth rateOur risk case implies a ~$120 stock price (-27%) with high 20% revenue growth (implying ~12m seats or 3% global TAM and 7% of US TAM), non-GAAP operating margins at ~13% and a similar cost of capital.Our reward case implies a stock price of $330 (+100%) and assumes a ~35% revenue CAGR, >20m seats (implying a 6% global TAM penetration and 13% US TAM penetration), non GAAP operating margins of 22% and a terminal growth rate of ~5%.1) Cybersecurity attack – RNG operates in the public cloud and an attack on the global infrastructure could drive slower adoption of UCaaS.2) Avaya partnership fails – expectations on the Avaya partnership are clearly higher on the buyside than the sell-side (as the stock has jumped ~20% while estimates have not moved); if Avaya slow rolls the launch or they dissolve the partnership it would be a BIG disappointment. We believe that incentives are well aligned as Avaya will make significantly more money selling ACO then without a public cloud product and they are on the hook with the investment RNG made in upfront commissions.3) Execution risk – RNG is a rapidly growing company with more demand than they currently can satisfy (per primary research and conversations with the head of sales). They need to be laser-focused on hiring to scale their platform and in training both Avaya salespeople and the new channel partners.4) Competition – we believe that Microsoft TEAMs represents the greatest risk as MSFT has a large installed base that overlaps with RNG. AMZN, Google and Zoom all have competing products that are likely to grow over time. Primary research suggests that telephony is not the core focus for ANY of the competition and that many of them have inferior products (do not control the POPs). We have heard the “big tech company” entering the space bear thesis many times but that hasn’t stopped CRM, NOW, WDAY and many others from rapidly scaling by beating their legacy competitors.1) Organic revenue growth2) Avaya partnership execution"

The biggest news on the front was its tie-up with Avaya.","Cloud-based communication services provider RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) has had a stellar year so far. Its stock has nearly doubled since the start of the year and the continuing partnerships don't seem to be stopping it.For the third quarter of the year, RingCentral's revenues grew 34% to $233.4 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $221.3 million. EPS was $0.22, compared with the Street's estimates of $0.19.By segment, software subscriptions revenue increased 33% to $211 million. Other revenues grew 43% to $22.4 million.Among key metrics, its annualized exit monthly recurring subscriptions (ARR) increased 31% to $881 million with RingCentral Office ARR growing 35% to $800 million. Mid-market and Enterprise ARR increased 61% to $426 million, Enterprise ARR grew 77% to $259 million and Channel ARR increased 63% to $263 million.For the third quarter, RingCentral expects revenues of $238-$240 million with a non-GAAP EPS of $0.21. The market was looking for revenues of $237.37 million and an EPS of $0.21. RingCentral expects to end the current year with revenues of $888-$890 million and an EPS of $0.81.RingCentral continues to deliver on its growth targets through several tie-ups. The biggest news on the front was its tie-up with Avaya (OTC:AVYA). As part of the agreement, Avaya and RingCentral will introduce a new solution, Avaya Cloud Office (ACO) by RingCentral. It will be the exclusive public Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) solution marketed and sold by Avaya. As part of this agreement, both companies will invest in development and sales and marketing of Avaya Cloud Office. RingCentral has invested $500 million with Avaya in cash and stock as part of the deal.The ACO will combine RingCentral's UCaaS platform with Avaya's technology, services, and migration capabilities and be available by the first quarter of calendar 2020. Together, the two companies will develop programs to leverage Avaya's global sales and partner network, and to build automated technologies for seamless customer transition to RingCentral's global UCaaS solution. It will enable Avaya's customers to leverage their existing investments while reducing migration complexities and timeframes. The market is pleased with this partnership.On-premise communication services such as Cisco have already positioned themselves on the cloud. For instance, Cisco acquired BroadSoft and has been developing its own UCaaS capabilities. Avaya has been trying to get its communication systems on the cloud, but has not had a lot of success. The ACO will help it get there. For RingCentral, the partnership gives it inroads into Avaya's customer base, especially in the market outside US.More recently, RingCentral also announced an extended tie-up with AT&T through the AT&T Office@Hand agreement. The agreement will bring mobile-first voice, video, online meetings, messaging, and team collaboration capabilities to businesses and vertical sectors globally through the RingCentral partnership. Additionally, the two companies will jointly develop capabilities and technologies to further integrate with AT&T's network to improve overall customer experience.The market is pleased with RingCentral. Its stock is currently trading at $170.19 with a market capitalization of $14.6 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $177.39 last month. It has climbed from a 52-week low of $64.41 in December last year.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4307514,104608,2019-11-18T13:02:19-05:00,"RingCentral reported a strong Q3 with revenue well above expectations.Their recent partnership with Avaya and expanded relationship with AT&T could propel revenue growth higher in 2020.Valuation remains at a premium, but rightfully so as this is a premium company.","RingCentral (RNG) reported another very strong quarter, something I think investors have become accustomed to over the past few reports. Revenue growth remains very strong at 34% and the raised guidance gives investors more confidence about the long-term growth trajectory.In addition, RNG talked more about their recent exclusive partnership with Avaya (OTC:AVYA), as well as their expanded relationship with AT&T (T). While both of these new events remain in early stages, it could set the company up for revenue growth accelerating in 2020 in addition to potentially more partnerships along the way.While valuation remains at a premium, I think the stock remains a long-term buy, even at these levels. Investors will always pay up for successful companies and even if valuation were to pull back a bit, the company's superior revenue growth can continue to drive stock outperformance.Data by YChartsRNG is one of the leaders in the UCaaS, or Unified Communications as a Service, market. This segment of the market focuses on the transformation of enterprise communication as it evolves from traditional landlines to newer forms of communication. RNG utilizes its cloud-based approach in order to provide flexible and cost-effective services to support an ever-changing workforce. Employees are becoming more mobile, and RNG is capturing the ""bring-your-own device"" market shares.Enterprises have rapidly moved away from traditional landlines and towards newer forms of communication, including online meetings, team collaboration, telephony, and video conferencing. RNG assists with delivering the newer forms of communication, and its cloud-based offerings enable the company to deliver more transparent revenue streams.Source: Company PresentationThe new forms of communication are here to stay. Yes, voice communication is still the dominant form of enterprise communication, but there is an increasing number of new communication forms. For example, RNG held a study surveying 2,000 customers, of which 44% said voice was their main method of communication. However, both team messaging and text followed closely behind. This demonstrates the changing landscape and need for enterprises to develop modern communication platforms.Q3 was a very strong quarter with revenue again growing 34% to $233 million, well ahead of consensus expectations for $221 million. Subscription revenue continues to drive growth, representing over 90% of revenue and growing 33%. The software revenue stream is very valuable for SaaS companies as it is highly predictable and recurring in nature, thus giving investors more confidence in placing a higher revenue multiple on the company.Source: Company PresentationThe company closed more than 30 $1+ million deals during the quarter, demonstrating their continued success moving up the market. The larger the contracts they win, the more likely this clients will turn into recurring and sticky revenue streams. I think as the company continues to scale, we will see more larger deals, which will ultimately improve the company's visibility into their revenue stream.RNG recently announced a newly formed partnership with Avaya where they will become the exclusive public UCaaS solution marketed and sold by Avaya. While contribution from this partnership is not expected to hit until late 2020, their product is expected to launch in Q1. Given the size and scale of Avaya in the communications market, this could propel RNG's revenue growth higher over the next few years.In addition, RNG announced they expanded their AT&T partnership which could add even more fuel to their revenue growth profile. RNG will become the lead UCaas provider for AT&T and the combination of two large relationships have given investors greater confidence in the longer-term trajectory of the company's growth profile.Source: Company PresentationWhile margins continue to be strong, non-GAAP operating margin of 9.3% during the quarter was largely in line with expectations and management's guidance. However, with the recent additions of Avaya and AT&T, I would expect margin expansion to remain minimal as RNG invests heavily into further expanding these relationships and accelerating revenue growth.The large revenue beat combined with strong margins led to EPS of $0.22 during the quarter, which was slightly ahead of expectations for $0.19.Source: Company PresentationQ4 revenue was guided to $238-240 million, or 26-27% growth and was slightly above consensus expectations. The company has historically guided a little conservative and I think we could see some upside to these numbers as RNG has gained significant traction in the market after signing their two large deals.For the full year, management raised revenue guidance to $888-890 million, up from $874-877 million. The 32% growth for the full year was raised slightly more than the Q3 beat. Non-GAAP operating margins were left at 9.1-9.2%, which is probably right given the investments the company will look to make in their recent large signings.The stock has moved up nearly 10% since reporting earnings given the recent signings with Avaya and AT&T as well as better than expected earnings. This name just became a little more challenging to value because of the potential for revenue acceleration next year. Investors typically place a higher valuation on companies who can accelerate their revenue growth, something we could see RNG accomplish in 2020.Data by YChartsThe challenge with RNG's valuation compared to other UCaaS and CPaaS competitors is that RNG now trades at a significant premium. One could argue that Twilio (TWLO) or Five9 (FIVN) could be better investments given a more reasonable valuation. At RNG's current level, it is challenging to see their forward revenue multiple expand much more. Rather, the company will need to rely on providing strong revenue growth to drive stock outperformance.Data by YChartsEven when looking at other leading revenue growth software names in the market, RNG's stock is not cheap.With a current market cap of $14.30 billion, cash balance of $580 million and debt of $380 million, the company has a current enterprise value of $14.10 billion. Using management's recently 2019 revenue guidance of $888-890 million, we can start to build out 2020 and 2021 revenue expectations.I think revenue growth will accelerate from the 32% growth expected in 2019 because of both the newly formed partnership with Avaya and the expanded relationship with AT&T. By becoming their exclusive UCaaS providers, RNG has put themselves in a position to rapidly scale, expand, and potentially land new partnerships along the way.Assuming revenue grows 35% in 2020 and 30% in 2021, we could see 2020 revenue of $1.2 billion and 2021 revenue of $1.55 billion. This would imply a 2020 revenue multiple of ~11.8x and a 2021 revenue multiple of ~9.1x. While these multiples are not completely out of line, they are still an expensive price to pay for the expectation of accelerating revenue growth.Yes, I do think the stock will be a winner next year and over the long-term. However, valuation is a little excessive at this point. For investors who are able to ride the wave of higher-valued companies, I think RNG is an excellent option.The stock's valuation could be a weakness if we start to see the market turn sour. Typically ,the higher-valued software names are the first ones to see their valuation pull back quite a bit. If this were to happen, I think investors would quickly put more money into the name on the basis of revenue acceleration and strong partnerships. Even after the recent 10% run up post earnings, I think the stock remains a long-term buy."
4305406,104952,2019-11-11T11:06:43-05:00,RingCentral has had a great FY 2019 so far. Subscription revenues grew at mid-30% YoY as of Q3. Contact Center solution also picked up major traction.Avaya's partnership will strengthen RingCentral's moat going forward. It is a lower-risk way to receive a secular growth exposure from the global UCaaS demand.RingCentral's up-selling and upmarket move as a result of AT&T's and Avaya's partnerships will also boost gross margin and raise switching costs.,"RingCentral (RNG) continues its solid run in FY 2019 with another outperformance in Q3. Aside from beating all the estimates, the company also recorded a $233.35 million of quarterly revenue, which represents a record-high guidance beat by ~5%.We maintain our bullish position in RingCentral. The long-term outlook appears very solid, particularly driven by the company's increasing overall moat strength as a result of its strategic partnerships with AT&T and Avaya. Meanwhile, the demand for UCaaS (Unified Communications-as-a-Service) platform continues to drive adoptions of RingCentral's mid-market and enterprise solutions across some maturing verticals. With a 34% top-line growth YoY across the board, the company has also not shown any signs of slowing down.In the competition landscape, RingCentral competes with other first-time UCaaS players such as 8x8 (NYSE:EGHT) and Vonage (NASDAQ:VG) and also legacy system players such as Comcast (CMCSA) and Cisco (CSCO).Source: G2CrowdGiven the primary nature of telephony communication demand, we believe that there are more untapped opportunities beyond the estimated $61.9 billion UCaaS market. RingCentral's largest market has been the SMB market where the greenfield demand for telephony communication is primarily addressed by UCaaS/cloud-based services.The enterprise market, on the other hand, is also interesting due to the higher vendor lock-in effect that creates a strong moat. As RingCentral penetrates the enterprise market further and increases the adoption of its contact center UCaaS, the company will need to overcome a key obstacle. The bulk of the work in converting enterprise companies into clients will involve a company-wide digital transformation to replace the legacy phone system offering for the most part. In that sense, the cost and operational burden to enter such a market are relatively also high. Consequently, the strategic partnerships with AT&T and Avaya will allow RingCentral to directly access their enterprise client base and to efficiently retain them.The key highlights in Q3 were RingCentral's strategic partnership with Avaya and extended relationship with AT&T. We believe that these enterprise-focused deals are major moat-enhancing moves. The former will allow RingCentral to immediately tap into Avaya's global install base. Consequently, the latter will allow RingCentral to extend its footprints in the domestic enterprise market.With the partnerships, RingCentral will not only diversify its revenue channel but also raise its clients' switching costs by up-selling and moving upmarket. As of Q3, RingCentral generated almost 91% of its subscription revenue from RingCentral Office solution, which targets the regular business needs of an end-to-end VoIP solution. Avaya's dominance in the hosted enterprise contact center market globally also means that RingCentral now has strategic access to Avaya's massive install base where it can directly market its RingCentral cloud-based Contact Center solution.Source: RingCentral's 10-QUltimately, RingCentral will receive instant exposure to the growing UCaaS demand across 180 countries that Avaya has already been in. Historically, RingCentral has always focused on North America, where it generates 95% of its revenue. Considering Avaya's know-how and global presence, we see the partnership as a lower-risk approach to unlock the rest of the $50 billion TAM opportunities abroad and also to diversify RingCentral's revenue geographically.Our view is that the cloud-based VoIP communication is a massively fragmented market where a lot of competitors can coexist with roughly similar offerings given the relatively mid-to-high switching cost. In the long term, we see a potential disruption danger from Zoom (ZM), wherein the company's viral marketing tactics and cross-platform video conferencing technology innovation are superior to most of the competitors we see, including RingCentral. As it stands, Zoom's dominance in video conferencing today will limit RingCentral's potential upside in that area.Compared to its peers in the VoIP communication market, RingCentral's superiority in both gross profit margin and revenue growth have set the stock to trade at a much higher premium with a 16.32 TTM P/S. Its peers, such as Five9 (FIVN) and 8x8, trade at 11.7 and 4.94 TTM P/S respectively.With such a profile, RingCentral is certainly not cheap, though its strong moat and fundamentals should justify the stock as a solid long-term buy. Considering the unchanged TTM P/S of 16.32, outstanding shares of ~82.97 million, and the expected FY 2019 revenue of $889.52 million, we are setting a conservative price target of ~$175 per share by the end of the year."

RNG is the leader in the UCaaS market and has rightfully deserved to trade at a premium to the market and near the higher-end of SaaS companies. Even with the stock near an all-time high, growth remains very impressive, with revenue growing 34% during the quarter, well ahead of consensus expectations for ~28% growth.Management also raised their 2019 guidance which now demonstrates revenue growing ~30% compared to consensus expectations for ~28% growth. In addition Q3 revenue guidance was better than expected. With the company firing on all cylinders and continuing their market-leading growth, there are few questions to why the stock is trading near all-time highs including trading up over 10% since reporting earnings.Data by YChartsWhile I was previously a bit neutral on the name post-Q4 earnings, I believe the company has demonstrated two very strong quarters of growth and guidance raises, reinforcing their leadership position and demonstrating why they deserve to continue to trade at a premium valuation. The stock was pretty flat from mid-February to mid-April, but after posting strong Q1 and Q2 earnings, the stock is up nearly 35% since then.Even with the recent run-up, I believe there is still upside remaining in this name. While it might not be the most opportune moment to put new capital to work, investors who current hold this name in their portfolio should not look to trim their position as there is still upside to current prices. RNG's current premium valuation will stay for quite some time and investors should look forward to a successful second half of the year.RNG is one of the leaders in the UCaaS, or Unified Communications as a Service, market.

Software subscription revenue continues to impress, growing 33% to $195 million during the quarter and now represents around 90% of total revenue. Guidance for subscription revenue was only for $185.5-187.5 million and the strong beat here demonstrates the underlying strength in the business. The software revenue stream is very valuable for SaaS companies as it is highly predictable and recurring in nature, thus giving investors more confidence in placing a higher revenue multiple on the company.Source: Company PresentationThe company also continues to move up the market and gain more share with larger enterprises. During Q2, there were 30 deals with total contract value reaching the seven-figure total. The larger clients and contracts are a positive sign for more sustainable and recurring revenue growth as larger enterprise revenues are typically stickier and are less likely to leave.Gross margin continue to remain healthy at 76.7% during the quarter and are likely to remain in the high-70's over the long term. Given a majority of their revenue is software based, their operations naturally have a higher gross margin (given software does not have as many cost of goods sold compared to hardware products).Source: Company PresentationIn addition, RNG continues to impress on operating margins, posting an operating margin of 9.5% during the quarter compared to management's previous guidance 8.3-8.5%. Combined with the strong revenue beat, this led to EPS for the quarter coming in at $0.21, ahead of expectations for $0.15-0.17 and consensus expectations for $0.16.Source: Company PresentationManagement also provided guidance for Q3 which includes revenue of $220-222 million (27-28% growth) with subscription revenue of $200-202 million (27-28% growth). This appears to be somewhat conservative given the company's history of exceeding their guidance range and Q2 revenue just coming off a 34% growth quarter. Operating margins are expected to be 9.2-9.4% leading to EPS of $0.18-0.20.Management also raised their guidance for the full year to include revenue of $874-877 million (30% growth) compared to their previous guidance for $862-866 million (28-29%). Remember to start the year, management originally guided to 26-28% growth. With Q2 revenue coming in ~$10 million ahead of their previous guidance, management's recent 2019 guidance raise is pretty similar to the amount they just beat by, implying they could be leaving a little conservatism in their guidance.While the recent run-up has led to the stock trading near all-time highs, valuation is not completely unreasonable. The company continues to report revenue growth of 30%+ and even with the recently raised guidance, it appears conservative and beatable for the rest of the year.RNG currently trades ~12.5x forward revenue, a considerable premium to some other UCaaS and CPaaS competitors such as 8x8 (EGHT) and Vonage (VG). However, RNG is moving closer to Twilio's (TWLO) valuation and rightfully so. Their premium revenue growth and history of beating and raising guidance warrants a premium valuation.Data by YChartsRNG's current market cap is ~$11.5 billion and with a net cash balance of ~$200 million, the company has an enterprise value of ~$11.3 billion. Management's recently raised revenue guidance of $874-877 million now represents ~30% growth for the year. I believe the company will be able to beat this given they just beat Q2 revenue guidance by ~$10 million and they could end the year with revenue closer to $900 million.Assuming revenue decelerates a little bit in 2020 to ~28% growth, we could see 2020 revenue of $1.15 billion. Using the current $11.3 billion enterprise, this implies a valuation of under 10x revenue.Data by YChartsWhile 10x forward revenue is not cheap by any means, there are several software companies throughout the market that trade at higher valuations given similar revenue growth and margin profiles. While I am not advocating RNG should trade at 20x forward revenue, I believe there is some room for their multiple to expand if the company is able to consistently produce impressive revenue growth and raise guidance along the way.Given the stock is near all-time highs, this might not be the best moment to build a new position in the name, however, long-term investors should look to add on any future dips and hold onto the name. While it seems tempting to sell and realize some profits in this name, I believe guidance remains somewhat conservative and beatable for the rest of the year. Another impressive quarter and beat and raise could lead to the stock reaching $160 by the end of the year.Risks to RNG include increased competition from both EGHT and VG. As the competitors continue to grow in size, they will begin to compete for a similar customer cohort which may cause RNG's revenue growth to decelerate quicker than anticipated. In addition, being a highly valued name based on forward revenues, it is subject to large corrections in the market. We have seen the tech market as a whole self-correct over time as revenue multiple continues to reach new levels."

After consolidating for the last three weeks, it looks like the stock is ready for further gains.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)RingCentral has been handily outperforming the Invesco Dynamic Software ETF (PSJ) in August, a fund comprised of many SaaS stocks.The recent price action, along with company fundamentals and promising growth potential, leads me to give RingCentral a strong buy rating. In my opinion, the price action and strong fundamentals outweigh the stock valuation which is overvalued relative to its peers. If you are an aggressive investor, then now is the time to jump in.RingCentral has a strong YoY revenue growth of 34%. But what is more interesting is the very convincing 66% YoY revenue growth in mid-market and enterprise supported by a rapidly expanding channel partner ecosystem which grew at 69% YoY.(Source: RingCentral)Larger business sales will soon start to dominate total sales and could very well lift annual revenue growth from the already great 34%. Not only is revenue growth higher for larger companies but customer churn is half that of small business.(Source: RingCentral)RingCentral is also growing its 10,000 strong channel partner ecosystem which targets large businesses, resulting in less churn and higher revenue expansion.RingCentral is identified as a Gartner Magic Quadrant Leader for Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS) with other leaders being Microsoft (MSFT), 8x8 (EGHT) and Cisco (CSCO).(Source: Gartner)Despite the strong competition, RingCentral is holding its own and then some in this $35 billion Total Addressable Market (TAM).(Source: RingCentral)I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for the 82 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV, ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, RingCentral is sitting above the trendline, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that RingCentral is overvalued relative to the average stock in my digital transformation universe.High-growth companies generally sacrifice profits for growth, and traditional value factors such as P/E ratio are not meaningful. Therefore, I focus on other metrics such as the ""Rule of 40,"" free cash flow margin, and cash burn to evaluate software companies.The Rule of 40 is a metric used by software companies to help them achieve a balance between growth and profitability. The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus profit adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and profit and is financially healthy.RingCentral's management is well versed in the Rule of 40 and it is in fact presented in the 2018 Investor Day Presentation.Just to keep the company's management honest, I have done my own Rule of 40 calculation and it is summarized below.RingCentral's revenue grew by 33.7% for the most recent twelve months.(Source: Portfolio123)RingCentral had a free cash flow margin of 5.6% for the most recent twelve-month period. The free cash flow margin has been steadily rising since at least 2014.(Source: Portfolio123)RingCentral's YoY revenue growth was 33.7%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was 5.6%. Therefore:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 33.7% + 5.6% = 39.3%Since the Rule of 40 calculation comes at approximately 40%, I conclude that the company is financially healthy.Normally, when a company fulfills the Rule of 40, I don't analyze cash burn. But I am providing the SG&A expense here for reference. From looking at the SG&A expense relative to sales, I can tell that RingCentral’s cash burn is elevated but not severe. The SG&A expense is 78% of revenues but has been steadily decreasing since 2014.Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.(Source: Portfolio123)Another way to look at cash burn is to create a scatter plot that shows the operating margin/EV versus forward sales growth for SaaS stocks. The operating margin for my purposes is calculated as follows:Operating Margin = Gross Margin TTM - SG&A Expense Margin TTM(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The operating margin is above the trendline, suggesting that cash burn is less than its peers.There are many SaaS stocks with extreme valuations, and it is possible that we could have a dot-com-like crash in the future. In this case, I would expect to see RingCentral’s stock price to fall along with the rest of the market.The trade dispute between President Trump and China is ongoing and has the potential to cause market turbulence or even drive the United States into a recession.RingCentral is a high beta stock with a 1-year beta of 1.97. If there is a stock market correction, then investors should expect losses higher than the general market.As the RingCentral sales mix adjusts towards the higher end of the market, sales will come slower and revenue growth lumpier. This could give the appearance of growth deceleration at times.Now that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has its own telephony offering, the RingCentral-Google partnership could lose steam.RingCentral is a high growth SaaS company that is growing revenue by 34% YoY. While competition is strong, I see no reason why strong revenue growth should not be sustained for a few years to come given the excellent growth figures coming from mid-market, enterprise and channel partners. The stock chart suggests that the stock price is ready to continue rising after and breakout from $125 then a period of consolidation. Although the stock is overvalued relative to its peers, I am still giving this stock a strong buy rating based on fundamentals and technicals. I suggest placing a protective stop below $125."
4296255,99986,2019-10-13T05:51:15-04:00,"RingCentral continues to be the performance leader in the software space, up 112% for the year.The company's quarterly revenue growth rates in the low 30% range continue to remain strong, but mild deceleration is likely in Q3.I believe this is an opportune time to take some profits on the stock.","It's been an incredible year for RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) shareholders, with the stock up 110% year-to-date, and only second to Coupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP) for performance among its peers. The stock gapped up by 28% last week after the announcement that the company would become the exclusive provider of unified communications as a service (UCAAS) for Avaya Holdings (OTC:AVYA). This is undoubtedly a bullish development for the stock, but I believe that a good chunk of this news is now priced into the stock short-term. RingCentral is currently trading just below the 20x price-to-sales ratio ceiling where many tech names have trouble and has gone parabolic following the news. I see no reason to cash in all of one's chips here for RingCentral shareholders, but I believe this is a strategic spot to book some profits. The stock could undoubtedly head higher long-term, but short-term, it's getting closer to fully valued.(Source: TC2000.com, Barron's.com)The software stocks (IGV) have seen a nasty correction the past couple of months, but RingCentral has been the shining star among the group. While the Software Index is down 13% from its highs, with many individual names down 30% or more, RingCentral has managed to buck the trend completely. Avalara (AVLR), Twilio (TWLO), and Alteryx (AYX) have all fallen significantly from their Q2 highs, but RingCentral is currently 20% above those levels. This is a significant divergence by the stock, in part due to the recent announcement. The problem, however, is that the stock is finally beginning to get closer to fully valued after this jump. Before going into the valuation, however, let's take a look at the company's robust growth metrics which got it here:(Source: TC2000.com)Taking a look at the below chart of RingCentral's annual earnings per share (EPS), we can see a steady uptrend in the past eight years. While the company was posting net losses until 2015, this trend reversed in 2016, and we've seen exceptional growth in EPS since. Earnings per share were up 520% in FY-2017, 63% in FY-2018, and are expected to grow in the low single digits this year. However, the market is mostly interested in the next 12-18 months, and FY-2020 is expected to post a new high in annual EPS at $0.96 based on current estimates. This will translate to 23% growth year-over-year and back to the levels where the best growth stocks tend to traffic in. In summary, from an annual EPS standpoint, there are lots of things to like here. The FY-2019 growth of only 2% can be overlooked, as the market is forward-looking and is more interested in the double-digit growth for FY-2020.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)Moving to quarterly revenue growth rates, RingCentral has consistently put up low to mid 30% growth in the past eight quarters. This is exceptional growth for a company of its size above $10 billion, and it saw another quarter of 34% growth in Q2. The company reported revenue of $215.2 million, up from $173.8 million the prior year. The only issue with revenue growth here is that forward estimates are looking like we might have some deceleration on the horizon. Deceleration is not a huge issue when it's to the tune of only 600-800 basis points, but it can be an issue for a stock trading at a lofty valuation. Current estimates for Q3 are sitting at $221.0 million, and this would translate to a 27% growth year-over-year from last year's Q3 revenue of $173.8 million. If the company cannot beat on these numbers, this will be a 700 basis point deceleration from current growth rates averaging 34%.The blue line in the below chart represents the quarterly growth rate, while the white line represents the two-quarter average. I like to use a two-quarter average for revenue growth rates as it helps to smooth out any lumpy quarters and better dictates the overall trend. As we can see, this deceleration that is being telegraphed based on estimates would see a new downtrend begin for revenue growth rates. If the company reports between $219.0 million and $222.3 million in revenue for Q3, this will drop the two-quarter average revenue growth rate down from 34% as of last quarter to 30.5% for this quarter. As mentioned, this is not a material deceleration, but it can be a problem for a company that is close to fully valued.It's important to note that estimates are not guaranteed, nor are they written in stone for what a company will report. Instead, they give us an idea of what we can expect. If RingCentral can blow estimates out of the water and report $239 million in revenues or higher, we will not see any deceleration. However, I would be shocked by this big of a beat.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)While earnings per share growth remains strong with 23% growth expected in FY-2020, it is possible we're finally going to see some deceleration in the revenue growth rates. Investors are going to want to see $235 million or better for Q3 2019 revenue, or we will have our first quarter of deceleration since last year.Moving to RingCentral's valuation, the company's price to sales ratio (P/S) is beginning to get a little frothy. At current levels of $174.00 per share, RingCentral is trading at 18.0x price to sales. While some tech companies can trade well above these levels, the majority of them are unable to get past this hurdle. As the chart below shows, Twilio (TWLO) topped at 20.0x price to sales on two occasions, Paycom Software (PAYC) topped at 20.0x price to sales, and Avalara topped at 18.0x price to sales recently. Also, newcomer Anaplan (PLAN) recently peaked at 22.0x price to sales. One of the only companies to blast through this 20.0x price to sales ceiling is Coupa Software, which is currently trading at 28.0x.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)Taking a look at the sales growth rates of these peers, we can see that RingCentral and Paycom Software have the lowest growth of the peer group in the low 30% range. Twilio has the highest quarterly revenue growth at over 80%, with Coupa Software in second at 54%. The median sales growth of the peer group is 44.5%, while the average sales growth is 49%. Based on this, RingCentral has lower sales growth than both the median and average within this peer group. If four out of five of these peers topped at 20.0x price to sales with median sales growth of 44.5% and average sales growth of 49%, it would be shocking if one of the lowest growth names managed to get past this 20.0x ceiling. The only company to get through this ceiling with ease was Coupa Software, and it saw revenue growth rates accelerate from the 40% range up to the 54% range in the last quarter. Based on this, I believe it's highly unlikely that RingCentral is able to get through this ceiling with current sales growth rates of 34%. It does not help that the company's sales growth is expected to decelerate slightly heading into next quarter.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)In summary, from a valuation standpoint, RingCentral is close to fully valued here at 18.0x sales when compared to its peers. It could hit the 20.0x price-to-sales ceiling or even head above it, but the odds would suggest that the reward to risk up here is not ideal. This is because RingCentral is in the lower growth cohort of its peer group and is trading just shy of where its peers topped on a price-to-sales basis.If we look at the technical picture, the stock continues to remain in a powerful uptrend and will stay in this uptrend as long as it remains above $145.00. The stock is beginning to get a little later stage as this is the stock's fourth base breakout in the past 18 months, but this is not a topping signal in itself. Instead, fourth and fifth base structures suggest that a stock may be getting a little later stage. The key for the bulls will be defending the $147.00 level and the prior highs on any pullbacks. A drop back into this base on a weekly close would be a bearish sign.(Source: TC2000.com)Moving to the daily chart, however, we can see some potential signs of exhaustion on the horizon. Over the past three years, RingCentral has either gone sideways for three or more months or dropped 15% or more after trading more than 45% above its 200-day moving average (blue line). The stock is currently the most extended above the 200-day moving average it has been in the past three years, and this suggests that the best-case scenario is sideways for the next three months. While further upside is undoubtedly possible as anything is in the market, the odds would indicate any move above the $185.00-188.00 level before year-end will likely run into selling pressure. For this reason, the stock remains extended here short-term.(Source: TC2000.com)While a test of the 200-day moving average near $140.00 does not have to occur as it has twice after the stock got extended, a pullback to the 50-day moving average would not be shocking. The 50-day moving average will likely be at the $150.00 level by the end of November, as it's gaining ground at a pace of $0.40 per day. It's also possible the stock goes sideways here and builds a new base. However, I think a correction of 10-15% is the more likely scenario.RingCentral is an exceptional growth stock with an exciting new deal, but it's beginning to approach full valuation here short-term. Without a significant beat and raise on the Q3 revenue above $238 million, I would expect the $190.00 level to be the ceiling for the stock into year-end. Based on the fact that the stock likely has an 8% upside over the next three months and a 10% downside after reaching overvalued levels, the reward to risk is no longer in favor of the bulls. For this reason, I believe this is an opportune time to take some profits and ring the register on half of one's position. The stock could undoubtedly head higher long-term, but short-term, it's getting a little frothy over $174.00."

Prior to the listing, the company had raised $45 million from investors including Akkadian Ventures, Hermes Growth Partners, RTP Ventures, Scale Venture Partners, Khosla Ventures, Silicon Valley Bank, DAG Ventures, Cisco, and Sequoia Capital.RingCentral recently announced the acquisition of a leading cloud-based digital customer engagement platform called Dimelo for an undisclosed sum. Paris-based Dimelo was founded in 2006 to offer a digital-only customer engagement platform. Its customer list includes names like Allianz, AXA, BNP Paribas, ENGIE, Orange, and Telenor.RingCentral plans to leverage Dimelo's capabilities to offer a modern end-to-end solution in the high-growth customer engagement solutions market. Dimelo's AI-based routing engine will allow its agents to efficiently manage customer interactions across digital channels via a single interface. Prior to the acquisition, Dimelo was privately held. Its financial and funding details are not publicly known.RingCentral has been working on the addition of artificial intelligence capabilities to its services by tying up with third-party partners. It recently announced partnerships with Gong.io, ThetaLake, and Velvetech to provide real-time and post-call voice analytics services to global customers. For instance, Velvetech is leveraging RingCentral's open APIs to build a custom, real-time transcription solution with machine learning capabilities that can extract real-time insights to coach sales agents and drive improved sales performance.Additionally, RingCentral also is adding enhancements to its integrations with Box (NYSE:BOX) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The new enhancements with Box include the capability to allow users to archive key RingCentral communications data such as SMS, fax, voicemails, and call recordings automatically to their Box account. This information can then be used by Box's AI tool called Box Skills to improve performance. Similarly, Google's enhancements include the native Google Calendar Add-on that will allow users to schedule a meeting or conference call without having to toggle between applications.RingCentral's product upgrades will help it compete more effectively with its rivals like Nextiva and 8×8 (NYSE:EGHT), which offer similar services at similar price points. These players also are tying up with other technology players to offer seamless products. For instance, recently, Nextiva announced a strategic tie-up with Nitel, a technology services provider to improve their customer experience.I would like to know from SMB users of these integrated VoIP services about the features that attract them to their VoIP vendor. What makes you choose RingCentral over other alternatives?RingCentral's shares are currently trading at $76.40 with a market capitalization of $6.1 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $98.15 in September this year and a 52-week low of $43.85 in November last year."

While we still see gains, it's perhaps best to wait for a dip in the price.You can see the company's products on its website and a little oversight what it does from the company's earnings deck:RNG's cloud platform is the fastest growing UCaaS platform (according to Synergy) and a market leader, according to Gartner (earnings deck):The company grows through the following:The market is shifting to cloud platform solutions and away from legacy solutions. RingCentral's big contract win from the Columbia University competing against the top legacy solutions providers is simply a sign of the times. From the Q4CC:Cloud platforms have crucial advantages, such as connections, scalability, expansion and a seamless user experience (for a description of the advantages and the difference with VoIP solutions, see here).The company made two acquisitions, Connect First and Dimelo, which it used to launch its customer engagement platform RingCentral Engage. Although they don't contribute any significant amount of revenue, they're tuck-in acquisitions acquired for their platform-enhancing capabilities and further boost upsell opportunities.The company launched other new products like its unified mobile app (Q4CC)...The channel partners is a somewhat surprising source of growth, given it is now being a $180M business growing at 80% (in Q4 y/y). Also, 70% of the company's seven-figure wins were from channel partners.Perhaps somewhat counterintuitive, the economics are also favorable (Q4CC):Management expects this 80% channel growth to continue.The company has a blossoming ecosystem of app developers and app integrators, as well as a series of business app integrations from well-known providers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). From the Q4CC:The company's international sales are still small (less than 10% of revenue), but they are growing faster than overall sales, and the company is making an effort to increase its international footprint.RNG is already well established in the UK and Canada, but is now moving to France and Australia, for instance.Here are the highlights from the company's earnings deck:As you can see, the company had a massive quarter, beating expectations by $8M, of which 40% materialized in the bottom line. Management argues this is an inherent leverage of the SaaS business model, driven by two forces:One should keep in mind that Q4 is a seasonally strong quarter for the company, although this seasonality isn't that strong. EPS beat by $0.05 and came in at $0.23, and revenue grew 34%.Here is another look (earnings deck):The company used to do $50M per year in business with AT&T (NYSE:T). It has re-engaged with AT&T late last year, and although management doesn't expect all that much revenue from AT&T in 2019, this has a clear potential for the future.The company had a very good quarter getting other big customers on board as it raked in eight seven-digit TCV (total contract value) deals in Q4 (one of which was an eight-figure deal, the company's first). For the year, there were eight of these big deals, so all of them barring one arrived in Q4.From the earnings deck:Management argues that the company is well on track to break the $1B revenue in 2020 and that seems a pretty reasonable assumption.Data by YChartsGAAP margins have trended up, although not recently. Here is a more detailed view from the 10-K:Non-GAAP margins are considerably higher. Here is the difference for Q1:Data by YChartsThe company's cash flow has steadily improved and now solidly positive, although this is due to share-based compensation, which has also led to a considerable dilution, much of it through non-stop selling from executives (scroll down to the bottom here).Data by YChartsThe company's balance sheet is pretty healthy. From the 10-K:The success of the company hasn't exactly gone unnoticed:Data by YChartsValuation is fairly steep, although on a forward basis, that comes down to 10x sales. The company's recent earnings considerably beat analyst estimates. From SA:Analysts expect an EPS (non-GAAP) of $0.71 this year rising to $0.94 next year, but clearly shares are still very expensive on an earnings basis. Given the market recovery and the excellent Q4 results, the stock has been on a tear since late last year:And there is a little figure in the 10-K, which is quite telling:RingCentral clearly has the right products and is getting ever bigger clients. We think there is every reason to expect this growth to continue, as the company has a number of cylinders to fire on, and the market is still in the early innings with its shift to the cloud.But RNG's shares already reflect much of that growth. We don't see room for valuation multiple expansion, and the share count is a bit of a drag on EPS growth.The next phase will be when operational leverage turns into GAAP profits. The cash flows can be used to buy back shares, and we're not that far off."
4247678,104608,2019-03-11T05:50:44-04:00,"RingCentral remains the leader in the UCaaS market and continues to trade at a premium valuation, near all-time highs.Q4 revenue and earnings came in ahead of consensus and management's expectations, sending shares up over the next few days.2019 guidance was well above consensus estimates, yet Q1 guidance seems conservative and beatable.Valuation has pulled back a bit from pre-correction highs, but tech valuations in general have remained suppressed compared to late 2018 highs.","RingCentral (RNG) remains the leader in the UCaaS market and has earned its premium valuation. I have previously discussed RNG, and in August, I noted investors should look to take a profit, and then in November, I recommended picking up some shares at a more reasonable valuation. As you can see from the chart below, post-Q2 earnings, the stock was at a high point.After watching the stock fall in late September and October, valuation receded quite a bit and made it very tempting to purchase more shares. After a very strong beat in Q4 and encouraging guidance, the stock popped again and reached its all-time highs.Q4 revenue came in well above both consensus expectations and management's quarterly guidance. Management also provided 2019 guidance above consensus estimates and now appears to be on pace to overachieve its $1 billion 2020 revenue goal. The stock remains a winner over the past year, similar to its competitors in the UCaaS market, notably 8x8 (EGHT) and Vonage (VG).Data by YChartsRNG popped over 6% following the Q4 earnings report and 2019 guidance. However, after quickly reaching the all-time highs, the stock seems to have hit a top and has dropped a bit since. For now, it seems like expectations are fully priced in, and it could be challenging to find a ton of upside from here. However, over the longer term, RNG will continue to perform well, and we could continue to see the stock returns demonstrate outperformance.RNG is one of the leaders in the UCaaS, or Unified Communications as a Service, market. This segment of the market focuses on the transformation of enterprise communication as it evolves from traditional landlines to newer forms of communication. RNG utilizes its cloud-based approach in order to provide flexible and cost-effective services to support an ever-changing workforce. Employees are becoming more mobile, and RNG is capturing the ""bring-your-own device"" market shares.Source: Company PresentationEnterprises have rapidly moved away from traditional landlines and towards newer forms of communication, including online meetings, team collaboration, telephony, and video conferencing. RNG assists with delivering the newer forms of communication, and its cloud-based offerings enable the company to deliver more transparent revenue streams.Source: Company PresentationThe new forms of communication are here to stay. Yes, voice communication is still the dominant form of enterprise communication, but there is an increasing number of new communication forms. For example, RNG held a study surveying 2,000 customers, of which 44% said voice was their main method of communication. However, both team messaging and text followed closely behind. This demonstrates the changing landscape and need for enterprises to develop modern communication platforms.Q4 was another very strong quarter for RNG, delivering revenue growth of 34% and subscription revenue growth of 38% excluding AT&T (NYSE:T). Revenue also beat consensus estimates of ~$182 million. This is very impressive considering RNG is the largest player in the UCaaS market ($189 million in Q4 revenue). It primarily competes with other UCaaS players such as EGHT and VG.RNG continues to move up the market and enter into the enterprise landscape. In fact, the company closed a record number of seven-figure total contract value deals this past quarter, which included its first eight-figure deal. This is a great sign for RNG, and the enterprise market tends to be a bit stickier with higher recurring revenue and larger contract values.Source: Company PresentationGross margin expanded ~60bps to 77.5% compared to 76.9% in the year-ago period. Gross margins are likely to remain in the high-70s range even as the company's growth eventually decelerates. This is because of the cloud-based and subscription revenue streams. This type of revenue has significantly lower costs compared to the hardware counterparts.Source: Company PresentationDuring Q4, RNG posted operating margins of 9.2%, which were significantly ahead of management's guidance of 7.9-8.1%, ultimately leading to an EPS of $0.23. EPS was ahead of management's estimate for $0.17-0.19 and above consensus expectations for $0.18.Source: Company PresentationManagement provided guidance for Q1 which included revenue of $191.5-194.5 million, representing 27-29% growth. This seems somewhat conservative given the company's 30%+ growth rate each quarter in 2018 and Q4's revenue growth of 34%. However, management's Q1 guidance came in above consensus estimates for 23-24% growth.What's impressive about the Q1 guidance is the software subscription growth of 28-30%. Although the full-year guidance is 26-28% (implying deceleration throughout the year), management remains confident in the long-term growth potential of software subscriptions.For the full year, management guided to revenue of $847-859 million, representing growth of 26-28%, and software subscription revenue of $775-785 million, representing growth of 26-28%. Full-year revenue guidance came in well ahead of consensus expectations for $823 million.The strong Q4 results reinforced RNG's premium valuation and justify why it is currently trading near all-time highs. The company's continued 30%+ revenue growth and even higher software subscription revenue growth demonstrate its ability to retain market leadership and its ability to continue to take market share.Currently, RNG trades at nearly 9.5x forward revenues, a significant premium to competitors in the UCaaS and CPaaS industry. Revenue growth is above a majority of its competitors, and the company does have a significant market share, however, which warrants the premium valuation.Data by YChartsOn Friday, RNG's market cap was ~$8.3 billion. With a net cash balance of ~$200 million, the company had an enterprise value of ~$8.1 billion as of Friday's closing price of $101.89.Management guided to subscription revenue of $775-785 million for FY19, representing a growth rate of 26-28%. To be conservative, I will assume RNG does not beat and raise throughout the year, but instead just comes in at the high end of guidance. Assuming $785 million in FY19 subscription revenue and deceleration to 20% growth in FY20 (which could be a terrible guidance), we could see subscription revenue of ~$945 million.Doing the same thing for total revenue, management guided to $847-859 million, also representing a 26-28% growth. Assuming this decelerates to 20% growth in FY20, we could see RNG's 2020 revenue of $1,025 million, eclipsing management's longer-term 2020 revenue target of $1 billion.Using total revenue of $1,025 million and Friday's enterprise value of ~$8.1 billion, RNG is currently trading at just under 8x revenue. If investors continue to believe RNG should trade at a premium, which I believe is true, we could see the company's multiple remain around 9x at the end of 2019, thus there could still be some upside remaining throughout the year.Despite the 2020 revenue multiple slowly reaching 9x as the year progresses, management's 2019 guidance seems somewhat conservative. If RNG is able to beat and raise revenue, just like it has in the past, we could see the stock price continue to outperform the market.Risks to RNG include increased competition from both EGHT and VG. As the competitors continue to grow in size, they will begin to compete for a similar customer cohort which may cause RNG's revenue growth to decelerate quicker than anticipated. In addition, being a highly valued name based on forward revenues, it is subject to large corrections in the market. We have seen the tech market as a whole self-correct over time as revenue multiple continues to reach new levels."

I previously wrote an article noting valuation appeared to be a bit stretched, given the stock was trading near all-time highs. Now down over 20% since my article, I think valuation has stepped down to more realistic levels and a strong Q3 earnings report reinforces the long-term thesis.RNG reported subscription revenue growing 38% in Q3, accelerating from 34% growth last year and even accelerated from 32% last quarter. The stock remains a winner over the past year, similar to their competitors in the UCaaS market, notably 8x8 (EGHT) and Vonage (VG).RNG data by YChartsRNG popped over 15% the days following their strong Q3 earnings report. However, market turbulence and consistent uncertainty about where the global economy is going have caused the tech sector to underperform as of recently.

This compares to other leading UCaaS players such as EGHT ($81 million in FQ2) and VG.Source: Company PresentationGross margin expanded ~100bps to 77%, compared to 76% last year and 77% last quarter.

This type of revenue has significantly lower costs compared to their hardware counterparts.Source: Company PresentationManagement also raised their full-year guidance by $13 million at the midpoint, resulting in a 32% revenue growth range (compared to 29-30% previous growth range). Subscription revenue was raised by $9.5 million at the midpoint, now representing a growth of 30-31%, slightly below the 32% growth seen in Q3. Core subscription revenue, which excludes AT&T, is now guided to 36%, up from 34-35%. This shows that the AT&T revenue stream is still a drag on the company; however, revenue growth remains very healthy.The strong Q3 results reinforced RNG's premium valuation and the 20% pullback from recent highs provides investors a great opportunity to build a position at this level. The 30%+ revenue growth and impressive margin targets reinforce the premium valuation compared to the broader software communications market.Currently, RNG trades at nearly 9x forward revenues, a significant premium to competitors in the UCaaS and CPaaS industry. RNG's revenue growth is above a majority of these competitors and they do have a significant market share, however, which warrants the premium valuation.RNG EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsWhen looking at forward revenue compared to their closest competitors, EGHT and VG, RNG trades at a 4-5 turn premium. This is a significant premium considering RNG's top-line growth in Q3 (33%) easily beat EGHT (19%) and VG (~15%) when it came to direct UCaaS revenue (VG competes in the UCaaS, UPaaS, and CCaaS markets).Google Finance reported RNG's market cap on Friday at $6.14 billion. With a net cash balance of ~$215 million, RNG had an enterprise value of $5.9 billion as of Friday's closing price of $76.40.Management guided subscription revenue to $606-608 million for F18, representing a growth rate of 30-31%. Let's assume for F19, the growth slightly decelerates to 25%, implying subscription revenue of ~$760 million. Total revenue is guided to $664-667 million, representing a growth rate of 32%. Again, let's assume this growth rate decelerates to 25%, which would imply total revenue of ~$832 million.Using management's subscription and total revenue guidance and my implied F19 25% growth rate, RNG trades at a F19 revenue multiple of 7.8x at the midpoint (subscription revenue only) and 7x (total revenue). I believe a ~8x F19 revenue multiple is warranted because of RNG's above industry-average revenue growth and significantly larger market share.RNG’s 20%+ correction over the past few weeks has made valuation a bit more tempting. With revenue growth accelerating in Q3, margins remaining healthy, and management remaining optimistic about future growth, now could be a great time to build a position in this name. Trading ~$75, RNG provides investors a great long-term investment with the ability to buy on any dips related to the broader market volatility.Risks to RNG include increased competition from both EGHT and VG. As the competitors continue to grow in size, they will begin to compete for a similar customer cohort which may cause RNG's revenue growth to decelerate quicker than anticipated.

According to the researcher, the low cost of calls offered by VoIP providers are driving growth in the industry. Billion-Dollar Unicorn RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) offers these SaaS-based communication services to small business. Recent results suggest that it's doing rather well so far.San Mateo, California,-based RingCentral was founded in 2003 by Vlad Shmunis and Vlad Vendrow. It offers hosted phone systems through its flagship products RingCentral Office, RingCentral Mobile, and RingCentral Internet Fax. Its core offering RingCentral Office is a VoIP service that enables businesses to connect teams in different locations. The service comes with advanced features such as multi-extension business phone systems, fax service, unlimited calling, and pre-configured phones. Its Mobile offering provides customers with access to a single local or toll-free number that connects their existing phone lines as virtual extensions. It also offers additional services such as an Internet fax product, a virtual Meeting room, and a collaborative platform called Glip. I had met Vlad Shumnis a few years ago when he explained how the business grew into becoming a ""business-in-a-box idea.""RingCentral earns revenues through monthly subscriptions. For its recently reported first quarter, revenues grew 34% over the year to $150 million. Revenues were ahead of market expectations of $145.4 million. EPS of $0.16 grew 77% over the year and was ahead of the Street's forecast of $0.12 for the quarter.By segment, software subscription revenues grew 32% over the year to $136.96 million.

Earlier this quarter, it announced the launch of RingCentral Collaborative Contact Center solution, an offering that transforms the way organizations manage customer engagement. The new service integrates contact center features with team messaging, thus enabling communication and collaboration across agents and supervisors on a real-time basis to resolve customer issues efficiently.It also announced the release of RingCentral Pulse, another innovative solution that provides intelligent bots that monitor critical call center metrics in real time. The offering is able to send alerts and notifications automatically to key stakeholders within the team using RingCentral Glip. The service helps improve quality of service offered by organizations to their customers.Finally, it launched RingCentral Collaborative Meetings, a virtual meeting solution that provides integrated team messaging, online meetings, video conferencing, screen sharing, and task management. The service is available on a standalone basis as well as a part of the RingCentral Office solution.Its innovative products have helped RingCentral achieve the leading position in the 2018 IHS Markit UCaaS Leadership Scorecard released earlier this year. Last year, Synergy Research also rated RingCentral as the worldwide market share leader in both revenues and subscriber seats, significantly ahead of its competitors 8×8, Shoretel, and Vonage Business.RingCentral attributes its success to its open collaborative platform that helps organizations empower their global and distributed workforce to work anywhere, anytime, and on any device. The company believes that the rise of cloud-based solutions will lead to the demise of legacy providers like Avaya and help RingCentral grow to a $1 billion business by 2020.RingCentral has successfully leveraged the growing opportunity within SaaS.

In the third quarter, the company continued to expand margins and grow market share as demand for its mobile-centric communications software increases. With optimistic forward guidance, its share price could further appreciate in coming months.In the most recent quarter, revenues came in at $76.8 million, topping estimates for $74.6 million. Furthermore, the company reported a net loss of $6.3 million, also exceeding estimates that called for as much as a $25 million loss.RingCentral experienced total organic revenue growth of 35% annually, with its Office business, optimized towards small businesses, growing 48% to over $220 million in annual revenue, according to management.The company specializes in mobile-centric software that intends to replace the way businesses communicate. It utilizes cloud-based technologies, and is currently the leading cloud communications platform on the market today.Its software is unique in the sense that it attempts to integrate core-communication like voice, text, and audio into its platform so businesses can operate remotely and stay equally as connected as they would be operating in the same place at once. In essence, it is trying to solve the challenges that modern companies face, and by looking at the earnings results, it is catching on.RingCentral now has users in over 140 countries, with local calling numbers available in as many as 70 countries. Additionally, large enterprises have chosen the company to handle all of their global needs.For example, in its most recent earnings call, management stated that Medallia, a leading provider of customer experience management solutions, is using RingCentral in its Palo Alto, New York, Buenos Aires, London, Paris, and Hong Kong offices. The platform has proven effective on a global scale, and testimonial will only further expansion.Similarly, RingCentral has great relationships with service providers AT&T (NYSE:T), BT (NYSE:BT), and TELUS (NYSE:TU). RingCentral is the only business communications company with major carriers reselling its platform.Since late 2013, revenues have nearly doubled. This is accompanied by operating margins that expanded by 1,200 basis points on a trailing twelve month measure over that time. These results signal two things. First, demand for the product is evident, and with management's innovative thinking, RingCentral has the ability to continue to capture market share.Additionally, the company is scaling nicely, as margins are improving alongside higher growth. Management claims that the company will soon operate at a profit on a consistent basis, which will only further benefit shareholders.RingCentral is obviously only in its infancy, but it operates in a market that is sure to grow in coming years. The ways businesses operate and communicate in 2015 are much different than at the turn of the century, and communication is still ever-evolving. RingCentral has managed to become the market leader in cloud-based business communication, and with further innovation, it looks to remain in its current status.The company's share price is up close to 100% over the last year, but improvements have been fueled by growing operations. There looks to be a lot of value left in this company, meaning it could double again in the next year if management keeps up its efficiency. RingCentral trades at a market cap just over $1 billion, and presents an attractive buying opportunity currently, offering a lot of growth as cloud-based communication is further adopted by global businesses."

This represents an extremely small premium to what shares had previously been trading but closer to 20% premium to the share price since rumors began to be reported that management was working with investment banks on a sale. Similar rumors have been swirling about Ring Central (RNG) but it seems likely that these rumors may very well be diminishing given that Broadsoft sold for materially less than what Dmitry Netis of William Blair & Company indicated a discounted cash flow model would indicate was fair (see page 10).Perhaps another buyer will emerge and top Cisco's (CSCO) offer but if not it would seem that market expectations for the sector have gotten ahead of reality. For reasons explained in the next few paragraphs it seems reasonable to take a short position in Ring Central in the hope that the share price will decline in the event of a market correction or recognition of diminished potential for a merger. If a merger does indeed happen some losses would likely be incurred but it seems like a solid risk/reward trade as it is unlikely a buyer would pay a premium.So why is the Cisco acquisition bad news for Ring Central and what is the downside?It is one less potential buyer for Ring Central. The most likely buyer as indicated in the press, would be private equity or a large company such as Alphabet but unless that comes to fruition it would seem that Ring Central's valuation should contract from the current $3 billion to under $2 billion or roughly a 33% decline based on the fact that the company could not (or maybe would not due to controlling shareholders) do a deal at current valuations as well as the fact that its future cash flows are almost certainly lower than Broadsoft's.Unlike most of its public competitors, Ring Central has a dual class stock structure that makes an acquisition impossible without the consent of the CEO and CTO. It seems difficult to believe they would be happy as part of a larger company but perhaps they would be o.k. or even prefer private equity. There is, however, no doubt that it reduces the likelihood of a buyout and a discount of some sort is appropriate.Obviously one never knows for sure. Private equity funds certainly have a lot of cash to put to work but it seems difficult to imagine the price being above $40 a share unless the market moves into a full-on bubble mode.It seems likely that Broadsoft is worth more than Ring Central for the following reasons:The first argument put forward by anyone who believes Ring Central is more valuable has to be based on sales. No doubt Ring Central's $120 million in sales last quarter exceeded Broadsoft's $90 million but Broadsoft is gaining more traction in the marketplace because Broadsoft is primarily a technology wholesaler partnering with telcos while Ring Central is primarily a retailer selling directly to business customers.A buyer of Ring Central's very fine products still has to contract with a telecommunication firm in order to purchase a network connection. If a problem arises with the network connection, Ring Central logs the problem but cannot solve it. A buyer from a telecommunications firm using Broadsoft's products on the other hand, knows who to call and has a single neck to choke over the problem.In my view, Ring Central and other over-the-top (OTT) providers are extremely vulnerable to:Further, most of Ring Central's sales are to small businesses who, quite frankly are not ""sticky"" and could easily switch to a local telco much as many of Vonage's residential customers went back to a telecom provider once prices came down (assuming they didn't cut the cord). Finally, most Ring Central customers have to continue dealing with the telco that has a Broadsoft product for sale in order to have the high speed internet connection.This is not to say that Ring Central's large enterprise customers are not ""sticky,"" they are, but as said above, the vast majority of Ring Central's revenues come from small and medium size businesses who will switch back to a single provider the moment costs become comparable as service levels will improve and costs will be comparable to what they have with Ring Central.The above chart is from a presentation by Ring Central. They obviously recognize the need to move up-market and there is no doubt they are making progress but progress is difficult with enterprise bookings only constituting around 5% of all bookings.Finally, I am going to express disappointment in how Ring Central discloses stickiness in dollar terms rather than client terms. In general Ring Central's disclosures are exemplary and I have no criticism but this single metric is misleading and should be changed.A dollar based metric that includes upsells is misleading because most customers try the product on a small portion of their lines and expand. It is an unfortunate truth that many software providers have moved to dollar based metrics but the best, such as Service Now (NYSE:NOW) present metrics that exclude the impact of upsells and are actually useful.So most revenues come from small customers and less than half of new customers are medium size companies. Broadsoft/Cisco is going to make it very hard for RNG to meet their hopes of growing into the Enterprise market and as mentioned earlier, those small customers are not going to be sticky on a long term basis.My honest bias is that sales as a valuation measure is dubious at best. Still, if a business model is the same it can be used to benchmark companies. As said above, Broadsoft and Ring Central do not have the same model and therefore benchmarking based on sales is completely inappropriate.Broadsoft is primarily a technology wholesaler. Ring Central is primarily a retailer (similar to Vonage) who also have some wholesale and enterprise customers.The fact is that retail vendors are going to generate higher sales than a wholesaler of technology. Normally, it would be typical to expect that the difference would be reflected in gross margins but that is not the case with a technology company. Instead the difference in operating margins is driven by marketing expenses. Broadsoft has significantly lower sales and marketing costs and a review of the two companies shows that operating margins, excluding R&D, are much higher.Note that both companies do have similar R&D expenditures. When these are included RNG swings to a loss position while BSFT swings between small losses and profitability depending on the quarter. Regardless of whether R&D is included, Broadsoft is much more profitable.So Broadsoft has shown that they can make money and grow sales. Ring Central has only shown that they can grow sales. The arguments one has to make in order to justify RNG trading at a higher valuation is that some day (1) profits from existing customers will outweigh the marketing burden or (2) they will cut marketing and sales will at least maintain existing levels.Ring Central has looked good over the last three quarters with regard to return on marketing efforts. No doubt about it.Unfortunately, I hate to say it but their progress reminds me a lot of Vonage who once they cut marketing expenses and reached profitability sales plateaued.Ring Central will likely do better than Vonage, and they had certainly better hope they do as they carry a much higher valuation but their go-to-market method is eerily similar to what Vonage was in the 2008-2010 time frame.This article does not claim to know with certainty whether Ring Central will eventually become, as Vonage has, a nice business with reasonable profitability or instead a monster with giant profitability but the odds are not in their favor as the telecoms are not going to stand by and let RNG and other over-the-top providers grow indefinitely. Further, risk of complete disruption comes from Microsoft Skype and other software powerhouses.From a risk/reward perspective Ring Central is a short."
3426886,54942,2015-08-12T07:45:42-04:00,"The business model is a highly scalable SaaS cloud-based communication system that is not being valued as such but we think eventually will, driving the shares higher.The market opportunity is so large that we think there can be several dozen 'winners' in the space all achieving significant share.The company is likely to expand rapidly overseas with new carrier partnerships similar to the TELUS and British Telecom deals recently announced.","RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) is attempting to disrupt the legacy communication systems of small-and-medium sized businesses and replacing them with state-of-the-art SaaS, enterprise-grade solutions. The company is able to offer these high-grade communications systems typically found in large-scale enterprises at a subscription price of $25-$45 per user per month. We think they are likely to be one of several big winners in the move to SaaS communication platforms with a mobile-first approach.We think the company can eventually take a piece of the very large addressable market through the offering of a more cost effective solution that actually offers more functionality compared to the legacy systems in place at most of these small businesses. They only serve the business community, with no consumer presence. The business model is highly scalable with strong recurring revenue streams but the shares are not being valued as such. We think the shares are being valued as a telecom company instead of a SaaS model, a re-rating of which would significantly boost the shares.Large Addressable Market But With CompetitionThe market for these types of communications systems is extremely large with approximately $50-$75 billion in opportunity. Just about every business today has a phone and fax, and some sort of communication system. RingCentral aims to displace those systems as most of these small and medium-sized businesses they attempt to sign on cannot afford a PBX system that can run up to $100,000. Even the smaller businesses (less than 10 employees) are paying significant costs in excess of the value that RingCentral offers to the local telecom for 'business' communications services.The RingCentral system costs nothing up-front and users are charged a monthly subscription fee. Many investors have shunned these types of companies as they believe that they will not be the market leader. While that may be true, we think the market opportunity and highly scalable business model will allow many competitors to operate successfully in the space.The chart below shows the very low penetration rate that cloud-based systems currently control. The most acute opportunity resides within the US and 'unconnected employees' who reside in businesses that are too small and believe that they cannot afford a complex business communication system.(Source: Investor Presentation)The business model is the typical SaaS architecture with the same recurring revenue predictability seen in most SaaS models. They do expose themselves to some phone device risks by buying and 'reselling' phone devices (desk phones and conference room devices) to customers but these 'risks' are minimal and account for less than 10% of revenue.The other negative of their model is that they have no long-term contracts with customers paying month to month. However, this is in the process of being altered with the new Office product, which is accounting for more of their new bookings, which are contracts locked for several years. Still, despite half of the customers not being locked-in, they do achieve a 99% monthly retention rate and 88% annual retention rate. For the market they serve (small and medium-sized businesses), this is a remarkable achievement.RingCentral Office Product Should Drive GrowthThe Office line is their flagship product launched in 2009 with a design for multi-seat enterprises. It uses a mobile-first framework which we think gives them a competitive advantage compared to other cloud-based systems which didn't make that their primary consideration. Many are now scrambling to catch-up to firms like RingCentral who have the BYOD (bring your own phone) infrastructure in place.RingCentral has formed partnerships with a few of the major carriers including AT&T (NYSE:T), British Telecom (NYSE:BT), and TELUS. These carriers can resell RingCentral's services, which changes the dynamic of the relationship with the carriers going from being competitors to partners. Their products are co-branded with all these carriers and one can walk into an AT&T store and the carrier will sell businesses of all sizes of the cloud offering.The TELUS deal was signed in the fourth quarter of last year and was launched in six of the seven provinces in Canada earlier this year. The BT deal was launched in the first quarter expanding their reach into the UK. They are now the only cloud communications provider today with multiple carriers selling their platform. Simply signing one deal allows them potentially significant upside potential even with only limited penetration levels. Having three of these relationships will allow them to assume even lower penetration rates and create substantial revenue contribution.(Source: Investor Presentation)Upside Drivers Not Being AppreciatedWe think the new contact center market is creating an even larger market opportunity for the firm and another revenue stream with strong margins. The product was launched at the end of April and is offered in tandem with inContact (NASDAQ:SAAS), a cloud contact center provider. While likely a lower-margin business line given the partnership agreement, we think it will drive incremental earnings with relatively little additional operating expenses outside the cost of the relationship.The company is also likely to expand rapidly internationally with only a small presence outside of the US and Canada. The company had a foothold in the UK since late 2013 but it hasn't produced much in revenue generation. We think that is likely to change with their new British Telecom relationship mentioned above. A successful relationship with BT would likely lead to further partnerships in other geographies around the globe. The beauty of the model is that it is easily replicated and can be setup with minimal capex spend to enter new geographic markets.We think the company continues to be ignored as a SaaS business model and is being analyzed more as a technology telecom services business. However, the margins and scale-factor are already there with gross margins in excess of 65% last year and likely to grow several hundred bps per year over the next several years. Subscription gross margins are 1000 bps higher (recall they have a phone segment). In fact, the company has provided long-term operating model targets that call for subscription gross margins between 75% and 80% with consolidated gross margins between 70% and 75%. Sales and marketing are currently constituting 43% to 46% of revenue, but they believe that will fall over time to just 25%.ValuationOur valuation is predicated on the shares being re-rated towards other vertical SaaS company multiples. The company trades at just 3.8x EV/Revenue and compared to the group average of 6.8x for like-vertical SaaS companies, they are growing faster and have superior operating margins. We believe this is the market not correctly valuing the business as a SaaS model and instead valuing it like ShoreTel (NASDAQ:SHOR) and other hosted solutions companies.While the below chart is a bit dated now, you can see the valuation spread between fast growing and slow growing SaaS companies. With RingCentral growing the top line at mid-20% rates for the next five years, the valuation, at least according to this chart, should be around 5.0x.(Source: Inside Intercom)A more up-to-date chart shows overall valuations of SaaS companies, which has seen compression in the multiples over the last year. But the median EV/NTM Revenue has stabilized over the last several quarters around 6.0x. We think RingCentral should see a multiple, given their growth rate and massive addressable market opportunity, around 5.0x-6.0x, conservatively speaking.(Source: Redpoint)With the company likely to earn $363 million in 2016 and applying a 5.0x multiple to that revenue, we think the shares are worth around $33.75. For sensitivity analysis, using a 4.0x generates a value around $27 while a 3.0x returns a $20.80 value, still 5% above the current trading price. That 3.0x is half the average SaaS valuation, which we do not think is warranted given the growth and margin prospects.The DCF model below isn't quite as bullish but still does show substantial upside available using reasonable assumptions for growth (which are not far off from the Street consensus values).Our blended valuation then returns a roughly $30 intrinsic value for the shares, for nearly 50% upside from the current price.ConclusionRingCentral is a sleeper SaaS company that we think will eventually be valued as such as the company starts to generate positive EBITDA and operating income. The current growth trajectory suggests that will come in the first or second quarter of next year, which we think could be the catalyst and the confirmation of the 'success story' of the SaaS business model. We believe that the shares will be worth substantially more by that time and that the launch of Contact Center and the new relationships with British Telecom and TELUS are likely to drive results."
1723172,25120,2013-10-01T12:10:06-04:00,,"RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) made its public debut on Friday, September 27. Shares of the provider of SaaS solutions for business communications ended their first day with gains of 40.0% at $18.20 per share.Even after these great returns, I am cautiously optimistic on the back of high gross margins, solid revenue growth and a relative modest sales multiple valuation.Dependent upon the outcome of additional research, especially regarding the competitive position of RingCentral's products, I might initiate a position in the stock.The Public OfferingRingCentral is a software-as-a-service provider for business communications offering an innovative, cloud-based approach for business communication; providing flexible and cost-efficient services for distributed workforces and mobile workers.Through RingCentral Office, the flagship service of the company, the company offers multi-user communication solutions through voice, text and fax through all common devices such as smart phones, tablets and PCs.Traditional communication networks involve quite some upfront investments and are expensive to maintain, as they focus on employees which work on one spot. These new technologies are based on cheaper hardware, more online connectivity and making networks more agile and cost-effective.RingCentral sold 7.5 million shares for $13 apiece, thereby raising $97 million in gross proceeds. Nearly all shares were offered by the company, as selling shareholders offered some 80,000 shares in the offering, hardly 1% of the offer size.Bankers and the firm set an initial price range of $11 to $13 per share. Shares were eventually sold at the high end of this range.Some 12% of the total shares were offered in the public offering. At Monday's closing price of $18.02, the firm is valued at $1.09 billion.The major banks that brought the company public were Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), J.P. Morgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America/Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), Allen & Company and Raymond James.ValuationRingCentral solutions are developed with a mobile-centric approach and can be configured, managed and used from smartphones or tablets. The lack of significant upfront investments in hardware, or large maintenance costs, make the appeal of RingCentral's solutions high to businesses.The high quality and reliability allow for easy scaling and can often be provided through existing broadband connections. RingCentral estimates that the North American market is large, seeing a $15 billion replacement market for business communications.RingCentral sells through the website, sales representatives and a network of over 1,000 agents and resellers. At the moment, the company has a customer base of over 300,000 businesses across all industries. While the company has focused on small and medium sized businesses, it sees potential for large companies as well.For the year of 2012, RingCentral generated annual revenues of $114.5 million, up 45.2% on the year before. Net losses increased from $13.9 million to $33.8 million in the meantime.For the first six months of 2013, RingCentral generated revenues of $73.2 million up 41.3% on the year before. Losses rose from $18.7 million to $23.9 million.The company operates with $19.3 million in cash and equivalents and $21.0 million in total debt. Adding gross proceeds of $97 million from the offering, and RingCentral should operate with a net cash position of around $85 million.This values operating assets of the firm at $1.00 billion. As such, operating assets of the firm are valued around 8.7 times last year's revenues.Investment ThesisAs noted above, the offering of RingCentral has been a huge success. The company priced the offering at $13 per share, some 8.3% above the midpoint of the preliminary offering range.Add to that opening day returns of 40.0%, and shares are trading with gains of 51.7% above the midpoint of the preliminary offering range.While you might be under the impression that RingCentral has only been founded recently, as revenues more than doubled from $50 million in 2010 to $114 million last year, the firm has actually been founded back in 1999 already. Its flagship product RingCentral Office, launched in 2009, has been the major driver behind recent revenue growth.The company is the latest public offering focusing on companies which are outsourcing technology infrastructure to the cloud. Prominent investors in the firm are key executives but also Sequoia Capital and even Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).Obviously there are some key risks as well, which includes the increasing pace at which the company is reporting losses. Other risks include the reliance on network service providers, notably Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT) and Bandwidth.com. The industry is very competitive, with low upfront investment create lower cost of switching to competitors.Traditional competitors include the likes of Alcatel-Lucent and Cisco, but also communication firms like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). It it not unthinkable that large internet companies might make an entry in the market as well.On a positive note, gross margins improved by some 43 basis points to 61.2% of total revenues in the first half of this year, compared to the full year of 2012. Other good news is that the current revenue rate is close to $150 million per annum, while the company achieves impressive 99% retention rates.Revenue growth is solid as well, coming in at 43.2% in the first quarter compared to a year earlier. Second quarter growth of 39.6% was solid as well. Operating expenses kept increasing to almost 92% of total revenues in the first half of the year.The company has all the right characteristics to create long term value. Revenue growth and gross margins are solid, so are retention rates, a strong shareholder base end experienced management. While I understand that investments are needed to drive growth, I would be a little more comforted if operating expenses would come down on a relative basis.I remain cautiously optimistic, even after a successful offering as the current sales pace values the business at little below 7 times annual revenues, combined with solid gross margins.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in RNG over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
4200627,104608,2018-08-20T15:03:00-04:00,"RingCentral remains the clear leader in the unified communications as a service, or UCaaS, market and has performed exceptionally over the past year.Competition from 8x8 and Vonage continues to pick up with each company reporting solid Q2 numbers.Current valuation appears to fully price in ~25% revenue growth through fiscal 2019 and investors should be more cautious building a position in this name.","RingCentral (RNG) remains the leader in the UCaaS market and has earned a premium valuation over the past year. However, with the stock at an all-time high after another strong quarterly report, valuation appears to be a bit stretched. Though the UCaaS market overall continues to grow at impressive rates, RNG appears to be relatively overvalued and the stock may remain flat over the coming months.RNG reported subscription revenue growing 32% in Q2, accelerating from 29% last year and excluding AT&T (T), subscription revenue was up 37%. The stock has been an absolute winner over the past year, much like the other names competing in the UCaaS market, namely 8x8 (EGHT) and Vonage (VG). After the Q2 earnings, all three of these companies reported very strong revenue growth and their share prices reflected investor's positive attitude.RNG data by YChartsThough RNG continues to grow at a faster rate than their direct competitors, the forward revenue multiple has exceeded 10x. Not many companies these days constantly trade at a 10x or greater forward revenue multiple, and I do not believe RNG should trade at this level.RNG is one of the leaders in the UCaaS market, or Unified Communications as a Service. This segment of the market focuses on the transformation of enterprise communication as it evolves from traditional land lines to newer forms of communication. RNG utilizes their cloud-based approach in order to provide flexible and cost-effective services to support an ever changing workforce. Employees are becoming more mobile and RNG is capturing the ""bring-your-own device"" market shares.Source: Company PresentationEnterprises have rapidly moved away from traditional land lines and moved towards newer forms of communication, including online meetings, team collaboration, telephony and video conferencing. RNG assists with delivering the newer forms of communication and their cloud-based offerings enable them to deliver more transparent revenue streams.Source: Company PresentationThe new forms of communication are here to stay. Yes, voice communication is still the dominant form of enterprise communication, but there are an increasing number of communication forms. For example, RNG held a study of 2,000 customers and 44% said voice was their main method of communication. However, both team messaging and text followed closely behind. This demonstrates the changing landscape and need for enterprises to develop modern communication platforms.Q2 was another very strong quarter for RNG, delivering revenue growth of 32%, and 37% excluding AT&T. This is very impressive considering RNG is the largest player in the UCaaS market ($146 million in Q2 revenue). This compares to EGHT ($78 million in Q2) and VG ($76 million in Q2).Source: Company PresentationGross margin remained relatively flat at 77%, though this remains impressive. Gross margins are likely to remain in the high-70's range even as the company's growth eventually decelerates. This is because of their cloud-based and subscription revenue streams. This type of revenue has significantly lower costs compared to their hardware counterparts.Source: Company PresentationManagement also raised their full year guidance by $10.0 million at the midpoint, resulting in a 29-30% revenue growth range. Subscription revenue was raised by $6.5 million at the midpoint, now representing growth of 28-29%, slightly below the 32% growth seen in Q2. Core subscription revenue, which excludes AT&T, is now guided to 34-35%, up from 32-34%. This shows that the AT&T revenue stream is still a drag on the company, however, revenue growth remains very healthy.The strong Q2 results reinforced RNG premium valuation, however, I believe this valuation is a bit stretched and investors may take a break from this name. The 30%+ revenue growth, though guided to be under 30% for the full year, remains impressive and forward revenue multiple is has been floating around that of Twilio (TWLO). TWLO grew nearly 55% this past quarter with a similar revenue base of RNG. Post-TWLO earnings, TWLO's multiple reached nearly 15x, a premium to RNH, however, I still believe RNG's multiple may be a bit much.Currently, RNG trades at nearly 12x TTM revenues, a significant premium to competitors in the UCaaS and CPaaS industry. RNG's revenue growth is above a majority of these competitors and they do have a significant market share, however, their expensive premium may not be warranted.RNG EV to Revenues (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsWhen looking at a forward revenue compared to their closest competitors, EGHT and VG, RNG trades at a 5-7 turn premium. This is a significant premium considering RNG's top line growth in Q2 (32%) easily beat EGHT (20%) and VG (~15%) when it came to direct UCaaS revenue (VG competes in the UCaaS and UPaaS markets).RNG EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsGoogle finance reported RNG's market cap on Friday at $6.78 billion. With a net cash balance of $210 million, RNG had an enterprise value of $6.57 billion as of Friday's closing price of $89.30.Management guided subscription revenue to $595-600 million for F18, representing a growth rate of 28-30%. Let's assume for F19, the growth slightly decelerates to 25%, implying subscription revenue of $744-750 million. Total revenue is guided to $649-656 million, representing a growth rate of 29-30%. Again, let's assume this growth rate decelerates to 25%, which would imply total revenue of $811-820 million.Using management's subscription and total revenue guidance and my implied F19 25% growth rate, RNG trades at a F19 revenue multiple of 8.8x at the midpoint (subscription revenue only) and 8.1x (total revenue). I believe an ~8x F19 revenue multiple is warranted because of RNG's above industry-average revenue growth and significantly larger market share. It would be challenging to build a position if RNG continues to trade at this high of a current revenue multiple and investors may need to wait a few quarters for revenue to catch up to this valuation. However, at ~90, RNG holds a premium valuation and looks to be fully priced in. I would look to hold onto any positions in RNG for the time being and possibly buy on any large pullbacks. It is challenging to make a complete argument to begin building a position in this name at this time.Risks to RNG include increased competition from both EGHT and VG. As the competitors continue to grow in size, they will begin to compete for a similar customer cohort which may cause RNG's revenue growth to decelerate quicker than anticipated. In addition, being a highly valued named based on forward revenues, this name is subject to large corrections in the market. We have seen the tech market as a whole self-correct over time as revenue multiple continue to reach new levels."

RNG has been selling primarily to small to medium-sized business. The growth plan includes sales and marketing to larger, enterprise-wide customers.ValuationAccumulated deficit of -$107.ConclusionBuy RNG on the IPO.To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above.BusinessRNG is a leading provider of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, solutions for business communications.RNG's solutions have been developed with a mobile-centric approach and can be configured, managed and used from a smartphone or tablet.RNG primarily generates revenues by selling subscriptions for its cloud-based services.RNG enables convenient and effective communications for customers, across all their locations, all employees, all the time, thus enabling a more productive and dynamic workforce.RingCentral Office, the flagship service, is a multi-user, enterprise-grade communications solution that enables customers and their employees to communicate via voice, text and fax, on multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets, PCs and desk phones.Riding the ""bring you own"" waveRNG believes that its innovative, cloud-based approach disrupts the large market for business communications solutions by providing flexible and cost-effective services that support distributed workforces, mobile employees and the proliferation of ""bring-your-own"" communications devices.Traditionally, businesses have used on-premise hardware-based communications systems, commonly referred to as private branch exchanges, or PBXs.According to Gartner's April 2013 report entitled ""Bring Your Own Device: The Facts and the Future,"" by 2017, half of employers will require their employees to supply their own devices for work purposes.RNG believes that this trend will create additional challenges for businesses using legacy communications solutions.Legacy systems generally require specialized and expensive hardware that must be deployed at every business location and are primarily designed for employees working only at that location and using only their desk phones.In addition, these systems generally require significant upfront investment and ongoing maintenance and support costs.Subscription plansRNG's subscription plans have historically had monthly or annual contractual terms and over 95% of current customers are on monthly contractual terms, although RNG also has subscription plans with multi-year contractual terms, generally with larger customers.MarketThe market for business communications solutions is large. According to Infonetics Research, from 2008 through 2012, there were 61 million PBX lines sold in North America.Assuming RNG's current base selling price of $20 per user per month, RNG believes that the potential replacement market is $15 billion in North America.RNG also believes that this estimate significantly understates the potential market opportunity for its cloud-based solutions because a significant number of businesses today have not historically deployed a business communications system due to functionality limitations, cost and other factors.Customer baseRNG has a diverse and growing customer base comprised of over 300,000 businesses across a wide range of industries, including advertising, consulting, finance, healthcare, legal, real estate, retail and technology. To date, RNG has focused its principal efforts on the market for small and medium-sized businesses, defined by IDC as less than 1,000 employees, in the U.S. and Canada.RNG is making investments in an effort to address larger customersIntellectual PropertyRNG's intellectual property portfolio includes 18 issued U.S. patents, which expire between 2026 and 2032.

1709912,21136,2013-09-24T08:16:54-04:00,,"RingCentral, Inc (NYSE:RNG), a San Mateo, California-based SaaS cloud telephonics firm, plans to raise $90 million through its upcoming IPO. RNG will offer 7.5 million shares at an expected price range of $11.00-$13.00. If the stock can find the midpoint of that range at $12.00 per share, RingCentral will command a market value of $808 million. RNG is expected to go public on September 27.RNG filed confidentially on June 24, 2013.Joint Managers: Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Merrill LynchCo-Managers: Raymond James & Associates, Allen & CoSUMMARYFounded in 1999, RingCentral aims to make waves in business communications, which are rapidly trending away from traditional private branch exchanges (PBXs) to handle the bulk of communications among employees. PBXs typically require costly, customized hardware and only permit employees to work through their desk phones, whereas RingCentral's flagship software-as-a-service, RingCentral Office, allows employees to use voice, fax, and text communications from devices including smartphones, desk phones, laptop and desktop computers, and tablets. RingCentral Office is impressively designed to be mobile-centric and can be managed and configured from mobile devices.RingCentral has a significant customer base across the United States and Canada, including some 300,000 customers. RNG has focused on North American small- and medium-sized businesses (those with less than 1000 employees), but has stated interest in expanding into international markets.VALUATIONRNG offers the following figures in its S-1 balance sheet for the six months ending June 30, 2013:Revenue: $73,229,000Net Loss: ($23,881,000)Total Assets: $48,500,000Total Liabilities: $69,225,000Stockholders' Equity: $(20,725,000)RNG has posted impressive total revenues of $50.2 million, $78.9 million and $114.5 million in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, which translates to year-over-year increases of 57% and 45%. It also has posted consistently increasing gross margins over the same period.CONCLUSIONThough RingCentral is not currently profitable, we see a lot of upside in this firm's stock. RNG's highly experienced management team has the technical and business chops to negotiate the booming market for software to operate across multiple devices in the coming ""Bring Your Own Device"" era, as described below. Significant portions of recent losses are due to the high cost of operations in a period of massive expansion; this firm probably has a more direct path to profitability than most, though we'd like to see RNG turn that particular corner sooner rather than later.The firm's unique niche in business communications and swiftly expanding revenues and gross margins are also very encouraging and make it an attractive takeover candidate for a larger technology firm like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).We would be a buyer of this IPO in the $11 to $13 range and would not be surprised to see the range increased as we approach September 27th and as the company finishes its road show presentations to institutional investors.We are very pleased to see that Doug Leone from Sequoia Capital has been on the board of directors since 2006 and that Sequoia is currently a significant owner. It is also important to us that the high quality boutique firm of Allen and Co. is involved in this quality underwriting.BUSINESSRingCentral's future looks bright in a business world that increasingly operates on a ""Bring Your Own Device"" basis. Small businesses in particular now often require employees to provide their own devices for work purposes, and RingCentral's malleable, mobile-oriented technology simplifies integration of communications between various devices tremendously. At a per-user price tag of $20/month, RingCentral is also a highly cost-effective option for small businesses.RingCentral's cloud communications products are, of course, highly dependent upon the functionality of the internet. In areas that suffer frequent internet failures, the firm's software is unlikely to become popular. Moreover, the recent scandals surrounding government intrusion into internet communications may lead to some downward pressure on share prices of firms that primarily trade in internet communications.Cloud communications is hardly a wide-open field, and RingCentral faces several competitors that have stronger resources and are significantly better capitalized. The most prominent of these are Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) , AT&T (NYSE:T), j2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ).ManagementCEO and Chairman Vladimir Shmunis has both a lengthy, steady tenure with RingCentral and an impressive resume in the fields of software development and executive management. Mr. Shmunis is a co-founder of RNG and has served the firm in his current positions since its inception in 1999. He had previously founded Ring Zero Systems, Inc., and served as its President and CEO between 1992 and 1998; the firm was eventually acquired by Motorola, Inc. (NYSE:MSI). Mr. Shmunis holds a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science from San Francisco State University and has worked in software development for numerous Silicon Valley firms. RNG could scarcely ask for a more qualified chief. The recent addition of CFO Clyde R. Hosein only adds to RNG's executive firepower. Mr. Hosein has previously served as CFO for Marvell Technology Group (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Integrated Device Technologies (NASDAQ:IDTI).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The expected listing date is September 27, 2013 on New York Stock Exchange. (Source: IPO prospectus)Company Overview:The company is a leading provider of software-as-a-service, or SaaS, solutions for business communications. Its flagship service is a multi-user, enterprise-grade, communications solution that enables its customers and their employees to communicate via voice, text and fax, on multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets, PCs and desk phones. Its communications solutions provide flexible and cost-effective services that support distributed workforces and mobile employees. It markets and sells its services directly, through both its website and inside sales teams, as well as indirectly through a network of over 1,000 sales agents and resellers, including AT&T (NYSE:T), which the company refers to collectively as resellers.Industry Overview: (Business Communication Solutions industry)Traditionally, businesses have used on-premise hardware-based communications systems, commonly referred to as private branch exchanges, or PBXs. These systems are primarily designed for employees working within the premise where the system is installed.The Market for Business Communications Solutions is Large According to Infonetics Research, from 2008 through 2012, there were 61 million PBX lines sold in North America. Assuming the company's current base selling price of approximately $20 per user per month, the potential replacement market is approximately $15 billion in North America.In recent years, there have been significant changes in how people work and communicate with customers, co-workers and other third parties. With the proliferation of smartphones and tablets that offer much of the functionality of PCs, businesses are increasingly working around the clock across geographically dispersed locations, and their employees are using a broad array of communications devices and utilizing text, along with voice and fax, for business communications. Today, businesses require flexible, location- and device-agnostic communications solutions that provide users with a single identity across multiple locations and devices. These changes have created new challenges for business communications. Traditional on-premise systems are generally not designed for such challenges.Most of these challenges can be meet by the cloud based business communication solutions that allow users to communicate through multiple mediums (text, voice, fax, etc) across multiple locations and devices. The chart below shows some benefits of cloud based solutions as compare to traditional systems.Customer Base:The company has a diverse and growing customer base comprised of over 300,000 businesses across a wide range of industries, including advertising, consulting, finance, healthcare, legal, real estate, retail and technology. To date, it focused its principal efforts on the market for small and medium-sized businesses in the U.S. and Canada.Growth Strategy:To grow its business the company intends to:Financials: (healthy growth in revenues)The company primarily generates revenues by selling subscriptions for its cloud-based services.The company experienced significant growth in recent times, with total revenues of $50.2 million, $78.9 million and $114.5 million in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, generating year-over-year increases of 57% and 45%, respectively. It incurred net losses of $7.3 million, $13.9 million and $35.4 million, in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.For the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2013, its total revenues were $51.8 million and $73.2 million, respectively, and its net losses were $18.7 million and $23.9 million, respectively.Key points:Key Positives:1. Growth in gross margins:The company had shown constant rise in the gross margins since last few years, from 55.29% in FY 2010 to 61.22% during the first six months of FY 2013 (see the chart below).2. Huge addressable market:Nearly 61 million PBX lines were sold in North America, from 2008 through 2012. Assuming the company's current base selling price of approximately $20 per user per month, the potential replacement market is approximately $15 billion in North America.3. Cloud computing based platform:The company serves its customers through the cloud based platform which allows its end-users to access and use its services anytime through the Internet from anywhere. Cloud based products are in high demand in almost all industries due to its features like:4. Mobile-Centric Approach:Its platform was developed with a mobile-centric approach and can be provisioned, configured, managed and used from a smartphone or tablet as well as from PCs and the Web. Its solutions are designed to work with a broad range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, PCs and desk phones, enabling businesses to successfully implement a ""bring-your-own"" communications device strategy.5. Effective Go-to-Market Strategy:The company employs a broad range of direct and indirect marketing channels to target potential customers, including search-engine marketing, search-engine optimization, referral, affiliate, radio and billboard advertising. It offers simple, easy-to-understand pricing plans. It also offers ongoing customer support to help retain its customers and encourage them to add more users and functionality.Key Negatives:1. Loss making entity:The company is a loss making entity and is reporting losses for the last few years.2. Rising operating expenses:The operating expenses of the company had shown constant rise during the last few years, not only in the absolute numbers but also in percentage term (as % to the revenues). This leads to increase in operating loss in absolute as well as in the percentage term (see the chart below).3. Highly competitive market:The company operates in a very competitive market and competes with players that are more establish than it. Some of its prominent competitors are: 8x8 Inc (NYSE:EGHT), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), etc.Valuation:At $12 (mid range of offer price) the company's valuations stand at $728 million. At $12, the company is available at P/S of about 5.35x (trailing twelve months).Peer Comparison: (trailing twelve months).Conclusion:The company operates in the rapidly evolving, but competitive industry. The company is in its growth phase so the operating expenses are on the higher side. The worrying thing is, the growth rate of its operating expenses that outpaced its revenue growth rate (explained above), for the last few years. This in the past led the company to increasing losses. On the positive side its gross margins has been growing constantly and company deals in the cloud computing sector, the sector which is creating a lot of enthusiasm among investor community, due to its future growth potential.Disclaimer: Investments in stock markets carry significant risk, stock prices can rise or fall without any understandable or fundamental reasons.

3838876,54942,2016-01-28T12:22:54-05:00,RingCentral's move upmarket is substantially increasing their revenue per seat and allowing them to drive the top line.The added revenue per seat is generating more cash flow that is being reinvested into their sales and marketing effort which will continue at 40% to 45% of revenue.The return on those marketing dollars spent is not accurately reflected in the share price given the lifetime profit and revenue generated.Shares continue to trade at a significant discount to the high-growth SaaS peer group due to overblown competitive fears.,"We discussed our long thesis on RingCentral (NYSE:RNG) back in early August and since then the shares are up over 20% despite a negative tape. To save the readers some time, we are still very bullish on the name. We had a $30 price target on the shares back then, but several new pieces of data have come out which not only reinforces our thesis, but augments it. The shares hit nearly $26 in mid-December before falling back along with the broader market shortly thereafter.We think the shares are a high-quality growth name that should rebound fairly sharply when the market realizes stability. The opportunity is being driven by the third quarter release which reported their first profitable quarter in company history. We think the shares are still trading at a sizeable discount to the high-growth SaaS peer group leaving meaningful upside.The Market Opportunity Continues To ImproveAs we noted previously, the company is set to benefit from the secular shift away from PBX and telco systems and towards the cloud-based unified communications market - known as UCaaS. New communications systems on premise are growing fairly rapidly as businesses replace legacy systems in order to offer their employees more productive technology (voicemail to email, fax to email, anywhere calls, etc.). But the UCaaS industry continues to grow at roughly twice that rate and we think eventually will be expanding at three or four times the legacy system growth trajectory as costs come down.The trend in this shift has accelerated in the last year or two as the technology continues to improve and the ease of deployment becomes quicker and seamless. Less than 5% of all businesses use a cloud-based communications system, offering significant growth potential. Meanwhile, the cost-benefit of such a shift is creating an almost tidal wave movement towards UCaaS.We had the chance to test this system recently as our office is undergoing the same shift in their communications systems. RingCentral Office was the most superior product of the handful we tested and offers comparable technology and options of most on-premise PBX systems but at significant cost savings to the customer. We calculate that the total cost savings on average is approximately 40%-50% for the SMB market.As workforces become increasingly more mobile, requiring seamless communications across a variety of geographies and devices, the shift towards these types of systems will grow faster. Most of the large players in the space including Polycom, ShorTel and Avaya have been slow to adopt the mobile-centric environments still focusing on desktop and laptop-based offerings. Eliminating that office hub and going virtual has been the center of RingCentral's strategy.(Source: Investor Presentation)The connectivity of offices is where we see the most opportunity. Right now, it would take as much as $500K to connect colleagues on an extensional basis (customer rings one office and the person answers and then transfers the call to another office at a separate location or even select countries). This platform is expanding to the entire globe over the next year which should help them market to large global enterprises.The iPhone app technology we found to be the most seamless and of much better quality than most of the others we tested. The app rests on the workers iPhone and allows calls to an office to ring on their personal phone. Essentially eliminating the need for workers to have two phones, a personal and a work device. The app now has video conferencing, web conferencing, and audio conferencing features making it one of the few to offer such options.Fundamentals Leading the ChargeWe think much of the discount valuation over the last year has been due to weaker fundamentals (although similar growth profiles) compared to other high-growth SaaS businesses. These include free cash flow, margins, and much higher SG&A expense (and thus higher customer acquisition costs). But we think the company is reaching an inflection point whereby these metrics are likely to catch-up to the broader industry and could allow them to close the valuation gap that exists (more below).Some of this improvement is likely due to better pricing overall. Revenue per seat over the last few years has improved by 10%+ per annum. This hasn't been driven by a broad price increase but as they have grown the number of subscribers and total businesses, they have normalized pricing for some customers who came on early. However, the largest driver has been their move upmarket to enterprises (500 or more employees) who tend to buy the more premium edition of the product. The premium or enterprise offering tends to cost approximately $10 more per person, or a 50% increase in revenue per seat.This has helped to drive gross margins on subscriptions to about 77%, up from the high-60% area a few years ago. Management has a targeted range of 75% to 80%, so they are comfortably within their objective range. However, we think as they continue to shift towards the enterprise, that gross margin target model is likely to shift higher to 80% to 85%, and possibly higher long-term.On operating margin, they broke even last quarter which was a positive surprise. But we expect them to continue to invest heavily in sales and marketing in order to drive top line growth. We expect them to spend approximately 40% to 45% of revenues to grow the number of seats, and driving revenue at a 30%+ rate. RingCentral is the largest pure player in the industry and given the large under-penetration in the space, we believe this is the right strategy. During a recent investor conference, management detailed that for every dollar they invest in sales and marketing, they generate $8 of lifetime revenue and $5 of lifetime profit. The math thus works out to 20% to 30% operating profit by year three for every customer they sign up. We think this dynamic is being completely missed by the market.Competitive Fears ExaggeratedOne of the main overhangs to the shares, we believe, is Microsoft's entry into the space with a new and improved Skype for Business Online offering. The cloud-based communication systems functionalities and clout are overblown. For one, Microsoft has again launched a product without fully-completing the build-out. For example, they have yet, according to our research, completed the regulatory hurdles of becoming a CLEC or offering E911 options. Additionally, they are not able to offer full enterprise telephony functions without a hosting partner which creates a more complex roll-out to new enterprise customers.In addition, third-party research Gartner named RingCentral to their leaders' quadrant this past September, which we think will help increase visibility to their product offering. The addition to the leaders' quadrant will drive enterprise adoption, which will likely increase revenue per seat further over the next two years.(Source: Gartner)ValuationThe shares trade at 4.4x our fiscal 2016 revenue estimate which is a significant discount to the fast-growth SaaS peer group average of nearly 7.0x. The shares trade closer to the SaaS group as a whole which is close to 4.0x. As the company shifts to a profitable business model and continues to grow the top line at 25%+ over the next three years, we think the multiple will upgrade towards 5.0x-5.5x by the end of 2017.In addition, as the company shifts towards a profitable EBITDA line, we think the shares will be more likely to be valued based on this methodology rather than EV/Sales. However, this line won't truly be indicative of their earning power given the sales and marketing investment strategy. Still, even at $45 million in EBITDA for 2017, at a 30x multiple, the shares are cheap. Below is our assessment based on the EV/Revenue at a 5.0x multiple.Lastly, the company should move to being free cash flow positive this year (or very close to it), which should provide added support to the share price. While the company has no real debt levels ($8.8 million senior lien), the added free cash flow could eventually be used for a share buyback program to offset dilution from stock option grants.ConclusionRingCentral is at an inflection point with many of their operating metrics improving significantly and the aggregate firm on the cusp of profitability. We believe their product to be superior to most of the competition in the space while being added to the leaders quadrant in the most recent Garter survey likely will juice the firm's acceptance in the marketplace. We think gross margins will be above the firm's target range as early as the second half of this year due to continued upmarket moves into the enterprise space which carries significantly higher revenue per seat. While profitability will be constrained due to increased investment in sales and marketing, the market is failing to accurately ascertain the lifetime revenue and profit from those marketing dollars spent. We think they will handily beat consensus in early February when they announce their fourth quarter results providing a catalyst to the share price."

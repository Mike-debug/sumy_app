4362443,104744,2020-07-30T14:14:11-04:00,"ROK reported a 16.3% reduction in total sales in FQ3, mostly precipitated by the capex reduction trends in its end-markets like oil & gas and automotive.The food & beverage and life sciences end-markets saved the company from a much deeper revenue plunge.Orders sharply rebounded in June and July, which means the recuperation in demand is underway.ROK's valuation is too inflated, which compounds downside risks.","Rockwell Automation, Inc. (ROK), one of the smart manufacturing industry heavyweights, has recently presented its surprisingly strong fiscal Q3 results. Both adjusted and GAAP earnings per share beat analysts’ consensus estimates by a solid margin, while revenues were in-line with the forecasts. ROK also informed investors that it would recalibrate the corporate structure in FY21 and operate with three segments: Intelligent Devices, Software & Control, and Lifecycle Services. It also presented the upbeat revenue guidance, which inspires some confidence that the worst had passed, and the industrial activity has been steadily recuperating.In the first quarter, Rockwell Automation tested choppy waters, as the pandemic restrained economic activity in its end-markets. Its total sales fell by 16.3% after ten quarters of single-digit growth (except for 3Q19). Adjusted for contributions from acquisitions (e.g., ASEM and Kalypso), organic revenues were down 17.6%; in the U.S., ROK's flagship market (59% of sales), revenues dipped 20%. Both the Control Products & Solutions and Architecture & Software segments reported a steep decline in revenues, 15.8% and 16.9%, respectively.Source: UnsplashThere is no coincidence that the principal culprit of the double-digit reduction in sales was the recession in the oil & gas industry (including LNG, pipeline & transportation, refining, petrochemicals, etc.) precipitated by the abrupt decline in oil prices and the crisis in the automotive industry; ROK includes these two end-markets into the Process and Discrete industry segments, respectively. Rockwell did not clarify how deep was the reduction in sales to the mining/aggregate/cement and chemicals end-markets (included in Process), mentioning only a double-digit decline.The explanation here is simple: for most companies within ROK’s end-markets, the debt servicing and the robustness of the balance sheets have become the principal priorities amid the growing uncertainty and supply chain disruptions. Capital investments (together with opex) were slashed, major projects were postponed in order to avoid a cash crunch (or spiraling debt) and to protect the bottom line and dividends. For instance, Eastman Chemical (EMN), an advanced materials market heavyweight, which I have covered recently, reduced its 2020 capital budget by ~$100 million. As, in many cases, investments in industrial automation are considered discretionary capex, there is no coincidence that Rockwell's top line was afflicted.At the same time, some industries were somewhat immune to the pernicious effects of the economic crisis, e.g., included in the Hybrid group. Certainly, they also suffered from the repercussions of lockdowns and supply chain disruptions, but, however, the demand for capital equipment from these end-markets was not as depressed, as, for example, from oil & gas. For instance, food & beverage declined ~10%, together with life sciences (biotechnology, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals); tire was down in the double digits.As I have already discussed multiple times in my articles, non-cyclical demand for essentials makes the food industry a perfect defensive play; moreover, in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, pharmaceuticals and healthcare-related sub-industries even benefited from the burgeoning demand for drugs and investments from governments. Importantly, food & beverage was Rockwell's principal end-market in 2019, with approximately 20% contribution to the top line. So, its diversified portfolio saved it from a much deeper revenue plunge. In other words, if ROK was focused only on the oil & gas and automotive industries, its FQ3 revenues would easily crater and fall by ~25%-30%.Sure, the FQ3 sales decline was horrible, but the silver lining is that ROK observed precisely the same tendency as did Chart Industries (GTLS): growing orders. As comes from slide 11, Rockwell’s global daily average product orders were deeply depressed in April and May, and then rose sharply in June and continued growth in July. So, though they are substantially behind the January-March levels, the rebound is clearly observable. For a broader context, GTLS (focused on cryogenic solutions for the LNG industry) noticed a strong improvement in demand for the HLNG vehicle tanks and LNG fueling stations. The corollary here is self-evident: the recuperation is underway.Encouraged by the strong rebound in orders, Rockwell updated its FY21 (due to end in September 2020) guidance (see slide 13), expecting only ~8% contraction in organic revenue vs. 9.5-6.5% anticipated in April. It also became more confident in margins and lifted the EPS target from $6.9 to $7.4 in the bearish case.Despite the headwinds, which it has to cope with, Rockwell Automation has sector-leading returns, margins, and, hence, A+ Profitability Grade.Its cash flow also deserves high praise. In FQ3, Rockwell substantially improved operating and free cash flows by means of cost-cutting and the reduction of capital expenditures. The FQ3 net CFFO reached $346 million, while organic FCF (before acquisitions) was almost $311 million. What especially surprised me is ROK's Cash Return on Total Capital. As of my calculations, its LTM CROTC stands at ~36.9%, which is an undoubtedly phenomenal result. At the same time, a more traditional ROTC is also impressive, equals ~19.5%.But what price are investors paying? Spurred by the hopes of a V-shaped economic recovery boosted by the governmental stimuli, Rockwell’s stock price climbed to an all-time high. So, in my opinion, its valuation is overstretched, as it has an F Value Grade. For instance, its Forward EV/EBITDA surpassed a multi-year high of 21.7x, which is more than 80% higher than the sector median and ~57% above the stock's 5-year average.One of the risks worth bearing in mind when discussing Rockwell is the fact that the company is leveraged, as, in end-June, its Debt/Equity ratio was above 220%. The silver lining is that thanks to sector-leading margins and competent working capital management, ROK has abundant cash flow; so, the Net debt/Net CFFO ratio stands at ~1.17x, which is healthy.The analyst community does not see unquestionable capital appreciation potential in ROK, considering that 14 analysts in the pool of 26 pundits gave the stock a Neutral rating, while 6 experts are bearish or very bearish. Sure, there are a few bullish voices, including Citigroup's analysts. In my opinion, though ROK might be a pick worth considering for long-term investors, given the prospects of smart manufacturing, the current price is too inflated and the stock is unattractive.Rockwell Automation successfully endured one of the toughest quarters in its corporate history. It demonstrated that it prioritizes shareholder profit and FCF and that it can deliver on its cost-cutting targets quickly in order to shore up margins and cash flows. Unfortunately, the stock looks overpriced, so I remain on the sidelines.In conclusion, I also would like to take a look at the sustainability of the dividend. Rockwell is a dividend contender, which means the company has been increasing the payout for ten consecutive years. In the wake of sales contraction, some investors may be concerned by the DPS sustainability. I reckon that given the robustness of cash flow (and ~2x coverage of the 9M FY20 dividend by organic FCF), ROK will likely not reduce the DPS this year. Anyway, its ~1.85% yield is not attractive for me."
4362165,105503,2020-07-30T05:44:55-04:00,"Rockwell Automation has seen a deterioration of revenues due to the coronavirus.As a counteraction, the company has implemented cost reduction measures and boosted liquidity.The company's automation products have great potential, and ROK has carried out a structural reorganization to be more aligned with customers.Challenges constituted by currency headwinds look to be easing up.Current levels of volatility provide an opportunity for buying this dividend-yielding stock.","As a firm believer of an enterprise's inner strength when confronted with external factors like supply chain disruptions and tariffs due to geopolitical tensions, I have been following Rockwell's (NYSE:ROK) cost savings plans right from the start of the pandemic.In this connection, my investment theses on BASF (OTCQX:BASFY) and Corteva (NYSE:CTVA) were aimed at exploring the inner strength as a counterbalance to external uncertainty.Rockwell, as a leading provider of industrial automation solutions used by companies in the automobile, Oil & Gas as well as healthcare sectors, has gone a step further by rapidly carrying out a reorganization of its organization structure to be more aligned with customer needs.The stock price, on the other hand, has lagged significantly behind peer ABB (NYSE:ABB) since mid-April of this year by more than 25% while trending slightly higher than the Vanguard Industrials ETF (NYSEARCA:VIS).Figure 1: Comparing Rockwell's stock price with peer ABB and Vanguard Industrials.Data by YChartsFinancial efficiency, strength in key automation areas and reorganization synergies now position the company to deliver on earnings guidance for FY-2020.Rockwell's Q3-2020 earnings have been impacted by COVID, but on the other hand, the company managed to beat consensus by $0.10.Looking at the wider perspective, the automation company has maintained its earnings beat run during the last four quarters except for Q1-2020 when there was a draw.Figure 2: EPS figuresSource: Seeking AlphaNow, the adjusted EPS of $1.27 for Q3-2020 did beat consensus, but is down 47% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019. This is in sharp contrast with the EPS for Q2-2020 which not only beat expectations but was also up 19% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2019. Therefore, this must have played into the morale of investors as they dumped the stock, resulting in a 3% downside following earnings results on July 28.Looking into the rear-view mirror, the executives had already warned that earnings for Q3-2020 would be a ""little over $1"" and that it would be the worst quarter with organic sales projected to decline by around 20%. The dire projections have been confirmed with the exception of sales which have fared better (minus 17.6% instead of minus 20% as projected). I will come back to this point later, but right now, I look into the finances.First, the primary reason for upbeat earnings in Q2-2020 was due to cost savings as a result of lower incentive compensation expenses. Also, some COVID-19 windfall gains resulting in higher sales for the Architecture & Software segment and Control Products & Solutions in the second quarter are absent in Q3-2020.For this quarter, the company has benefited from some percentages of growth from acquisitions.Figure 3: Q3-2020 segment resultsSource: Seeking AlphaHowever, there have been lower sales in the company's Solutions and Services business with the book-to-bill deteriorating to 1.05 due to projects being delayed. Interestingly, from a longer-term perspective, there have been no cancellations, and this is a good sign for the fourth quarter. Even to a lesser degree, the company continues to suffer from supply chain inefficiencies which has led to higher freight expenses.Rockwell is also exposed to the whims of the auto industry where the road to recovery is viewed as tough. Also, little improvement was seen in the process markets (optimization of control processes by industrials) which were down 25%. Oil & Gas sales were also weaker.Figure 4: COVID windfall gainsSource: Image built from Q2-2020 transcripts dataThe company ended the quarter with cash equivalents of $910 million, up from $640 million in the last quarter. Debt totaled $2.4 billion, $300 million up from the last quarter. As per the SEC filings, in April 2020, Rockwell entered into a $400 million senior unsecured 364-day term loan credit agreement. As a result, leverage was 1.8x at June 30, 2020, up from 1.3x at March 31, 2020.Next maturity for long-term debt of $2 billion is in 2025. Additionally, there is a $1.25 billion credit facility. Free cash flow was $310 million, down from the $323 million in Q3-2019. Cash flow from operations was $346 million compared to $341 million in Q2-2020 was recorded. This is sufficient liquidity for a business with a 17.6% decrease in sales and suggests further flexibility to cut down on capital expenditures for aligning with lower revenue in the short term.However, this is not enough for making a wise investment decision and more solid arguments are necessary in terms of strengths and challenges.Products constitute two-thirds of Rockwell's business with the remaining third comprising software and services. Moreover, the company has an extensive supply chain covering China, which means that it had to maintain relatively higher inventory levels of China-sourced components to cater for contingencies.Now the fact that the gross margins are on the higher side at 40% compared to peer ABB's 32% (figure 7) means superior production efficiency.Figure 5: Quarterly income statement with revenues and expenses in millions of USD.Source: Seeking AlphaExploring this further, the fact that Rockwell's employees could not have access to sites for commissioning of projects due to COVID stay-at-home orders has contributed to revenue shortfalls especially in the process markets where more hands-on interaction is required. Therefore, the company has not benefited fully from the work-from-home momentum as only the non-manufacturing workforce has been working from home.However, Rockwell has used technology in innovative ways with one example being the increasing leverage on augmented reality for testing, training and customer support.Looking forward, there should be further cost efficiencies especially those enabled by acceleration in rendering the supply chain more flexible and enhancing the level of factory automation.Interestingly, one of the ways in which a higher degree of automation can be achieved is through the use of IT tools. In this context, Rockwell has accelerated the usage of Microsoft's (MSFT) Dataflex Pro to increase the degree of automation of mundane and time-consuming business processes. By using this tool, its engineers are engaged in streamlining workflows, thereby gaining on productivity.According to Chris Wagner, analytics architect at Rockwell Automation:This transformation can now be viewed concretely through the three newly-setup operating segments with one of the corporate aims being to add software talent and accelerate profitability.Figure 6: Rockwell's new structureSource: Seeking AlphaStill, in an economic scenario which is beyond the grasp of many, it is important to identify other challenges with the most important one being currency headwinds stemming from Rockwell's global footprint.The company faced larger-than-expected headwinds due to a stronger U.S. dollar which impacted sales by 1.9% which is considerable.Figure 6: US dollar IndexSource: Investing.comNow, with the US dollar index currently in the mid-90s, far from its value of above 100 during most of the second and third quarters, there could be positives in the next quarter.Since the guidance for FY2020 excludes the impact of currency, there is possibility for some positive surprises in terms of earnings for the last quarter. This is supported by some other positives.First, there is the fact the company expects the full cost reduction measures for this year amounting to $150 million only starting to make a real difference in terms of earnings as from Q4-2020. Also, Rockwell is in the process of reducing its global real estate footprint which should reduce monthly rental charges.Second, there have been exceptional costs related to supply chain inefficiencies related to the pandemic and acquisitions charges. Absence of exceptional costs and cutting down on expenses should result in sequential improvement in the fourth quarter.In this respect, the full-year outlook of $7.40-7.60 (midpoint of $7.50) provided this month is higher than the initial value of $6.90-7.70 (midpoint of $7.30) provided back in April.I now work out a valuation aware that cost savings alone are not going to generate earnings.When compared to ABB, the trailing price-to-earnings (GAAP) and price-to-sales ratios provide a mixed picture of the valuations. However, the margins, return on total capital and employee productivity provide a clearer picture of Rockwell's much better operational efficiency.Figure 7: Comparing Rockwell and ABBSource: Seeking AlphaTherefore, compared to ABB, Rockwell should be more richly valued, but this is not the case when considering the price evolution in the last three months (figure 1). Moreover, taking into consideration that the stock price has already known better growth than the industrial average and persistence of some confinement measures, my target price would be for a moderate $230 in the medium term. This is above analysts' target of $207.I further support my target by providing some key points about Rockwell.Figure 8: Rockwell's positions of strength which are likely to be transformed into sales opportunitiesSource: Table built from transcripts dataTherefore, this is a company which can play a significant role in automation of industry processes, thereby reducing the labor component as a factor of production. There have been strategic wins spanning several industries including Life Sciences, Food & Beverage, and Oil & Gas. These wins are considered as strategic as the company was not the incumbent supplier.One of the more notable wins was for Brazil's largest exporter of instant coffee. Furthermore, there have been strong sales in the European, Middle East and African (EMEA) regions derived from PPE (medical protection equipment) manufacturers. There has also been significant demand for Rockwell's Information Solutions and Connected Services business from the EMEA region.Orders are also coming from machinery builders in Europe and life sciences companies in the U.S. Furthermore, Rockwell's IoT (Internet of Things) offering can be used to increase efficiency of pumping activities as well as help in the maintenance of pipes and wells in the Oil & Gas industry. This is important for bringing down the break-even oil price. Also, automation features reduce the need for touching surfaces and help in saving lives.Finally, dollar weakness if sustained could be highly beneficial to the company's earnings taking into consideration that there was $0.15 to $0.10 negative currency impact in the second and third quarters respectively.Rockwell can be considered as an essential business as it supports critical infrastructures required to produce goods at scale.Its advanced automation capabilities is proving essential in supporting healthcare companies like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in expanding North American manufacturing footprints through flexible, collaborative and robotized chains of production. Shareholders should be comfortable owning Rockwell's shares. The leverage should revert back to the 1.3x level in Q4-2020.It pays a healthy dividend yield of 1.8%. The current payout ratio is 54% with a cash payout ratio of 40%. For potential investors looking for an entry point, current volatility provides an opportunity to get on board with a nice margin of safety. There could be a drop to the $215 level in the aftermath of the third quarter earnings and some political tussle over the coronavirus stimulus package.This is a stock to have on the watch-list as it is on a path to convert COVID constraints into opportunities. Rockwell is a buy with a possibility of the $215 level being reached."
4341234,24361,2020-04-29T19:01:54-04:00,"Rockwell delivered a mid-single-digit beat on the top line and a strong beat on the segment operating income line, with healthy demand in discrete markets like auto and semiconductors.Management's guidance for a 20% revenue decline in the June quarter is beginning to look like where many companies will end up for the quarter.Rockwell has relatively little exposure to industries likely to see a slower, more troubled recovery, but recent outperformance in auto could temper some of that recovery upside.Investors seem to already be counting on meaningful reshoring opportunities for Rockwell.Reshoring could indeed be a tailwind for Rockwell, but robust expectations are already in the share price.","What has happened recently with Rockwell (NYSE:ROK) shares is a great reminder to make sure you take advantage of real-time price alerts for stocks on your watch list. If you moved quickly, you had the chance to buy Rockwell shares in March with a double-digit prospective annualized return - a very rare opportunity for a much-loved (if not over-loved) industrial company.In any case, Rockwell is one of the very rare U.S. industrial stocks that's almost in the black on a year-to-date basis, as sentiment has quickly recovered. Not only does it seem like investors are getting more comfortable with the idea of a 20% or so drop in the June quarter for many businesses, they're also counting on that recovery to start before the end of 2020. In the case of Rockwell specifically, not only is the company leveraged to some markets with relatively attractive recovering potential, it's also a direct play on a trend of reshoring that is increasingly working its way into base-case scenarios.With the big rally since the March panic, Rockwell shares are back to their typical premium pricing, and I think there may be more risk here from slower end-market recoveries and disappointment on the scale of future reshoring.I don't want to diminish Rockwell's stronger than expected fiscal second quarter results, but the reality is that a fair number of industrials (so far) are delivering mid-single-digit beats and better operating profits. Likewise, it's worth viewing these beats in the context of pretty significant downward revisions in sell-side estimates as the quarter went on. In other words, business conditions are better than expected, but those expectations have come down pretty significantly in the last month or two.Revenue declined slightly on an organic basis, with the Architecture and Software (or A&S) business up 4% on 8% growth in Logix and Control Products and Solutions (or CP&S) down 4% on 3% contraction in control products and 4% contraction in Solutions. Rockwell outperformed peers and rivals like ABB (ABB), Emerson (EMR), and Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY) overall, though ABB more or less matched Rockwell in CP&S and Yaskawa (OTCPK:YASKY) modestly outperformed.Gross margin declined 110bp from the year-ago period, but operating income rose 7% on good corporate cost control, and segment income rose 5%, beating expectations by 13% (or $0.31). The A&S business reported 11% profit growth (and margin expansion of 230bp), beating by over 20%, while the CP&S business declined more than 3% (margins down 70bp), beating by about 2%. Given ABB's Motion business saw a 13% profit decline on a similar 4% revenue decline, Rockwell's margin structure once again stands out positively.By geography, North America remained positive, benefiting from strong auto business that offset weaker oil/gas. Europe declined 2%, while Asia Pacific declined more than 6%.I credit Rockwell management for being one of the few companies to continue providing guidance, with management lowering full fiscal year revenue guidance by about 9% at the midpoint (organic contraction of 6.5% to 9.5%) and guiding to a 20% decline in the third quarter. That number, 20%, is coming up a lot, and it looks like that's a pretty solid expectation for many businesses and end markets as it pertains to declines from the COVID-19 outbreak.As is always the case, Rockwell's end-market commentary was interesting.Management pointed to high single-digit growth from its discrete markets, including 20% growth in autos and double-digit growth in semiconductors. The semiconductor growth isn't surprising, given the strong trends reported by companies like ASML (ASML), Atlas Copco (OTCPK:ATLKY), TSMC (TSM), and VAT Group (OTCPK:VACNY), but the auto performance is surprising, with so many companies across the board highlighting pronounced weakness in auto industry demand. In Rockwell's case, it looks like a lot of company-specific project business is driving the performance, including EV battery assembly projects in Asia.Hybrid markets were flat overall, with modest growth in food/beverage, mid-single-digit declines in life sciences, and a high single-digit decline in tires. Here, again, I think there are idiosyncratic company-specific issues at work. Most companies with exposure to food/beverage automation, including ABB and Emerson, are seeing good results, but this is always a highly variable market on a company-by-company basis. With life sciences, most companies are reporting healthy demand, and Rockwell may have been hit harder by a tougher comp (life sciences was very strong for ROK a year ago).That process markets were only down mid-single-digits is a win, particularly the mid-single-digit decline in oil and gas, though I suspect that was driven by projects that finished before the precipitous fall in oil prices. Mining/cement was down a similar amount, while chemicals were down at a high single-digit rate.Overall, Rockwell's end-market exposures look good for the eventual recovery, with autos and general industrial likely to see more V-shaped recoveries, semiconductors likely to continue recovering, and food/beverage and life sci staying relatively healthy. Oil/gas is definitely a worry, and I think this may be a multiyear downturn, but it's only about 10% of overall revenue, and Rockwell could benefit from share gains through its Sensia JV with Schlumberger (SLB). I do also wonder if Rockwell's comparative outperformance in the auto sector could create some downside risk in the recovery (a timing issue).Longer term, Rockwell is poised to be a strong beneficiary if there is a significant reshoring of businesses to the United States. The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the downside of having offshored so much capacity in areas like pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and certain consumer and industrial goods (including safety/protection equipment).Reshoring of some pharmaceutical intermediaries and other essential goods seems likely, but it also seems premature to expect a wholesale change in how manufacturing companies operate their manufacturing and supply chains. If it does happen, though, Rockwell's strong market share in U.S. factory automation (around 20%) will give the company significant potential leverage, but I expect its competitors to try to leverage their existing relationships with companies operating overseas to gain share in the U.S. at Rockwell's expense.The adjustments I've made to my model for Rockwell are broadly similar to the adjustments I've made for peer companies, though Rockwell's leverage to controls, sensors, and software versus instrumentation is a meaningful advantage, and I expect a shallower revenue trough for Rockwell. I still expect mid-single-digit long-term revenue growth, as well as modest operating margin and asset efficiency improvements driving FCF margins into the high teens.On discounted cash flow, Rockwell's prospective return is back down to the mid-single-digits, and the shares likewise don't look cheap on a margin/return EV/EBITDA basis. That's not atypical for Rockwell, but I do see some elevated risk now, given how the Street is assuming a relatively early and sharp rebound for Rockwell and near-term benefits from reshoring. While it's a stock worth buying opportunistically, I'm not going to chase it."

One thing is for certain, unless there are some unknown unknowns, we are going higher.","This Sunday, when I wrote about the possibility that the rally would meander a bit more, I thought the slow start yesterday morning confirmed my caution. Then, this morning, the market went in the other direction. As I have been writing and editing today's piece, it looks like the indexes are going back to a consolidation mode. To me, this is the best of all possible worlds, forgive the ""Panglossian"" pronouncement, but flatlining indexes for a week or so before we move on significantly to new highs going into the end of the year is exactly what we need.Exhibit A:KEMET (NYSE:KEM) Acquired by Taiwanese electronics component company Yageo Corp. plans in a $1.8 billion deal aimed at expanding its global footprint, the two companies said. Yageo will offer $27.20 per KEMET share, representing an 18% premium to Monday's closing share price. KEM makes capacitors from some of exotic materials of tantalum and ceramics. KEM provides all sorts of essential electronics for the industrial sector. The first point is, this is yet another acquisition this week.

ROK sees future sales growth of 2-5%. The upbeat outlook comes in the face of what Chief Executive Blake Moret said on the post-earnings conference call with analysts it was facing uncertainty created by global trade tensions. However, the CEO says on CNBC:""We see some uncertainty and some decelerating economy on a macro-level in deceleration in industrial production, but we are growing and taking market share.""Despite whatever the CEO says to temper the market enthusiasm, an industrial stock shooting up 12% in the best day in a decade, you have to say, industrials are esteemed by the market.Exhibit C:Boeing (NYSE:BA) continues to provide positive news on progress with the MAX even as its current orders diminish a bit. BA got its second MAX order two months in a row, even though it was only one, it still means that with more certainty, more MAXes will be ordered going forward.

This week's cover was on HON, and how it is using its ""Forge"" software to tie-in not only their industrial and aerospace equipment but also other machines, sensor, and control tools and devices made by others. My point isn't that HON is a great buy, it is. Also, my point isn't that Barron's has a great article on HON, it does. My point is that more and more, there is financial media attention and commentary on the Industrial sector.The Industrial sector getting bullish attention will power the overall indexes higher in a broad-based rally that we have not seen in a while.Defense Industrial ComplexLockheed Martin (LMT) is a buy for the long-term investorLast's week's Pentagon contract to procure 478 F-35 fighters from Lockheed Martin was a big acquisition marker for a program known widely by its promise, development delays, and costs. The contract couldn't come at a better time. The fiscal 2020 defense budget is still being negotiated, but it's widely seen as the high-water mark of recent efforts to modernize and upgrade U.S. forces. The F35 is well-publicized in being the premier weapon in the US Air Force Arsenal and also sold to many friendly nations. What is less well-publicized are the late-model fighters that are still being built and compete head-to-head with cheap equipment from Russia, China and even Pakistan. These are 4th generation planes that are not stealth planes, so in this very cost-conscious space, LMT still looks like it is landing on top. I got this item from Jane's Military Journal and I think it says something about LMT's broad menu of product. Selling this new/old fighter has got to be very profitable...Indonesia Signals F-16V Intention - The Indonesian Air Force (Tentara Nasional Indonesia - Angkatan Udara: TNI-AU) is planning to procure two squadrons of Lockheed Martin's F-16V (Viper) Block 70/72 Fighting Falcon multirole combat aircraft, TNI-AU's Chief of Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Yuyu Sutisna, has said.Kratos (NASDAQ:KTOS)KTOS reported third quarter 2019 revenues of $184.1 million, an increase of 15.5% year-over-year results. It had an adjusted EBITDA of $20.4 million, at an 11.1% margin, a 22.2% increase YoY. KTOS third quarter 2019 operating income increased 13.9%. KTOS affirmed the full Year 2019 financial guidance. Aside from the good financial results, I like this plucky little defense company they definitely punch above their weight-class.The other names I like in this space are AeroVironment (AVAV), Raytheon (RTN), L3Harris (LHX), and of course Boeing (BA). None of these names are trades in the sense that I don't know of any short-term catalyst that will bounce these names higher. I think that the big-cap names are eligible for your long-term accounts since they provide a dividend. As for KTOS and AVAV, they are in the sweet spot of the future of defense, the drone sector. KTOS is working on the ""Loyal Wingman"" project and already had a flying demo while BA had to buy a company in Australia that was working on one, except as of about 6 months ago, all they had was a mock-up on a pedestal. KTOS is a nimble little defense company that in spite of its size does win prime contractor projects. I would not be surprised if some larger defense company just gets tired of losing to these guys and makes them an offer they can't refuse. I like LHX since these two (recent combination between Harris and L3) are in a great niche of the electronics subsystems business. RTN is in the missile and radar business, the anti-missile/missiles like the Patriot, need I say more?Thank you to the reader that asked me to look at The Trade Desk (TTD)I believe the question was prompted by my renewed focus on Roku Inc. (ROKU), and that the same forces that have buoyed ROKU would work with TTD. Also, TTD had turned in a good earnings report. It surpassed the consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings as well as upped its guidance for the fourth quarter. TTD has a 95% retention rate with customers, and it has its sights on the international markets for further growth. Since a bullish behavior in tech stocks is recently hard to predict by the fundamentals alone, I thought it would be a good idea to chart out TTD to decide whether we should get long in it...Source: Tradingview.comTTD is showing a very pronounced ""Cup and Handle"" formation, and with the last few days of performance decidedly broke a two-month downtrend. It's possible that with the restriction of political advertising on Twitter and talk of restriction on other social sites that, TTD may see higher usage for political ad placement in 2020. I think TTD is a buy, and I went long on TTD today, more on that in the Trader's Corner below.Applied Material (AMAT) Upgraded by Cowen PT raised to 65 with Outperform rating and 14.9% upside.My take: The Chip sector is the strongest tech sector right now.

(AER) upgraded by both Barclays and Credit Swiss boosted price targets to $73 and $70 with 21% and 16.1% upsidesMy Take: Aircraft leasing is heating up as they have the planes that airlines need. It is either trying to lease a viable plane or buy another airline that isn't utilizing their equipment enough, like maybe JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU)? Not very scientific, but I hear from friends that JBLU planes are not full. It could mean nothing, but if you can't add equipment until March and you have already been waiting a year, for you, MAX maybe acquiring another smaller airline is not so crazy. Also, what does this upgrade mean for General Electric (GE)? GE has a very nice aircraft leasing business.Goldman Sachs Initiating Coverage on the Cybersecurity Landscape, Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) @ Buy, FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) @ Neutral, Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) @ Buy, Check Point Software @ Neutral, Verint Systems (NASDAQ:VRNT) @ Buy, Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS) @ Neutral, SecureWorks (NASDAQ:SCWX) @ Sell.My Take: The fact that Goldman is initiating coverage on so many cybersecurity names all at once is interesting. The fact that so many are initiated as a ""Neutral"" and one is even a sell buttresses my lack of enthusiasm for this space. In fact, there are many more names that could have been added to this list. There are just too many, for even a handful to rise above the fray. This causes me to look elsewhere, even CrowdStrike (CRWD) which is not on this list no longer excites me. Sometimes you just have to say that a space is just too hard. I guess if you want to play in this space, then FTNT and VRNT might be worthwhile. I just want you to really understand WHY these two names should stand out. This sector needs to consolidate by some bigger operator.I went long on TTD based on the recent trading behavior and the charts. I am not staying long, but I am expressing this optimistic position in the form of Long Calls. If TTD does treat me well, I might spread them with a fairly narrow spread. I also went back into General Electric since it broke out by closing above the 11.30 level, and I would not be surprised if GE now closes in on $12. I also rolled my ROKU Call Spread up and out, as the prices get close the strike I had on the Calls.I am intrigued by the behavior of ROK, and I think it might be a buy. My thinking is that the CEO tried his best to ""sandbag"" the forward guidance and market participants went ahead to ignore him. This is another brick in the wall regarding a buttress to the argument that we are gathering steam in a strong upward move. I would not buy ROK today, let's keep an eye on it. But it could be an interesting trade. It could also be an interesting longer speculation. I think HON is very interesting too. It is at a yearly high, and the chart is showing that it looks like it is going higher. I would say HON is not a fast money trade, but if you want a stock that you could ride into year-end with that is esteemed widely HON is a buy."
4337121,103547,2020-04-12T14:23:03-04:00,"Rockwell Automation recently announced salary cuts for all of their non-manufacturing employees, just one day after maintaining their $1.02 quarterly dividend.The company is bracing for a slowdown that will severely impact a large portion of their customer base.Rockwell Automation has delivered high shareholder returns over an extended period of time, but shares appear overvalued and shareholders may see meager returns for several years.","Rockwell Automation (ROK) announced their next dividend payment of $1.02 per share on April 7, maintaining their previous payout rate. In a surprising move, they suspended the company match for employee 401(k) contributions and cuts salaries for many employees the following day. Rockwell stated that sales had held up in fiscal Q2, but they anticipate reduced demand in many countries and industries that they serve ""for a period of time"". Investors will have to wait until the fiscal Q2 earnings release on April 28 to hear more from the company, but now is a good time to look into the company to understand where it currently stands.The recently announced salary cut will not impact manufacturing positions, which will actually receive a one-time bonus payment. The company made a conscience decision to reduce salaries in order to minimize workforce reductions, but it may cause big problems for employee retention over the long term. Given the potential long-term consequences, March numbers must indicate a severe slowdown is on the way.A large contraction in Rockwell's business would not be surprising given they serve a number of industries that have already seen considerable slowdowns, including aerospace, automotive, and oil & gas. Even industries that have been spared the worst of the slowdown so far will likely be pulling back on discretionary capital spending for the rest of the year as they look to conserve cash in an uncertain time.Rockwell Automation product alignment to different industriesFrom Rockwell Automation 2019 10-K, page 15The ongoing economic slowdown is unprecedented in its speed, and the seemingly unlimited government stimulus may not be enough to induce companies to maintain capital spending. To get a sense for how quickly things can change for even a great company like Rockwell Automation, let's consider the Great Recession. Below is a graphic from page 2 of Rockwell's 2009 annual report. Free cash flow generation declined by almost 19% from 2007 to 2009.Image from Rockwell Automation 2009 annual reportRockwell Automation did sell their Power Systems business in 2017, but its $42.3M contribution to net income was excluded from the above free cash flow numbers. Despite the rapid contraction in cash generation over the short run, long-term shareholders saw free cash flows almost double over the last decade.Data by YChartsGray shading indicates the last recessionThe growth is not surprising considering the company is focused on free cash flow generation and return on capital, two highly shareholder friendly metrics. The company targets return on invested capital of over 20%, which they have hovered around over the last decade.Data by YChartsRockwell's operating margins have been at or near the top of its peers in the automation space: Emerson Electric Co. (EMR), Fanuc Corp. (OTCPK:FANUY), and Honeywell (HON). The process automation space is a high margin industry and one that should continue to grow over the long haul as companies continue to focus on efficiencies and cost reduction.Data by YChartsClearly, Rockwell is a strong company in a desirable industry, but are they prepared for a prolonged economic slowdown? Below is a copy of Rockwell's balance sheet from their most recent 10-Q. Cash and cash equivalents along with receivables, net of doubtful accounts, totaled $2.22B. The doubtful accounts could certainly increase in the coming months as bankruptcies hit shale and other customers, but at first glance, it looks like Rockwell should be able to cover their current liabilities of $2.07B.Balance sheet from Rockwell Automation fiscal 2020 10-QThe company had $926.2M in cash at the end of fiscal Q1; however, they had $299.4M of notes coming due in March. This would have reduced their cash balance to $626.8M. Rockwell had $403.2M in SG&A expenses in Q1 and $26.4M in interest payments. Assuming they experienced similar expenses in the recently closed Q2, this could potentially reduce their cash balance down to $197.2M before any cash inflow from Q2 is considered.While the remaining cash should be sufficient for the short term given their pending receivables, timing could play a major factor. Rockwell also lists $193.5M of liabilities for returns, rebates, and incentives that could potentially wipe out this remaining cash. Depending on the timing of payments for the $708.3M accounts payable and receipt of $1,298.1M in accounts receivable, you can see why management might be afraid that liquidity could become an issue in the coming months, resulting in the cash-saving salary cuts.Statement from Rockwell Automation 2020 Q1 10-QThe good news is that cash commitments beyond 2020 drop off significantly to $262M in 2021 and $194.3M in 2022 (table below), so the company has a fair amount of flexibility to adjust to declining revenues after they make it through 2020. Rockwell generated $1.18B in cash from operating activities in 2019, meaning even a 50% reduction would leave enough money to cover the current annual dividend payment rate of $471.6M per year. However, the company has averaged $133M in capital expenditure and $945M in share buybacks over the last three years, so the share buyback program that has reduced outstanding share count by over 17% in the last decade may be off the table for the foreseeable future.Rockwell Automation cash obligations from page 26 of the 2019 annual reportRockwell is a strong brand in the automation space and they will likely survive the current economic storm. The question for investors then becomes at what price do the shares become attractive.Rockwell has generated an average free cash flow of $1.04B over the last three years. We will use a working average cost of capital of 9.4% to discount future cash flows in all the following assumptions. In Scenario 1, we assume a prolonged economic slowdown results in a 30% reduction in free cash flow for 2020 and a 3% annual decline in cash flow for the following two years, then 2% growth thereafter. In Scenario 2, 2020 free cash flow is reduced by 20%, with flat free cash flow generation for two years, followed by 2% growth in future years. Scenario 3 assumes a 10% decline in free cash flow for 2020, followed by accelerating growth over the next five years, with a terminal growth rate of 3%.These scenarios do not represent the extreme possibilities, but they give us some idea how profoundly the current economic slowdown can impact the intrinsic value of a cyclical company, even a quality name like Rockwell Automation. Given that share buybacks will be curtailed or eliminated, a key tailwind will be missing in the coming years. Given the downward pressure on the business, it looks like shares would have to decline from there present levels before purchasing shares would be warranted.Rockwell Automation is a quality company, but they are vulnerable to current macroeconomic headwinds. The recent announced salary cuts are an indication of the company's concerns over liquidity in the short term. As one of the strongest companies in the growing automation space, Rockwell is well positioned to come out of the current economic crisis in good shape, but investors would be better served to wait for a better entry price before purchasing shares."
4320470,24361,2020-01-31T05:08:05-05:00,"Rockwell did miss at the segment profit line, but revenue was better than expected and full-year guidance was maintained.Rockwell's digital efforts seem to be gaining some traction, and it looks like the company may have gained share in the auto and oil/gas verticals.These shares are still pretty richly valued, though not really any worse than the high-quality multi-industrial peer group.","Automation specialist Rockwell Automation (ROK) reported a decent quarter for its fiscal first quarter (calendar fourth quarter), but Rockwell's valuation isn't predicated on decent results - the valuation embeds expectations of superior growth and margins, and I'm concerned that investors may continue to be disappointed on that front, as the company's reputation can overshadow its reality. On a more positive note, the company's digital industrial initiatives do appear to be gaining some traction.Rockwell shares are down a little from my late November update, modestly lagging the industrial peer group over that very brief time frame (though Rockwell has also underperformed a bit over the past year). That hasn't brought the shares to what I'd call an undervalued level, but I can say that the shares aren't all that more expensive than many other high-quality industrials these days in terms of prospective returns.Rockwell reported a 1% contraction in revenue on an organic basis, though that was still enough to beat expectations by about 3%. Both segments saw revenue contraction, with controller, sensor, and software-driven Architecture & Software (or A&S) down a little less than 1% despite a 2% decline in Logix, as Information Solutions & Connected Services (or ISCS) grew at a double-digit rate. In Control Products & Solutions (or CP&S), revenue fell more than 2% on a 5% decline in higher-margin product revenue (motor starters, protection devices, drives, and so on).Despite good momentum in software businesses, margin performance was not particularly strong. Gross margin declined 330bp year over year, while segment profits declined 10% and missed expectations by about 2%, driving a $0.04/share miss. The A&S business saw a 6% decline in segment profits (margin down 170bp), while CP&S declined 16% (margin down 310bp).By geography, Rockwell saw a 3% organic decline in North America, 2% growth in Europe, and 6% growth in Asia. At this point, Rockwell's weakness in North America seems about par for the course, and Asia seems to be performing better for many multi-industrials as well (at least relative to expectations).As I mentioned in a recent article on Fanuc (OTCPK:FANUY), extrapolating end-market conditions from a single report is always problematic. It's more like assembling a puzzle piece by piece, but Rockwell did at least provide some interesting insights.The discrete business (around 25% of sales) saw low-single-digit growth which was better than the company had guided and the marketed had expected. The high-single-digit growth in the semiconductor end-market isn't so surprising given reports from companies like ASML (ASML) and Atlas Copco (OTCPK:ATLKY) on improving demand. The mid-single-digit growth from the auto sector was a surprise, though, and I wonder if that is reflective of share growth. Though Fanuc did mention good underlying trends in the North American auto sector, 3M's (MMM) auto performance wasn't strong - admittedly, that's a very different product set, with 3M more volume-oriented and Rockwell capex-oriented.The hybrid business, which represents about 40% of sales, was weaker than expected with low-single-digit revenue contraction. Life sciences and tires were both up mid single digits, while food/beverage was down low single digits. As I've mentioned in other articles, I put no stock whatsoever in quarter-to-quarter performance from companies like Alfa Laval (OTCPK:ALFVY) and Rockwell that serve the food/beverage vertical - there's just too much idiosyncratic noise to draw useful conclusions, though management did point to growth in packaging as a forerunner/predictor of better food/beverage performance down the line.In process, which contributes the remaining 35% of sales, Rockwell saw weaker-than-expected revenue, with low-single-digit contraction. The mid-single-digit decline in mining and cement was actually pretty moderate given recent updates from that sector (making me wonder about share gains and/or project-specific growth), and the mid-single-digit growth in oil/gas likewise leads me to conclude share gains were a driver. The double-digit decline in chemicals may look a little alarming for Honeywell (HON) and Emerson (EMR) (which haven't reported as of this writing), but Rockwell is frankly too small in chemicals for me to regard that as a telling indicator.While not relevant to end-market dynamics, I do want to call out the ""strong double-digit"" growth in Rockwell's ISCS business, including its first augmented reality project in oil/gas. This is the part of the business where Rockwell's partnership with PTC (PTC) would be expected to drive results, and while it's still early in the partnership's life (and PTC has thus far gotten more leverage from its Microsoft (MSFT) partnership), this is nevertheless a good step for an important growth driver.I was a little above the Street with respect to 2020 expectations, and it looks like the sell-side will move a little closer to me after this quarter's revenue beat. Management reiterated its EPS guidance for the year, leading me to expect a ""higher revenue, weaker margin"" type of year, and it did suggest a more second-half weighted evolution of the year. That fits pretty cleanly with the consensus expectation of a second-half 2020 recovery for most short-cycle markets.In FY 2021 and beyond, my revenue assumptions are still ahead of Street expectations, and I'm expecting long-term revenue growth in the neighborhood of 5%. I'm also still expecting FCF margins to improve toward the high teens versus a long-term trailing average in the low-to-mid teens.Discounting my estimated cash flows back, I believe Rockwell is priced for a mid-to-high single-digit return from here. That's not bad relative to a wide range of quality industrials, but nor is it a compelling entry point. Likewise with my margin and return-driven EV/EBITDA valuation approach. Rockwell remains a very highly respected industrial, even though the arguments about its resistance to cyclicality and superior margins are overstated (though it's legitimately good in terms of FCF generation, return on assets and so on). Were the shares to fall into the $160s, I'd be a great deal more interested. Time will tell if that happens."
4308385,24361,2019-11-21T15:46:13-05:00,"Renewed optimism that the cyclical slowdown will end soon has propelled Rockwell shares back to a premium valuation.Rockwell management is looking to leverage growth opportunities in markets like warehouse/logistics and oil/gas, while also shifting to a less cyclical mix.Rockwell's prospective returns are now more typical for the shares, as it is a generally well-liked name in the industrial space.","While many industrial companies used the third quarter earnings cycle to talk down expectations for 2020, Rockwell Automation’s (ROK) strong beat-and-raise quarter seemed to stoke optimism that the end of this cyclical slowdown is in sight and the company will return to growth relatively soon. As a well-loved name among the industrials, that newfound optimism has launched the shares about 25% from their pre-earnings level.When I last wrote about Rockwell, I suggested considering the shares if/when they slipped below $150, and they subsequently did for a couple of weeks. If you bought then, you’ll already sitting on healthy gains, but also holding a stock that is back to a premium valuation despite a trend of shrinking outgrowth versus the industry in recent years and plenty of concerns still in play regarding 2020. The prospective returns here aren’t the worst among what I follow, but there definitely are names with more interesting valuations.Rockwell recently hosted its Automation Fair and investor meeting, and the messages out of that event weren’t thesis-changing, but were nevertheless encouraging. Management seems more focused on top-line growth than in recent years, with a target of $9 billion in sales (albeit not with much specificity on timing), but the underlying high-margin/high-ROIC model will remain in place.Maybe the biggest change is management’s desire to establish a less cyclical revenue base for the business. In addition to building up recurring software subscription and service revenue (including managed services), Rockwell is also looking to shift its mix more in the direction of products and services that are funded out of opex budgets rather than capital budgets.As far as areas of focus, auto will remain a key market for Rockwell for the foreseeable future, but EV-related spending should pick up more significantly in the coming years. The company also remains committed to growing its presence in hybrid markets like life sciences and food & beverage. Not surprisingly, given the Sensia joint venture with Schlumberger (SLB), oil and gas will be a significant part of the future mix. Rockwell is also following in the footsteps of automation companies like Honeywell (HON) and positioning itself to take advantage of growth opportunities in warehouse/logistics in the coming years.Last and by no means least, Rockwell management reiterated its commitment to its partnership model. Rockwell has long maintained that partnerships (versus M&A) give the company more flexibility in offering best-of-breed solutions, as well as steering clear of integration risk. It’s certainly a different strategy than the one pursued by many of its peers (including ABB (ABB) and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) ), but it seems to work relatively well for them. To that end, the company announced new partnerships with Accenture (ACN) and Ansys (ANSS), with the latter boosting the company’s capabilities in simulation.I like Rockwell’s interest in building a less cyclical business, though to be fair it’s not like Rockwell’s valuation really includes much of a penalty or discount for the cyclicality. I also like the increased focus on industries like oil & gas where there is significantly less automation in place than in other industries. Importantly, Rockwell is not really looking to compete head-to-head so much with Honeywell or Emerson (EMR) in these process industries (where Emerson in particular is strong), but rather offer products and solutions that others don’t.It’s well worth noting that Rockwell ended its fiscal year (the calendar third quarter) with some momentum. Revenue came in about 5% better than expected, with segment income outperforming by a similar amount (with incrementally better performance in Control Products & Solutions relative to expectations). Excluding restructuring and charges related to Sensia (which I don’t think should be excluded, but that’s neither here nor there), the outperformance was even more stark. Then again, it’s worth noting that expectations were lowered significantly going into this quarter, so the outperform isn’t so impressive relative to where expectations were, say six months ago.Both the Architecture & Software and CP&S segments managed organic growth this quarter (surprising on both accounts, with overall organic revenue up more than 1%. Gross margin declined by about a point, while segment-level margin declined by about a point. Guidance was strong relative to expectations before the report, but not so special relative to where the Street was a couple of quarters ago.Looking at the market commentary, it would seem that stronger-than-expected demand in the auto space, where sales rose at a mid-single-digit clip despite weakness at other automation peers, certainly helped the quarterly beat. Food & beverage was also positive (up low single digits), while oil/gas and mining were very strong (up double-digits) despite some warnings from peers that demand was slowing. Demand from semiconductor customers remained weak (down more than 10%).I believe management’s guidance for FY 2020 was prudent, and I think we’re probably at or near the halfway point of the cyclical slowdown (not all companies move in lockstep through the cycle). I value companies like Rockwell with both a long-term approach (discounted cash flow) and short-term approach (margin/return-driven EV/EBITDA), and my core expectations of mid-single-digit long-term growth remain in place.I’m not surprised that Rockwell shares have outperformed on renewed optimism that the worst is over, but I am a little surprised at the magnitude. For now, at least, the Street doesn’t seem worried about the trend of shrinking outgrowth versus the industry at Rockwell, nor the possible risk of reduced PLC hardware demand in the future. On the other hand, Rockwell has done a lot to build its position in software, digitalization, and simulation, and I believe those will be increasingly important tools in the future.I believe Rockwell shares are now priced for a mid-to-high single-digit annualized return, which I consider “okay” but not necessarily compelling. I’m concerned that the relief rally may be too much too soon, but I also do expect many of Rockwell’s markets to stabilize in the next few quarters and then recover. Were another round of panic to hit industrial names, this would once again be a name to consider picking up on dips/pullbacks."
4296778,104720,2019-10-16T09:36:43-04:00,"Rockwell has some excellent products, which are its long-term growth drivers.
        The company’s revenue is expected to grow in mid-single digit in the next four years.
        Long-term investors can accumulate Rockwell’s stock around the current price.","Rockwell Automation (ROK) is an industrial automation company. Its revenue is growing at a CAGR of 4.40% in the past ten years, and EBITDA is growing at a CAGR of 10.62% in the same time period. Rockwell is a medium-growth company. Its stock has created a 52-week high of $191.96 and a 52-week low of $141.46. Currently the stock is trading near $165, and around this price the stock is attractively valued. Long-term investors can accumulate the stock around the current price.Rockwell is a provider of industrial automation and information solutions. It has two operating segments, which are Architecture & Software, and Control Products & Solutions. The company has some excellent products, which are its growth drivers for the future. The products are factory analytics, advanced process control products, and advanced motion control products.Rockwell’s FactoryTalk Analytics platform has the potential to become one of its top growing products. This platform offers solutions that include assessment of machine health and identification of machine maintenance needs. The company produces insightful information from raw data at the factory level on plant floors across the globe. It has standardized its operation on its EtherNet/IP system. The EtherNet/IP system connects devices like motor starters and sensors with the computers at the enterprise level. After assessing machine health and its maintenance needs, the analytics platform sends this information to the enterprise from the plant floor.Rockwell’s advanced process control products Pavilion8 and PlantPAx are MPC (model predictive control) products that will see high growth in the future. In today's competitive world many companies are shifting their operations from product-centric to customer-centric and demand-driven. The Pavilion8 software platform helps the companies achieve this. The platform has modules to analyze, control, monitor and visualize factory operations in such a way that it is possible to control manufacturing according to demand. PlantPAx MPC software platform is designed to run within standard Logix hardware. This platform helps the companies manage most challenging and complex control problems by responding more quickly to the demands of the customers and to the fast-changing product specifications.The company’s Servo drives, Servo motors and actuators are its advanced motion control solutions. Motion control is a sub-field of automation and an important part of robotics where machines move in a controlled manner. Since motion control is a part of robotics, Rockwell’s Servo family of products are actually robotics products. And since robotics is a high-growth sector, Servo will see growing revenue in the years to come. According to a report, “The robotics market was valued at USD 31.78 billion in 2018 and is expected to register a CAGR of 25% over the forecast period of 2019-2024.” In addition to Servo, Rockwell’s iTRAK intelligent track system is another intelligent motion control solution. The iTRAK system is a modular and scalable motion control system that substitutes rotary-driven chains, belts, and gears of the past. Instead, it is controlled by simple software profiles. The iTRAK system will also see increasing revenue in the coming years.Industrial automation is a highly competitive business. Rockwell primarily competes with ABB Ltd (ABB), Cognex Corporation (CGNX), Honeywell International (HON), Siemens AG (OTCPK:SIEGY) and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (OTCPK:MIELY). Some of the company’s competitors, which are large diversified companies, also have business interests outside of industrial automation. A few smaller companies that compete with Rockwell, like Cognex, have business interests only in industrial automation. These companies have a limited portfolio of industrial automation products. Rockwell’s competitive advantage is its large portfolio of industrial automation products, technology differentiation and domain expertise.In the third quarter of fiscal 2019 Rockwell delivered mixed results. The company reported fiscal 2019 Q3 revenue of $1,665 million, down 2% YoY from $1,699 million in the year-ago quarter. However, organic sales were up 0.5% YoY. Fiscal 2019 Q3 net income came in at $261.4 million or $2.20 per share, compared to $198.6 million or $1.58 per share in the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS was $2.40, up 11% YoY compared to $2.16 in the year-ago period. The company updated its fiscal 2019 adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.50 to $8.70 from $8.85 to $9.15 earlier.Operating margin was 23.8% compared to 22.5% a year ago, impacted by lower incentive compensation expense. The company witnessed strong growth in longer-cycle end markets and weak growth in shorter-cycle end markets. Longer-cycle end markets include oil and gas, pulp and paper, mining, and life sciences, which grew in double digits. Shorter-cycle end markets include automotive, semiconductor, and food and beverage, which witnessed declines.End market cyclicality always impacts industrial automation companies, there is nothing new in it. Further, in a challenging macro environment 2% revenue decline is not a big disappointment. What is encouraging is that, according to a report, “the industrial control and factory automation market is expected to reach USD 269.5 billion by 2024 from USD 160.0 billion in 2018, at a CAGR of 9.08%.” Industrial Internet of Things or IIoT is driving growth in this market. In IIoT, use of smart sensors and actuators drive manufacturing output.Rockwell’s peer group includes ABB Ltd, Cognex Corporation and Honeywell International. Rockwell’s GAAP forward PE ratio is 20.98x, compared to ABB’s 29.03x, Cognex’s 55.94x and Honeywell’s 20.15x. Rockwell’s trailing 12-month price to sales ratio is 2.94x, compared to ABB’s 1.38x, Cognex’s 10.48x and Honeywell’s 3.09x. Rockwell’s trailing 12-month price to cash flow ratio is 17.95x, compared to ABB’s 18.15x, Cognex’s 30.70x and Honeywell’s 18.77x.Compared to its peers, Rockwell is attractively valued around the current price. However, the company has a “not so strong” balance sheet. Its cash on balance sheet is $913.4 million and total debt is $2.24 billion. Net debt is $1326.6 million. The company isn’t cash-rich, and it is funding its growth activities partially through debt. However, its net leverage is 0.88x, which means its debt-load isn’t alarming. Moreover, the company has generated $1.07 billion of net operating cash flow, and $591.64 million of free cash flow in the past twelve months, which are encouraging.The company’s mission is to establish “the connected enterprise” with the help of smart manufacturing, leveraging the power of smart sensors and analytics. The company will help its customers convert their enterprise to a connected enterprise where IIoT will play a major role. This will create demand for many of the company’s products. In addition, the company’s motion control products will see rising demand since they are basically robotics products and robotics is a high growth sector. Compared to these demand drivers, Rockwell’s debt problem isn't a serious issue.In the last four years Rockwell’s revenue growth remained flat. I expect the growth drivers mentioned above will drive its revenue growth at a CAGR of mid-single digit, say 5%, in the next four years. Its trailing 12-month revenue is $6694.1 million. At a CAGR of 5%, its 2023 revenue will be $8545 million or $73.03 per share. At today’s price to sales ratio is 2.94x, the stock’s 2023 price will be $214.71.A large percentage of Rockwell’s sales in the U.S. and Canada are achieved by distributors. In other countries also, a high portion of its sales are achieved by a limited number of distributors. Disruptions to the company’s distribution channels could adversely affect revenue growth.The ability of the company to correctly identify the changes in demand patterns of the customers results in revenue growth. If the company fails to identify changes in customers’ demand patterns, revenue growth will be adversely affected. In addition, if the company fails to anticipate broader industry trends, demand for its products could decrease.Many of Rockwell’s products are products of the future, such as the iTRAK intelligent track system and the connected smart products. Although the company’s revenue growth remained flat in the past four years, in the next four years its revenue is expected to grow in mid-single digit driven by demand for such products. Long-term growth-oriented investors can buy the stock around the current price."
4278612,24361,2019-07-29T09:45:58-04:00,"Rockwell came up short on organic growth, and the segment-level margins were boosted by cuts to incentive compensation.Short-cycle sector weakness seems to be spreading, though longer-cycle process industries are holding up better for Rockwell.Bull/bear debates are focusing on whether Rockwell's core PLC offerings will still be relevant in the future, and whether its open software approach is inferior to proprietary offerings.Rockwell shares look fairly valued relative to the near-term risks, but another drop below $150 would make the shares worth considering.","I don't believe there's much debate anymore about whether weakness in short-cycle industries is spreading, though longer-cycle industries have continued to hold up better (even if they're wobbling a bit) and some investors are still pinning their hopes on a second-half rebound. That's all bad news for Rockwell Automation (ROK), as this leading pure-play in industrial automation continues to see slowing markets that are sapping its growth and momentum.The short-cycle slowdown is manageable; Rockwell has always been a cyclical business, and that's just part of the landscape. Beyond that, though, there are some interesting arguments about Rockwell's operating philosophy and its place in the future of industrial automation. I like buying proven operators when these sorts of questions crop up, but I'd rather hold off in the hope of getting another crack at the shares below $150.Rockwell's fiscal third quarter wasn't disastrous, but it wasn't a good outcome either. Revenue came in 4% below expectation, with the organic growth rate more than 1% lower than expected. Segment results relative to expectations were messy; third-party data sources suggest that Rockwell beat at the segment line by about $0.05/share, but some analysts have written about a $0.15/share beat, which leads me to believe there's a discrepancy in how some costs (incentive comp, etc.) were being treated and incorporated into ""consensus"" estimates.Revenue fell 2% as reported, but rose about a half a point in organic terms. The Architecture and Software business saw a 2% decline, as Logix declined 3%, process rose 3%, and ISCS grew at a double-digit pace. Control Products & Services rose 3% in the quarter.Benchmarking these results is a little challenging because of the differences in how companies report. That said, a 3% decline in Logix (controllers used in discrete/factory automation) fits with the 3% decline in ABB's (ABB) Robotics and Discrete Automation business, as well as the 1% decline in Schneider's (OTCPK:SBGSY) automation business. Process growth of 3% is consistent with the results seen at Honeywell (HON) and ABB in their process automation operations, and the 3% growth in CP&S would fit with ABB's 5% growth in Motion, as this is where Rockwell reports most of its revenue from drives, motor controls, and the like.Gross margin increased a bit and reported operating income rose 5%, while segment operating income rose 3%, with margin expanding 130bp. The A&S business saw a 7% decline in segment earnings (and 60bp of margin erosion), while the CP&S saw a reported 20% improvement in segment earnings (and 320bp of margin improvement), spiked by a significant cut in incentive compensation. Sell-side analysts seem to have differing views on how to treat that compensation item; for my part, while Rockwell delivered a reported beat, the ""core"" segment profitability was weaker than expected and a net negative.All told, I didn't find much to like in Rockwell's near-term guidance. The sub-1.0x book-to-bill is unusual for the third quarter of Rockwell's year and not a good sign relative to slowing end markets. Likewise, management's revised guidance suggests an organic revenue decline in Q4 around 3% and a 10%-plus downward revision to earnings net of the incentive compensation move. I'd also note that weak guidance from Rockwell's software partner PTC (PTC) sent those shares down sharply after its earnings report.Looking at Rockwell's major served markets, auto remains very weak, though it ""improved"" from a negative 20% in the fiscal second quarter to negative 10% this quarter; ABB and Yaskawa (OTCPK:YASKY) have also pointed to weakness in automation spending in the auto sector.Pulp/paper was up double digits for Rockwell, as were oil/gas, mining, and life sciences. ABB, too, noted strength in pulp/paper, and the relative strength for Rockwell in oil/gas and mining really makes me wonder again why ABB is having the problems it has in those markets (loss of market share is certainly a plausible explanation), but it does support the idea that Honeywell and Emerson (EMR) are both in solid shape with their petro-heavy process automation businesses. Semiconductors remain weak, and Rockwell also saw a decline in food/beverage, with fits with the commentary Alfa Laval (OTCPK:ALFVY) made about some modest near-term weakness in that sector.I have found the debates over Rockwell's future in automation to be interesting, particularly given the strong share the company has established in discrete automation in North American and its expansion into hybrid automation markets.To make a complex debate simple, the central issues boil down to two primary talking points - will PLCs, where Rockwell enjoys strong share, still matter in the future? And, is Rockwell's ""open"" approach to software the right one?With the PLC debate, companies like Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) and Schneider have weighed in saying that they see more factory control moving to the edge and/or toward the top of the enterprise, effectively ""hollowing out"" that control layer in the middle where PLCs fit. I think that's premature, as PLCs will still have an important role to play in coordinating those systems. What's more, Rockwell is strong in manufacturing execution system software and is looking to its PTC partnership to improve its edge control capabilities.As to the second debate, I can understand why Siemens and Schneider want to create doubt about the value of a more open software platform, given the amount of money they've spent creating proprietary software systems. Rockwell's argument is that, while Siemens and/or Schneider may have good software today, companies will be wary of locking themselves into proprietary systems that will be difficult to change and could be surpassed/out of date faster than expected. This is a more challenging argument for me to resolve; Rockwell's more open, partner-based approach has worked very well this far, but I can see how the proprietary systems of Siemens and Schneider, customized and fine-tuned for individual users, could ultimately be the better long-term approach.With deteriorating short-cycle conditions (industrial sector year-over-year organic growth is down about half a point from Q1 at this point in the reporting cycle) and meaningful margin pressures, I'm lowering my earnings expectations for Rockwell over the next two years, but not changing the longer-term numbers to the same extent.Revenue growth for this year and the next will basically stall out, but I do still expect long-term revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, with only relatively modest incremental FCF margin leverage. I am also reducing my near-term margin and return assumptions, which lowers the ""fair"" forward EBITDA multiple in that model.I believe Rockwell is trading pretty close to fair value, with an implied long-term annualized total return in the high single-digits that is better than what is on offer from the likes of Honeywell, but with a much rockier near-term outlook. Below $150, though, I'd consider adding shares - while the debates about whether Rockwell's strategy are out of step with the evolution of the automation markets are certainly worth considering, I don't think Rockwell is as out of step as the bears want to believe."
4364270,24361,2020-08-04T14:29:55-04:00,"Rockwell posted a modest segment-level beat in the fiscal third quarter, with better results in the A&S segment.The auto market remains weak, and Rockwell seems to be underperforming a healthy life sciences investment cycle, but management commentary supports a short-cycle bottoming thesis.Rockwell shares don't look particularly cheap, but then they seldom do.","Rockwell (ROK) is a pretty well-loved industrial, and particularly when recovery themes take over (as has been the case for a few months). While industrials with short-cycle exposure like Parker-Hannifin (PH) can, perhaps paradoxically, see momentum fade when ISM moves back above 50, Rockwell’s past rallies tend to last a little longer. Add in investor expectations that Rockwell will benefit from a meaningful reshoring trend, and I can’t say I’m surprised that Rockwell shares have stayed pretty strong since my last update.Valuation is a frequent issue for me with Rockwell. Even though I think quality companies deserve premiums (and Rockwell qualifies), settling for less doesn’t always work well in my experience. On the other hand, with interest rates likely to remain low for a while, maybe investors have to accept that 7% returns are the “new 10%” return and adjust expectations accordingly. Even so, compared to names like Dover (DOV), Honeywell (HON), and Lincoln Electric (LECO), Rockwell screens as relatively more expensive.Like so many multi-industrials, Rockwell managed to hit the lowered bar for fiscal third quarter (calendar second quarter) results as end-market demand picked up throughout the quarter (after a disastrous April). Revenue was slightly better than expected, while better cost-cutting led to a 4% (or $0.07/share) beat at the segment profit level.Part of the reason I say “not THAT much better” is that Rockwell still reported an organic revenue decline of more than 17% - a little on the worse side of average for multi-industrials this quarter. A&S segment revenue declined 16% on a 16% decline in Logix and low single-digit decline in ISCS, while CP&S revenue declined 19% on a 17% decline in control products and a 20% decline in solutions.Gross margin declined 330bp, while operating income declined 47%, with margin declining a steep 820bp, with decremental margin above 60% (versus the low 30%’s many companies are reporting). Segment-level profit declined 42%, with segment margin down 730bp.A&S was the stronger business on both the top line (4% beat) and segment line ($0.10/share beat), with segment profit down 34% and margin down six points to just under 24%. CP&S segment profit missed by $0.03/share, with profit down 53% and margin down 830bp to 10.6%. On a more positive note, CP&S orders did grow at a double-digit rate, with a 1.05x book-to-bill.On the whole, I’d say Rockwell’s commentary on its end-markets was consistent with my expectations, albeit with a couple of points of interest. I also want to note a potentially worrisome trend I’m seeing with other industrials – while sales improved pretty nicely through the quarter, July is trending fairly flat with June. I’m not panicking about that, but I think it’s worth watching particularly given how the market seems to be treating a short-cycle recovery as a done deal.Discrete markets were down 20%, and the 25% decline in auto sounds very consistent with the reports from companies like Atlas Copco (OTCPK:ATLKY), Dover, Lincoln Electric, and so on. The mid single-digit improvement in semiconductor markets was a little low in my view, though at least some equipment companies have reported a slower order trend in the second quarter. Management did also note that the underlying trend was improving in discrete end-markets.Hybrid markets were down 10%, with food and beverage (the largest single market for Rockwell) down 10%. Tires were down double digits, while life sciences was down 10%. This is two straight quarters of seemingly weaker-than-trend results in life sciences, and I’m curious as to why Rockwell would be seeing this when companies like Danaher (DHR) and Halma (OTCPK:HLMLY) have reported healthy demand. This could be due to where Rockwell sits in the “food chain,” but it bears watching. Management indicated that hybrid markets were basically stable.Process markets were down 25%, with oil/gas down 30%, mining/cement down double digits and chemicals down double digits. This is quite consistent with what companies like Honeywell (among others) have said, and Rockwell noted worsening conditions, despite some order growth for the Sensia JV.Rockwell management announced that they would be changing their operating and reporting structure. Rockwell will henceforth be run as three operating segments – Intelligent Devices, Software & Control, and Lifecycle Services.Intelligent Devices will be mostly hardware, bringing sensors, safety, drives, motion control, and industrial components under one umbrella. Software & Control, as the name suggests, will include the MES/MOM busines, as well as offerings like simulation, visualization, augmented reality, security analytics, discrete/process control, and network infrastructure. Lifecycle Services will include offerings like consulting, Sensia, connected services, and maintenance.This rearrangement makes abundant sense to me. In particular, I think it may help highlight the growth and value that can be added by the company’s investments in software and “X-as-a-service” offerings, including its IoT, analytics, and simulation offerings.As I’ve said before, I’m still somewhat skeptical on the onshoring/reshoring theme. I believe it will happen, but I think it will be more “situation-specific” than the general consensus. I believe it makes abundant sense, for instance, to reshore more production capacity for active pharmaceutical ingredients, and I likewise understand the desire to reshore some electronics components. Still, a lot of industries, like autos (10% of sales), food/bev (20% of sales), home/personal care (5%), tires (5%), oil/gas (10%) and other process commodity markets (20%) aren’t likely to move much.I know Rockwell is working closely with Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) to use automation to allow SWK to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S., and I’m not ruling out the possibility of more companies doing this, but I think investors should temper their expectations. On a positive note, as the leader in the U.S. market, Rockwell would stand to gain meaningful business if there’s a greater wave here than I expect.I’m still looking for Rockwell to generate long-term revenue growth of over 4% over the next decade – an acceleration from the past decade as more industries adopt automation and as offerings like software grow. I’m also expecting Rockwell to be more profitable, as the mix shifts more towards higher-margin services and software. That, in turn, should support long-term FCF growth in the 6% to 7% range with FCF margins in the high teens.If that FCF growth rate is in the ballpark, Rockwell shares look priced for a mid single-digit return on an annualized basis. I said in the open, maybe investors need to accept lower returns as part of the new normal, but Rockwell’s prospective returns are lower than many other quality industrials, including industrials with good short-cycle recovery exposure and leverage to future reshoring. I don’t believe in betting against Rockwell, but history has shown that patient investors can get opportunities to buy in with better expected returns than what is available today."
4279809,104131,2019-07-31T18:42:16-04:00,"The industrial automation trend is likely to continue for a long time, benefiting companies with a strong focus in this area such as Rockwell Automation.Rockwell is well managed, and despite having considerable cyclicality, it has proven it can grow its revenues and profits at a good rate over long periods of time.Shares look reasonably priced at the moment, but there might be better buying opportunities if the global economy continues to soften.Rockwell's high returns on invested capital and re-investment opportunities make it an attractive long-term compounder.","One trend we are confident is going to continue for many more years is that of increasing industrial automation. A company that is well-placed to benefit from this move towards increased productivity and efficiency is Rockwell Automation (ROK), which describes itself as the world's largest company dedicated to industrial automation and information.These automation solutions are complex and require the use of many different pieces of hardware and software to implement. Not only are these solutions rather complex, but the trend has also been towards tailored solutions for each customer with increasing use of advanced software. This creates a moat for Rockwell and makes them a truly strategic partner to their customers. Many companies would be hesitant to have their production lines idle because they opted for a cheaper, less reliable competitor.Many Rockwell solutions also let companies have better understanding of their production processes, with advanced industrial analytics and real-time data.Source: Rockwell Automation investor presentationOne thing that is not ideal with Rockwell is the cyclicality of its revenues, which tend to decline significantly when companies spend less on capital expenditures. The last two revenue declines were during the financial crisis of 2008 and then during the industrial slowdown of 2015.Data by YChartsHowever, when taking a longer term view, these revenue declines look a lot less scary, and the significant growth can be better appreciated.Source: Rockwell Automation investor presentationAs expected, the cyclicality in revenues makes earnings quite volatile. Fortunately, free cash flow is a little less cyclical than earnings, which should provide some comfort that the dividend is less at risk than what could be suggested by a drop in earnings.Source: Rockwell Automation investor presentationWhile a cyclical company can still be a great investment over the long term if it has enough secular growth, Rockwell has been implementing some strategies to reduce cyclicality by increasing subscription and recurring services revenue. This is related to its push to increase software content in the solutions the company offers as well as some strategic partnerships.Source: Rockwell Automation investor presentationOne particularly important partnership Rockwell established is with PTC, which is a leader in augmented reality and IoT solutions for industrial applications. As part of the partnership, Rockwell made a $1 billion equity investment in PTC for an approximate 8.4% ownership interest. The strategic partnership is also expected to accelerate growth for both companies by enabling them to be the partner of choice for customers who want to transform their physical operations with digital technology.Source: PTC investor presentationThe global industrial automation market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 6% for the next few years. This seems reasonable given the number of tailwinds industrial automation is benefiting from, and we would not be surprised if it ended up being a little higher.With the global economy slowing, analysts have reduced their long-term earnings per share growth targets for Rockwell. This is probably an important factor that has reduced the price of the shares in recent quarters. The current estimate appears a lot more reasonable. If Rockwell can grow at least as fast as its market, share buybacks and some operating leverage should make the company able to grow earnings at 8-9% for the next few years.Data by YChartsSeveral of the markets that Rockwell serves are growing fast, such as renewable energy and water treatment.Source: Rockwell Automation investor presentationThere are, however, some soft spots, such as the transportation segment that includes the automotive industry, which has been noticeably weak in the last few years. Other sectors such as consumer staples have been significantly more resilient. Transportation accounted for ~15% of Rockwell's FY18 sales.Source: Rockwell Automation investor presentationWhile we expect some of the sectors to remain relatively weak for a while, we think new applications can keep the company growing at a fast pace. One such example is the increasing use of automation to help improve the efficiency of trash recycling. Below, we link to an interesting video that talks about it.One thing we really like about Rockwell Automation is its commitment to being a responsible company. Its products are found across many applications supporting environmental sustainability, and it has won several corporate responsibility awards.Source: Rockwell Automation investor presentationRockwell also has above-average ratings from its employees on Glassdoor, including a very high approval for its CEO.Source: GlassdoorIn terms of valuation metrics, Rockwell is currently trading above its 10-year median price-to-sales ratio. This ratio has been trending higher in the last few years, probably in part due to the effects of low interest rates on valuations as well as increased profitability for the company as the economy rebounded from the financial crisis.Data by YChartsWhile the EV/EBITDA ratio is not near the bottom, it is not near a maximum either, and seems reasonable at a ~13 multiple. The forward PE ratio of ~18 does not look too expensive either, given the quality and growth expectations for the company.Data by YChartsRockwell has been returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. This has reduced the number of shares outstanding significantly.Data by YChartsThe balance sheet remains strong, although it has moved from a net cash position to having net long-term debt. The debt is quite manageable and reasonable compared to Rockwell's earnings and operating cash flows.Data by YChartsRockwell deserves a premium valuation compared to its competitors given its much higher operating margins and ROIC.Data by YChartsIn fact, Rockwell has proven to be a powerful compounding machine for long-term investors. During its life as a public company, it has returned almost an order of magnitude more than the market as measured by the S&P 500.Data by YChartsThis is, in part, thanks to the high returns the company has been able to generate on its invested capital as well as the fact that it keeps reinvesting in R&D and making capital expenditures.Data by YChartsRockwell has shown to be disciplined with capital allocation by reinvesting profits in the business, paying a growing dividend, and repurchasing shares.Data by YChartsIt is likely that significant share buybacks will continue, given how much free cash flow Rockwell is generating. This shows the quality of its earnings, and opens the possibilities for more strategic partnerships like the one with PTC, growing the dividend, or continuing to reduce the number of shares outstanding. The smart re-deployment of this cash flow is crucial for Rockwell to remain the investment compounding machine it has been so far.Source: Rockwell Automation investor presentationPart of Rockwell's business strategy is maintaining strong financial flexibility, enabling it to take advantage of acquisition opportunities that might present themselves and to hold on to a solid credit rating.Source: Rockwell Automation investor presentationThe balance sheet remains rock solid with an ""A"" credit rating, a reasonable amount of net debt, and conservative debt to EBITDA ratios.One important risk to consider is that of the global economy entering a substantial recession. The Estrella and Mishkin model is currently giving a close to 30% recession probability within the next twelve months.Data by YChartsManufacturing data has been weak for the last couple of quarters and things could get worse before they get better.Data by YChartsAt least Rockwell's share price appears to be discounting this risk to some degree, while many market indices are close to record highs.Data by YChartsRockwell Automation is a wonderful company that is growing at a fast pace, operates in an industry with significant tailwinds, has strong margins and market leadership, and has been good at rewarding investors. We believe it is currently available at a reasonable valuation because it discounts to some degree the possibility of a recession in the near future. While shares can certainly go much lower if the global economy enters a recession, we think Rockwell Automation will continue to be an attractive long term investment."
4237124,24361,2019-01-31T12:54:35-05:00,"Rockwell generated better than expected operating profits in the calendar fourth quarter, but considering the valuation, such outperformance is almost required.Rockwell is still seeing strong demand in significant end-markets like food/bev, life sciences, mining, and metals, and even in weaker markets like semiconductors and autos, ROK appears to be outperforming.These shares seldom trade at any sort of discount, and that's still true today, but this would be a name to revisit if weakening demand in 2019 pressures the shares.","A lot is expected of Rockwell Automation (ROK), a seemingly perennial favorite in the industrial space, and those high expectations may be the biggest challenge for the company as 2019 looks to be a year of slowing capex investments across a range of industries. Although I think mid-single-digit revenue and free cash flow growth are attainable over the long term, I’m not sure Rockwell’s share price today really reflects the risk of slower spending as 2019 goes on.Rockwell’s fiscal first quarter (calendar fourth quarter) was strong relative to expectations, with a small beat on revenue and a larger mid-single-digit beat at the operating profit line. Guidance was benign and not only does Rockwell continue to benefit from growth in several large end-markets, it would seem that the company continues to outperform even in those verticals where conditions have slowed.Revenue rose more than 3% as reported, but closer to 6% on an organic basis, beat the expected organic growth rate by around 1%. Growth was balanced, with 5% growth in the Architecture and Software segment (boosted by 7% growth in Logix and double-digit growth in ISCS) and close to 7% growth in the Control Products & Solutions business (with slower 5% growth on the control products side).Gross margin isn’t an area of much focus with this business, though it did improve about a point from last year. More importantly, operating income rose nearly 7%, though segment-level profits grew at a slower 5.6% pace, with A&S up 5.7% and CP&S up 5%. While the CP&S margin was basically static at 15.5 (up 10bp), A&S saw a one-point improvement to 31.5%.Book-to-bill was a healthy 1.12x for the CP&S business, though that’s relatively normal on a seasonal basis.Relative to other industrial/multi-industrial managements, Rockwell’s CEO sounded relatively more confident about the growth outlook for his business. Time will tell if that’s a reflection of Rockwell’s greater leverage to the U.S. market (where demand seems stronger for now), a reflection of increasing share gains across its end-markets, or a reflection of excessive optimism ahead of a more pronounced slowdown in demand.On the plus side, Rockwell has meaningful exposure to markets that still look healthy in 2019 and beyond. Demand in the food/beverage sector is still strong and makes up about 20% of sales (check out Alfa Laval’s (OTCPK:ALFVY) upcoming earnings for corroboration), and as seen at Danaher (DHR), there’s still strong demand for automation in life sciences (where Danaher’s Beckman life sciences business saw 20% revenue growth driven by automation) which makes up another 5% or so of Rockwell’s mix.Mining is still quite healthy, and companies in the metals space are stepping up their spending as they expand production and build out capacity. Pulp/paper is also quite healthy now and all together these markets account for another 15% or so of revenue.Rockwell acknowledged weakness in the auto and semiconductor markets, but mid-single-digit declines in auto suggest Rockwell still outperforming the overall market, and likewise with low single-digit growth in semiconductors. Although companies in both the auto and semiconductor markets are reducing overall capex spending, automation projects are still a comparative priority. Rockwell also expects mid-single-digit growth in its oil/gas and process industries. Rockwell has been trying to build up its presence in process automation, but rivals like Honeywell (HON), Emerson (EMR), ABB (ABB), and Yokogawa (OTCPK:YOKEY) are likely to benefit more from this typical late-cycle strength in process automation.Stepping back a bit, I do think it’s worth noting that Rockwell isn’t particularly well-positioned in traditionally stronger late-cycle industries like aerospace and chemicals. Likewise, if you look at the long-term track record of Rockwell’s growth compared to an industry-weighted record of capex spending, Rockwell hasn’t outgrown the market all that much. In other words, while automation is a legitimate long-term growth trend and Rockwell is well-placed in discrete and hybrid automation, it is still a provider of capital equipment at a time when capital investments are likely to slow noticeably from the prior two years.Rockwell also just announced a small acquisition – acquiring British software company Emulate3D. It’s a small deal that isn’t financially material to Rockwell, but what Emulate3D does is provide software that allows users to simulate and emulate industrial automation systems, allowing users to test machine and system designs in the virtual world before locking in a final design.What’s odd to me is that that sounds a lot like the Discovery Live platform that PTC (PTC) offers through its partnership with ANSYS (ANSS) and PTC and Rockwell are partnered together now in the industrial IoT space with PTC’s ThingWorx, Vuforia, and Kepware platforms. Maybe there is less overlap between Emulate3D and Discovery Live than I think, but it’s an interesting move if they are in fact quite similar.Although I’m still concerned about a slowdown in industrial spending/investment in 2019, that was already in my numbers for Rockwell and not much changes after this quarter. I still expect mid-single-digit revenue and FCF growth over the long term, and I still believe Rockwell deserves a premium EV/EBTIDA multiple for its strong margins, ROIC, and ROA. The “but”, as is typically the case with Rockwell shares, is that quite a lot is already factored into the share price here, and I don’t see them as particularly cheap on an absolute basis. I would note, though, that Rockwell seems a little more reasonably priced than usual compared to the “average” industrial peer.I’ve made no secret of my long-term bullishness on automation and the likelihood that large players in automation will be able to generate above-GDP growth as more industries look to automation as a solution to rising labor costs, labor shortages, and manufacturing/cost flexibility. I believe Rockwell’s strong position in discrete automation and growing presence in hybrid automation are both valuable, but I believe the share price captures that adequately and I’m in no hurry to pay up here, though if 2019 does prove to be a tougher year than is reflected in the current estimates, this is a name I’d revisit on a sell-off."
4267701,24361,2019-05-31T17:37:54-04:00,"The surprising announcement of tariffs against Mexico will create some challenges for Rockwell and other automation providers, as Mexico is a major manufacturing location for many companies.Sentiment among industrial sector CEOs is not getting better, and seems to be incrementally worse than a month ago, though Rockwell believes contagion outside autos is minimal.Rockwell is now trading below my fair value range, not a common occurrence, and it's tempting to take advantage even if I see more macro-economic risk on the horizon.","At the time of Rockwell’s (ROK) fiscal second quarter earnings report in late April, I commented that I thought investors would have an opportunity to buy shares in this high-quality automation enabler at a lower price. Since then, the shares have dropped more than 15%, significantly underperforming industrials in general, on growing concerns about a slowdown in the industrial end-markets that make up a large part of the discrete automation market. Now with the prospect of significant tariffs on Mexico on the table, Rockwell is taking another body-blow.I do believe that Rockwell management is underestimating the risk of a broader slowdown in industrial end-markets, even though I do basically agree with its more bullish medium-to-long-term outlook. With a real risk of a “lower-for-longer” end-market demand situation and now potential pressures from new tariffs, I’m inclined to keep waiting even though Rockwell shares now trade below my estimate of fair value.President Trump surprised the markets with an announcement late on May 30 that he was ordering new tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico starting on June 10. While the tariff will initially be 5%, he has threatened stepwise increases up to 25% by October if the Mexican government doesn’t take unspecified steps regarding the so-called “migration crisis”.This is potentially a serious issue for Rockwell, as about 15% of Rockwell’s plants and 30% of its manufacturing square footage are located in Mexico. Making matters worse, the strongest near-term opportunities Rockwell management sees, motor controls, drives, connectors, and so on, are most likely the items being manufactured in Mexico.How much this will impact Rockwell relative to other peers/rivals is hard to say. Disclosure policies vary wildly across the industrial space; I know that Rockwell and Regal Beloit (RBC) (a manufacturer of motors used in automation) have significant manufacturing footprints in Mexico, but other companies have been much less forthcoming about their exposure – something I believe will likely change quite soon as analysts and investors flood the sector with calls to assess exposures and risks.I know that ABB (ABB) has six locations in Mexico, and I know at least some of the sites are manufacturing sites, but I don’t know the mix of manufacturing sites and sales/support offices. Likewise Fanuc (OTCPK:FANUY) and KUKA have presences in Mexico to support its automotive robotics customers. Honeywell (HON) has 15 manufacturing plants in Mexico, and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) likewise has multiple facilities, but it is difficult to get a full picture of what is manufactured where, not to mention the markets to which it exports what it manufactures in Mexico.My overall sense is that Rockwell is more exposed to Mexico than its peers, as I would estimate that its rivals likely have around 10% of their manufacturing floorspace in Mexico. Of course, that doesn’t capture what is manufactured there, but I nevertheless do see some risk to Rockwell’s margins, and greater risk than for its peers, if the full 25% tariffs end up going through.The recent EPG Conference was another opportunity for the major players among the multi-industrials to update the Street on where things stand. On the whole, I wouldn’t say there were many surprises coming out of the EPG Conference this year (not a lot would be expected to have changed since the late April reporting cycle), but I feel like there was an incrementally more cautious tone from many participants regarding end-market conditions across the industrial landscape.For its part, Rockwell reiterated that it expects the near-term to be challenging for its large auto business (and that certainly won’t be helped by these new tariffs against Mexico), but it still sees attractive longer-term opportunities from EV and hybrid launches as companies tool up and automate.Management also said that they see “no signs” of auto weakness spreading into other industrial areas, and this is where I’ll disagree. Multiple companies, including Emerson (EMR), nVent (NVT), and Parker Hannifin (PH) talked about broader weakness, project push-outs, and ongoing destocking that could last through, and perhaps past, the second quarter. I’d also note that about two-thirds of Rockwell’s business is book-and-ship within the same quarter, so I think you could argue their insight is perhaps more limited than some of its peers with longer order-to-ship cycles.Although I see more near-term risk for Rockwell than many analysts (and Rockwell management), I think it’s important to mention the difference between near-term risk and longer-term opportunity. Rockwell remains a major player in U.S. discrete automation (alongside Siemens) and the company has been working hard to extend its global footprint (the relationship with PTC (PTC) has already started to help) and expand into hybrid and process automation.Along those lines, I’m still looking for 4% to 5% long-term growth in revenue and FCF, even if the near-term growth opportunities prove to be more limited as the cycle rolls over.I’ve lowered the lower end of my fair value range (from $164 to $157), but Rockwell shares are already below that, and that is not a very common occurrence. My biggest hesitation in diving in today is the risk of further downgrades to earnings expectations for CY 2019 and 2020, a generally expensive stock market, and more risk to the macro-economic outlook (slowing growth, tariffs/trade disputes, etc.). I don’t want to too cute about trying to bottom-tick what I believe is a very well-run and well-placed long-term winner in automation, but I still believe there could be opportunities to buy in at a lower price and I may “split the difference” by establishing a partial position in the near future and looking to add if the price declines further."
4257246,24361,2019-04-26T15:41:01-04:00,"There were signs of weakening discrete automation demand prior to the earnings release, but Rockwell still surprised to the downside with a 3% revenue miss.The auto end-market has gotten very weak, and I believe caution is warranted regarding the broader industrial sector.If industrial stocks are in fact still pricing in too much growth for 2019, there will likely be a better chance to buy Rockwell later this year.","The last three months haven’t been particularly kind to Rockwell (ROK), as the share price of what is usually a darling among industrials has lagged the broader industrial sector, and automation peers like Yaskawa (OTCPK:YASKY), Fanuc (OTCPK:FANUY), Nidec (OTCPK:NJDCY), Emerson (EMR), Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY), and even ABB (ABB). To be fair, it was the significant slide after second quarter earnings on Thursday that did the damage, though the shares had still been lagging most automation companies (except ABB) and were only slightly better than the average industrial before the report.Like 3M (MMM), Sandvik (OTCPK:SDVKY), SKF (OTCPK:SKFRY), Illinois Tool Works (ITW), and the Japanese automation companies, weakness in autos is a major contributor to Rockwell’s present weakness, but I took management’s guidance and comments as reflective of some potential warnings about spreading weakness in other industrial end-markets – something that I’ve been expecting as this year rolls on. Rockwell shares are now in a tough situation valuation-wise; they’re not so clearly undervalued that I’m inclined to say “just buy and wait for the cycle to reverse), but the valuation is getting more reasonable and this is a stock to watch more carefully now.I haven’t had a chance to read through the blizzard of earnings releases from April 26, but my overall sense at this point is that there’s an emerging divergence among industrials, with companies like Honeywell (HON) standing out on the good side, but many others getting dragged down by the auto sector (and maybe a broader weakening trend). With these results, Rockwell goes into the “disappointing” bucket, though I’m a little surprised this weakness wasn’t better anticipated given the earlier releases from ABB and Schneider.Revenue rose a little less than 4% on an organic basis, but still came in about 3% below expectations. Both segments were weaker than expected, but moreso in the Architecture & Software (A&S) segment, which grew a little more than 1% as double-digit growth in process and ISCS was dragged down by 2% contraction in Logix (the company’s PLC business). In the Control Products and Solutions business, revenue grew a little less than 6% and the book-to-bill stayed firmly position (1.09x vs. 1.12x in the prior quarter).Gross margin ticked up slightly this quarter, but operating income barely budged and segment-level profits grew less than 3%. Segment profitability was about 2% lower than expected, with A&S profits down more than 3% (30bp of margin contraction) and CP&S up almost 13% (140bp of margin expansion).Although neither company really quantified it, both Rockwell and PTC (PTC) affirmed that their partnership is having positive effects on their business.In broad strokes, the weaker discrete automation and stronger process automation results at Rockwell are very consistent with the reports from ABB, Schneider and others. Discrete automation has definitely slowed, pressured by significant headwinds in the auto and electronics sectors, as these two end-markets account for more than 60% of discrete automation spending in some categories. For Rockwell’s part, the company said that auto sales were down a whopping 20%, and it doesn’t look like there’s any real momentum in the business, though the comps will be getting easier.Process industries are healthier though, and Rockwell noted strength in mining (echoing Sandvik, ABB, and others) and oil/gas. Life science, which is more of a hybrid automation market, also remains quite strong, which is no real surprise given the recent report from Danaher (DHR).As far as the outlook, management did trim off the high end of its growth expectations, adjusting its full year revenue growth forecast to 3.7%-5.3% from 3.7%-6.7%. Management also said it saw broad softness in the U.S. that recovered into the end of the quarter. Even so, U.S. sales were weaker for Rockwell than companies like Honeywell and Dover (DOV) had been indicating, and this is another sign of that bifurcation I mentioned before. Management sounded rather cautious about the prospect of further acceleration for the remainder of the year, and I’m still concerned that weakness is starting to spread into other short-cycle industrial end-markets (typically lumped together as “general industrial”). That said, this has been my position for a little while now, so I’m aware of the risk of confirmation bias and seeing/focusing on data points that support my position.Rockwell clearly is not looking to stand pat. Last year saw the company forge an alliance with PTC to add more software capabilities, and more recently the company acquired Emulate3D to further build its software capabilities.Then in February the company announced the creation of Sensia – a joint venture with Schlumberger (SLB) that looks to be a digital oilfield automation solutions provider. Schlumberger will be contributing about 100 engineers to this effort, and the business will skew more heavily toward the North American E&P market. This move is broadly consistent with Rockwell’s efforts to expand further into hybrid and process automation markets, even if it is late in the E&P capex cycle for such a move.This was not a great quarter for Rockwell, but the company still outperformed the majority of its automation peers (ABB being the odd exception). Although there are some valid long-term concerns about how the “democratization” of software could impact the automation space, I think Rockwell has a strong suite of controls, motion control products, and software to address the evolving automation needs of customers across a range of markets.My biggest concern now is how much worse conditions in the U.S. will get through the remainder of 2019 and into the first half of 2020. I’m still comparatively bearish on this point, so I am worried that Rockwell could see headwinds building outside of the already-weak auto market.Longer term, I still see Rockwell as a mid-single-digit grower on the top line and a company capable of generating high teens FCF margins. Discounting the cash flows back, I think the shares are priced for a mid-to-high single-digit annualized return, which is below my typical hurdle rate. Margin/return-driven EV/EBITDA is more forgiving, but still not at an “obvious buy” point.I don’t expect Rockwell to ever get shockingly cheap; it still enjoys far too much support and benefit of the doubt on the Street for that. Still, given my belief that the rally in industrial stocks has gone too far, I think there could be a chance to add shares at a better valuation. Today’s price looks more like a “close but not quite” situation to me, but it’s definitely prominent on my watchlist."
4240099,50452,2019-02-12T04:36:38-05:00,"Rockwell Automation designs and manufactures industrial automotive components and solutions that advance production technology in various markets.The company has expanded margins, FCF conversion, and CROCI throughout the past decade. This has fueled strong dividend growth.The company is poised to grow over the coming years, but are presently overvalued as an industrial in an economic up cycle.","The constantly expanding need for resources by society leads us to seek improvements in our production capabilities and efficiencies. Whether we are talking about food, consumer products, infrastructure or energy, industrial companies are constantly searching for a way to produce more output at a lesser cost of resources. This constant thirst for innovation is what makes the industrial sector (or more specifically, the companies that drive innovation in the sector) such a hotbed of investment activity.One great example, is Rockwell Automation (ROK), whose industrial automation solutions offer manufacturers and other producers a means to improve production, efficiency, and safety. As factors modernize, and emerging economies develop, the trend of making production increasingly technologically sophisticated plays into the hand of companies such as Rockwell Automation.Rockwell's strong fundamentals and growth prospects provide a strong foundation for a long-term bullish investment outlook. However, Rockwell Automation's industrial-centric business model means that investors need to pay attention to the economic climate when evaluating a potential investment.Rockwell Automation designs, produces, and sells industrial automation solutions into various end markets. The company operates through two segments. The Architecture & Software segment produces components and software that introduce communication to industrial processes. The Control Products & Solutions segment includes the company's industrial and motor controls products. The company generates more than $6 billion in annual revenues, and does business on a global scale.Source: Rockwell Automation, Inc.Source: YChartsBeing an industrial company, Rockwell is very sensitive to the economic cycle. In other words, the business will fluctuate depending on economic conditions. During ""down cycles,"" companies won't invest as heavily into factory expansion and upgrades. Over the past decade, sales have grown at an approximate CAGR of 4%, while earnings per share have grown at 8% on an adjusted basis. While we would like to see more growth, Rockwell Automation is able to generate a lot of resources from its revenues.To quantify this, we begin by reviewing Rockwell's profitability. We track this using operating margin, and the FCF conversion rate (ratio of FCF to revenue). Margin has expanded since the recession a decade ago. We can see that margin will correct during slowdowns such as 2016, but Rockwell's ability to more than triple operating margin within 10 years is impressive. Meanwhile, the company has seen similar success in converting revenue into free cash flow. The current rate of 17.62% is comfortably above our 10% benchmark, making Rockwell Automation a solid cash-generating business.Source: YChartsIt is important to note that much of the past decade has been a period of economic recovery, so long-term investors will want to see how well the company can maintain profitability when the next down cycle inevitably comes.Next, we will review Rockwell's cash rate of return on invested capital (CROCI). This is a very important metric because it measures two critical traits of a company. It measures how efficient management is at deploying the resources of a business from a cash perspective. It is also a baseline indicator of the strength of a company's competitive ""moat.""Source: YChartsThe company has consistently posted a strong CROCI (we look at 13% as a benchmark), and has been able to grow that percentage over time. The company has invested in numerous acquisitions over the years, as well as investing $1 billion into a strategic partnership with PTC (PTC) in 2018. When a company is active in M&A and increases CROCI, it signals that value is being created by the M&A process. The current CROCI of 34% is above historical norms, so it should be monitored in the quarters to come to see if this is sustained, and to what degree.The last area of review before moving on is the balance sheet. A company that over-borrows is vulnerable to rising interest rates, or a cash flow squeeze if the business faces an unexpected downturn.Source: YChartsRockwell is currently carrying $632 million in cash against $1.86 billion in total debt. The leverage ratio of 1.23X EBITDA is comfortably below our ""warning sign"" threshold of 2.5X, and signals that Rockwell is on sound financial footing.Rockwell Automation is building up its reputation as a dividend growth stock. The company has raised its dividend payout each of the past nine years. The dividend is paid out every quarter, and totals an annual sum of $3.88 to shareholders. The current yield of 2.29% is solid, but modest. It likely won't sway income-focused investors who can get a 2.66% yield from 10-year US treasuries.Source: YChartsThe dividend has grown at a rapid pace. Over the past 10 years, the payout has grown at a robust 12.1%. This growth rate has been pretty consistent throughout the decade. In fact, 2018 saw two increases of 10.2% and 5.4% respectively - signaling continued momentum for growth. Despite this, the dividend only consumes about 39% of cash flow. Investors can expect continued dividend growth at previous rates as long as the operating environment remains generous. When the industrial sector enters a down cycle, the business will pull in spending to weather that financial storm, which will include the dividend payout of course.Rockwell is set up nicely for steady growth for years to come. There are some inherent aspects of the business that make this possible. Brand strength is present when it comes to industrial automation. Smart systems and components such as a PLC are programmed and operate uniquely compared to competitors. It is difficult to switch, so when systems are upgraded, it is very common for specifications to just call for the current iteration of whatever brand is used on the old equipment - it's typically what the factory staff is comfortable with.Source: Automation PrimerThis is great news for Rockwell, who owns a large market share within the North American Markets. On the other hand, this works against Rockwell Automation in certain international markets where their share isn't as strong (although respectable).Source: Automation PrimerRockwell Automation's strong spec position in the market also enables it to integrate with other providers to further spread its brand. For example, the company's recent partnership with PTC allows for Rockwell to expand its offerings by piggybacking onto PTC with its portfolio of solutions. This plays into the trend of factories embracing technology such as stronger automation, data collection, and connectivity.Source: Rockwell Automation, Inc.As the global industrial scene matures over the years, there is near endless opportunity for Rockwell Automation. Modernized factories will need upgrades as the years pass, and applications in emerging markets will seek upgrades as they strive to keep up with/meet standards.We are bullish on the long-term trajectory of the business based on these growth levers. The largest threat to Rockwell Automation remains macroeconomic factors. The business will be negatively impacted by any industrial slowdown. As an industrial, the best time to buy stock is during these downturns.The largely positive economic environment of the past decade has resulted in a great run for shares of Rockwell Automation. They have appreciated more than 600%, easily besting the indexes over that time frame.Source: YChartsTrading at more than $169 per share, the stock is currently at the midpoint of its 52-week range. Analysts are currently expecting FY2019 earnings per share to come in at about $9.02. This places shares at an earnings multiple of 18.77X. This is a slight discount to the stock's 10-year median earnings multiple of 19.59X.Another way of looking at valuation is on the basis of free cash flow. When we measure the yield on cash flow, Rockwell Automation has approached an 8% yield on FCF during each of the past two minor downturns, while yield jumped to 16% during the major recession a decade ago. The recession was uncommonly severe, so we view an 8% yield as a more appropriate buying signal.Source: YChartsAt $169 per share, the current economic environment (a prolonged up cycle) has us cautious towards industrials as a whole. Based on free cash flow yield, an 8% yield would result in a share price of about $90, but it would take a recessionary environment to push shares that low. If we scale back to an earnings multiple of 15X from 2019 expectations, it would result in a target price of $135. While it may not represent a floor in a recessionary market, we feel that this price level would provide a margin of safety with adequate long-term upside in most market scenarios.A high quality industrial is a fine addition to any long-term portfolio. The need for industry, and the cycle of innovation results in continued opportunity over the years as industry modernizes on a global scale. Rockwell Automation's strong fundamentals, increasing efficiency, and strong spec position combine to form a bullish long-term investment outlook. Investors should keep Rockwell Automation on a watch list for the next recessionary market event.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article.Author Disclaimer: Wealth Insights is an investor and investment author.

4194090,24361,2018-08-02T17:44:54-04:00,"Rockwell redeemed a weak fiscal second quarter with a much stronger third quarter organic revenue growth rate, though many automation peers did even better.Rockwell's pivot towards software and data services is a sound long-term strategic move, but near-term concerns about slowing end-market growth could weigh on the shares.Rockwell shares aren't cheap enough to be a clear-cut buy, but it's a good candidate for a watch list and a buy-the-dip opportunity if cyclical concerns re-emerge later this year.","Even though I understand the demands of the world in which they work, sell-side analysts still amuse me from time to time (and I used to be one). When Rockwell Automation's (ROK) fiscal second quarter came up light on growth, you could hear the wails of anguish and the rending of garments that the cycle was doomed to roll over and crush Rockwell's multiple with it. Now Rockwell posts a stronger than expected fiscal third quarter and it's all party hats and conga lines. As I said, sell-siders serve a client base (institutional investors) where ""long-term"" sometimes seems to mean two quarters, but it does help explain at least some of the volatility in the share price.For my part, I'm still a little concerned about the cycle. Many industrial CEOs have gone on record saying they think there's another 12 months or more left in this expansion, but I do think the pace is likely to slow and historically that's been a hard environment for Rockwell's share price performance. I do still like this company, and I like its partnership with PTC (PTC) and growing focus on software and services within automation. But ""automation"" is not a growth panacea and I have some concerns about a high-multiple stock in a possibly slowing sector that could see multiple reversion to the mean.After a disappointing fiscal second quarter (the first quarter of the calendar year), Rockwell snapped back with a strong set of results that exceeded expectations - by roughly $0.10/share at the segment operating profit line.Revenue rose a little less than 6% in organic terms, making Rockwell a good-but-not-great performer this quarter. Growth was led by the higher-end Architecture and Software business, where 10% growth in Logix, 8% growth in process automation (DCS and the like), and double-digit growth in Info Solutions and Connected Services drove nearly 7% organic growth. By comparison, ABB's (ABB) Industrial Automation business was flat. Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY) saw 11% growth in its automation business in the second quarter, Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) reported 13% growth in its ""Digital Factory"" business in the second quarter.In the Control Products and Solutions business, revenue grew 5% on an organic basis. That stacks up less impressively to ABB's 8% growth in Robotics and Motion and Yaskawa's (OTCPK:YASKY) motion control business growth of 10%, but these segment-level comparisons are always at least a little imperfect. All told, I'd say that Rockwell had an okay quarter but not necessarily an exceptional performance compared to other discrete and hybrid automation peers.Margin performance was pretty strong. Gross margin improved by about 130bp on an adjusted basis, while segment-level profits rose 14% and saw 140bp of margin improvement. Stronger growth in the higher-margin A&S business certainly helped; A&S profits rose 17%, beating expectations by almost 10% and seeing margins improve more than two points to 30%. CP&S profits rose 8%, missing expectations by a few percentage points as margin improved 60bp to just under 16%.Where everybody's at in the cycle, and where the cycle itself is at, remains one of the predominant questions for the industrial/multi-industrial group. Sentiment has certainly improved from the first (calendar) quarter, where there were more widespread fears that multiple major segments were rolling over and about to start contracting.Between presentations at the May EPG Conference and second quarter earnings commentaries, most industrials, including peers/comps of Rockwell like ABB, Honeywell (HON), Emerson (EMR), Schneider, Siemens, and Yaskawa sound a little more optimistic. There are some weak spots, but ""general industrial"" remains relatively healthy and process industries continue to recover, while construction activity remains healthy.For Rockwell's part, management noted a sharp drop (down 10%) in its auto business but expects reacceleration next quarter and into fiscal 2019. The auto sector is one of the most confusing and confounding right now - Yaskawa and ABB did fine, but Fanuc (OTCPK:FANUY) did not and there were signs of weakness in other auto equipment areas. On the other hand, Rockwell was upbeat on electronics (another area of widespread concern), reporting double-digit growth in its semiconductor business at a time when Fanuc and Yaskawa are both seeing weakness and Atlas Copco (OTCPK:ATLKY), VAT Group (OTCPK:VACNY), and Pfeiffer (OTC:PFFVF) have all noted significant near-term slowdowns in equipment demand/spending.For whatever they're worth, here are my thoughts. First, there are ample signs that ""general industrial"" demand is strong - welding companies are doing well, compressor companies (including Atlas) are doing well, and MRO demand is strong. Auto is likely seeing slowing overall capex equipment investment, but with a lot of company-to-company variability based on specific clients and equipment. Oil and gas and mining are definitely recovering, and there's healthy ongoing demand in consumer-serving industries like food/beverage and biopharma. Electronics is going to see a cyclical decline, but so far it sounds like it will be a shorter and less severe decline than past cycles.While most of the area where Rockwell earns its money is doing okay, I'm still a little cautious. The U.S. PMI for June was 60.2 - a level that hasn't been matched or exceeded too often in the last 40 years, and July saw a slowdown to 58.1. Rockwell shares usually perform better in the earlier phase of the cycle, and even though the PMI could certainly stay above 50 for a while, I do worry about the shares underperforming as growth starts to slow (it has happened more than once in the company's history).Longer term, I still expect healthy mid-single-digit revenue growth and high-single-digit FCF growth. I like Rockwell's shift toward software and recurring revenue, and I think there's a significant long-term opportunity in augmenting Rockwell's strong controls business with more software and software-like service offerings. Still, while I like automation and the long-term potential of increased ""digitalization"" of factories, it's not going to fundamentally alter the growth opportunities for Rockwell. In other words, don't go crazy with the long-term growth assumptions/expectations.Looking at both discounted cash flow and EV/EBITDA, Rockwell is still more expensive than I'd like for a new position, though I do think you could reasonably expect high-single-digit returns from this point. I do still have worries that the entire sector will continue to re-rate lower (meaning lower average forward valuation multiples) as growth comps become more challenging. Rockwell is still a preferred idea for buy-the-dip opportunities, but I'd be careful about chasing the shares unless you have a fundamentally more bullish view on this part of the economic cycle.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4253018,69675,2019-04-05T13:44:32-04:00,"The other day, the management teams at General Electric and Rockwell Automation announced plans to have the two firms work together on multiple issues.This may seem like a small move, but it's the exact opposite.With similar interests and areas of focus, both firms are likely to help one another realize value moving forward.","Late last month, the management team at General Electric (GE) announced that it had struck up an agreement whereby it will be working more intimately with Rockwell Automation (ROK) in an attempt to focus on a variety of things related to the industrial conglomerate's Healthcare segment. At first glance, this arrangement may appear to be just a run-of-the-mill endeavor by the two firms in some narrow field, but the implications for their joint activities should not be understated. Given the experiences and expertise of each firm, this could be the start of a significant, value-add marriage between the two businesses that can add real value to shareholders in the long run.In a prior article, I wrote about, among other things, some of the single-use technologies being developed by the Healthcare segment of General Electric. These activities, among other things, fall under the Life Sciences division of the conglomerate's segment and, last year, accounted for around $4.9 billion of the segment's $19.8 billion in revenue. This was up from the $4.6 billion in sales generated in 2017 of the segment's $19 billion. By any measure here, this is a large piece of General Electric's pie, and it's safe to say that, even if Life Sciences itself were a standalone enterprise, it would be a company worth several billion dollars.Life Sciences alone, according to the conglomerate, should do quite well over the next several years, with bioprocessing leading the way. That market, in particular, should see sales expand at a rate that is in the high-single-digits. Some of this growth will occur in the United States, but as I stated in my aforementioned article on those operations, the real upside will come from China. Asia, as a whole, was responsible for $5.2 billion worth of Healthcare's revenue last year, and China's government, with the population continuing to age, is investing heavily in this space and those similar to it. This catalyst was one of the reasons behind why General Electric elected, last year, to partner up with Wego Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. in an effort to capitalize on its single-use consumable film called Fortem that it developed with the help of Sealed Air Corp. (SEE).On General Electric's side, there is more, of course, than just Fortem. Life Sciences range from it to the firm's Xcellerex stirred-tank bioreactors to its MabSelect PrismA chromatography resin, and far more. In particular, the company seems dedicated to its FlexFactory platform.According to the press release covering its partnership with Rockwell, General Electric stated that it is working with Rockwell at least in part because of their experience with single-use technologies, but it covers so much more than just that. In the press release, the company said that the scope of this arrangement will cover, ""automation, IT and single-use solution expertise to build bioprocessing operations for the digital age"".For investors who are familiar with Rockwell, this should be ring of the perfect marriage between the two firms. As I have written about before, General Electric has extensive operations covering digital innovation, particularly under the focus of IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things). This appears to fit well with Rockwell's own operations, which last year won the company the status of IoT Company of the Year.*Taken from Rockwell AutomationAt the corporate level, Rockwell has made very clear that its long-term strategy is to build up what it calls The Connected Enterprise. In the simplest terms, this means to make sure the business becomes a global provider of ""innovative industrial automation and information software products, solutions, and services"". To achieve this goal, not only has Rockwell focus on building up its own systems, it has also worked diligently to partner up with like-minded firms.*Taken from Rockwell AutomationFor instance, the company currently owns 53% of a joint venture called Sensia, with Schlumberger (SLB) owning the rest that seeks to create a robust, fully-integrated automation services provider for the oil and gas industry. Expected to launch in the summer of this year, Sensia will generate revenue, initially, of $400 million per year, have around 1,000 employees, and will essentially bring IIoT services through connected devices to the oil field. Another partnership is Rockwell's strategic alliance to sell its own IoT software under the InnovationSuite brand name.These actions and more mirror very closely General Electric's own professed objective aimed at transforming the struggling industrial giant into an IoT service and platform provider. Not only that, though, but unlike General Electric, which has seen some of its business segments suffer in recent years, Rockwell has hit no such slump. Between 2016 and 2018, revenue at the firm grew 13.4% from $5.88 billion to $6.67 billion, while pre-tax profits expanded by 41.1% from $943.1 million to $1.33 billion, and while operating cash flow grew a similar 37.2% from $947.3 million to $1.30 billion.At first glance, this move by General Electric and Rockwell may not look all that impressive, but when you dig down deep, the picture suggests some real upside could be captured if all goes well. Rockwell and General Electric have similar operations, obviously-similar objectives, and while General Electric is larger and has the kind of scale Rockwell couldn't have, the latter carries with it a continued history of fundamental improvements that the former hasn't had in some respects because of larger operational troubles. By combining their strengths, not only in Life Sciences and single-use technologies, but in all things related first to Healthcare, but then later, perhaps, to their objectives of becoming IIoT firms, the two can create synergies that would, keeping all else the same, open a pathway of prosperity for their respective shareholders long-term."
4226192,24361,2018-12-04T12:45:10-05:00,"Rockwell remains a high-quality play on automation, but the company's growth isn't dramatically better than its peers and several end-markets could see slower growth in 2019/2020.The partnership with PTC is already paying some dividends for Rockwell and allowing the company to better leverage the data generated/handled by its control systems.Rockwell shares are a tougher call with ISM slowing and more concerns about the healthy of the industrial cycle.","Looking into 2019, Rockwell Automation (ROK) seems to be in familiar territory – nobody’s really questioning the operational excellence of this leader in discrete automation, but there are plenty of concerns about end-market health, where industrials sit in the cycle, and whether Rockwell is as well-positioned for the next phase of automation as it was for the last.I typically shoot for double-digit returns when I invest, and Rockwell doesn’t seem priced to deliver that unless you think long-term FCF growth can reach that grey area between mid-single-digits and high single-digits – a level of performance that’s not impossible, but certainly not conservative to expect. Although I’m tempted to call today’s potential returns “good enough” for a stock that seldom gets all that cheap unless/until industrial stocks really go fan-ward, I do believe there could be another round of angst and stock weakness early in 2019 that could be an opportunity to pick up high-quality industrials like Rockwell.Rockwell did miss expectations in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter (calendar third quarter), and guidance wasn’t perfect, but I can’t fairly call it a bad performance. Organic revenue growth of over 7% compared reasonably well to the peer group in which ABB (ABB) saw 7% and 3% growth in its automation businesses, Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY) saw a little less than 7%, Emerson (EMR) saw 9%, and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) saw 13% and 5% growth.Logix was once again a strong positive driver, with revenue up 7%, while the process business was up 11%. Margins improved by about two points in the Architecture and Software business (on an adjusted basis), with a smaller sub-1% improvement in the Control Products & Solutions business.Rockwell management’s rundown of its end-market commentary was interesting. The 10% decline in the auto business definitely pinches (it’s one of the largest contributors at more than 10% of sales), but weaker auto has been a theme in the automation sector for some time now. I was quite surprised at the double-digit growth in the semiconductor market, but this speaks both to mix and to the fact that spending is not monolithic (companies may not be spending on tools, but they’re still spending to upgrade/improve factories). Strength in mining and life sciences was less surprising, but the high single-digit growth in food/beverage was nice to see, while the flat performance in oil/gas was a little more concerning and maybe not so surprising in the context of the performance at Honeywell (HON) and ABB.Where the cycle is going from here is a major unknown. There are some clear signs that growth and momentum have slowed, with ISM tracking down yoy and mom in November and distributors like Fastenal (FAST) reporting slower sales growth. Although guidance from industrial companies was largely constructive following third quarter results, there have been a few names like 3M (MMM) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW) that have worried the Street.Most likely, this is a pause/pullback within a generally healthy ongoing cycle. The catch is that Rockwell has historically done well early in recovery/expansion cycles and slowing/falling ISM is usually not correlated with good stock performance. While orders were healthy in the third quarter, management here and some peers (including Emerson and ABB) sounded a bit more cautious than before. With that, it may well be the case that 2019 and 2020 see weaker growth (without going negative) ahead of a rejuvenated cycle.Between rejecting Emerson’s acquisition bid and acquiring part of PTC (PTC), there’s been no shortage of debate on Rockwell’s positioning for the future of industrial automation. On its own, Rockwell has rather adroitly maneuvered from a strong position in discrete automation (where it has about 20% share in the U.S., or about 50% more than #2 Siemens) into a healthy and growing presence in hybrid automation. Rockwell has also at least partly addressed the concerns about its digital/software positioning with that PTC alliance.Even so, questions remain. I’ve seen multiple sell-siders argue that PTC is actually getting the better end of the Rockwell-PTC deal … to which I respond with “so what?” Maybe PTC will benefit more, but Rockwell will still benefit and I think Rockwell’s ability to drive a harder bargain with PTC had to have been constrained by the knowledge that PTC had other options. What’s more, I see the PTC partnership has helping “paper over” years of what you could argue was underinvestment in important areas like software – areas that Siemens, Schneider, and Hexagon have addressed with acquisitions and internal development.As highlighted at the recent Automation Fair, PTC’s software capabilities complement Rockwell’s controls quite well, adding data connectivity, modeling, and augmented reality capabilities that Rockwell simply didn’t have before. Rockwell’s devices handle large amounts of data and now the company can offer the software tools to do something with them, even if it has to share the benefits with PTC. Rockwell has recently won business with Ford (F) and Schlumberger (SLB) largely because of the PTC capabilities, and I don’t think those will be the only wins.There weren’t enough surprises in the fourth quarter release to change my basic modeling assumptions all that much, and I continue to believe that Rockwell has attractive long-term growth opportunities in discrete and hybrid automation. I’m still expecting healthy mid-single-digit long-term revenue growth and further FCF margin leverage into the high teens. While the long-term FCF growth rate does decline relative to my last update, that’s only because the base year changed and FY 2018 was a much stronger year for FCF generation than the prior base year.Discounting back the cash flows I model, I think Rockwell is priced for high single-digit annualized returns from here – not as high as I’d like, but not bad on a relative basis for high-quality industrials. Much as I’d like to buy into Rockwell with a double-digit annualized expected return, those opportunities don’t come often. I’d also note that Rockwell isn’t particularly cheap on an EV/EBITDA basis; the company’s strong margins and ROIC argue for a mid-teens multiple, but the market is already there.As I’ve said multiple times in the past, Rockwell is a good name to consider on cyclical dips. Whether we get one in 2019/2020 or not remains an open question, but as much as I like Rockwell, I’m reluctant to chase the shares when multiple end-markets seem to be slowing (even if Rockwell’s business from those markets hasn’t yet shown that slowdown). Long term, I believe this is a good name to own for its leverage to ongoing automation, but I’d advice patience if you don’t already own it.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4309039,24823,2019-11-25T14:39:06-05:00,Rockwell changes direction with earnings breakout.Catches the shorts in a squeeze that helps to pop price.Good fundamental and technical signals.Time to take a new look at the fundamentals.,"Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) has finished a long period of testing the bottom at $146 and is changing character by breaking out from an established trading range. Good earnings and guidance triggered this price breakout. However, the pop in price was inflated by a short squeeze and now the market determining a more efficient price based on the good earnings news. An analyst has raised the 12-month target to $208 and that is bullish. The 50-day moving average has crossed above the 200-day moving average in a bullish move called the ""golden cross."" This breakout also has a bullish ""cup and handle"" pattern.Our unique fundamental/technical score has improved from a Sell grade to a Hold grade of 64 out of 100 identifying this change in character for ROK. Below is a copy of our live, public chart available on StockCharts. Now let's look at the fundamentals to determine whether this breakout in price is justified or whether it is just a short squeeze pop that will be reversed once the shorts are finished buying.FinViz shows us the fundamental metrics at a glance as well as analyst upgrades, targets and the news on earnings and guidance. Company guidance is for earnings to improve from $5.83 to $8.48-8.88. Analysts are raising their targets, and that's bullish.However, price is already trading near these new, 12-month targets and that's bearish. The good news may already be fully priced in and price could consolidate here until targets move higher. The forecasted PE compared to five-year growth estimates is too rich. So while the earnings growth is good, the company revenue guidance of 2-5% for next year is much too low compared to a forecasted PE of 22. This explains why price trading near 12-month targets is a warning that price may have moved too high on this recent pop. If you use forecasted earnings of $9 and apply a generous PE of 20, you come up with a target of only $180. The consensus analyst target is only $183.In any case, portfolio managers will wait for weakness to buy and price is already retracing the jump after earnings. The price gap was probably inflated by stop loss buying by the shorts. Now that the shorts are covered, it is not surprising to see price retreating. The dividend yield has dropped to 2.1% and dividend players may be cashing in and moving on to yields above 3%. There are many of these in our Dividend model portfolio.On the chart below, you can see all the signals moving up to a peak. Profit taking is pushing price down, filling the gap up. Support is around $190 and the 20-day moving average. If it completely fills the gap up, then price could drop to $180. That would make it an attractive buy on weakness, if you accept the $208 target."
4140421,24361,2018-01-26T09:09:40-05:00,"Rockwell's earnings saw the impact of slower demand in its important consumer and auto end-markets, and management's revenue growth guidance was softer than the bulls wanted to see.Rockwell looks well-placed for the oncoming converge of hardware and software on the factory floor, but additional M&A to augment its offerings is more likely than not.ROK's shares seldom trade at attractive values when its end-markets are healthy and today is no exception.","In turning down a rather rich bid from Emerson (EMR), Rockwell (ROK) certainly signaled that the board has a lot of confidence about where this leading automation player is heading. Although Rockwell isn't, and never has tried to be, ""all things to all customers"", the company's strong presence in process and hybrid automation and its emerging industrial IoT platform doesn't make that confidence completely unfounded.As is so often the case with Rockwell, valuation continues to be my primary concern. While there are some valuation approaches that suggest Rockwell's valuation isn't excessive, it's not a bargain either, even if Emerson was willing to pay more than today's price to own the company.I can't call Rockwell's fiscal first quarter earnings report poor, but the Street was certainly hoping for a stronger beat-and-raise that wasn't driven primarily by the lower tax rate.Revenue rose a little more than 5% on a core basis, which is actually the lowest yoy core growth in a few quarters. Architecture and Software saw almost 5% growth, with Logix up 6%, while Control Products and Solutions saw almost 6% growth (with Process up 12%). Given that management noted flat growth in its consumer product end-markets and mid-single-digit declines in auto, the revenue deceleration makes a little more sense; Rockwell is uncommonly leveraged toward consumer and auto within automation and not as leveraged to industries that are recovering faster now like energy and chemicals.Gross margin improved by almost a point while segment operating profit grew by 12%. Both segments outperformed average sell-side estimates, with A&S up 8% (a small beat) and CP&S up 21% (a double-digit beat).Guidance was not as strong as hoped, particularly at the top line, as it doesn't seem as though consumer and auto customers are going to be significantly increasing their spending after the tax cut. Mind you, 5%-ish organic growth is not terrible, but Rockwell is a pretty consummate high-expectations stock.Rockwell has never been particularly acquisitive, often preferring to form lasting partnerships rather than seeking M&A targets. Management has been signaling its intention to do more M&A, though, so with the opportunity to repatriate meaningful cash, such a move could come sooner rather than later.As for what Rockwell might buy, likely bets would seem to be companies that fit into the broad categories of ""information solutions"" and process automation - mostly likely companies that would further facilitate Rockwell's Connected Enterprise industrial IoT efforts. To that end, data analytics and AI could make sense, but I suspect the target(s) will not be household names. I've long wondered if Rockwell might not pursue a target in the sensor space, as that too would make sense within the Connected Enterprise concept.On the other side of M&A, Rockwell made it clear that it was not interested in selling itself to Emerson, and Emerson backed off. While Emerson bulls may take exception to this, I can understand why the board may not have been eager to sell to Emerson - while Emerson has taken some significant steps toward refocusing on automation, that company's execution track record does leave something to be desired. I don't really expect another bidder to emerge anytime soon - Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY) has long had an interest in Rockwell, and the combination would make sense, but I don't know how much more Schneider would offer. ABB (ABB) has also long been in the rumor mill for Rockwell, but I think a bid is much less likely now after the B&R deal.Rockwell should be well positioned for the next wave of industrial automation, as more companies embrace industrial IoT and the greater blending of software and hardware. With good positions in HMI, PLCs and software (at least in terms of control/management and analytics), Rockwell enjoys strong reputations in those areas that most companies say will be the focus of their automation spending in the next few years.Still, the world is changing around Rockwell. The company is very strong in PLCs, but it is well worth asking if PLCs will be as important in 10 years or whether this next phase will see more automation control move to the ""edge"". I'd also note that rivals like GE (GE), ABB, Schneider and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) have made large commitments to software and Rockwell is going to face some stiff competition. Then again, Rockwell has a lot of software engineers working for it and a clear vision for a closed-loop system of smart assets on the factory floor.While a lower tax rate does boost my long-term FCF growth rate, my basic modeling assumptions about Rockwell haven't changed all that much. I'm still looking for long-term revenue growth in the neighborhood of 5%, with free cash flow growth in the high single digits.Those estimates don't support a fair value above today's price, and that has been the case more often than not with Rockwell's shares. I do use other valuation methods to supplement DCF, and at least one of them suggests that Rockwell may not all that overvalued. This methodology uses ROE and earnings growth (I use NOPAT for earnings) to estimate a ""fair"" multiple to book value. By this methodology, my model assumptions drive a fair value of nearly $190. I don't really like this method, though, as it is highly sensitive to small changes in the assumptions (a 0.1% change in earnings growth rate estimate moves the fair value 3%).I wouldn't buy Rockwell here, but then I usually think Rockwell's shares are too pricey and I've missed out on some pretty solid gains over time. I will always keep an eye on this company and stock, though, as every once in a while it does get cheap enough to buy and those are good opportunities for patient investors.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4149267,95006,2018-02-22T03:23:10-05:00,"For the past two years, I have specialized in researching cyclical stocks.My research has mostly focused on finding the best way to profit from cyclical stocks near the bottom of the economic cycle.With the dramatic rise in prices of many cyclical stocks, I have been writing a series of articles examining how far these stocks could fall if there is a downcycle.Investors may be tempted to buy after the recent dip in the market, but I would be more patient.In addition to analyzing the stock, I also offer some alternative investment ideas as a way to eventually buy more Rockwell Automation stock at a lower price.","A few months ago, I wrote an article titled ""How Investors Could Have Easily Avoided Chicago Bridge & Iron's Sell-Off."" My basic thesis was that if investors would have looked back far enough in history, they would have known that Chicago Bridge & Iron (NYSE:CBI) was a highly cyclical stock and that they could expect sell-offs of the stock up to 80% to happen on occasion. The most pointed critique of the article came from investors who were sitting on gigantic losses in their CBI stock. Several of them noted that my article didn't do them a whole lot of good now, and they wondered where it had been a year earlier, before CBI's price had dropped.Even though I claim no ability to predict the top of any cyclical stock, I have been trying my best in a recent series of articles to examine some of these rapidly rising industrial stocks from a different point of view - a point of view that examines how far they might fall, rather than simply examining how far they might continue to rise. So far, I have written about Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Boeing (NYSE:BA), Cummins (NYSE:CMI), John Deere (NYSE:DE), 3M (NYSE:MMM), Northrop Grumman (NYSE:NOC), Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), General Dynamics (NYSE:GD), Eaton (NYSE:ETN), and a stock that I recently sold myself after a 90% gain, BorgWarner (NYSE:BWA). Now let's examine Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) to see what its historical cycles might be able to tell us about its next potential downcycle.There are several factors that determine whether I think a stock's downside potential is worth closely examining. One of the most important is whether the stock is trading near all-time highs that are significantly higher than previous all-time highs.ROK data by YChartsRockwell Automation is currently over triple the price it was before the 2008 bear market and approximately double the price since its last major price drawdown in 2011. So, on these measures, it looks like a good candidate for further examination.Next, I want to check its performance relative to the S&P 500 index. Specifically, what I'm looking for here is to see if there is recent outperformance that would suggest that, even compared to the wider market, Rockwell's price is unusually high.ROK Total Return Price data by YChartsThis chart shows that in the past two years, Rockwell has significantly outperformed the wider market, even though the market has been trending upwards and making new all-time highs.Next, let's take a look at F.A.S.T. Graphs and see how Rockwell Automation looks based on historical P/E ratios.Based on a 20-year average P/E ratio of 17.5, Rockwell's current blended P/E ratio of 25.9 seems quite high compared to historical averages. (Note how the black line closely trends with the blue line until recently. Also note that the last two times the black line rose significantly above the blue line were in 2006 and 2010, just before major sell-offs in the stock.)Taking all this into account, I think Rockwell Automation is worthy of further investigation in order to see what we might expect during a potential future downturn.Some of the key factors current Rockwell shareholders might want to consider are the speed at which the stock price could fall, how deep the plunge could be, and how long they might expect the stock to stay below the price at which it is today. Over the past 46 years, Rockwell Automation has experienced 7 sell-offs of 40% or more, as depicted in the table below:With the exception of the Great Recession, during which Rockwell fell nearly 80%, when the stock starts a downcycle it usually lands in the 40-50% range before rebounding. The stock has a wide range of time frames it can take until it reaches the bottom - anywhere from 6 months to 3 years - and its whole cycle generally lasts between 2 and 5 years.The goal of the risk/reward analysis is to try to compare Rockwell Automation's potential for price appreciation over the medium term (3-5 years) with its potential if the company were to have a down-cycle during that time period. My goal is to find the most optimistic, yet realistic, forecasts and compare them with the historically pessimistic, yet realistic, numbers I presented earlier. I have chosen to use the F.A.S.T. Graphs forecasting calculator in order to produce a consistent methodology, and one that is independent of my own psychological biases. Let's take a look:This uses Rockwell's very high 25.9 P/E and forecasts out its total potential gain about 2 1/2 years into the future (as far and as high as F.A.S.T. Graphs offers). Using these very optimistic numbers, we would have a total gain, including dividends, of $66.07. If we add that to the current stock price of $185.56, we get $251.63 per share. Now, let's say at that point we experience a bear market and have a 40% drawdown in the stock price. We would then have a stock price of $150.98 per share. If the decline took only 6 months, then we might optimistically think in 4-5 years' time we might be back to even on our investment. That's not particularly promising. And it is entirely possible that the decline could be deeper and the recovery takes longer than that.Cash is always an alternative, but I think that if one wants some insurance in the case the market rises faster or longer than expected, a 50/50 mix of the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio ETF (NYSEARCA:SPLV) and the Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA:VPU) are a good choice. The goal of this strategy is to use the ETFs to capture some of the potential upside in the market, while also protecting some of the downside. Here is how they performed against Rockwell during the recent mini-correction up until today:ROK data by YChartsAnd here is how they would have performed during Rockwell's 2011 correction:ROK Total Return Price data by YChartsEven though we wouldn't have rotated out of Rockwell exactly at the peak (this chart starts on January 1, 2011, a few months before for the peak for ROK), there was still an opportunity to buy the stock at a 30% discount later that year in 2011. Once Rockwell had fallen far enough, one could have then rolled back into the position and owned 30% more shares than they started with, and once the cycle turned, Rockwell, of course, caught back up to the indexes within a couple of years.The key danger of this strategy is that if we are too soon rolling out of Rockwell and the market rises so fast and high that by the time Rockwell drops - even if it drops 40% - it's not enough to drop below our ETF alternatives. SLVP doesn't have a history that goes back far enough, but we can see a depiction of what this scenario might look like using VPU versus ROK starting January 2010. If we rotated out of ROK at that point, it would have been too early.VPU Total Return Price data by YChartsYet, even in this worst-case scenario, we would still have had an opportunity to roll back into ROK in 2011 at pretty close to equal value, and we would still have increased our capital by 25-30% compared to if we had chosen cash. That seems like a reasonable risk to take, especially considering that ROK rose over 100% in a little over a year's time - and I think the odds of that happening in the near future are very close to zero.Rockwell Automation is generally a shallow, yet consistent, cyclical stock that usually falls in the 40-50% range during normal cyclical downturns (though we can expect it to fall much further, 55-75%, if we experience a serious recession). Currently, it appears to be at the high end of its historical valuation. I think a 50/50 mix of SPLV and VPU will perform better over the medium term of 2-5 years.

4169765,24361,2018-05-04T08:20:16-04:00,"Rockwell's margins were good, but organic revenue growth looked a little light and some important higher-margin end-markets are starting to look weaker.Growth expectations for the second half of Rockwell's fiscal year may not be so easily met/bested and increased revenue contributions from heavy industry customers could depress margins.Rockwell is a well-run discrete automation company and buying on the dips has worked well in the past, but investors will have to have some patience.","Rockwell Automation (ROK) does well when the economy is expanding and companies are spending more on factory capex - Rockwell’s performance correlates reasonably well to U.S. industrial production. Now, though, it is pretty clear that the vital auto end-market has slowed considerably, and there are signs that electronics is going the same way, while growth in heavy industries will weigh on Rockwell’s margins.Rockwell is by no means a bad company, but the shares have often carried a premium for presumed superiority that may not be entirely deserved. What’s more, expectations for the second half of the year are not exactly easy. I definitely believe Rockwell is the sort of name you want to buy on pullbacks, but investors who want to start adding today should at least be prepared for the risk that things will get worse before they get better.Looking back at Rockwell’s fiscal second quarter report in late April, the company did okay on reported revenue (up 6%), but underlying organic revenue growth was a little light at 3.5%. What’s more, the average multi-industrial has delivered organic growth about 100bp higher than that, and this really ought to be a good part of the cycle for Rockwell. I’d also note that relative to other players in automation (ABB (ABB), Emerson (EMR), Honeywell (HON), and Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY)), this wasn’t a particularly strong quarter for Rockwell.Rockwell saw a little under 3% growth in its high-margin Architecture and Software division (with Logix up 5%), while Control Products & Solutions saw more than 4% growth (with 3% growth in products). While reported gross margin improved slightly, adjusted gross margin fell. Segment level profits grew about 17%, beating expectations, as the A&S segment outperformed on margins and saw better than 14% yoy growth. CP&S saw 20% growth (and nearly two points of margin improvement), but missed slightly relative to expectations. As I’ve written in multiple recent articles on industrials, several short-cycle end-markets appear to be at or past their peaks. In particular, the market for auto capex seems to be weak, with Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) seeing lower capex sales and Rockwell seeing sales down more than 5%. This is an important segment for Rockwell (and discrete automation as a group), not only because it contributes close to 15% of revenue, but because it is relatively high-margin revenue.Management said they believe that the year-over-year comps for auto capex will ease as the year goes on, but I’m still cautious here. Ford (NYSE:F) laid out a case for 2018 being its peak capex year, due in part to increased re-use of capex equipment, and other carmakers have said similar things. There will still be capex spending needed to support growth (particularly in China) and a shift toward more hybrid/electric vehicles, but I’m worried that one of Rockwell’s best markets could slow further.Rockwell also mentioned strong results from its semiconductor business, but electronics is another area where I’m concerned. There have been a lot of conflicting signals here: 3M (MMM) delivered underwhelming performance, Fanuc’s (OTCPK:FANUY) guidance showed some real near-term concern, Danaher (DHR) said things were okay, semi cap equipment companies have been reporting generally healthy earnings and guidance, SWK saw weaker demand for fasteners in electronics, and Atlas Copco (OTCPK:ATLKY) basically said “you’re all correct” as demand is flagging in some areas, but still strong in others.Rockwell did note strength in heavy industries like oil/gas and mining/metals, and this is likely to be a stronger area as 2018 rolls on (consistent with what companies like ABB, Emerson, and Honeywell have also said). The problem here for Rockwell is that these businesses are served largely through the lower-margin CPS segment, so revenue outperformance here will weigh on margins.More positively, Rockwell did also mention strength in its consumer business (which includes food/beverage, home/personal care products, and life sciences). That echoes at least some of the strength that Danaher has seen in its life sciences business, and this remains an attractive area for Rockwell – while Emerson is stepping up its game to address long-term growth opportunities in life science markets, Rockwell has a strong presence today.I do worry that the implied guidance for 5%-plus growth in the second half of Rockwell’s fiscal year will be harder to achieve than the Street currently expects. A lot of macroeconomic indicators seem to be plateauing and Rockwell’s comps are going to get more challenging. Moreover, if you look at the commentary from other automation companies like ABB and Fanuc, there are some valid concerns about near-term growth momentum in discrete/factory automation.These are admittedly all short-term concerns, and I fully expect to hear comments from readers along the lines of “my grand-pappy gave me these shares, and I ain’t ever selling <cue spittoon sound effect>.” While I do think there are some long-term challenges/threats to consider (including a shift away from PLC/DCS-based systems and possible underinvestment by Rockwell in R&D), I think Rockwell is well-placed to be a major player in discrete automation for at least another decade.Rockwell also benefits from having M&A price support. It’s no secret that Rockwell is a well-regarded company and Emerson is only the latest company to make a run at acquiring the business. Rockwell sees the future of automation in a fundamentally different way than Emerson (Emerson believes the market is moving toward a small number of large “soup to nuts” providers, Rockwell believes focus and specialization can still work). Nevertheless, if Rockwell ever were to make it known that they wanted to sell, they’d have no shortage of bidders, including (I suspect) companies you don’t normally think of in automation.I expect Rockwell to generate mid single-digit long-term revenue growth and high single-digit long-term FCF growth. That supports an expected return in the high-single digits today, but still on the lower end of what I usually look for from new investments.Buying dips in Rockwell has always worked well in the past, and I think that will be the case here again. My biggest hesitation or caution is that valuation is not washed out yet and some prior downturns have lasted a couple of years. If you can accept the risk that these shares will decline even further, and/or may be “dead money” for a while before eventually working their way up again, now looks like a good time for some extra due diligence."
4181030,24361,2018-06-12T10:23:42-04:00,"Rockwell's long-anticipated capital deployment into M&A takes the form of a $1 billion strategic tie-up with PTC.PTC's strong industrial IoT software offerings are the prime attraction, and should increase the value proposition (and analytical and control capabilities) of Rockwell's Connected Enterprise platform.Neither Rockwell nor PTC are particularly cheap, but Rockwell once again shows its commitment to using strategic relationships to position itself at the edge of the evolving automation market.","With Monday’s announcement of a strategic partnership between Rockwell (ROK) and PTC (PTC), two well-respected and perpetually-expensive players in industrial automation are coming a little closer together. Although this tie-up certainly won’t bring all of the benefits of an acquisition to Rockwell, integrating PTC’s strong IoT offerings with its own FactoryTalk offerings should meaningfully boost the data-gathering and analytical capabilities and advance Rockwell’s Connected Enterprise concept. Rockwell shares still don’t look cheap, but then they rarely do, and if management is right about the increasing role software will play in factory/process automation, this is an important long-term investment.Rockwell has been talking for some time about its intention to deploy capital into M&A and/or strategic partnerships, with management commenting as recently as late May that it wanted to deploy something in the neighborhood of $1 billion and preferably in a direction that would enhance its Connected Enterprise efforts.Rockwell’s announced partnership with PTC pretty much checks all the boxes. Rockwell will be making a $1 billion equity investment in PTC at a modest premium (8%) and will hold an 8% stake. Rockwell’s CEO will join the board of PTC and Rockwell will abide by a standstill agreement for at least three years. Rockwell has also committed to certain revenue minimums as part of the deal.PTC is a well-established player in both CAD software and PLM software, two significant segments of the enterprise-level control stack within the automation space. The bigger attraction for Rockwell, though, is the company’s growing industrial IoT portfolio, including ThingWorx (for app development), Kepware (machine-to-machine communication), and Vuforia (augmented reality). With this partnership, the two companies can better integrate PTC’s IIoT products with Rockwell’s FactoryTalk manufacturing execution systems (or MES) software offerings, as well as it analytical capabilities.This fits right in the heart of Rockwell’s “Connected Enterprise” concept that is calling for/driving greater convergence between “back-office” software functions and factory floor automation. A lot of data already flows through Rockwell’s controllers and now Rockwell will have more to offer in terms of analytics, app development, machine-to-machine communication, and visualization. It’s also very much in keeping with Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) and Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY) have been doing with their automation and software businessThe deal also benefits PTC. PTC partnered with General Electric (GE) years ago to advance IIoT and factory floor-level automation, but GE frankly hasn’t brought as much to the party as initially hoped. Pairing up with one of the most respected players in factory automation, and one that provides the “brains” for factory automation systems as well as control products, should significantly increase PTC’s leverage to front-end factory automation and perhaps create some synergies for its back-end CAD/PLM/SLM offerings.I’ll be very curious to see if this puts added pressure on ABB (ABB) to do something more dramatic on the software side. ABB has a respectable presence today in MES, HMI/SCADA, PLC, and DCS, but the company is not as strong as Schneider or Siemens in MES, HMI/SCADA or PLC (though the B&R acquisition helps in PLC), and has no real presence in CAD/PLM or simulation.Not coincidentally, Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY) could start to get more attention as one of the “last men standing” in those markets. An acquisition of Dassault would be extremely expensive for ABB (and/or anybody else), but it would bring a strong position in CAD, PLM, and simulation, and it is possible that Dassault would consider a strategic tie-up similar to the Rockwell-PTC deal that would still maintain its independence. Hexagon (OTCPK:HXGBY), too, could attract some interest, but extracting the parts of the business that would appeal most to a company like ABB or Emerson (EMR) might require too much slicing-and-dicing to be practical.I haven’t updated my thoughts on PTC in a while, but the shares have done well since my last write-up as the market has appreciated more of the long-term opportunity in its PLM and IIoT offerings. This tie-up with Rockwell should be a strong opportunity for the company to advance its front-end automation ambitions. For Rockwell, this looks like an expensive way to advance its Connected Enterprise efforts, but I’m not aware of any substantially cheaper options – DIY development would have taken years and a $1B stake acquired at a high multiple is arguably not such a high price to pay to improve the quality of its software offerings and better address an emerging multibillion-dollar opportunity, one that could also drive more demand for the company’s controller platforms, discrete controls, and software.With a high single-digit implied total return, I wouldn’t say that Rockwell is an awful idea here, but I can’t call it cheap either. Recent presentations from the company and its peers suggests a strengthening outlook for the second half of 2018, but I would still be reluctant to chase at these levels unless you have a very long-term horizon.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4230072,95006,2018-12-24T23:44:44-05:00,"In February of this year, I wrote an article questioning how far Rockwell Automation stock might fall during a bear market.I noted in the article that Rockwell Automation could fall 40-50% off its highs.Now that the stock has fallen about -30% off its highs, I'm revisiting it.In this article, I review my previous strategy and backtest some good historical entry points for Rockwell Automation stock to help determine when I would like to buy it.","On February 22th, 2018, I published an article titled, ""How far could Rockwell Automation fall?"" In that article, I pointed out that Rockwell Automation (ROK) was a highly cyclical stock which was subject to deep drawdowns in excess of -40%, and I shared the table below which contained all of Rockwell Automation's significant drawdowns for the past several decades, when they started, how deep they were, and how long it took for the stock to recover its previous high price.Currently, the stock is down about -30% off its highs. Here is my commentary/analysis of the table from the original February article:I'll add here that those recovery times from peak to peak are exceptionally fast for a cyclical stock and that's probably what sets Rockwell Automation apart in terms of cyclical analysis because with the exception of that deep dive during the Great Recession, the stock typically doesn't fall much deeper than the S&P 500. That probably means that unless something else is really out of whack, if Rockwell stock diverges a lot from the S&P to the downside, it's probably a buy signal.In the original article, I performed a risk/reward analysis where I projected out 2 1/2 years worth of stock price appreciation and dividends based on analysts' projections at the time and then included a bear market and a -40% decline in price after that. Here is the summary of that analysis:Given the poor risk/reward for Rockwell at the time, I suggested that investors rotate out of Rockwell Automation and into a 50/50 mix of the PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio ETF (NYSEARCA:SPLV) and the Vanguard Utilities ETF (NYSEARCA:VPU). Here is how VPU and SPLV have performed relative to ROK and (SPY) since the February article was published:The average total return of the VPU/SPLV mix was +7.51% while ROK lost -20.6%. An investor who still likes the long-term prospects of Rockwell Automation who rotated out of ROK back in February can now rotate back in and achieve an ~35% gain in shares at no extra cost. At this time, I consider this a completed successful trade for rotational investors. Now let's look at what might be a couple of good entry points for those investors who are waiting in cash or some other defensive investment (as I am).For my cyclical investing strategy, I use a medium-term investment time frame, which has a maximum holding period of five years in most cases. For that reason, I usually only invest in companies that have a history of recovering from their price declines within five years.Given what we know from Rockwell Automation's past cycles, I'm going to backtest entry points after -45% and -65% declines. Investing after a -45% decline from highs would have gotten us into 6 out of 7 of Rockwell's deep declines in the past. And while investing after a -65% decline would have only gotten us into the Great Recession decline, that was the most recent recession, and I think it's wise to be conservative this time around considering the velocity of Rockwell's current decline we've seen already. The S&P 500 is down -18% while Rockwell is down -30%. If they continue to decline in a similar ratio, then a -40% decline in the S&P 500 would get Rockwell down to the -65% target. This would probably only happen in a recession scenario, but I don't think it's unreasonable in those conditions.The table below shows the results one would have had they invested after a -45% decline in price during Rockwell Automation's previous downturns. The returns in the table do not include dividends. I annualized the returns and then compared them to the S&P 500 if bought and sold on the same dates, annualized. The goal is to see if historically buying after a -45% decline would be an alpha-producing strategy, so the last column is the alpha produced by the investment annualized relative to the S&P 500. All the percentages should be treated as estimates and are based on the approximate months held. If one buys after a ~45% decline and sells after the stock makes a full recovery, it produces a ~80% simple return, so that is the simple return for each of the investments in the table below.These returns are very impressive. Within 3 years of each investment, one would have produced both excellent returns and exceptional alpha to the S&P 500. Even during the decline that began in 2006 which carried into the Great Recession and saw ROK stock drop 77%, it took less than three years for an investment made after a -45% decline to recover the old highs. Obviously, if a second investment was made during this decline after the stock had fallen -65%, it would have enhanced the alpha even more.My standard investment weighting is a 1% portfolio weighting for each purchase for cyclical investments, but in Rockwell Automation's case, assuming everything checks out with the business after further analysis, I think deserves an overweight position of 2% portfolio weight for each potential investment.Rotational investors who like Rockwell Automation's long-term prospects can now rotate back into Rockwell and gain ~35% more shares than they had in February at no extra cost. Investors who are on the sidelines waiting to get in should consider taking a 1/2 position with about a 2% portfolio weight around $115.16 per share, and, should the price fall far enough, make a second 2% weighted purchase around $73.28 per share. I have a final round of analysis that I do before making my initial purchase that tests for any reasons the stock might not recover as it has in the past. This analysis looks more closely at the actual business prospects of the company. I'll write a follow-up if and when that happens and I buy the stock (or I'll explain why I decided not to buy)."
4068551,24361,2017-05-03T13:38:14-04:00,"Rockwell is reaping the benefits of improving industrial markets and continuing to see strong demand in core markets like auto OEMs and food/beverage.Industrial IoT is a real opportunity for Rockwell, but the company may have to break with its traditional practices and spend some meaningful sums on M&A to improve its offerings.Rockwell shares seem to be factoring in strong FCF growth, and I would prefer to wait for a better valuation to start a position.","My investing world feels more normal now that Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is back to a point of generous, if not excessive, valuation. While the shares offered investors a rare opportunity a year or so ago, the stock has been strong as industrial markets have started to turn in the company's favor.There's a lot to like about Rockwell, as it touches multiple popular themes like manufacturing reinvestment/capex recovery, reshoring, potential favorable tax changes, natural resource recoveries, and the industrial internet of things (or IoT). Moreover, management seems to be more willing to consider M&A as a means of rounding out its offerings and enhancing its addressable market.Valuation has been a challenge with Rockwell in the past and so again today. With the shares already pricing in close to 10% long-term free cash flow growth, I don't think you can say that the company is underrated. Good companies have a way of outperforming, and Rockwell certainly qualifies, but I'd really like to get another crack at this at a lower valuation.Not Back To Normal, But Definitely BetterWith core revenue growth of 7% in this first calendar quarter (Rockwell's fiscal second quarter), Rockwell is not only a standout among automation peers like ABB (NYSE:ABB), Emerson (NYSE:EMR), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), and Schneider (OTCPK:SBGSY), but also the larger industrial sector as a whole where only a handful of names (GE (NYSE:GE) and Parker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH)) have had comparably strong quarters.Rockwell saw 14% underlying growth in its Architecture and Software business, with Logix up 13%. Control was weaker, up 1%, but at least the results continue to improve. Margins were mixed. Gross margin improved by a point, but operating income declined about a half-point, with segment margins down about 30bp due to a two and a half point decline in the Control segment. Architecture and Software was strong, with segment profits up 23% and margin above the mid-20%s.Although Rockwell has a significant skew toward heavy industry, that's not really driving the growth at this point (though I would argue that ""significantly less bad"" is still a meaningful change). Auto remains very strong for Rockwell. Auto volumes are softening, but companies continue to spend on retooling and Rockwell seems to be benefiting from growth efforts in areas like powertrain. Consumer was also strong, with management pointing again to food/beverage as well as life sciences (interesting, given the lackluster results at Danaher (NYSE:DHR), though the businesses are very different).M&A - From Prey To Predator?Rockwell has long figured prominently in discussions of automation M&A, and why not? Rockwell has a very high-quality business (strong in PLC, drives, motor/motion control, and software) and has managed to successfully cross the discrete/process divide in automation.I'll come back to the prospects for Rockwell getting a bid, but I think it is interesting that Rockwell itself is taking a more forward stance on M&A. That's a big switch for a company that has long been skeptical about the benefits of broad diversification. To that point, Rockwell has only spent around $300 million on M&A this decade, and about half of that was spent in fiscal 2016.What does Rockwell want? Even though plenty of analysts have suggested they might want to buy a PLM or ERP software business, management has explicitly said they don't want to do that, as they think the synergies between such software and controls, instruments, and so on is more limited that commonly thought.Based on what they have said, though, I think sensors, safety, and instrumentation could be on the menu. The company has a long working relationship with Endress + Hausser (a strong player in instruments), but I could also see other European companies like Balluff, Beckhoff, HIMA, IFM Efector, and Pepperl + Fuchs possibly holding some interest. With substantial cash assets stuck overseas, a deal outside the U.S. for a company with a strong position in sensors, connectivity, or so forth could make a lot of sense.Now, as for Rockwell being a target… ABB's acquisition of B+R took away arguably one of the most motivated buyers, but Schneider has reportedly been interested in this asset for a long time. Emerson could also be a very interested party (Rockwell would fill some notable gaps), but I'm not sure they could afford the deal given their pending deal with Pentair. Honeywell could likewise use Rockwell to fill gaps, but Honeywell has historically pursued a specialist strategy akin to Rockwell where they don't try to be all things to all customers.To throw one more name out, how about General Electric? General Electric has made a big deal about being a player in the growing industrial IoT opportunity and Rockwell would definitely lend more credibility to those efforts. What's more, GE's business mix hasn't generated much for shareholders for a while and this management/board has never been shy about overpaying for assets they think are strategic.Making The ConnectionRockwell has its own initiatives underway in IoT, under the heading of ""Connected Enterprise."" In fact, Rockwell looks like one of the strongest players among the automation companies, with only Siemens and Schneider really looking serious contenders (though I'm sure ABB would argue strongly with that). Given its ability to straddle discrete and process automation, as well as its strong position in controls and software, Rockwell certainly has a serious opportunity here (even more so when you consider the amount of factory data flowing through their controllers).Rockwell's approach is multi-armed. In addition to its strong control technology, Rockwell has its manufacturing software platform, network infrastructure (in collaboration with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO)), and scalable computing resources in conjunction with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as well as info management/analytics capabilities (with several data analytics pilot studies underway in a variety of industries) and strong visualization capabilities.Rockwell doesn't have everything, though. The company's position in sensors is not as strong as it probably needs to be, and I think you could make the same argument with instrumentation. Hence, I think Rockwell's larger-scale M&A activity will be in those directions. I don't expect the company to do much on its own in robotics, though its partnership with Fanuc has been fruitful so far and the company can work with numerous small robot companies without needing to own its own platform.The OpportunityEven with a recent change at the top (a new CEO was named in mid-2016), I don't think Rockwell is going to change all that dramatically. The new CEO is a Rockwell veteran and the company had been telegraphing a greater willingness to consider M&A prior to the transition. I'm still a little concerned that the head of Architecture and Software, Frank Kulaszewicz, could be a target for a competitive hire-away since he didn't get the top spot, but I'm not going to get hung up on a theoretical risk.I know there are investors who largely scoff at modeling and instead believe in buying good companies and holding them long term (or at least through a cycle). Rockwell certainly qualifies, and I acknowledge the limits of modeling, but I would note that the company is still quite cyclical and tied to the health of the underlying industrial economy (particularly in the U.S.).I'm looking for long-term revenue growth of around 5%, and larger-scale M&A could swing that a little higher. Rockwell already generates strong margins relative to other automation players, but I believe FCF margins in the mid-teens are attainable on an extended basis, supporting FCF growth in excess of 6%.The Bottom LineAs I said earlier, Rockwell shares already seem to be pricing in close to 10% long-term FCF growth. I don't think that's an absurd notion, but I think that means a pretty bullish outlook is already in the shares. I would definitely like to get another shot at these shares at a lower valuation, but with Rockwell checking the box on so many bullish trends today, I don't necessarily expect to get that chance right away.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4130607,23757,2017-12-08T07:35:54-05:00,"Rockwell Automation should have taken Emerson's final offer.The premium offered was large enough to cover tax issues for most shareholders.Even if no synergies materialized, the offer still valued Rockwell well above peers.","We've been shareholders of Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) for a while and are a bit disappointed that it didn't accept Emerson Electric's (NYSE:EMR) final buyout offer. I say a bit disappointed because Rockwell is obviously a successful company, well positioned, and has a bright future. It's just that Emerson's offer was a wild overpayment and it would have been more financially beneficial to shareholders for Rockwell to take Emerson's deal.Emerson's final offer was $225 per share with 60% of the deal in cash and 40% in stock. By any measure, it's a very rich valuation for Rockwell. It would value the company at 35.4 times current earnings, 27.3 times forward earnings estimates, and 23.7 times EBITDA. Using a simple DCF model with a 10% discount rate, 3% terminal growth rate, and a 10-year high growth period, it implies 12.8% free cash flow growth over the next 10 years. This is quite a bit above consensus analyst estimates for 9.65% earnings growth for the next five years.The main sticking point for Rockwell's shareholders seems to be the questionable logic of the deal. Emerson is projecting $4B in capitalized cost synergies and $2B in capitalized sales synergies. But, by their own admission, the companies' business lines do not have significant overlap, so generating the projected synergies will be difficult as there will not be a large, superficially redundant pool of costs to cut. The sales synergies are also questionable as GE (NYSE:GE) provides a good example of the limitations of a ""one-stop industrial shopping"" type company.Because of the dubiousness of the rationale for the combination, it's probably better to value Emerson's proposal on a worst-case scenario basis and assume that either the synergies don't materialize or that investors immediately liquidate the shares of Emerson received in the transaction. For Rockwell investors who hold shares in a tax deferred account, taking the deal is a no brainer. Just sell your Emerson stock when you get it and you get the whole $225 per share.For investors who hold Rockwell in a taxable account, things are a bit different depending on the gain you have on the stock. Since the average holding period for a stock is somewhere around a year (if you're rounding up) and Rockwell's stock opened the year at around $134 per share, the average investor would be sitting on an average gain of about 68% or $91 per share. At a 20% tax rate that would be about $18.20 in capital gains. Since the cash portion of Emerson's offer is greater than the taxable gain, the rest is treated as a return of principal and the Emerson Electric shares received could be sold without accruing further taxes.That means the true ""cash offer"" for Rockwell would be about $206 per share. That still values the company at 25 times forward earnings and almost 22 times EBITDA.However, Rockwell has handily outperformed the market and investors who've been shareholders longer face high unrealized capital gains. For instance, investors who've been in the stock for five years are looking at 140% gains, 10-year holders have 180% gains, and if you timed the market well and bought after the Great Recession, you could be looking at 400% to 500% gains.For investors who don't want the tax hit of selling Emerson's shares received, it's useful to see how much value is at risk. Rockwell's shareholders would own approximately 22% of the combined company under the terms of Emerson's last offer. With $6B of projected synergies existing, Rockwell shareholders would be looking at $1.32B in total risk (22% share of the synergies). This would be equivalent to $7.32 per Emerson share to be received ($6B in synergies divided by 641.82M existing Emerson shares plus 128.5M Rockwell shares times 1.38 for 819.15M total Emerson shares) or could be thought of as about $10.11 per Rockwell share owned. So, put another way, the deal could be looked at about $215 in ""merger-risk free"" assets being received (cash and Emerson shares less synergy risks). This is still a hefty premium for shareholders valuing the company at a forward P/E of around 26 and almost 23 times EBITDA.Compared to peers like ABB (NYSE:ABB) trading at 24 times earnings and Schneider Electric (OTCPK:SBGSY) at 20 or other industrials like Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), 3M (NYSE:MMM), and Honeywell (NYSE:HON) at 25, 27, and 23 times earnings respectively, Emerson's offer, even if you take into account taxes and failed synergies, looks like a very good deal."
4130611,36431,2017-12-08T08:34:29-05:00,"ROK is an elite business with a bright future in automation.Margins are sinking overall, but the Software & Architecture segment is a bright spot.Despite solid expected earnings growth, shares are overvalued on a relative basis.","Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) has popped by over 43% so far this year, spiked higher in part by a proposed offer from Emerson (NYSE:EMR) for $29 billion. Emerson has withdrawn its offer, so for now it looks like it may be ""back to business"" for Rockwell as a result. It's one of the best-run industrial businesses out there in my opinion, and I'd like to take a deeper dive into its fundamentals.Rockwell earns high returns on invested capital despite sinking operating margins (more on that later). To illustrate this, I built the below model (and all others in the article, unless otherwise noted) using data from its 10-K.The firm earns ROIC far in excess of its cost of capital, indicating a wide moat. This is likely in part due to its Logix platform, and its capability to control both discrete and process manufacturing. Research from Morningstar offers some insight into this concept, using a beverage plant as an example, which utilizes sensors and controls to position bottles in a specific way (discrete) so that they can be filled (process) with a specific amount of product.Rockwell's moat is therefore largely tied to the fact that it's not only a facilitator of the ""connected"" enterprise, but also the fact that it's the ""only scalable, multidiscipline, information-enabled control platform"" that provides ""real-time insights."" This gives it an edge and also allows it to increase efficiency, and therefore overall business value, for its customers.The automation market is also an attractive one, with growing demand from emerging markets and an aging installed base in developed ones. Rockwell is mostly focused on industrial automation and information, and its products, services, technologies, and expertise should allow it to continue to not only grow but also continue to earn ""excess profits"" (ROIC higher than its WACC) going forward as well.It also consistently generates free cash flow in the double digits as a percentage of its sales and holds more cash and short-term investments than total current liabilities. Despite its strong cash flow and sizable cash pile, however, it's not stingy - paying out roughly 80% of its free cash flow to shareholders (in dividends and buybacks) over the past decade.Next, I will look at the firm's return on equity by breaking it down into five analyzable pieces.Rockwell has been able to increase its ROE sequentially over the past three years, but after some deeper digging, we can see that it's not because of margin expansion. The firm's efficiency improved year-over-year, judging by its asset turnover ratio, but this ratio is still lower than it was in fiscal 2015. Higher leverage and a lower effective tax rate have mostly boosted ROE over the past three years. These are the GAAP numbers, but management also provided some adjusted figures (for both EBIT and net income) in Rockwell's 8-K that it thinks better reflect economic reality.If we use management's numbers, ROE is higher overall, but sinking margins are still apparent. According to Rockwell's 8-K:The company's margins are much higher in the Architecture & Software segment, and expanded to 27% from 26.4% in the previous year. The lower margin segment, Control Products & Solutions, sank from 15.2% in fiscal 2016 to only 13.2% in 2017 - dragging down overall margins with it. Margins still remain lucrative, but watching them going forward for further compression would be wise.If we also apply management's numbers to ROIC, and back out cash, we get what the company thinks its true underlying return on invested capital is.Source: ROK 2017 8-KThis number is significantly higher, but I personally consider cash as a component of ""invested capital"". If they put the cash into something that generates lower returns, it would drag down overall ROIC. While it's nice to know the core business is even stronger than what's advertised just by looking at ""headline"" ROIC, what can the company put this cash in to keep generating 39%? And if it could, why hasn't it?I think the more accurate number, using management's adjusted operating income number (and keeping the cash as a component of invested capital), puts ROIC closer to around 23% - still very impressive.Rockwell is trading far above its five-year average and thirteen-year median PE ratios, which are around 18 to 18.5 times earnings.Shares are trading even higher using GAAP EPS, at closer to 30 times earnings. Management is guiding for strong organic sales growth of 3.5% to 6.5%, and adjusted EPS of between $7.20 and $7.50 in 2018. That translates to roughly 6.51% to 10.95% growth in the bottom line year-over-year, and we can stack this growth up against what's currently being implied by its share price.If Rockwell knocks earnings out of the park in 2018, perhaps today's valuation is justified on an absolute basis - if we consider a conservative discount range in the 10% to 12% range (implying growth of only 6% to 8% baked into the current share price), but this is assuming everything goes right - and then some.Analysts expect the company to earn EPS of $7.42 in fiscal 2018, putting shares at about 26 times 2018's expected earnings, which translates to growth of about 9.76%. This means that while the current share price could be justified based on growth, for any upside to occur, the company would also have to retain an elevated multiple versus history, and I'd argue that the recent offer from Emerson has inflated the price tag some.I think Rockwell is more than fully priced here, perhaps due to the recent Emerson bid. The most I'd be willing to pay is 18 times 2019's earnings estimate, or around $150 a share. Even that might be a stretch, but probably worth it in the long run due to the elite quality of the underlying business.Rockwell earns very high (and likely sustainable) returns on its invested capital, generates strong free cash flow, is shareholder friendly, and most of all is a strong player in an attractive industry. Unfortunately, I think I could be waiting a long time before I get the chance to own shares, however, due to its current price tag and solid expected growth.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page by the author's name."
4062352,102273,2017-04-13T15:14:55-04:00,"Convergence of industrial automation and enterprise software well underway.Rockwell's goal to increase software sales falling short, but long-term trend is promising.Acquisitions more likely to bring together robotics, industrial automation and enterprise software.","Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is a pure-play Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) company that is working hard to increase its revenues from selling software. It's focused on the right priorities of increasing its software sales and integrating with data analytics platforms and ERP systems. In the long run, there may be greater convergence of industrial automation software, robotics and enterprise software. This may lead to Rockwell acquiring robotics companies or even it being acquired.Industrial Internet, which enables smart factories, exists to best serve the needs of the customer. The integration of Industrial Internet and enterprise software will help manufacturing companies respond faster to changing demands and reacting faster to product defects. Companies can achieve this flexibility while keeping costs low. Eventually, there may be very little distinction between Industrial Internet and ERP systems when tightly integrated.The IIoT integration with rest of the enterprise software stack is still in its infancy, but the convergence of Industrial Internet and enterprise software will enable a software company to help their customers gather, analyze and act on data from the factory floor to the customer. It is an enticing prospect for any enterprise software company to be able to sell products that cover every aspect of their customer business. For these reasons, Rockwell Automation may be an ideal acquisition candidate for an enterprise software company such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) or even a company like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO).From the customer perspective, it is easier for them to deploy and maintain industrial automation systems from a single vendor. There is business value in making near real-time production decisions by analyzing sales data, warranty data and raw material costs. The integration of the factory and enterprise data can help bring about greater efficiencies to the company. Moreover, automated factories can help lower labor cost, improve operational efficiencies and help with preventive maintenance.There are multiple trends driving the adoption of the Industrial Internet.Exhibit: Trends Driving Industrial Automation (Source: Company Filings)The cost of semiconductors and wireless hardware has dropped dramatically. It is now cost effective to add sensor technology and wireless connectivity to very low-cost industrial equipment. Now, data from every aspect of a plant can be gathered and analyzed. That data can be stored in elastic cloud environments hosted on premise or by a public cloud vendor. The cost to store and retrieve data from computing platforms has dropped dramatically too. The availability and robustness of today's Big Data tools to quickly analyze vast amounts of data and present actionable intelligence is making it easy for companies like Rockwell Automation to manage data. Demographic trends such as population growth and increased urbanization is increasing the demand for products. The income levels in many emerging countries are less than that in developed countries. The large population coupled with lower income levels necessitates efficient and flexible operations while lowering the unit cost of products. Products and services offered by Rockwell Automation help in making products efficiently.Exhibit: Products That Rockwell Automation Helps Produce (Source: Company Filings)Rockwell Automation operates under two business segments:In 2016, Architecture & Software operating segment accounted for $2.64 billion or 45% of the total sales. Its Control Products & Solutions operating segment accounted for $3.24 billion or the remaining 55% of the total sales. Rockwell Automation has customers in consumer products, resource-based and transportation industries.Exhibit: Rockwell Automation Annual Revenue (Source: Company Filings)Software Has Larger Margins, But Has Shown Inconsistent Growth!Exhibit: Rockwell Automation Revenue from Architecture & Software (Source: Company Filings)Exhibit: Rockwell Automation Control Products & Solutions (Source: Company Filings)Rockwell Automation enjoys a higher operating margin in its Software business compared to its Control Products operating segment.To achieve a truly smart factory that can deliver on lower costs and increased efficiency, one would need an integrated approach to data management and analysis.Exhibit: Data Management Capabilities to Truly Enable a Smart Factory (Source: Author)Rockwell has products that enable a connected machine, help in gathering data and provide the network connectivity required to transport data to Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) and to ERP and data analytics systems. Broadly speaking, Rockwell offers products in these categories:It has also teamed up with Microsoft and integrated with its business intelligence software and Azure cloud to provide end-to-end system for a smart factory. In essence, Rockwell has capabilities in enabling connected machines and in data gathering via use of its networking technology, but lacks the ability and infrastructure or compute cloud to store and analyze vast amounts of data. Microsoft has expertise in the areas of Big Data storage and analysis. Its partnership is complementary.Even though Rockwell has a stated goal to increase its revenues from software, the reality is much different. Its revenue from software hasn't shown any consistent growth. Until it starts showing consistent revenue growth in software, it may not be enticing for an enterprise software company to acquire it.Exhibit: Revenue Growth in Architecture and Software Segment (Source: Company Filings)There could be multiple reasons for this lack of growth in software sales:Rockwell Automation Heavily Dependent On Revenue From Raw Materials ProductionExhibit: Revenue from Various Industry Segments (Source: Company Filings)But there may be signs that things are about the change. Industrial companies closely monitor economic trends and pay close attention to Industrial Production (IP) Index, Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), Industrial Equipment Spending and Capacity Utilization (Total Industry).Exhibit: Economic Data on Industrial Spending and Manufacturing Trends (Source: Company Filings)The industrial production index and capacity utilization were slightly down, but industrial equipment spending and PMI were up in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The economic data is positive sign for Rockwell Automation in the short term, assuming the current geopolitical risks don't dampen consumer spending and lead to a decrease in industrial production.Rockwell Automation has built a solid foundation, but has to start showing good consistent organic growth in its software operating segment to extend its leadership position in IIoT. The eventual convergence of industrial automation and enterprise software is inevitable in the long run. There will also be further close integration between robotics and industrial automation software. For example, Rockwell and FANUC have a global collaboration agreement in place to create integrated manufacturing solutions. Rockwell may even acquire robotics companies in order to help it gain a larger share of industrial spending and further its goal of increasing software sales. Or, it may be an acquisition target for a large enterprise software company looking to gain a strong foothold in the Industrial Internet. It may first have to prove that it can be major force in industrial automation software by showing consistent growth."
3805806,24361,2016-01-13T14:56:52-05:00,"Rockwell has sold alongside its fellow automation peers despite stronger margins and ROICs.Rockwell is less exposed to oil/gas, mining, and metals, but food/bev looks to be slowing, and auto could disappoint amidst a broader manufacturing malaise.This looks like a rare buy-the-dip opportunity, as a 3%+ revenue growth rate and 5%+ FCF growth rate support a fair value of around $111.","When your biggest complaint about a stock is the valuation, that's a pretty clear signal you're looking at a good candidate for the watch list and future buy-the-dip-opportunities. I have long respected Rockwell Automation's (NYSE:ROK) position in the automation space and its strong presence in controls (especially PLCs). What I haven't liked as much has been the valuation, but the apparent realization among the sell-side and institutional investors that Rockwell is still a cyclical company appears to have created a window of opportunity.The problem with buying the shares of a good company like Rockwell during a downturn is that you never really know how bad the decline will be. I believe the long-term drivers for automation are still very strong and that Rockwell's long-term future looks bright, but that doesn't mean that the shares couldn't see $80 again if conditions in markets like auto OEMs get really bad and margins decelerate further. If you're in a position to take the risk of short-term pain for long-term gain, though, I think this is a good time to consider these shares.Less Cyclical, Maybe, But Still CyclicalThe automation space hasn't been too popular over the past year, as investors have grown increasingly worried about the impact of weak oil/gas markets, weak mining, and increasingly weak ""general manufacturing"". The weak conditions of the oil/gas and mining markets probably speak for themselves - with prices at multi-year lows in many cases, companies in these industries have dramatically scaled back their capital spending. It's also happening in the manufacturing sector, where orders for capital goods like machine tools weakened sharply in the second half of the year.Investors in ABB (NYSE:ABB), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), and Emerson (NYSE:EMR) have all had some reason to worry, given that oil/gas, chemicals, mining, and the like are meaningful portions of their automation business. At Rockwell, though, these afflicted markets come in at just under 30% of revenue, and the company boasts a strong presence in less cyclical businesses like food/beverage, consumer, and pharmaceuticals.With management's guidance after the fiscal fourth quarter leading to some sizable estimate cuts, it seems that analysts have come to accept that the company is still vulnerable to the cyclical ups and downs of the sector. Now the question is how bad things may get. Analyst expectation for fiscal 2016 revenue have fallen by about 10% over the last six months (to a 5% contraction currently) and there aren't many brave souls projecting a quick snap back in 2017.Auto Could Be The Swing FactorLooking at Rockwell's market exposures, the 12% or so exposure to oil/gas is what it is - everybody knows this is a weak market. Relative to Honeywell, ABB, Siemens, and Rockwell have greater exposure to upstream oil/gas (about 60%, 67% and 75%, respectively), and Rockwell is also exposed to exploration (about 40% of the upstream business), which I expect will be the weakest part of oil and gas.The 15% or so exposure to metals and mining is a little harder to read. Rockwell's mining business hasn't been as horrible as you might imagine given industry conditions, but it's not exactly poised to be a growth driver either.I was a little surprised by Rockwell's guidance that 2016 revenue from food and beverage was going to be flat. This had been a pretty strong sector for the company, but it looks like many large players are pausing spending while they reevaluate their manufacturing footprints and digest acquisitions. Other consumer markets like personal care are looking healthier, but aren't large enough to really move the needle.In my view, the biggest swing factor Rockwell in 2016 could be the health of the auto OEM industry. Auto manufacturers have been spending quite a lot on capex and my expectation has been that this spending would decelerate meaningfully in 2016. Rockwell's guidance is more positive than that, with the company expecting growth here above the company average. Helping this growth will be the company's entry into the powertrain segment (helped by its alliance with Fanuc); Rockwell has historically been strong in body manufacturing and assembly, but is now looking to challenge Siemens in the powertrain area. With auto and tire making up close to 15% of Rockwell's revenue base, it certainly merits watching as the year develops.Will Rockwell's Scarcity Value Provide A Floor?With its strength in manufacturing execution system software and Layer 2 controls, strong margins, and non-typical end-market exposures, Rockwell has long been regarded as an appealing takeover target. ABB and Emerson would likely be the most interested parties within the sector, but I suppose Honeywell could consider it and General Electric (NYSE:GE) may also be an outside player if it wants to establish a larger presence in automation.Apart from Rockwell's desire to stay independent, valuation has likely been a barrier to serious takeover discussions. Were the stock's valuation to slip far enough, though, I think management would at least entertain offers and that should provide some floor for the shares. By the same token, Rockwell's healthy balance sheet gives it the option to be active in M&A on its own terms - adding capabilities in product lifecycle management and/or plant design and simulation would fit in with the company's focus on higher-value parts of the automation value chain.Recalibrating The ValueGiven the worsening state of the manufacturing sector, I've been lowering my expectations for a lot of industrial companies in 2016, and Rockwell is no exception. The last major decline in Rockwell's business was in 2009 (fiscal 2009 revenue was down 24% from fiscal 2008) during the global recession and the company's revenue fully recovered in two years. I don't think this decline will be that bad, but I also don't think the recovery will be as sharp - a lot of U.S. manufacturing growth since 2009 was fueled by the onshore oil and gas boom and even if demand for automation picks up in China, there are more local firms like Hollysys (NASDAQ:HOLI) competing for that business now.My expectations were lower than most of the sell-side six months ago, so my revisions are less severe. I'm definitely looking for a weaker 2016 and 2017 than before, but my long-term revenue growth rate is more or less unchanged in the mid-3%'s. I do have some concerns about margin de-leverage over the next two years, but I think Rockwell will maintain a ""low-mid"" teens FCF margin and will still ultimately be able to lift that above 15% - supporting mid-single digit free cash flow growth.Discounted back, those cash flows lead to a fair value around $111 today.The Bottom Line.With the shares down almost $28/share since my last article and my fair value only down around $2/share, I'm definitely a lot more interested in these shares. I own ABB and am a little concerned about over-exposure to the sector, but it seems that one of the lessons of investing history is that you don't get too many opportunities to buy very solid companies like Rockwell at appealing prices.I will again repeat the warning the global economic conditions can certainly get worse from here, and that the second-half recovery that management is looking for could get canceled out by more cautious spending heading into the U.S. presidential elections. Even if the shares have further to fall here from here, I'd be tempted to take the short-term pain rather than miss out by trying to pick them up right at the bottom.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3891596,24361,2016-02-12T08:44:09-05:00,"Rockwell outperformed expectations for the December quarter, but guidance spooked the Street and investors are worried about a typical cyclical decline and greater margin deleverage.Rockwell's product quality and attractive market exposures won't evaporate, but there are a lot of warning signals in the broader economy for the near term.Rockwell looks undervalued on the basis of mid-single digit long-term FCF growth, but a full-blown recession will take the shares lower.","Cynical and sarcastic as I am, I'm nevertheless surprised when Wall Street collectively punts on a story they once dearly loved . I can understand worries that Rockwell Automation's (NYSE:ROK) margins in Architecture & Software are going to slide with weak revenue, but I can't quite fathom where the surprise about that comes from. Be that as it may, it looks like sell-side analysts are diving toward the bottom of the guidance range and taking a much more cautious approach.It doesn't help that Rockwell management seemed more conservative on the outlook for its end-markets than the likes of ABB (NYSE:ABB) or Emerson (NYSE:EMR). Going back to that ""cynical and sarcastic"", I'll just mention here that the two worst-performing companies in the sector are more optimistic about the near-term outlook and the better performers (Emerson and Honeywell (NYSE:HON)) seem a little more cautious to me.What Rockwell is hasn't changed - it's still an excellent player in industrial/process automation, with a strong presence in PLCs and strong mid-teens-to-20% share in the North American automation market. Buying Rockwell now certainly involves the risk that the automation market gets worse before it gets better, but I still think there's a compelling long-term argument here.A Beat, But Lower Margins And Guidance Are The TakeawayMost of the automation players actually did better than expected for the December quarter, and Rockwell was no exception. Revenue fell about 3% on a core basis, but that was about 3% better than expected. Architecture and Software (A&S) sales were down a little less than 3%, with process initiative sales down 14% and Logx down 6%. Control (or CPS) was down about 4%, with motor control product sales down 1% and solutions/services sales down 6%.Gross margin declined 80bp on volume deleverage and segment profits were down 15%. Segment margin was actually a little better than expected (20.7% versus an average estimate of 20.5%), but I suspect that the Street was spooked by the roughly four-point decline in A&S margins (on a 20% decline in segment profits). CPS earnings were down 5% with an 80bp margin improvement for the quarter.Orders were reported down mid-single digits (versus down 2% at ABB and recent double-digit order declines at Emerson) and management noted a worsening of conditions in markets like oil/gas. With that, management lowered guidance for organic revenue growth in FY 2016 by 1% (to a range of down 5% to down 1%) and also lowered its EPS forecast range (to $5.70 - $6.20).Mixed MarketsThe oil/gas industry is a major customer for process automation companies and we all know that sector is struggling, but Rockwell's report of a 30% decline in sales to oil/gas customers in the U.S. is a pretty bracing sign of just how bad things are. Although consumer and auto markets were better ""about flat"" is not nearly enough to absorb the kind of weakness the company is seeing in the oil/gas sector. All told, U.S. revenue was down about 6% in the quarter, while revenue in China was down 10%. In part because of the ongoing weakness in oil/gas, management is looking for industrial production to be negative in the U.S. for its fiscal year.Given the magnitude of capex cuts that are being announced in the oil/gas sector (25% at Chevron (NYSE:CVX), one-third at Anadarko (NYSE:APC), and 66% at Continental Resources (NYSE:CLR)), that industry isn't going to be any help in calendar 2016. Metal and mining are likewise down, and growth in pulp/paper and food/beverage isn't going to be enough on its own. While ABB talked about growth in the auto sector, Emerson talked about flat conditions and I'm still worried that auto OEM spending on capex could decline this year (after a prolonged stretch of spending); Rockwell should be poised to take some share from Siemens, but it may not be enough to deliver much growth.Still Strong; Still AppealingRockwell's website highlights how the company recently won 32 of 53 first place industry category awards in reader's choice awards process from Control Magazine. I don't usually get too excited about these things, but it's hard to ignore that Rockwell swept the categories for food/bev and metals/mining and nearly swept plastics/rubber and water/wastewater (missing out one category to Honeywell and Schneider, respectively) in ""best in control"". All told, Rockwell (and Emerson) come out of this looking pretty good.I would also note Rockwell's clean balance sheet provides flexibility. The company has generally preferred to partner than to buy (including a key partnership with Endress+Hauser), but the company did just acquire MagneMotion, a manufacturer of intelligent conveying systems. No terms were discussed, so I would assume it is a relatively small deal. Thinking bigger picture, Rockwell has strong share in the North American and Latin American discrete and process automation markets, but mid-single digit share in Europe. Perhaps acquisitions aimed at increasing its market exposure in Europe would be worth considering. On the other hand, Rockwell itself isn't so large that it couldn't still find itself the target of ABB, Emerson, or GE, though that is not my expectation.Nothing really changes about my outlook given the December quarter results, as I was already a little low relative to the Street and the changes I have made are more ""fine-tuning"". I'm still looking for long-term revenue growth of around 3% to 4% a year and mid-single digit FCF growth. Discounted back, that ought to be worth around $107.50 today.The Bottom LineIt's pretty clear that the industrial economy is not in good shape right now and not really pointing up. ABB and Emerson sounded optimistic with respect to their market/economy outlooks, but I think investors need to consider the possibility that 2016 remains ugly for industrials, as well as the risk that it spills over into the consumer in 2017. I don't say this to spook investors away from Rockwell, but just to frame the risk a little more explicitly. I think Rockwell will be fine over the long term, but not all investors have the patience to see a stock position go red for an extended period.I still like Rockwell, though I own ABB myself. ABB looks cheap, Honeywell looks undervalued, and Rockwell looks somewhere in the middle - which is probably fair given that it is a superior company to ABB in many respects but not a true blue-chipper like Honeywell. Given that Rockwell is often pretty pricey during the good times, this looks like a buy-the-dip opportunity to consider, even with the risk that the dip gets deeper from here."
3959782,89486,2016-03-20T14:36:37-04:00,"Look under the radar for future long-term dividend growers.Pay attention to a few key metrics such as valuation, payout ratio, yield, debt/equity, and EPS growth.Don't be bound to lists.","Retired and looking for income from solid companies that might not be on any list of long-time dividend growers like the Dividend Aristocrats or Dividend Champions? I previously discussed ""short-timers"" Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) in the article ""These Dividends Are Back In The Black"".This article adds two, albeit lesser-known companies, to the future dividend dynamo list: Robert Half International (NYSE:RHI) and Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK).Robert Half has a 12-year streak of dividend increases, with a double-digit growth rate, and Rockwell has boosted the payout every year for the past six. I believe these trends will continue going forward based upon numerical and qualitative factors.On the quantitative side, I analyzed the companies based upon a modified screen that stripes out a dividend growth history of 25 years or more but keeps intact the rest of the selection criteria, which I first wrote about in June 2015 in the article ""My Rules For Creating An Optimal Dividend Growth Portfolio"".The modified criteria are as follows:1. Fairly valued: The P/E should be less than or equal to the overall market and historical performance for the company.2. Competitive return: The dividend yield should be greater than the 10-year Treasury yield (which is around 2% now).3. Room to grow the dividend even in the event of slowing earnings: The payout ratio should be less than 60%.4. Increase the probability of future increases: The EPS (or cash flow) growth should be greater than 10% per year over the past five years.5. The company won't spend that much on debt: the debt/equity ratio should be less than 1.0.Intangibles such as management effectiveness, industry trends, and recent news also come into play.Only half of itRobert Half is the world's largest accounting- and finance-staffing firm and provides temporary employees for a broad spectrum of industries and corporations, so it is well-diversified and won't be affected by a slowdown in one or two areas. If energy slumps, the consumer product sector is there to pick up the slack.The temp staffing industry is poised to grow; for example, 5% this year, according to a study by Staffing Industry Analysts. Many companies are now outsourcing back-office services, such as payroll and tax compliance, previously performed in-house.Robert Half has a relatively wide economic moat and has just a few competitors. It would be difficult for start-ups to break into the industry and impact the company.The stock currently yields 2.1% and can be considered fairly valued right now with a trailing P/E of 15 and a forward P/E of less than 13. The company has reported robust earnings growth, averaging over 40% per year over the past five years (and the consensus is that double-digit growth will continue), has no debt to speak of, and sports a low payout ratio of 29%.Automated deliveryThe century-old Rockwell Automation is a leading supplier of industrial automation and information products. Some of the better-known brands include Allen-Bradley and Rockwell Software.Rockwell is a big player in the rapidly expanding industrial Internet of Things, providing systems used to control other pieces of equipment. And in a case where less was better, the company was not affected by the turmoil in oil and gas.Rockwell meets the modified criteria discussed above with its reasonable valuation (P/E of 18 and forward multiple of 17 are approximately in line with the overall market), EPS and cash flow both growing above 10% over the last half decade (and some analysts expect it to be positive going forward in spite of a few hiccups recently), debt/equity of 0.67, payout ratio of 49%, and yield of 2.7%.Conclusion Retired investors needing a bit of extra income might miss some dandies like Robert Half, which is halfway to Aristocrat status, and Rockwell Automation, about a quarter of the way there, by just looking at lists of companies that have grown dividends for a quarter-century or more."
3675646,25120,2015-11-11T09:26:55-05:00,"Rockwell Automation is a good business in an industry which is supported by secular tailwinds.This positioning makes the company a bellwether for global industrial producer confidence, as the outlook for 2016 is rather disappointing.Even as I am not impressed by historical sales growth, the margin stability and strong cash flow conversion creates enough reasons to hold onto the shares at current levels.","Rockwell Automation (ROK) is a very interesting business as it provides great insight into the need and willingness of manufacturers to upgrade and expand their plants. While the company benefits from long term secular tailwinds such as growing industrial production and increased automation, Rockwell is hurt by the strong dollar and an uncertain global economy.The company´s clients in machinery as well as the energy sector are facing big headwinds for obvious reasons. Given the importance of these industries to the overall business of Rockwell, the fiscal year of 2016 is set to become a ¨lost¨ year.That being said, Rockwell´s shares have priced in a great deal of bad news at current levels. Rockwell continues to deliver on stable margins and good cash flow conversion, while it operates with a strong balance sheet. Even as I do not see many potential catalysts in the near to mid-term horizon, I think that the overall quality and attractive valuation creates sufficient appeal to hold the shares.If the global manufacturing sector might recover and dollar might retrace from current highs, shareholders have a lot to look forward to.Rockwell Is A Global IndicatorThe reason why I tend to keep an eye on Rockwell is that it is very well positioned to tell you a lot about the global state of manufacturing, and the willingness of these manufacturers to invest into the future. The reason is quite simple, Rockwell´s architecture & software as well as control products solutions are needed when manufacturers are building new plants, or are upgrading existing older plants.Keeping facilities up to date is very important to producers and this is where Rockwell comes into play. Its solutions allow manufacturers to improve their utilization levels, connect machinery to software packages and reduce the total cost of ownership. That being said, such long term projects typically involve significant upfront costs.Rockwell´s strong positioning in the automation segment makes that it is a relative attractive play. Its revenues should outpace long term industrial production trends as many plants still have large automation improvements to make.Current Headwinds Dominate The Investment ThesisAs Rockwell generates roughly half of its sales abroad, the company is severely impacted by a strong dollar in terms of currency translation losses. The strong dollar has a negative impact on US industrial production as well, creating indirect headwinds in that way.That being said, Rockwell´s execution does not appear flawless either. The 9.8% fall in fourth quarter revenues has mostly been driven by a strong dollar, although organic sales have been down by 2.3%. This fall in organic sales marks a big change in the 2.2% organic growth being reported for the third quarter, as the company previously anticipated a 1% organic increase in fourth quarter revenues.Worse, trends have been deteriorating throughout the quarter, as indicated by management on the conference call. The company acknowledged that US sales for the month of September fell by 10% compared to the year before, as oil and gas revenues were down by 30% compared to last year. Another weak spot has been China as the European activities have done fairly well.Fourth quarter sales amounted to $1.61 billion and they have held up relatively well thanks to the architecture and software side of the business which posted a 0.4% decline in organic sales. The real weakness was seen in the control products & solutions segment, with organic sales being down 3.6%. These sales declines have had an impact on the overall margins being reported, as overall segment operating margins were down 130 basis points to still a healthy 20.9% of sales.2016 Will Become A Lost YearUnfortunately, Rockwell does not seem to believe that the current slowdown is anticipated to recover anytime soon. As a result, organic sales are anticipated to be flat at best into the upcoming year, while they could fall to the tune of 4%.On top of the expected fall in organic sales, a strong dollar is still anticipated to hurt next year´s sales by 3%. All in all, Rockwell is guiding for sales of roughly $6.0 billion in the fiscal year of 2016. While the company proudly claims to use realistic exchange rates in its guidance, including a 1.09 exchange rate to the Euro, the dollar has already become stronger than these levels in recent days.Adjusted earnings are seen at $5.90 to $6.40 per share. The impact of non-operating pension costs is already anticipated to reduce GAAP earnings to the tune of $0.37 per share in the coming year.In comparison to the 2015 numbers, the outlook is pretty disappointing. The company reported sales of $6.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $6.40 for the fiscal year of 2015. Instead of stagnation, investors should really brace themselves for modest revenue and earnings declines in the coming year.Strong Financial PositionShares of Rockwell have fallen towards the $100 mark in response to the disappointing numbers and soft 2016 guidance. Based on the midpoint of the adjusted guidance, Rockwell trades at 16 times earnings in what arguably is a very difficult environment.The good news is that the balance sheet is pretty clean, containing $2.1 billion in cash and equivalents. Combined with a net debt load of $1.5 billion and pension related liabilities of nearly $800 million by the end of 2014, net leverage employed is pretty flat. This allows the company to continue to aggressively pursue share buybacks, certainly at opportunistic levels.Great Prospects, Modest ExecutionWhile Rockwell benefits from long term secular tailwinds, including global economic growth and automation of plants, the past sales performance has been somewhat disappointing. Sales have risen from $5 billion in 2005 towards an anticipated $6 billion in the coming year, translating in to growth of merely 2% per year.While topline sales has been somewhat disappointing, Rockwell is a very asset-light business as it achieves very high returns on invested capital. This is illustrated by the fact that capital spending amounts to just $100-$150 million per year, a fraction of the reported net earnings.As a result, operating margins currently come in at 15-20% of sales, above long term averages around 15% of sales. To create more growth on top of topline sales growth, Rockwell has been a serial buyer of its own stock. The outstanding share base has been reduced by 25-30% compared to 2005. Combined with topline sales growth, revenues per share have been up by two-thirds over the past decade. This means that revenues per share have been growing at an average pace of 5% per year.Decent Play, No Screaming BuyThe trouble which I have with Rockwell is the modest topline sales growth amidst strong secular tailwinds. With exception of the low pace of organic sales growth, there is much to like about the company. This includes fat and stable margins, great cash flow conversion, very low capital expenditures, consistent buybacks, a modest valuation and a nice dividend yield.While a 16 times multiple seems full as the company enters a difficult year, the reality is that this translates into a +6% earnings yield, as pretty much all of these earnings can be returned to investors. This should support shares in this low interest rate environment. The real appeal has to come from improved topline performance and this should be supported from an improvement in the global economy and a weaker dollar.In case organic growth numbers accelerate to 3-4% in 2017 amidst easier comparables and a potential recovery of the global economy, the future looks a lot brighter. This is certainly the case if the dollar would lose some strength.In such a scenario, sales could grow towards $7 billion by 2017-2018. Combined with operating margins of 18%, net earnings could come in around $900 million in such a scenario. Following the continuation of modest share buybacks, earnings might come in around $7 per share.If I apply a 18-20 times earnings multiple to these potential earnings, to reflect for the quality of the business and its balance sheet, shares could be worth $125-$140 in the years 2017/2018. In this optimistic scenario investors can look forward to meaningful returns, although this scenario does rely on improvements in the current environment. While such scenario seems unlikely based on what we know today, I do see modest upside in the coming years, making me a buyer on dips around the $100 mark."

However, the company’s GHG Intensity metrics indicate the company has increased.ROK employs 31% women in its workforce, but does not disclose women in management, which probably explains why ROK’s board includes only 10% women.","Seeking Alpha contributors have identified Rockwell Automation (NYSE: ROK) as an undervalued company with 10+ years of dividend-paying history. Rockwell Automation, founded in 1903 and headquartered in Milwaukee, WI, competes in the 21st century with a focus on smart manufacturing, and sees itself on the brink of a new industrial evolution. ROK uses sensors to collect first-time data from an industrial process which is analyzed to develop new insights that drive process improvements that are cost effective, energy efficient, sustainable and safe.This company interests me because it is quantitatively undervalued, has a long dividend-paying history, and provides products and services that help address global megatrends. Once I know financial metrics are sound, next steps to inform my investment decision include an analysis of a company's standardized, non-financial metrics on material environmental, social and governance (BATS:ESG) issues that may impact the business value or reputation of the company or its sector.Companies voluntarily release key environmental, social and governance (ESG) data through annual reports such as the 10K and the sustainability reports. Since 2009, corporate ESG data has been available through the Bloomberg Professional Service (Bloomberg) platform. SPI's primary source for the ESG data in this blog is the Bloomberg platform. If a company sees an error in its ESG data, it should contact Bloomberg and get it corrected, as it would with public financial data.For Rockwell Automation, I am interested in the extent of the company's environmental footprint. Table 1 shows ROK's Total GHG emissions, Total Water Use, and Total Waste generated for fiscal years (FY) 2010 through 2014.Taken together, Rockwell Automation's key environmental metrics show that the company's environmental footprint is modest compared to other industrial sectors. ROK's Total Greenhouse Gas (NYSE:GHG) emissions have increased between 2010 and 2014, but have remained relatively flat for the past four years. ROK at one time used a large quantity of water, but since 2010, ROK's Total Water Usage has decreased by more than 50%. ROK's Total Waste usage metrics show the enterprise has reduced Total Waste gradually over the past five years, and overall the enterprise is not a large waste generator.Table 2 provides further evidence that natural resource conservation and environmental management are taken seriously at ROK. According to Value Investor, ROK has grown about 2% per year since 2005. During this same time, ROK has increased Total GHG Emissions, but GHG Intensity has remained at 2010 levels. This means ROK has reduced GHG emissions as a percentage of sales.Similarly, while the company grows each year, water and waste intensity metrics show the company is doing more with fewer natural resources, and generating less waste as a percentage of sales.Table 3 compares ROK to its 40 North American peers, identified by Bloomberg, and classified by SIC code as manufacturers of instruments that measure and control devices. Table 3 shows the top 10 peers, based on the ESG Disclosure Score. ROK leads its peers with an ESG Disclosure Score of 40, which is well above the average ESG Disclosure Score of 14 for the peer group. A primary reason ROK leads this group is that ROK is the only company in this group to have disclosed key environmental metrics, in Table 1.From my perspective, ROK gets credit for accountability and transparency for disclosing key environmental metrics. ROK's technology helps other companies reduce their environmental footprint, so it makes sense that ROK would measure, manage, and disclose its own environmental footprint. Although ROK's footprint is not very large compared to other industrial sectors, it is a positive that ROK's actions and words meet on this issue. ROK discloses metrics that suggest continual improvement as the company drives energy efficiency, cost effectiveness, and safety throughout the manufacturing process.Table 3 also shows key social metrics disclosed by ROK and its peer group. ROK has a board of directors that is 90% independent, which is well above the average of its peers. ROK also discloses a workforce that includes 31% women, which is great to see in a high tech company. However, ROK has not disclosed the percentage of women in management, which I suspect is not a robust number, because ROK reports that only 10% of its independent board includes women.There are plenty of studies and evidence which show that corporate boards that achieve gender balance perform better financially. The general thinking seems to be that men and women reduce risk when they make decisions together, and avoid same-sex group think. If you are interested in this information, please let me know. I have provided this research in past blogs.Disclaimer: The author does not hold a position in any of stocks mentioned in this article, and has no plans to change that position within the next 72 hours."

In addition, several qualitative factors make the company interesting. For example, Stephen Simpson of Kratisto Investing recently wrote about the company's ability to differentiate itself from competitors while Cory Renauer of Moaty Chowder explained the company has significant free cash flow which could be used to propel growth further. These are great issues to consider, but one must first look at a quantitative analysis of the company.In fact, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to determine a potential investment's merits. Here's an updated look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.This model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests tobe suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryFree Cash FlowConclusionRockwell Automation is suitable for the Enterprising Investor but not the more conservative Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned by the insufficient earnings growth over the last ten years, and the high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. Therefore, all Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding with the next stage of the analysis, which is a determination of an estimate of intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.90 in 2011 to an estimated $5.74 for 2015. This level of demonstrated growth is in line with the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 6.3% over the next 7-10 years.The company's recent earnings history shows an average annual growth in EPSmg of around 9.4%. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces such a rate to a more conservative figure, assuming some slowdown will occur, but still returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling within a margin of safety relative to the current price, indicating Rockwell Automation is fairly valued at the present time."
3342215,74695,2015-07-21T12:30:21-04:00,"As a dominant player in the industrial automation industry, Rockwell Automation should benefit enormously from the accelerating trend of industrial automation.Rockwell Automation's growing international presence should help propel growth, especially with the rise in demand from emerging markets like Latin America.The company's architecture/software and control products/solutions segments should continue to experience robust growth in light of the company's growing demand and improving financials.While Rockwell Automation will likely experience some headwinds from the resource-based industries, the company's long-term growth prospects remain stronger than ever.","Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is a leader in the highly promising industrial automation and information solutions industries. The company's industrial automation business in particular has a huge amount of promise, and has contributed enormously to the company's outperformance over the past decade. With the accelerating rate of industrial automation technology adoption in recent years, Rockwell Automation is set to continue its impressive growth.Rockwell Automation has experienced robust sales and profit growth in recent years, nearly doubling its net income over the past four years. Not only does Rockwell Automation continue to have a technological edge in terms of industrial automation technologies and services, but the company is also starting to grow its presence on the international scene. With a large foothold in huge industries such as manufacturing, mining, energy, etc, the company has long-term staying power.Dominant Industry PlayerRockwell Automation currently operates in architecture/software control and control products/solutions. The company is a dominant player in both these industries, as is evident in its Q2 revenues of $674M and $877M respectively. The architecture/software business, which includes Rockwell Automation's control/information platforms, automation components, and software applications, has been one of the company's key business segments.In fact, this segment led the company's Q2 organic growth of 2.7%, and is expected to continue showing strength in the long-term. As customers' appetite for information services/solutions and automation components is only growing in light of the increasingly complex/automated industrial environment, Rockwell Automation's architecture/software control business should continue to outperform. The plethora of solutions offered by Rockwell Automation, such as information solutions and integration services, will become increasingly relevant as automation grows in importance.While Rockwell Automation's control products and solutions business has seen a noticeable YOY downturn, this segment should also experience higher-than-average growth in the long-term. This business segment, which includes things such as intelligent motor control, would also benefit tremendously from the increasing trend of industry automation, giving control products/solutions an even greater role in manufacturing. Despite this segments YOY sales decline of 4.1%, this segment should growing considerably moving forward.Along with notable product lines such as the Allen-Bradley, Rockwell Automation also offers a multitude of information services to help increase industry productivity. Here is a picture of one of the company's new Allen-Bradley PowerFlex 527 AC product, which is used to reduce machine complexity.Source: Rockwell AutomationStrong International PresenceWhile the majority of Rockwell Automation's business is still located in the US, the company is noticeably growing its presence on the international markets. The emerging markets in particular have shown tremendous promise for the company, with its Latin American business experiencing organic growth of 12.8%. This figure far eclipses the company's business in other regions, which experienced growth figures in the low single digit percentages.Despite some major industry headwinds in the oil/gas industry, which accounts for a sizable fraction of Rockwell Automation's business, the company continues to grow its profits. As the company's Q2 YOY growth of 2.7% was brought down significantly by resource-based volatility, most notable in its Canada business decreasing by a whopping 10.8% in Q2 on a YOY basis, the company's growth rate should rise significantly as the resource markets calm down.As industry on the global stage continues to grow rapidly, a larger percentage of Rockwell Automation's business will likely shift overseas. With the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions in particular expected to rise dramatically in GDP, Rockwell Automation has plenty of opportunities on the international front. Although near-term demand in the Asia Pacific region may be held back slightly due to a slowdown of business in China, this region should show increasing promise with time.Robust/Improving FinancialsWhile Rockwell Automation's revenues have grown marginally over the past few years, its profitability has seen a sharp increase. With a net income growth rate that has exceeded that of its sales, the company has clearly seen some notable improvements on the financial front. Rockwell Automation's operating margins have been a main driving force behind the company's improving profitability. The company's main business segments have seen an increase in operating margins both on a YOY and YTD basis.For Rockwell Automation's architecture/software business, the company's YOY and YTD operating margins improved by 210 and 140 basis points respectively. The company's control products/solutions front has been even more impressive, with a YOY and YTD improvement of 300 and 220 basis points respectively. With a 2015 fiscal year sales guidance of around $6.4B, the company remains near all-time highs. As Rockwell Automation's margins will likely continue to improve given the demand trend for automation technologies and information solutions, the company still has much more room to grow.ObstaclesResource-based business have not fared well recently, with commodities like oil and gas experiencing tremendous industry pressures. As a large percentage of Rockwell Automation's customers are in resource-based businesses, the company itself should also experience some growth troubles in these arenas. Despite this, Rockwell Automation's increasingly diversified business should help blunt the impact of the near-term headwinds in resource-based businesses.ConclusionWith industrial automation starting to gain some serious traction, Rockwell Automation is set to gain tremendously. At a market capitalization of $16.65B and a P/E ratio of 20, Rockwell Automation is already one of the most valuable companies in this space. Despite its impressive valuation, the company still has more room to grow given the rapid progress being made on the automation front. As industry becomes more complex as a result of automation, the company's information services should also experience increasing demand. Rockwell Automation's surge over the past decade will likely continue, making this company a solid investment."
3734586,96566,2015-12-04T15:06:24-05:00,"Rockwell Automation has a highly cash generative underlying business with increasing cash return on invested capital and free cash flow growth well in excess of top-line revenue growth.The company continues to benefit from margin expansion, and sustainable stock buybacks from free cash flow have led to 16% CAGR in the per-share dividend since 2010.The long-term trend towards greater automation offers future growth, although there are strong short-term headwinds from the strong US dollar and uncertain global economy.With the stock currently trading at 13x free cash flow and offering a 2.75% dividend yield current levels offer an attractive entry point for long-term investors.","Rockwell Automation (NYSE: ROK) is a leading provider of industrial automation solutions and a compelling investment case for long-term orientated dividend growth investors. The business operates in two sectors; Architecture & Software and Control Products & Solutions, with the former consisting of software and automation component products and the latter including integrated systems and product services. Both segments are well placed to benefit from the long-term drive toward increasing productivity via industrial automation.Benefiting from margin and CROIC expansionLooking at the segments in isolation and Architecture & Software is the higher margin business, with average operating margins of 25.2% versus 12.3% for Control Products & Solutions between fiscal years 2010-2015. Interestingly though both segments have enjoyed expanding margins over that time period, which have largely driven the 15% compounded annual growth in operating income versus 5% annual top-line growth over the same period, with the total group operating margin coming in at 18% for fiscal year 2015.The underlying business is also extremely cash generative, with the company continuing to post very high cash returns on invested capital (CROIC). For the period 2010 to 2015 the company has generated, on average, approximately $22 in free cash flow for every $100 of capital invested in the business. More importantly, however, is that the trend has been consistently increasing -- with Rockwell going from a CROIC level of 16% in fiscal year 2010 to 28% in fiscal year 2015, largely driven by the 20% compounded annual growth in operating cash flow and the decreasing level of capital expenditures. The increasing trends of both the company's operating margins and CROIC is not only testament to the quality of Rockwell's management and their operations but is also potentially indicative of the competitive advantages that they enjoy over rivals. Indeed the metrics hold up favorably compared to peers Emerson (NYSE: EMR) and Eaton (NYSE: ETN).DGI Case: Free Cash Flow MonsterRockwell has increased its dividend in each of the past six fiscal years and in 14 of the last 15 fiscal years (2009 being the exception in which the dividend stayed constant). More importantly though the underlying free cash flow metrics are very strong, with free cash flow growth averaging a huge annual compounded rate of 24% since 2010 due to a combination of operating cash flow growth, reduced capital spending and the effects of stock buybacks.Consequently the dividend has grown at a rate of approximately 15% over the same time period but due to the rapid rate of free cash flow growth the pay-out ratio has actually been declining, with the dividend pay-out ratio at approximately 33% of free cash flow in 2015 compared to 45% in 2010. This leaves the company with plenty of scope to continue their capital return program and/or fund acquisitions from cash flow without leveraging the balance sheet, as well as extending their recent dividend growth record.In terms of Rockwell's continuing capital return program the outstanding shares in issue have decreased from 179.9m in 2006 to 135.7m in fiscal year 2015 -- or at a compounded annual rate of about 3% of the outstanding float per year. Looking ahead and the company could maintain a similar rate of buybacks, sustainable from cash flow, which would provide further support to per-share free cash flow and the dividend.Outlook and ValuationThe nature of Rockwell's business and its industrial and manufacturing customer base make it heavily dependent on the health of the wider economy and on industrial production. Fourth quarter fiscal 2015 earnings and revenue both missed, whilst full year 2015 earnings of $6.40 per-share also missed Rockwell's guidance of $6.55-$6.70 due to the continuing strength of the US dollar and a sluggish economy. Looking ahead to fiscal year 2016 and sales guidance has been lowered to around -4% year over year, due to a combination of projected lower US industrial spending, continuing capital expenditure cuts in the commodities sector and a slowing China. Overall, however, the wider trend of industrial automation remains very much intact, and as an industry leader Rockwell is very well placed to capture a significant portion of that.Currently the shares are valued at approximately 17x forward twelve month earnings estimates, which is broadly in-line with the industry mean, with the stock currently trading about 15% lower than its summer high. Interestingly, though, the stock is trading at only 13x trailing year free cash flow versus an industry mean of approximately 17x, which largely reflects the macro uncertainty listed above and the lower guidance for fiscal year 2016. Using a DCF analysis with an assumed five-year cash-flow growth rate of 6% and a discount rate of 9%, then I calculate fair value to be in the region of $140 per-share, which represents upside of approximately 40% from current levels. Given Rockwell's stellar balance sheet, current dividend yield of approximately 2.75%, premium fundamental metrics and broad scope for future sustainable dividend growth, the current price represents an attractive entry point for long-term, dividend growth-oriented investors -- notwithstanding the potential short-term headwinds from the wider economy."
4124023,25120,2017-11-13T02:49:27-05:00,"Emerson is looking to acquire Rockwell Automation in a +$27 billion deal.The deal makes strategic sense, but multiples are too elevated and Emerson's track record is not good in terms of dealmaking.Earnings and synergy contribution are largely offset by dilution and interest expenses as pro-forma leverage will be very high.For these reasons I find it very easy to avoid Emerson at this point in time despite a pullback last week.","Rockwell Automation (ROK) is right to reject the $27.6 billion unsolicited offer made by Emerson Electric (EMR). While both companies have stellar true long term track records, but the truth is that Emerson has been lagging in shareholder and operational returns in the past decade. As its shares have been largely stagnant, shares of Rockwell have nearly tripled over this time period.That is for good a good reason as Rockwell has superior margins and revenue growth per share, while Emerson is plagued by poor M&A decisions in the past. While Emerson is much bigger and the strategic rationale behind a deal makes sense, a fat multiple, leveraged balance sheet and lack of earnings accretion, combined with questionable ""track record"", makes is very easy to stay out of this situation.Emerson Electric has been willing to buy Rockwell Automation in a $27.6 billion deal which looks to be driven by empire building, as it is trying to make a huge deal to mask underperformance of its own business. Emerson has been willing to pay $215 per share for Rockwell, comprised out of a 50/50% cash and stock component. Rockwell has rejected the offer, after Emerson has already upped it from a previous offer at $200 per share.Emerson has been selling underperforming assets, such as network power in order to increase the focus on automation as well. Unfortunately Emerson´s expertise in automation has been focused on a wrong industry, being oil and gas. The expertise of Rockwell, which is strong in software and equipment being used for automation and robotics, appears to have a much better long term growth profile.As Emerson has been reorganising the business, without much revenue and margin growth to show for, the timing to pursue such a mega deal seems very odd and inconsistent. In fact recent dealmaking has been questionable in my opinion, including the $3.15 billion acquisition of Pentair´s valves and controls business. Emerson furthermore spent half a billion to buy Paradigm. While this is a software business, it actually increases the reliance on oil and gas again.A $27 billion price tag for Rockwell Automation would represent a huge premium. After all, shares started the year around $134, as the deal tag would represent a 60% year to date return after price action has been remarkably strong in September and October. Despite this big run and the fat multiples at which Rockwell is trading, management of this company has refused to talk to Emerson.Rockwell Automation has seen real momentum this past year, having just released its results. Comparable sales growth of +6% is very solid, as the company expects 3.5-6.5% growth for the upcoming year. The company is very profitable and reported segment earnings of $1.23 billion on sales of $6.31 billion this year, for margins of nearly 20%.That is before one-time items and corporate cost allocation of $76 million, as normalised operating margins still exceed 18% of sales.The company reported earnings of $6.35 per share and adjusted earnings of $6.76 per share. With net cash holdings of nearly $700 million, equivalent to roughly $5 per share, the $215 offer values operating assets of Rockwell at roughly $210 per share. It goes without saying that multiples are elevated at 31 times adjusted earnings. Rockwell posts operating profits of $1.15 billion. If we would anticipate synergies being equal to 5% of sales, which looks ambitious, that translates into synergies of +$300 million per year. That would boost earnings power of Rockwell to $1.45 billion on an operating basis. After applying $75 million in interest expenses (paid by Rockwell) and a 20% tax rate, after tax earnings could hit $1.1 billion, for earnings of close to $8.50 per share. While that looks a lot better, multiples remain elevated at 25 times earnings as realisation of those synergies is quite a task (given that Rockwell is quite efficient already), while synergies take time to be realised and probably involve sizable upfront costs.Furthermore I believe that while Rockwell´s prospects are very good, they have been good for a while as I am not that impressed by its past performance. Sales have ""only"" grown from $5 billion in 2007 to $6.3 billion. It should be said that Rockwell continues to operate with a strong financial position and has retired one in every five shares over the past decade. This has translated into revenue growth per share of +50% over the past decade, a modest performance if you ask me given the prospects.Let's put some math at work. Emerson is much bigger, yet its underlying sales were up just 1% this past year to $15.3 billion. It should be said that the company has seen some acceleration in its sales, as underlying sales were up 3% in the final quarter of the year. These same underlying sales are seen up 5-7% this upcoming year.Emerson ended Q4 with $3.1 billion in cash and $4.7 billion in debt, for a modest net debt load of $1.6 billion. The 645 million shares now trade at $62 per share, for a $40 billion equity valuation and near $42 billion enterprise valuation. The combined enterprise valuation could jump to $69 billion following a deal at $215 per share, as Emerson´s net debt load of $1.6 billion would jump to $15.1 billion, or to $14.4 billion if we account for Rockwell´s net cash position of $700 million.Emerson posted EBITDA of $2.3 billion last year while Rockwell's contribution was limited to $1.3 billion. The $3.6 billion EBITDA number would imply that the combination would be pretty leveraged. Net debt of $14.4 billion translates into 4.0 times leverage, or to 3.7 times if we factor in some $300 million in synergies.Emerson posted operating earnings of nearly $1.7 billion on $15.3 billion in sales for pretty paltry margins of 11%. Reported earnings of $2.54 per share pretty closely match the adjusted earnings metric of $2.64 per share. The combination posts sales of $21.6 billion and operating earnings of $2.8 billion, or $3.1 billion after accounting for $300 million in synergies. After applying 4% interest costs on a net debt load of nearly $15 billion, interest costs come in at $600 million. Applying a 20% tax rate, net earnings might amount to $2.0 billion. Emerson will need to issue $13.5 billion worth of equity, which at $62 per share involves the issuance of 217 million shares.That dilutes the share count to 862 million shares, implying that reported earnings come in at $2.32 per share. This implies that the deal would actually be dilutive to shareholders of Emerson, even as the growth and margin profile would become better.I have not had high hopes for Emerson as I have not been impressed by the sale and purchase of certain assets in recent years, and the associated prices which were involved with those deals. In this October article I actually compared Emerson in some sense to GE, as it too has had a history of buying high and selling low. Emerson's margins are quite lacklustre and even if they could hit peak levels again of nearly 20%, when oil and gas was booming, I calculated that earning per share would be limited to $4 per share.Based on the $27 billion price tag, Emerson would be glad to acquire Rockwell at 4.3 times sales and 24 times operating earnings. While synergies of potentially $300 million could be lucrative and valuable, I continue to believe that a deal would be expensive. Even if I would apply a 20 times multiple to these synergies, after applying a 20% tax rate, they could represent $4-5 billion in value. Emerson, by the way claims that capitalised synergies are worth $6 billion, without providing a calculation to this number.Emerson on the other hand trades at just 2.7 times sales and at a similar 24 times operating earnings multiple. While earnings multiples are similar, and elevated at both firms, it is clear that Emerson has more margin potential given the levels of margins and turnaround potential of the Pentair´s valves business. In this sense, Emerson is acquiring (albeit a great business) at a very high price, at least if it succeeds in its ambitions.A deal will be very complicated, might potentially involve even a higher price, will not be accretive in my opinion, and while it strategically makes sense, the financial math does not. The pro-forma business would become stronger and better positioned, yet would be saddled with >3.5 times leverage as earnings would not improve in the short term. At the same time, the payout ratio would be very elevated, as Emerson pays out nearly $2 per share in dividends to its shareholders.For all these reasons investors have rightfully sent shares lower from a recent high of $67 to $62 in recent days and weeks, but that move is not sufficient to create appeal as the situation remains highly uncertain."
3330835,24361,2015-07-17T11:12:16-04:00,"Focusing on Layer 1 and Layer 2 software and controls has created an attractive margin and ROIC profile, while avoiding some of the deeply cyclical automation end-markets.Rockwell is frequently mentioned as a takeover candidate, but its differentiated approach should allow it to remain independent if it so chooses, and overseas cash could plug some product gaps.Rockwell shares have been a strong outperformer in the automation space, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of obvious undervaluation.","There are a lot of things about how Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) runs its business that stand out as different from the likes of ABB (NYSE:ABB), Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), Emerson (NYSE:EMR), and Honeywell (NYSE:HON), but it's hard to argue with the results. A strong position in software and controls and a good operating structure have supported attractive margins and returns on capital, while a disciplined sense of what the company is about seems to lead the company away from value-destroying empire building. Looking at the shares, Rockwell lags only Honeywell over the last year and five years and far surpasses ABB, Siemens, and Emerson, and I believe you could argue that Honeywell's share price performance is not all that tied to its automation business.I have a lot of confidence in the thesis that Rockwell Automation is a high-quality automation company, but I'm not as confident that the shares are a bargain today. I don't necessarily buy into the ""peak margin"" idea and I believe Rockwell's exposure to less-cyclical markets like consumer products is a positive, but it's tough to get the numbers to work. That said, Rockwell remains an appealing acquisition candidate as well as potential acquirer in its own right and M&A activity could drive more value.Sitting Comfortably In The Middle Of the PyramidAnalysts and industry participants will often portray the automation industry as a pyramid, with enterprise-level software at the top, plant-level controls in the middle, and instrumentation/equipment at the base. Rockwell has a solid position in manufacturing execution system software (which is used to manage, monitor, and control manufacturing) alongside the likes of Honeywell, Schneider, and Aspen (NASDAQ:AZPN), but it is particularly strong in Layer 2 controls.Rockwell's controllers basically serve as the ""brains"" for factory and process automation systems. The company's Logix programmable logic controller (or PLC) platform has roughly 20% share in the market, making it one of the largest players alongside Siemens and Mitsubishi. The company's distributed control system (or DCS) business is less significant, with single-digit market share that significantly trails market leaders like ABB, Emerson, and Honeywell.Rockwell has some presence at Layer 1, but it's not really a strength of the company. Unlike ABB, it doesn't have a proprietary presence in robotics, nor much of a presence in motors. It does offer a range of motor control products, though, as well as drives, sensors, relays, and so on.I think this is a pretty attractive array of businesses. If you look at where the value in the automation industry lies, Rockwell is there. Robotics and motors aren't bad businesses, but controls and software offer better margins. I would also argue that these are stickier businesses - replacing Layer 2 controls or Layer 3 MES and ERP systems is significantly more disruptive than swapping out robots.Different Is BetterOne of the noticeable trends in automation has been a consolidation of the industry and a drive toward ""one-stop shops"". There is not much that Siemens or Schneider don't do, and ABB likewise covers a pretty wide swath of the market. With the notable exception of Yokogawa, M&A has driven this process. ABB, Emerson, Honeywell, Schneider, and Siemens have all been willing and active acquirers.Rockwell is different. Relative to its peers, this company really does work and play well with others. The company has an alliance with leading robotics company Fanuc, as well as partnerships with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Endress+Hauser. Rockwell is also the only provider of an open-source software platform in the industry and it has advanced a plug-and-play Ethernet IP approach. Given this more open approach, I don't think Rockwell has to be a one-stop shop, and so it maintains the luxury of picking and choosing to compete in areas with attractive margins and where it has competitive advantages.Rockwell also targets different markets. Oil & gas, chemicals, and power gen make up significant share of the automation industry (on the process side), but Rockwell has considerably less exposure to these markets than most of its peers. In contrast, Rockwell has a sizable presence in the much less cyclical consumer products market (food, personal care, pharmaceuticals, etc.), as well as presences in discrete automation markets like electronics/semiconductors and auto assembly.To Buy … Or To Be Bought?Given its strong presence in controls and software, Rockwell has long been tapped as an attractive acquisition target. ABB and Emerson in particular would look like logical M&A partners, as Rockwell's strengths (particularly in PLC and MES software) would offset notable weaknesses in these two companies' portfolios and create true one-stop shops. Rockwell won't come cheap, though, and I think the board feels empowered to drive a very hard bargain. Given the price and the likely perception that whoever buys Rockwell is buying after a long cyclical run, a deal for Rockwell may not be so easy.On the flip side, I think Rockwell could be an acquirer if it wanted to be. Acquiring its partner Endress+Hauser would be one way to leverage its overseas cash hoard and upgrade its process automation offerings. A deal for AVEVA (AVV.L) or Aspen could likewise make some sense from the perspective of bulking up/rounding out the software business.Just for the sake of speculation, I'll throw this out there - maybe Rockwell could someday attract a bid from a company like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Google is clearly interested in robotics and automation and industrial automation may be too big of an opportunity to ignore. Said differently, if Google is pursuing a self-driving car, is it so ridiculous to think that it could be interested in factory automation?Estimating The ValueI think Rockwell can generate long-term revenue growth in the mid-single digits by exploiting its strengths in Layer 1 and Layer 2 discrete and process automation. Emerging competition from China is likely more of a threat at Layer 3 and a bigger threat to companies like ABB, Fanuc, and Siemens. On the margin side, though, I'm not sure there's as much upside here given the already strong level of performance. Were the company to expand its Layer 1 presence (more software), that could skew the margin profile higher. As is, I'm looking for modest FCF margin improvement from here and some incremental FCF growth relative to sales.Discounted back, that brings me up short of today's price. So too with EV/EBTIDA and ROE-P/BV. None of these approaches suggest that Rockwell is meaningfully undervalued right now. Perhaps I'm underestimating the company's growth potential, or maybe all these years of outperformance has left the shares a little lacking in upside.The Bottom LineI can create some upside to my DCF-based valuation if I goose the long-term FCF growth rate into the 7%-8% range, but that seems aggressive. With that, this is a good example of a situation where I really like the company and I'm less certain of the stock. I'll openly acknowledge that valuation is an inexact process and investors often have to be willing to pay up for quality. That said, with a lot of concerning signs regarding the health of the U.S. and EU economies, I'm not so inclined to be aggressive here right now."
3282525,36201,2015-06-26T03:09:29-04:00,"Rockwell Automation's 2.1% forward dividend yield is unappealing.Its operating income growth has averaged just 4.36% over the past ten years.Going forward, long-term consensus estimates suggest 10% growth.I show readers how core growth of just 10% can lead to a total return of 13.5%.","I have a problem that many of today's investors can relate to. I want to invest in well-established, dividend-paying companies that report predictable earnings. Sadly, few of these companies are growing their core business at a satisfactory rate. Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is a prime example. The company's operating earnings grew at an annual rate of just 4.4% from $773 million to $1.18 billion over the ten-year period beginning 2005.After shedding the low-margin power control business, a sharpened focus on flexible factory automation solutions should boost growth in the years ahead. I'm not alone in this assumption, as the consensus long-term growth rate estimate from S&P Capital IQ suggests 10% core growth going forward.On its own, core growth of 10% for a dividend growth candidate sounds great. As you'll see factoring in the company's high profitability, will make it even more attractive. In fact, recent dividend growth and the presence of a wide economic moat earned the company a spot on the Moaty Chowder watchlist. In the absence of a major macroeconomic meltdown, the company's durable advantages over the competition make hitting that estimate seem likely.Rather than try to predict the future, I want to show you how a profitable company can provide satisfactory returns well above the growth rate of its core business. Doing so requires significant amounts of free cash flow, so let's begin there.Cost of Core GrowthFree cash flow can be measured as cash from operations minus the capital expenditures required to maintain those operations. You can also think of FCF as cash that a company can - at least in theory - return safely to shareholders. For the purposes of this exercise, you could also consider FCF as management's main tool for raising shareholders' total return above the rate of core growth. As you can imagine, companies with established and highly profitable operations can expand those operations at relatively little cost.At Rockwell, this is clearly the case, as FCF has averaged 90% of earnings over the past decade. This suggests that management has a great deal of the company's bottom line available for increasing total return. Let's see how that can be used to boost it above the rate of core growth.Adding up returnsAs mentioned above, strong positioning in the factory automation industry has led analysts reporting to S&P Capital IQ to estimate operating earnings to rise at about 10% annually. Now, here's where a lot of readers get excited about what is additive and what isn't. Over the past twelve months, Rockwell used 39% of earnings to pay dividends. Provided the payout ratio remains constant, the total dividend payout should rise at the same pace as operating earnings. This allows us to add the current yield to core growth, and brings our total return to 11.97%.That's a nice return, but we still need to include the benefits of excess earnings. Earlier, I defined FCF as cash that can be returned to shareholders. Dividend payouts almost never exceed FCF, so what are the leftovers worth? To answer that, we first need to find out how much is left over. You can calculate Rockwell's required reinvestment ratio by dividing expected core growth by its return on equity. Over the past twelve months, the company's ROE has been 32.7%, suggesting a 30.6% required retention ratio.From the $6.30 in EPS that Rockwell produced over the past twelve months, $2.46 was marked for dividend payments, and $1.93 was required for reinvestment. To find the third component of total return, we'll err on the side of conservatism and assume it will be used to repurchase shares. As you should be well aware by now, EPS is calculated as net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. We all prefer growth of the numerator, but reducing the denominator does the job just as well.The $1.91 per share left over following required retention and dividend payments is enough to reduce the total number of shares outstanding by 1.53%. Including this third component brings us to a total return of 13.5%.Sensitivity testAll these calculations seem nice and tidy, but a great many assumptions about the future have been made. The effect changes in the rate of operating income growth could have are straightforward. Less obvious is the magnifying effect a reduced share price has on the share reduction tailwind. A bear market might not help your blood pressure, but it does increase the number of shares likely to be repurchased. This is why I like to include a table that incorporates potential changes in core growth on top and average share price going forward on the side, with the total return as derived above in the center.As you can see, with mature, profitable, dividend-paying companies, the price you pay and the price the company pays to repurchase its own shares affects total return almost as heavily as operating income growth. If you've been avoiding well-established business like Rockwell Automation because you don't feel they can offer adequate returns, I hope this exercise has helped change your mind."

The firm is well-positioned to take advantage of the shift to smart manufacturing.New products and software allow users of Rockwell to operate facilities more efficiently. The firm continues to build its competitive profile.Rockwell has financial flexibility and solid free cash flow generation. The company's dividend prospects remain tied to these factors and are similarly impressive.Lets take an in-depth look at Rockwell's performance and derive our fair value estimate of the company.,"By Paul TaitRockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is a top player in industrial automation. From making customized products to notifying supervisors of maintenance requirements, Rockwell's offerings can be used to monitor nearly everything on a company's factory floor. Smart manufacturing is a rapidly-emerging market, and Rockwell is on top of its game.Rockwell is focused on improving its competitive profile and driving revenue diversification to augment its financial flexibility. Case in point, the company and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) recently announced additions to their Converged Planetwide Ethernet to help users address constantly changing security practices. The latest security expansions use technology from both companies and include features to help build a more secure network across the globe.Rockwell boasts a strong balance sheet, and this coupled with its focus on productivity should enable it to continue to invest in innovation. Another residual effect of the company's financial flexibility and strong free cash flow generation is Rockwell's outstanding dividend prospects. The company scores a 2.7, or a rating of GOOD, on the Dividend Cushion ratio, a measure of the safety of a firm's future dividends. We rate its dividend growth potential as EXCELLENT.Rockwell's competitive profile make result in what Warren Buffett calls an economic moat, but what good is a moat without a castle to protect? That's why castle analysis (magnitude) is just as important as moat analysis (duration). We have no concerns in this area, and we rate Rockwell Automation's Economic Castle as attractive, an impressive rating for an industrial business.Let's dig deeper into this fantastic business and derive the intrinsic value of the company's stock price.Rockwell Automation's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Rockwell Automation is the world's largest company dedicated to industrial automation. The firm's flagship Allen-Bradley and Rockwell software product brands are recognized for innovation and excellence. It was founded in 1903 and is headquartered in Wisconsin.• We agree with Rockwell that automation is a great market. The firm benefits from a number of tailwinds: an aging installed base, the need for productivity, the growing middle class in emerging markets, and wage inflation.• Rockwell Automation's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation and ValueRisk ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generatingeconomic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.• Rockwell Automation has some noteworthy long term goals. The firm is targeting annual sales growth of 6-8% and double-digit yearly earnings per share growth. It expects to generate 20%+ annual return on invested capital and convert more than 100% of net income to free cash flow. By 2017, it plans to generate ~60% of sales outside of the US.• The company is facing a number of challenges at the moment, however, including softer industrial production growth and a reduced outlook for oil and gas. Reported revenue may face some pressure but better margins should drive adjusted EPS in the range of $6.50-$6.80 for 2015.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisFrom our point of view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Rockwell Automation's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 44.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.4%.As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFree cash flow seems to be automatic at Rockwell Automation. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Rockwell Automation's free cash flow margin has averaged about 12.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Rockwell Automation, cash flow from operations increased about 44% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 1% over the same time period.Through the first six months of fiscal 2015, Rockwell reported cash from operations of $553.4 million and capital expenditures of $58 million, resulting in free cash flow of $495.4 million for the period. The firm is ahead of its pace in 2014.Valuation AnalysisThis is the most important portion of our analysis. Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive our fair value estimate of the company.Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Rockwell Automation's shares are worth between $86-$130 each. Rockwell Automation's current stock price is ~$124, at the high end of our fair value range. At this time we feel there is significantly more downside risk than upside potential based on our fair value estimate.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $108 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 18.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 10.9 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 2.4% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 3.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 21.6%, which is above Rockwell Automation's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.9% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Rockwell Automation, we use a 10.4% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $108 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example).After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock.In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Rockwell Automation. We think the firm is attractive below $86 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $130 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Rockwell Automation's fair value at this point in time to be about $108 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Rockwell Automation's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $139 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $108 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpWe like Rockwell Automation and its fundamentals a great deal. The company generates significant free cash flow, which will further augment its already solid balance sheet. Rockwell has a solid competitive profile and a number of tailwinds yet to be fully realized.Management has some ambitious long-term goals, and it is looking to the right areas for improvement. It's hard not to like Rockwell's focus on profitability, turning profit into free cash flow, and return on invested capital, especially as industrial production softens and the demand for oil and gas decrease. Both trends will negatively impact Rockwell's top line performance.Though we are fans of Rockwell's business fundamentals and we believe it is positioned well in the strong automation market, we're staying on the sidelines. The firm is not undervalued on a discounted cash flow basis, and shares are trading in the upper half of our fair value range. Rockwell is currently rated a 6 on the Valuentum Buying Index. We like newsletter holdings the best.PerformanceIn the spirit of transparency, we reveal the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index, our stock selection methodology, in a case study of the ratings spanning September 2013 through September 2014. Higher-rated entities (6-10) have been shown to outperform lower-rated entities (1-5). Past results are not a guarantee of future performance. Thank you for reading!"
3206966,36201,2015-05-23T18:11:01-04:00,Rockwell Automation's current yield is just 2.07%.Despite the low yield the stock looks like a strong candidate for a dividend growth portfolio.Recent dividend growth has been strong and the economic moat should allow the trend to continue.,"Rockwell Automation's (NYSE:ROK) current dividend yield is a paltry 2.07%. That's hardly enough to get an income investor out of bed. For those of you with many more years ahead of retirement, there are several reasons to suspect the stock could be a strong addition to a dividend growth portfolio.Seven years into a bull run, juicy dividend yields are far and few between. In response I've been applying the Chowder Rule to find potential portfolio additions likely to provide a satisfactory level of income in the long term. It's a simple test that adds current yield to the five-year dividend growth rate. For a stock yielding less than 3%, the sum should exceed 15. Over the past five years, Rockwell Automation has raised payments at an annual rate of 15.6%, meeting the requirement with ease.Strong dividend growth is wonderful, but it's only the first of two criteria that must be met to earn a place on my Moaty Chowder watchlist. All companies on the list also posses strong competitive advantages, often called an economic moat. This factor is much harder to screen for, but well worth the effort. When you consider the high cost of switching to a competing automation platform, it seems Rockwell is a perfect fit for Moaty Chowder. Let's see how well it ranks against the competition.Near-term outlookWith such a low current yield, strong growth in the near term becomes increasingly important. When Rockwell reported fiscal second quarter earnings late last month, increased efficiency was the theme. Unfavorable foreign exchange sent sales down 3.1% on year, but widening margins pleased the market.Excluding the negative effects of foreign exchange, sales actually rose significantly in all geographic segments except Canada. Top line growth in a tepid macroeconomic environment was encouraging, but it was dramatic margin expansion that caught my eye.ROK Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsFor the year, management reduced its revenue expectation somewhat, but widened margins kept the earnings estimate even at about $6.65 per share.Looking even further ahead, the average of 22 analysts reporting to S&P Capital IQ is expecting fiscal 2016 earnings to come in at $7.05 per share. This represents an annual growth rate of 6.9% over the two-year period beginning last October. When you consider the company's exposure to energy and basic materials, this is just outstanding. That said, it is exposed, so for now I'm awarding four of a possible five points in this section.Dividend historyNow that we've looked forward a bit, let's take a look the history of Rockwell's dividend policy. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, but it does indicate ability and willingness to increase value for shareholders. Scores in this section are based on longevity and rate of growth.After just 5 consecutive years of raising payments, the level of Rockwell's commitment is still unclear. This will result in a penalty, but luckily growth of the distribution has been robust. Over the past three-, five-, and ten-year periods, it raised payments at annual rates of 15.5%, 15.6%, and 13.7% respectively.The three- and five-year rates seem awfully fast, but they're both below average for companies with between five and ten consecutive years of increases -- often referred to as dividend challengers. Less-than-average dividend growth and a short history of increases earn the company just two of a possible five points here.Dividend sustainabilityDespite being lower than the average challenger, Rockwell's dividend growth has been fast enough to speed you toward retirement. At 15.5%, investors purchasing shares today would begin receiving a 10% dividend yield on their initial investment by 2026.Of course, that will never happen if the company has pushed distributions to unsustainable levels. When looking for companies likely to continue growing dividends at an acceptable pace, I like to start with the payout ratio. This is simply the percentage of profits required to make dividend payments.ROK Dividend data by YChartsOver the past five years, earnings per share have more or less risen in line with the distribution. As a result the payout ratio is at a very comfortable 41%. At this level Rockwell appears more than capable to maintain an acceptable dividend growth rate. As such, it earns a full five points in this section.Competitive advantageNow that we have a good idea of what to expect from the distribution, it's time to focus on factors that should allow it to continue growing for many years to come. In theory all profit margins would fall to zero in a perfectly competitive environment. Without an economic moat to protect it from the competition, Rockwell's dividend growth would slow to a crawl.Luckily its moat appears very wide. Other companies produce industrial automation and controls products, but Rockwell is the industry's largest pure play. Without the need to plow automation profits into other operating segments, the company has an increased opportunity to stay a step ahead.Many of Rockwell's products are designed to scale up as its clients grow. Once integrated into the manufacturing process, switching costs become exorbitant. In the end, potential savings from switching to a competitor is unlikely to result in a net positive. With this in mind, I'm giving the company a full five points in this section.ProfitabilityThe nice thing about economic moats is that they last an awfully long time. In fact, they often outlast good, and bad, management teams. Here's where we see how effectively the company is allocating its available capital.In my opinion the best way to gauge a company's profitability is to measure its rate of return on invested capital against the costs of that capital. Rockwell is one of few companies that actually provides detailed information about its ROIC and the inputs used right in its earnings press release.With a ROIC of 32.0% over the twelve-month period ended last March, you can understand its eagerness to share. This isn't a recent anomaly either; during the same period a year earlier ROIC was 30.6%. With a weighted average cost of capital around 10.2%, the company is more than capable of increasing shareholder value. With this in mind, I'm awarding a full five points here.Bottom LineA wide product portfolio is paying off for the company, as evidenced by recently reported demand from automotive and consumer product industries. Rockwell's success in new fields is encouraging, but exposure to the embattled energy and basic materials sectors is going to pressure sales going forward. However, the company's ability to grow, however modestly in such an unfavorable macroeconomic environment, is highly encouraging.A global uptick in industrial production would almost certainly be followed by another point for the company, but it hardly needs it. With a score of 21, Rockwell Automation isn't leading the Moaty Chowder rankings, but that should be high enough to receive a good amount of attention from me in the quarters ahead. All rankings to date, and a methodology discussion, are available here."
3091636,84886,2015-04-22T15:38:40-04:00,"Rockwell Automation is the leading global provider of industrial automation products that enhance the efficiency of factory floors, and enjoys a strong competitive advantage stemming from high customer switching costs.
        The company's focus on internal growth through innovation and external growth through acquisitions, as well as growing economies in developing countries around the world should ensure continuous long-term profitable growth.
        The company's stock is currently undervalued and offers the chance to buy an excellent company at an attractive price.","The CompanyRockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) is the leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve greater efficiency levels on factory floors. The company has two operating segments; Architecture & Software and Control Products & Solutions. Both segments operate globally in more than 80 countries around the world and serve customers in the food and beverage, transportation, oil and gas, metals, mining and life sciences markets. Products include motor starters, signaling devices, relays, sensors and motors, according to the company's 2014 annual report and 10-K.Many factors contribute to Rockwell's strong competitive advantage and superior industry position relative to its competitors. Such factors include high customer switching costs, open source architecture, large size and research & development capabilities, deep industry knowledge and 111 years of industry experience.High switching costs exist in the company's Logix automation control platform. When manufacturers install a new automation platform, it usually involves moving many critical processes into a central control system, and as a result such platforms become entrenched in a manufacturer's production system once installed. Converting to a different platform would be very costly in terms of production disruptions that customers usually stick with a platform once they install it.The open source nature of Rockwell's automation software is another source of competitive advantage, since it allows applications to be installed on an add-on basis on top of competing software, with no need for customers to change their entire software package into a Rockwell system. This provides Rockwell with an easy entry point to try and sell more of its products and solutions to customers and establish a long-term relationship with them.The company's size, strong balance sheet and cash hoard allows it to pursue additional growth opportunities through investing in R&D and introducing new innovative products, and by acquiring other companies that add to the range of products offered by Rockwell.The ExpansionAccording to a United Nations report from 2013, the world's population will reach an estimated 9.6 billion people by 2050. Growing economies and populations around the world will continue to create an increased demand for food, infrastructure and all sorts of manufactured products that people need and want. In addition, developed countries in North America and Europe will need to replace an aging installed base. These trends will provide a long-term tailwind for a competitively strong company like Rockwell Automation.In addition to favourable secular trends around the world, Rockwell continues to enhance its competitive position and support its growth through product innovation and external acquisitions. In 2014, Rockwell acquired two companies, the first being vMonitor, a technology company that provides wireless solutions to the oil and gas industry. Rockwell also acquired Jacobs Automation, a company that specializes in intelligent track motion control for machine builders. The company is also focusing its research & development efforts on the concept of The Connected Enterprise, which aims to drive company-wide business value and efficiency by closely integrating industrial assets and the rest of the organization in order to convert data into useful information, which helps an organization's management make better operational decisions.The NumbersRockwell Automation has been growing its sales by an average of 8.8% a year in the past 5 years, while earnings per share have grown by 30% a year, on average, in the same time period. Return on equity has never been less than 31% in the past 5 years, and has been at an average rate of 36% during that period, which confirms the presence of a competitive advantage. Furthermore, the company's strong competitive advantage is also confirmed by an average free cash flow/sales rate of 10.6% during the past 5 years, an indication of a strong level of free cash flow generation from the company's operations. Debt/equity ratio was at 0.35 in the latest quarter, which is very manageable considering a quick ratio of 1.71 and an interest coverage ratio of 20.The current P/E ratio (trailing 12 months) is 18.7, and with an EPS growth rate of 30% this would give it a PE-G ratio of 0.62, which means the stock is significantly undervalued at the current price of $114. The current dividend yield of 2.16% is adequate and should provide a stable and growing income for investors as the company continues to increase its dividend year in and year out.Therefore, based on its size, strong competitive advantages and favourable population and economic growth trends around the world, Rockwell Automation Inc. is a stock that offers a growing dividend income and future share price appreciation to long-term investors and looks attractive for investment at the current price level."

        Earnings per share and revenue beat expectations.
        Organic sales increased 2.1%.
        Generated $178.6 million of free cash flow.
        The company's stock has reacted by increased more than 2%.","Rockwell Automation (NYSE: ROK), one of the world's leading providers of industrial power, control, and information solutions, released first quarter earnings before the market opened this morning and its stock has responded by rising over 2%. Let's take a look at the most important statistics and updates from the report to determine if this could be the start of a sustained rally higher and to decide if we should consider initiating long-term positions today.The Better-Than-Expected ResultsHere's a summary of Rockwell's first quarter earnings compared to Wall Street's expectations and its results in the same period a year ago:Rockwell's adjusted earnings per share increased 11.6% and its revenue decreased 1.1% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014, as net income increased 8.5% to $224.8 million and organic sales increased 2.1%. In the company's Control Products & Solutions segment, revenue decreased 3.3% to $866.6 million, as organic sales decreased 0.3% and currency translation reduced sales by 3.2%. In its Architecture & Software segment, revenue increased 1.7% to $707.8 million, as organic sales increased an impressive 5.1% and currency translation reduced sales by 3.6%. Here's a breakdown of Rockwell's revenues and revenue growth by region (in millions):Rockwell's gross profit increased 3.6% to $687.5 million and its total segment operating profit increased 5.7% to $346.8 million in the first quarter, as its gross margin expanded 200 basis points to 43.7% and its segment operating profit margin expanded 140 basis points to 22%; these very strong results can be attributed to costs of sales declining 4.4% during the quarter, which far outpaced the company's 1.1% decline in revenue.For the quarter, Rockwell generated $203.5 million in net cash provided by operating activities, invested $35.6 million in capital expenditures, and reported a $10.7 million gain on excess income tax benefits, resulting in $178.6 million of free cash flow; the company utilized this free cash, and the $1,191.3 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet to begin the quarter, to repurchase 1.55 million shares of its common stock for approximately $167.3 million and to pay out a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share for a total cost of approximately $88.1 million.At the end of the quarter, Rockwell noted that $844 million remained for repurchase under its $1.0 billion share repurchase program that was authorized in June of 2014. The company also ended the quarter with $1,291.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and it generates ample free cash flow each quarter, so I think it could accelerate repurchases in the second quarter.Lastly, as a result of ongoing ""currency headwinds,"" Rockwell reduced its full year earnings per share outlook on fiscal 2015, calling for adjusted earnings per share in the range $6.50-$6.80, and this is down from its previous outlook of $6.55-$6.95. The company also stated that it expects full year revenue of approximately $6.6 billion and organic sales growth in the range of 2.5%-5.5%, which is down from its previous outlook of growth in the range of 2.5%-6.5%.Is Now The Time To Buy Rockwell?Rockwell Automation is one of the world's largest providers of industrial power, control, and information solutions, and a 2.1% increase in organic sales paired with reduced expenses led it to a satisfactory first quarter performance; the company achieved year-over-year growth in earnings per share, gross profit, and segment operating profit, while expanding its margins, generating $178.6 million of free cash flow, and returning $255.4 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, and its stock has responded accordingly by rising over 2%.Even after the post-earnings pop in Rockwell's stock, I think it represents a great long-term investment opportunity, because it trades at low forward valuations; here's a chart of the company's updated average earnings per share outlook on fiscal 2015 and analysts' earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2018, and the stock's price-to-earnings multiple based on these projections:As the chart above shows, Rockwell's stock trades at less than 17 times fiscal 2015's, 2016's, and 2017's earnings per share estimates and a mere 12.7 times fiscal 2018's estimates, all of which are very inexpensive compared to its five-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 20.3 and the industry average multiple of 22.8. Also, the company pays an annual dividend of $2.60 per share, which gives its stock a bountiful 2.4% yield at current levels, and it is actively repurchasing its shares, all of which shows the company is fully dedicated to maximizing shareholder value. Finally, the company now has more than $1.29 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet, so I think it is in a prime position to pursue acquisitions, accelerate repurchases, and raise its dividend in fiscal 2015.With all of the information above in mind, I think the rally in Rockwell Automation's stock is warranted and I think that investors should consider initiating long-term positions today, and adding to them on any weakness provided by the market in the weeks ahead."
3017956,36201,2015-03-21T16:54:18-04:00,Rockwell Automation's rate of return on invested capital is exemplary.I break down the components of the important profitability ratio.We get to see how Rockwell Automation's advantage over competitors translates into a quantifiable ratio.,"Many dividend growth investors - and some fund managers - take a myopic view toward current yield and rate of dividend growth. While those metrics are clearly a vital first step in the due diligence process, measuring a firm's ability to outperform its peers is equally important. In the spirit of providing value to the Seeking Alpha community, I would like to highlight one method of quantifying a firm's advantages. In this article, we will take a look at Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) and its outstanding rate of return on invested capital, or ROIC.Measuring ProfitabilityIf you want a quick measurement of a company's profitability, a look at how much profit it generates for every dollar shareholders have invested is the way to go. We could look at return on equity, or net profits divided by shareholder equity. It is certainly an important metric. However, I think the best way to quickly assess a company's level of profitability is finding the rate of return on invested capital calculated as:net operating profit after tax (NOPAT)/invested capital = ROICIt's a little more complicated, but worth the effort.To see how returns on invested capital are calculated, let's start at the denominator and work our way up. Invested capital is calculated as shown below:Invested capital = total assets - excess cash - non-interest-bearing current liabilitiesWhile you should be familiar with total assets, the last two terms probably require some clarification. Excess cash can be described as cash unnecessary for operations. As you can already see, this will put a firm with cash stuck overseas on more even footing with peers that don't. As for non-interest-bearing current liabilities, think accounts payable or deferred taxes. They're debts that must be paid within a year, but don't necessarily represent shareholder investment.Looking up to the numerator we have another figure that you're not likely to find within standard financial statements, net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT. It is basically net income with interest expense added back. Here's how it's calculated:NOPAT = (Operating Profit) x (1 - tax rate)Leading The PackHere's a ROIC comparison with Rockwell Automation, and peers with significant automation and control related operations. As you can see, Rockwell has led the pack for several years.Hold on a second. We're not finished yet. Simply having a large ROIC does not necessarily guarantee increasing value for shareholders. For that all important measurement, we must measure a firm's ROIC against its cost of capital. Rather than begin a discussion of the capital asset pricing model and its shortfalls, I'll simply use figures generated by That's WACC, one of my favorite productivity tools.In fairness to ABB (NYSE:ABB) and Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR), it might be worth calculating all components of the above figures by hand before dumping shares. YCharts is a fantastic tool, but it is easy to imagine discrepancies between what a database-driven script, independent analysts, or a CFO might consider excess cash. What we can reasonably discern with the above chart is that Rockwell is returning far more of every dollar invested than its peers.Why So Profitable?If I had to boil the source of Rockwell's profitability into a single phrase, high switching costs would do nicely. Installing an automation platform is a highly involved process. Every solution seems to create two more problems. Once everything is up and running smoothly, competitive pricing alone is hardly enough incentive to repeat the process.With control systems lasting 20 years or more, Rockwell can smooth out the bumps in the economic cycle while entrenching relationships with customers. The long life cycle of automation platforms may slow down organic growth, but it also allows Rockwell to retain pricing power as evidenced by its ROIC.Just a little closerAlso of importance is the downward trend we see in Rockwell's ROIC over the past several quarters. This could indicate the company is losing ground to competition, or making lousy investments.If we pull apart the components of ROIC for Rockwell we can see the culprit is surging levels of invested capital over the past several years.Hopefully, this is the result of recent investment that hasn't had ample time to produce returns. Steps taken to integrate controls for multiple disciplines under a single platform haven't been cheap. Also for the reasons highlighted above, I would expect gains from this investment to appear slowly.Final ThoughtsWhile I will certainly keep my eyes on Rockwell's rate of return on invested capital, at the moment it is miles ahead of its peers. Of course, the due diligence process is far from over, but this company has passed the first hurdle with flying colors."

This article investigates Rockwell Automation's fundamental attributes to determine whether this recent pullback has created a compelling investment opportunity.Please click here to read my article which outlines the DRAG analysis framework in more detail.To summarize, the four variables used in a DRAG (dividend and risk adjusted growth) analysis are as follows (each company is ranked from 0 to 3 in each category): 1) How cyclical is the industry in which Rockwell Automation operates? 2) How strong is Rockwell Automation's competitive position within this industry? 3) How risky is Rockwell Automation's balance sheet? 4) What is Rockwell Automation's dividend yield and dividend growth history?The premise is that a company that operates in a non-cyclical industry, with a strong competitive position and a clean balance sheet that pays an attractive dividend should trade at a higher earnings multiple than a company without these attributes, even if the lower quality company has higher projected future earnings growth. After adjusting for these variables, it becomes easier to compare companies in different sectors with different levels of future growth potential.Rockwell Automation DRAG Analysis:By each of the above measures, Rockwell Automation appears to exhibit an above average level of cyclicality. This academic research website categorizes Rockwell Automation as part of the electrical equipment industry; stocks within this industry have an average beta of 1.14 over the last 12 months. Rockwell Automation's share price has consistently demonstrated an even higher level of volatility and although its beta has declined in recent years, it still sits significantly above 1:The firm's annual earnings have declined twice over the past decade (in both 2008 and 2009), demonstrating that the business is somewhat economically sensitive. For all of these reasons, Rockwell Automation is likely more cyclical than the average stock and possesses more economic risk, causing it to earn a below average score in this portion of the framework.Rockwell Automation is a leader in its field and its margins and efficiency rations demonstrate its imposing competitive position. Its operating margin has widened slightly in recent years and its return on assets has remained consistently strong during this period. The firm's competitive strengths are easily observable via its above average return on invested capital. Over the last decade, Rockwell Automation has achieved an average ROIC of more than 26%. Based on the above figures, the company's competitive position is stable and worthy of an above average score in the DRAG analysis.Rockwell Automation maintains a conservative balance sheet with more cash and short term investments ($1.8 billion) than total debt outstanding ($1.2 billion). The firm also achieves an impressive level of interest coverage and has maintained a promising current ratio for more than a decade. Although the company has not been highly levered at any point in recent history, it has consistently reduced its debt levels over the last five years:The firm's balance sheet accounts for approximately $1 billion of goodwill, which significantly reduces its value of net tangible assets. However, Rockwell Automation sits in a solid financial position and shareholders can feel confident that its balance sheet does not add a significant level of risk to their investment.After a recently announced 10.8% dividend increase, shares of Rockwell Automation now yield a comfortable 2.5%. The company has more than doubled this payout during the last three years, but its payout ratio remains around 40%. Furthermore, the company has generated more in the way of free cash flow than net income in each of the last two years. The company has used these funds for both dividend payments and share buybacks in similar amounts. Although the firm kept its dividend stable from 2007 through 2009, management's long term dividend growth track record is impressive. Investors focused on dividend growth should feel comfortable considering adding shares of Rockwell Automation as an industrial component to their portfolios.With its stock price currently sitting at approximately $103, this DRAG analysis suggests that Rockwell Automation is undervalued by approximately 20%. In fact, its shares were trading at this price less than six months ago. Analysts anticipate that the company's earnings will grow consistently over the next several years:From a historical perspective, the stock does not appear overvalued at its current price. The above $125 target suggests a forward price to earnings ratio of approximately 17, which does not seem unreasonable given its valuation range over the last five years:Rockwell Automation offers shareholders a number of enviable attributes: double digit earnings growth potential, a conservative balance sheet, an above average return on invested capital and a solid 2.5% dividend yield. While other industrial companies might possess more exciting growth potential, Rockwell Automation deserves serious consideration for all income and dividend growth portfolios."

An analysts' estimates miss in one or two quarters, combined with worsening overall sentiment can often mask the bigger picture. This is especially true with cyclical companies, like Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK). In this analysis, I will examine whether or not a recent 20% decline has created enough of a discount, relative to the opportunity, to warrant buying shares.Business SummaryFounded in 1903, Rockwell Automation is a provider of industrial power and control & information solutions designed to increase efficiency for manufacturers and operators in the transportation, oil & gas, metals & mining, food & beverage, and life sciences markets. The company is divided into two primary segments:Architecture & Software: (42% of sales, 62% of operating income, 2.4% CAGR over the last 5 years) - Multi-discipline architecture of motion control, sensors, software, and communications for information and integrated control of manufacturing. Roughly 50% of this segment is software. The centerpiece is the Logix (ControlLogix®, GuardLogix®, etc.) system.Control Products & Solutions: (58% of sales, 38% of operating income, 2.3% CAGR over the last 5 years) - Project management, motor control products, drives, sensors, and packaged and custom systems and services.Approximately 70% of global sales (and 90% of North American sales) are obtained through independent distributors, which are supplemented by a direct sales force. Geographically, sales are roughly 58% to North American end-users, 20% to Europe, 13% to Asia, and 9% to the rest of the world. In the end-market, sales to consumer-related companies (food, beverage, etc) are nearly one-third of total revenue, followed by heavy industry (23%), metals and mining (16%), oil and gas (13%), and transportation (12%).While Rockwell Automation has only seen revenue grow at a 3.7% compound annual growth rate for the last 10 years, it has been able to grow operating income at a respectable CAGR of 7.5%. This is largely due to the company's high return on invested capital, which continues to be a focus area for management. By maintaining a high ROIC, the company has been able to maintain a strong growth rate with less reinvestment. Which, in turn, allows for higher cash flows that can be returned to shareholders. This is further demonstrated by a 10-year average dividend payout ratio of 36%, and a 25% reduction in shares outstanding.Although share price has appreciated 165% over the past 10 years, the shares have pulled back nearly 20% in the last 3 months. In this note, I will examine whether or not a third-quarter earnings miss and market sell-off have combined to create an opportunity to buy.Long ThesisUltimately, demand for Rockwell Automation's products are tied to industrial production and the financial performance of its end-markets. Swings in economic activity and capital spending trends have a large impact on revenues. Over the near term, earnings direction can be partially extrapolated by trends in the Industrial Production Index and Capacity Utilization, ISM's Purchasing Managers' Index, and Industrial Equipment Spending (in the GDP releases). Though most data are still trending favorably, there has been a deceleration in their pace. Additionally, the short-term can be volatile and change quickly.Of greater concern, and the focus of this note, are the long-term drivers of value for Rockwell Automation. Broadly speaking, demographic changes, labor cost increases, increased focus on efficiency and cost savings, and a burgeoning upgrade cycle may all have a positive impact on value over the next decade. For each, I will examine the narrative and its likely impact on the value of the company.Demographic Changes/Labor CostsThe world's three largest economies are currently facing the reality of significantly changing labor force demographics. In the United States, the combined impacts of retiring ""baby boomers"" and the lowest births to deaths gap in 35 years signals a slowing growth of the total labor force. Although projections currently predict that the labor force will continue to grow, the slower pace will likely lead to lower labor surpluses and, therefore, shortages in some industries and higher overall wages. Likewise, the IMF projects that excess labor in China will drop from the current 120 million to 30 million by 2020, leading to a significant reduction in low-cost labor. And finally, Japan's already shrinking labor force still has a higher median age than any other industrialized nation. Couple the reduction in the supply of labor with the demand of products from a potential 3 billion additional consumers in developing markets, and the need for automation as a cost saving necessity becomes clear. Spending on robots is already spiking, and is projected to continue. This plays into one of Rockwell Automation's core competencies: programmable automation controllers (PAC), which are needed to integrate control of robots. From FY 2012 to FY 2013, sales of Logix systems, the company's cornerstone PAC, were up 4%. In the third quarter this year, sales were up 7% year-over-year, demonstrating an acceleration of adoption. It should be noted, however, the same growth in cost of labor that may increase the attractiveness of spending on automation will also likely increase the cost of creating, producing, and implementing automation solutions. Beyond that, there will likely be other countries that are able to partially offset the demographic changes in the top three. Implications for valuation: longer growth period, higher return on capital from Architecture and Software segment sales.Efficiency/Sustainability/Cost SavingsThe emergence from the ""great recession"" in the United States has left many businesses obsessively focused on reducing costs and increasing efficiency. Beyond that, the drive toward sustainability and the growth of the ""circular economy"" concept have motivated many businesses, governments, and investors to seek new and innovative methods to capture efficiencies. Automation companies, such as ROK, are seen as one of the primary beneficiaries of these trends. For example, equipping new factories with dynamic, automatically adapting machines can streamline production and enhance fuel/electric capacity. Analytics from machine data and integrated automation hardware and software can unify multidisciplinary and multiple location operations to improve decision-making, increase speed to implement changes, and refine manufacturing processes. In addition, data from sensors can be utilized to more accurately predict when maintenance will be required, reducing unexpected downtime and maximizing the utilization of a small supply of skilled maintenance personnel. These emerging trends all align with Rockwell Automation's strategic vision of an integrated, optimized, collaborative, and secure connected enterprise. Indeed, the company has partnered with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Dassault Systemes (OTCPK:DASTY), and several others for the specific purpose of creating system-wide efficiencies for customers. The potential risk here is that some end-markets or specific customers may become so efficient that consolidations or disruptions could decrease the number of total potential sales. Implications for valuation: increased addressable market, high return on capital from fully integrated systems and higher-margin software/analytics solutions.Upgrade Cycle/RetrofitsNearly three years ago, in a report by ARC Advisory Group, it was noted that over $65 billion worth of process automation systems were nearing the end of their useful life (Note: this number does not include estimates of aging discrete automation systems). At 20 years old, most of the systems were being utilized well past their initial expected lifespan of 10-12 years. With approximately one-third of that $65 billion in the U.S. alone, ROK is in a strong position to benefit from the inevitable replacement and retrofitting cycle. In addition to retrofitting and replacing old systems, a host of new technologies, such as nanotech sensors, nanoscale assembly systems, additive manufacturing, and the potential for fully automated factories will require many companies to increase spending on completely new automation systems and solutions. Rockwell Automation's R&D has been focused on many of these areas for over 10 years. Although it could be argued that aging manufacturing and automation systems are simply being replaced overseas, that risk is partially offset (in the long term) by the demographic and labor cost shifts discussed earlier. In addition, though not as strong as its U.S. position, ROK is competitive abroad, as well. Implications for valuation: longer growth phase induced by replacement cycle, higher revenues and return on capital from higher-margin systems and replacements.RisksAlthough the investment theses present a strongly positive outlook, significant risks exist; realistic expectations must be separated from hopeful speculation. First, in the near term, as with all cyclical companies, price volatility exists. The same U.S.-based oil and gas production ramp-up that has benefited Rockwell Automation has also, in part, brought about a decline in oil prices that may lead to the curtailing of some production and further investment. Additionally, large segments of the metals and mining industry are still facing oversupply and low demand conditions, leading to continued low reinvestment. In the consumer and transportation segments, growth may continue to be slow for some time if, in fact, it has not peaked for this cycle. Keep in mind that as a result of the last recession, Rockwell's operating income dropped over 60% and did not recover for 2 years. In any event, the fact remains that ROK equity will likely be more volatile than the overall market. Implications for valuation: higher implied cost of equity, due to volatility.The second risk challenges the assumptions made regarding demographics and cost of labor. Put simply, cost of labor in the United States has not increased, and may not for some time. Although this condition may exist partially because of previous automation investments, it could decrease the motivation to make large and expensive future investments. In addition, demographic projections in the U.S. could shift dramatically with changes to immigration policy. Abroad, Chinese birth rates may rise due to policy shifts, or other countries could conceivably emerge as low-cost alternatives. Beyond that, the emergence of a large, emerging market middle class and the consumption that goes along with it may be overly optimistic. The bottom line here is, human capital will continue to be competition to automation, and projections of how populations interact with each other are extremely difficult to predict. Implications for valuation: conservatism on long-term growth.Finally, any company that demonstrates sustainable growth and high returns on capital invites competition. Rockwell Automation is not immune to that effect. Obviously, competition from traditional sources, such as ABB (NYSE:ABB), Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), Honeywell (NYSE:HON), Schneider Electric (OTCPK:SBGSY), and Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) have always existed for ROK, but what has changed in recent years is an increase in consolidation activity and the emergence of new technology competitors. For example, at the beginning of this year, Schneider Electric completed an acquisition of Invensys to improve its position in the process automation space. It has also been speculated that Siemens will follow suit. Conversely, ABB, which is strong in process automation, is speculated to be in the market to acquire more proficiency in the discrete automation space (which, consequently, is Rockwell Automation's core focus). In addition, many of the traditional competitors are strengthening their software and control offerings through acquisition (i.e. Siemens' acquisition of Vistagy in 2011). This implies that enterprise-focused tech companies (IBM, HP Enterprises, and even Google) are now considered direct competition for parts of Rockwell's business. Beyond that, private companies in the U.S. (Demco Automation, McClellan Automation Systems) and abroad are continually fighting for share. It is very likely that the competition in this space is just beginning. Implications for valuation: degradation of return on capital over time.Valuation and PricingAs interesting as this narrative may be, it is ultimately worthless without connecting it to value and price. For Rockwell Automation, I used a perpetual growth discounted free cash flow to the firm model, and two relative pricing methods. I then weighted methods based on my relative confidence in each to arrive at an estimated value and fair market price. Because the assumptions and inputs in intrinsic valuation are explicit, while the assumptions in relative pricing are more implicit and hidden, I place far more confidence in the former than the latter. Although many of you, no doubt, hate reading about models and methods, I urge you to evaluate the reasoning that went into the inputs. Here, I will explain my methods, the primary assumptions, and what influenced my judgment on each.Intrinsic Valuation:For the intrinsic valuation of Rockwell Automation, I used a three-stage (growth, transition, perpetual/terminal) free cash flow to the firm model. The company's operating cash flows were valued as a going concern and discounted back at an estimated cost of capital. Cash was added back, and debt (including operating leases), pension obligations, and employee option value were subtracted out to arrive at an equity value.Cost of CapitalAlthough many practitioners use a generic, intuitive number, historical data, or outsource cost of capital estimates entirely, I prefer to take ownership of every input in my valuations. Therefore, I spend a fair amount of time on this component in order to add forward-looking granularity and specificity to the process. That said, I use a modified, forward-looking CAPM, which is far from perfect (after all, it is only one tool) and is not to be taken as an exact science or precise number. In order to find a market-neutral cost of capital, I use the following process: First, for the cost of equity, I derive a market-implied risk premium based on normalized existing cash flows (market dividends and buybacks), risk-free rate, and projected growth of market earnings. Next, I use a bottom-up business beta from comparable automation, industrial, and business process companies (weighted by value derived from each segment) and lever the beta to Rockwell Automation's own debt-to-equity ratio. The reason for the business beta is fairly straightforward: individual company regression betas contain large standard errors, rendering them close to useless on a standalone basis. Multiplying the equity risk premium by the computed beta and adding it to the risk-free rate sums to a total cost of equity.Because ROK is rated by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, cost of debt was fairly straightforward and obtained by applying the current option-adjusted spread for A3-rated debt on top of the risk-free rate. Cost of equity and cost of debt are then weighted according to the market value of equity and debt, resulting in a total cost of capital of 9.88%. Shown below are the calculations:Operating Income and Base Year InputsRockwell Automation is clearly in a cyclical business. Therefore, margins, capital expenditures (including acquisitions), and returns were normalized over a ten-year period. Items that were clearly discrete, one-time items were also adjusted to reflect ongoing operations of the normal business. In addition, I performed two more steps to clean up the income statement and balance sheet. First, as always, I capitalized operating leases (and accordingly adjusted operating income), because they are, for all intents and purposes, interest-bearing debt. Second, I adjusted SG&A by capitalizing and amortizing research and development (4-year life, straight-line method). The reasoning behind this adjustment is that R&D is actually a capital expense, as it creates a long-term benefit/asset for the company. The effect is twofold: 1) Operating income is increased due to reduced expenses, and 2) the capital base is adjusted to reflect the R&D asset. The net effect on cash flows is neutral, but the adjustment does demonstrate how effective R&D has been in terms of return on investment. In Rockwell's case, return on R&D spending is less effective than the company's overall ROIC. That said, it is still well above the cost of capital, and therefore, value enhancing.Growth and Length of Growth PeriodBy definition, growth of operating income can come from one of two places (or both): efficiency gains, and income from new investments (including businesses, products, etc.). Higher margins and the ability to create more revenues from existing assets are both efficiency gains reflected in return on capital improvements. Investments in new products, services, or other assets using internal or external capital are reflected in a company's reinvestment rate. Mathematically, this means growth is a function of return on investment and reinvestment rate. Growth cannot be obtained without affecting these two variables.As was mentioned earlier, Rockwell Automation's return on invested capital has long been a strength of the company. Although the company's ROIC has actually improved over the past several years, I recognize that this is a cyclical company and moved the current toward a more normalized number. I then kept the adjusted, normalized ROIC at 25.75% for 5 years, before tapering off to a perpetually sustainable value.In the past, ROK has demonstrated fairly low reinvestment needs, choosing instead to return excess capital to shareholders. Even after adjusting to include R&D as a capital expenditure, the normalized reinvestment rate was roughly 20% of after-tax operating earnings. I did, however, adjust this number to 24% to reflect the upward trend in this number and a slight increase in spending as the industry continues to consolidate.The length of the growth phase is obviously difficult to predict, especially when there are several potentially disruptive technological and demographic shifts. Based on current projections on demographics, efficiency trends, and the replacement cycle, I assumed five years of 6%-7% operating earnings growth, followed by a slow deceleration over the following five years.Terminal InputsIn traditional DCF valuations, the terminal value carries much of the weight. However, if done correctly, there are substantial caps that keep the terminal value from getting out of control and over-inflating (or deflating) the valuation. Mathematically, for instance, a perpetual growth rate for any individual company cannot exceed the growth rate of the overall economy. Empirically, the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond is the most accurate proxy for the long-term growth rate in U.S. dollar terms. Assuming Rockwell Automation's long-term growth inherently tied to the growth of the overall economy, I let the perpetual growth rate match this proxy exactly. However, it should be noted that even if the growth rate is changed, the impact is fairly minor if discipline is applied to the other perpetual components.Far more important than the perpetual growth rate are the perpetual cost of capital and return on capital assumptions. For cost of capital, I assume reversion to the mean, moved the equity risk premium to the long-term, adjusted geometric average (U.S.) of 4.6%, and maintained the existing country spread. I lowered the current beta of 1.39 to 1.2, as more mature businesses tend to trade closer to the overall market. For the cost of debt, I lowered the debt rating to BBB (due to increased debt), applied the current risk spread for BBB rated bonds to the long-term median value for the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond of 3.87%. I also increased the debt ratio to 35%, reflecting a move toward the company's optimal debt ratio, while maintaining some conservatism. Additionally, I maintained a long-term marginal tax rate of 28%, as the company has no plans to ever repatriate earnings from outside of the United States. This resulted in a total cost of capital in perpetuity of 6.84%Many practitioners rigidly assume that in a competitive market, return on capital absolutely cannot exceed the cost of capital in perpetuity. However, empirical evidence does not support this claim, as competitors and industries rise, fall, and consolidate dynamically. Additionally, as the automation industry becomes more software-based, it should retain somewhat higher returns on capital. That said, competition does eventually erode competitive advantages. To estimate the long-term return on capital, I used a weighted average of comparable companies' worst margins and sales/capital ratios, adjusted for research and development capitalization, and applied a 28% marginal tax rate. The rounded result was a 9.95% return on capital in perpetuity.Cleaning UpIn addition to valuing the operating assets of Rockwell Automation, I needed to clean up for employee options and retirement obligations, and the unconsolidated portion of a 50% owned subsidiary. Because employee options represent both an equity claim and future cost to the company, I needed to subtract the value from the operating value of the company. I used the Black-Scholes method, data from the company's 2013 10-K, Q3 2013 10-Q, and sourced volatility for the calculation.For the retirement benefit obligations, I had two choices - subtract probable payments from cash flows, or treat it as debt. Because the company has been making voluntary contributions above minimum funding requirements, I treated the obligation as debt. Additionally, because ROK eliminated further enrollments in the pension plan as of October 2010, it will not be a perpetual drain on cash flows. As of the end of June this year, I estimated a market value of retirement benefit obligations of $459 million.My final, base-case, intrinsic value for Rockwell Automation equity after adding back cash and subtracting debt, pensions, and employee options is $15.85 billion, or $115/share.Value EnhancementAlthough I believe the probability of activism or M&A activity involving Rockwell Automation is fairly remote, I decided to analyze an optimized value of the company to contrast my conservative valuation presented above. In order to optimize the value of the Rockwell Automation, I only implemented three changes which I felt were realistic. First, I smoothed the transition from the current high return on invested capital to the normalized ROIC (as opposed to applying the normalized value immediately). This smoothed transition implies little to no short-term volatility in revenues or operating margins. Conversely, the company could improve or maintain current ROIC by moderately improving R&D efficiency. Second, I immediately increased the debt ratio to 30%, halfway toward the company's optimal capital structure (based off tax effects, cost of capital, and default probability). The primary effect of such a move would be a drop in after-tax cost of capital. Finally, I lowered the perpetual effective tax rate from 28% to the 10-year median of 24%. This is actually a fairly intuitive adjustment, considering the company has stated that it will continue to reinvest non-U.S. earnings outside of the U.S. (in order to avoid additional taxes paid due to repatriation). As more reinvestment occurs outside of the U.S., a higher percentage of earnings will come from lower-tax jurisdictions.Implementing the three steps listed would have the following impacts: 1) Increased ROIC from 25.75% to 28% for the first five years; 2) Increased compound annual growth rate from 6.18% to 6.72% for the first five years; 3) Lowered cost of capital from 9.88% to 8.34%; 4) Lowered cost of capital and lowered cash drain from taxes in perpetuity. Total value of the company, given the adjustments, would move from $115/share to $140/share. However, as I stated before, there is no obvious catalyst to move the company toward this value. Therefore, I am only applying a 5% weighting to the optimized value.Pricing:Relative pricing (aka pricing multiples) is different than valuation in the sense that pricing is based on similar assets or something else external to the company, while valuation is based on the risk-adjusted cash flows of the company itself. Both methods are useful, depending on the perspective that you take. For example, if you take the perspective of buying shares to later ""flip"" to someone else, pricing is more relevant. Conversely, if you take the perspective of ownership in the company, valuation is more relevant.For relative pricing, I used two methods. In the first, I used Rockwell Automation's own historical high and low PE ranges over the past 10 years, and multiplied the median values of each range by a weighted average forward EPS estimate. The estimate is based on the current analysts' ranges, and in this case, I apply a bias toward the low end of the range to contrast my higher intrinsic valuation. In addition, I used analysts' EPS estimates as opposed to my own, in order to reduce my own bias and to introduce current market expectations into the process.The second method I used was multiple regression analysis designed to control for differences across comparable companies (as opposed to the opinion-based multiple applications you are likely to see elsewhere). In this method, I compared various price ratios (P/E, P/S, EV/EBITDA, etc.) and inputs (growth, operating margins, return on equity, etc.), and was able to identify which factors were most important to the overall market in pricing the comparable companies. For Rockwell Automation, I used a wide scope, diversified machinery comp group, and found that the price/sales ratio was primarily tied to operating margins, with growth and volatility also having an impact.In the weighting of the different pricing methods, I gave the regression-based method a higher weight than the historical, because the regression partially controls for real differences across firms. In addition, historical PE multiples do not adequately account for structural changes, accounting changes, or industry changes. Note that I gave the lower historical PE higher weight than the higher median PE for conservatism.Based on current information and my own assumptions, it appears as though Rockwell Automation is at least somewhat undervalued and underpriced. Note, however, that this analysis is based primarily on metrics normalized over a full economic cycle and long-term assumptions, not quarter-to-quarter accrual earnings per share. Although it should go without saying, markets may continue to be volatile for some time, and shares could still trade significantly lower. That said, under $100, Rockwell Automation may be worth a look for long-term investors with moderate risk tolerance.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

345671,24491,2012-02-07T04:13:39-05:00,,"History has revealed that the best performing stocks during the previous decades have been those that shelled out ever-increasing cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. Most dividend analysis that we've seen out there is backward-looking - meaning it rests on what the company has done in the past. Although analyzing historical trends is important, we think assessing what may happen in the future is even more important. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety through our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. We use our future forecasts for free cash flow and expected dividends and consider the firm's net cash position to make sure that each company is able to pay out such dividend obligations to you -- long into the future. In this article, let's evaluate the dividend of Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK).(Click image to expand)(Click image to expand)First of all, Rockwell Automation's dividend yield is about 2.1%, so we view the name as a potential income generator for our dividend growth portfolio. We think the safety of its dividend is GOOD on our scale. We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges (read hiccups in operations), which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For Rockwell Automation, this score is 2.7, offering both a good ""cushion"" and revealing excess capacity for future dividend growth. The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies.Now on to growth. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years and the company has a nice growth rate, its future potential dividend growth is EXCELLENT, which is the case for Rockwell Automation.However, we don't just stop there. By employing a matrix, one can see above that Rockwell Automation has a nice dividend--the cross section of its GOOD safety and EXCELLENT future potential growth scores. And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In Rockwell Automation's case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss is MEDIUM. If we thought Rockwell Automation was undervalued, we'd consider the risk to be LOW.All things considered, we like the potential growth and safety of Rockwell Automation's dividend, but the yield is a bit low to get us excited. We'd wait for a dividend increase or a pullback in the shares to consider for inclusion in our Dividend Growth Newsletter.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

(NYSE:ROK) may provide investors with an investment opportunity in wide-ranging sectors, from industrial applications to energy and mining interests. ROK is an open equipment manufacturer (OEM) of industrial automation equipment, software and services. ROK consists of two main divisions. The Architecture and Software Control segment provides information architecture and integrated control to industrial clients. The Control Products & Solutions segment provides intelligent motor control and industrial control products. ROK's industrial clients range from pharmaceutical companies to oil and gas companies and mineral development groups.The oil and gas sector accounts for nearly 13% of the company's revenue, and may provide opportunities for revenue growth. ROK provides automated solutions and products to oil and gas clients, including intelligent motor control, pump station control, safety shut-down systems and remote monitoring. In addition, ROK has a significant software component, offering comprehensive software solutions to the automobile, pharmaceutical and consumer products industries. Software comprises approximately 10% of the company's total sales. ROK's main competition appears to be FANUF, a Japanese company with a market capitalization of $39.4 billion.ROK has made significant investments in emerging growth markets. In 2011, ROK acquired Hiprom, a South African company providing project management and delivery to mining and mineral processing industries. ROK is opening a new plant in Brazil, which will increase its manufacturing capacity in the region, and provide further investment in emerging growth markets. It is reported that the plant will manufacture medium and low-voltage drives for use in the oil and gas and mining industries. Six percent of ROK's sales are to China, with the company anticipating revenue increases due to expansion in that market. Another 8% of the company's sales are in Latin America with 17% in Europe. Thus, ROK still does have exposure to the continuing European instability.ROK has a market capitalization of $11.41 billion, with a current P/E ratio of 16.99. Earnings per share in 2009 were $1.53, increasing to $3.05 in 2010, and up 57% to $4.79 in 2011. Revenue grew from $4.86 billion in 2010 to $6 billion in 2011, an increase of a little over 23%. However, earnings did decrease from $5.7 billion in 2008 to $4.3 billion in 2009, indicating that ROK is certainly tied to larger macro-economic trends due to the core industrial nature of its business.ROK has a current free cash flow of $561 million, with a dividend of 0.43 for a dividend yield of 2.09%. The current mean of analyst recommendations is currently overweight. Goldman Sachs upgraded the company to a buy on 1/11/12. However, there does appear to have been some recent insider selling of shares, which may discourage some investors.Rockwell Automation's share price recently closed at 81.32, up nearly 12% for 2012. ROK is up nearly 62% since its 52 week low of 50.36 on 9/22/11, trading with a daily average of 1.27 million shares. ROK appears firmly entrenched in an upward channel, although there does appear to be a lower channel forming within the large channel. The open up gap up on 2/3 creates a doji ""shooting star"" on the daily chart, indicating that price could retrace back a step toward the lower channel support line. Assuming a pullback to the lower resistance level of the channel holds, this may provide traders with a opportunity for an entry point into a position. The 50 day SMA crossed the 200 SMA on 1/19, shown by the arrow on the chart below, creating a golden cross as reported by Barclay's which many consider to be a bullish sign.As stated previously, ROK is subject to larger macro-economic forces, especially the uncertain potential for growth in international markets. ROK may be exposed to hiccups in the Asian and Latin American economies. Still, ROK may provide investors with an opportunity for growth due to its diversified clients, and its potential for increased revenue streams in the oil and gas sectors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

I was itching for an action. I knew the end of the year was coming and wanted to go out with a ""bang"". I woke up on December 30th, after having analyzed the stock market the day before I knew what I was after and it was in a different industry that I have not truly been exposed to before. Enough with the opening, let's dive into my recent stock purchase and find out what, why and how much!Stock PurchaseOn December 30th, 2014 I purchased shares of Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK). To begin, they are within the Industrial sector with competitors listed such as Honeywell (NYSE:HON) and General Electric (NYSE:GE). ROK is a provider of industrial automation power, control and information solutions that help manufacturers achieve a competitive advantage for their businesses with two segments of operation - Architecture & Software and controls Products & Solutions. As Bert described in his portfolio review assessment in bulking up and adding different industries - the industrial sector is not an area where I had any exposure really. The company had great metrics when I was reviewing their financial statements and I also had a family friend that worked there, so when this stock came on a blip on a screener, I was interested in the guts. I used a combination of our Dividend Diplomat stock screener, the comparison of yield to 5-year yield average and the dividend growth rate impact. Let's see why I bought Rockwell.The AnalysisConclusion and SummaryI purchased 18 shares of Rockwell Automation at a price of $112.14, to which this adds $46.80 to my annual projected dividend income. I am pumped to see what this dividend growth stock can do in the future for me, as there is plenty of room due to the low payout ratio to continue to grow the dividend, as well as areas where they can improve earnings per share that will allow the dividend growth. Rockwell shows to me that it has a liquid balance sheet, solid earnings growth, potential for share repurchases and sales growth has been positive. This moves my weighted average dividend growth rate up to 7.16% or by 11 basis points and pushes my estimated/projected 2015 income to $5,062.32. Phew - had to go out with one last stock purchase before this year closed, that's for sure!What does everyone think of this purchase? Do you own Rockwell or a competitor that isn't GE? Any faults or downsides to this purchase? Thanks everyone, would love the input and talk soon. Hope you all had a Happy New Year!"

The company provides industrial control products (factory automation), both hardware and software, and operates internationally. I like owning shares of a company that provides products that make manufacturing more efficient and reproducible. On the downside, the stock price is fairly volatile with a beta of 1.71 but it did grow 13.36% this last year (Figure 1).Figure 1Do I want to keep this stock?To answer this question, I gathered more data:Rockwell's capital structure may be considered conservative with $1.0 billion in cash and equivalents and about $1.2 billion in total debt. According to the February 13, The Street ratings: ""The company currently stands out relative to its peers with a price to book ratio of 6.34 versus the industry average of 3.37, indicating the stock is trading at a premium.""Standard and Poor's Market Profile states:The company operates internationally and revenue by geography for 2012 was:The January 30th Equity Research Report from Credit Suisse, addressing the Chinese automation market, reports: I took a look at the last 21 years of dividends, not always increasing:One last thing I wanted to throw into the data pile is the status of their pension funding. According to Rockwell's 2012 10-K, the underfunding amounts to $931 million. This means that present or future earnings may have to be allocated toward this benefit liability.SummaryRockwell Automation leads a few of its peers in the Industrials Sector. Certainly other companies in this sector have higher revenue growth and earnings yield (Regal-Beloit Corp. (NYSE:RBC) for instance). The company has paid dividends every year since 1982; obviously, not always increasing. It is a conservatively run company with plenty of cash and it's in the business of manufacturing automation -- which is the future.So I think my answer is that if I want to own a stock in the electrical equipment sector, I'll still keep Rockwell. Since U.S. manufacturing capacity utilization is on the upswing and the China market is growing, there is no foreseeable reason why the company won't continue to grow and generate dividends for years to come.Things I'll be watching for: Can Rockwell capture more of the Chinese market share and are they managing their pension liability.Disclosure: I am long ROK.

259346,23502,2011-03-21T14:57:25-04:00,,"By                 Daniel Holland Since the market trough in March 2009,  automation stocks have averaged annual growth near 60%. While this track  record will be near impossible to match, there is good reason to  believe that these industrial products firms can still perform well as  manufacturers bring more capacity on line. An improvement in technology  is one of the principle ways to deliver economic growth, presenting an  opportunity for manufacturers that specialize in technology  improvements.A Tight Bond with Customers Drives Economic Moat While  the growth story is compelling, we tend to like these firms because of  their sticky customer relationships, and value-enhancing products for  customers, which lead to stronger, more resilient operating margins.  High customer switching costs represent the source of the moat for these  companies. Installing an automation platform is timely, and often  involves moving many critical processes onto a central control system.  The initial growing pains are similar to implementing a new enterprise  reporting platform across a large company. With many parts of the system  talking to each other, the opportunity for error is large, and the  costs of mistakes are higher. As such, many companies elect to stay with  an incumbent product for several years, rather than convert to  something new, irrespective of the technology improvement.Moving Outside of the Box The  manufacturing floor continues to evolve, with more firms pursuing  integrated activities across the plant, and the capability to monitor  and measure operational processes at any point in time, from any  location. Traditionally, discrete automation firms, specializing in  applications like automobile manufacturing and packaging, remained  separate from process automation firms, which focus on applications for  breweries and refineries. Instead of staying in their respective boxes,  discrete players began encroaching on some process applications,  allowing them to offer more services to customers with diverse needs. As  a result, process players are starting to see greater competition for  new business.Interestingly, process automation suppliers are unlikely to encroach  on discrete markets, since that would require process folks to open up  their currently closed systems and compete with other suppliers at the  component level. Simply put, process suppliers have little competitive  response to discrete firms like Rockwell (NYSE:ROK) and Siemens AG (NYSE:SI) from  entering their markets. This impacts growth more than profitability  since incumbent suppliers have good success holding their position, but  new projects will have more potential bidders, making growth more  difficult. The installed base is large enough at incumbent firms that it  will take several years for newer firms to materially set back  established companies.Rockwell Automation Leading the Charge into Process Automation Rockwell's  strength is multidiscipline controls, and the company's investment in  its control solution, Logix, is enabling it to branch away from discrete  applications, faster and easier than competitors. The beauty of the  solution is that it enables customers to maintain hardware and systems  from other manufacturers, but still use the Logix brain. Typically, an  automation upgrade would require a complete overhaul by the customer,  proving to be timely and expensive. In fact, Logix is proving to negate  the main barriers protecting process automation manufacturers, giving  Rockwell access to their customers. While Rockwell has a slim margin of  safety, further success penetrating process markets as well as robust  capital spending could boost our opinion of the company's near and  long-term prospects.The Road Ahead Looks Bright for Automation Firms We  think capital spending will remain high as manufacturers continue to  establish a footprint in Asia, and as incremental investments in capital  prove more fruitful than adding workers. As multinational firms expand  eastward, they traditionally take their suppliers with them, creating  new markets abroad. While local firms have related technologies, it has  proven difficult to break the bond between to a manufacturer and the  firm that essentially drives their manufacturing operations. Even though  the margin of safety on these stocks has diminished appreciably over  the last several months, we think the long-term fundamentals favoring  the companies warrant investor attention in the event prices retreat.Disclosure: Morningstar licenses its indexes  to certain ETF and ETN providers, including Barclays Global Investors  (BGI), First Trust, and ELEMENTS, for use in exchange-traded funds and  notes.

Many now say that the stocks in these countries are fairly priced, which means that there is no longer any easy money to be made investing overseas in BRIC countries and other rapidly emerging markets. This is despite the rapid increased flow of money into ETFs and Mutual Funds.Before forming E5A Funds LLC, I categorized stocks in buckets based on where they are domiciled. Many institutional investors also divide the world of equities into value and growth, and then sub-divide it further by market cap. I learned to play that game. Our team more often than not (measured in quarters) won; meaning, beat the appropriate benchmark. That set of definitions has always seemed a bit odd and short sighted to me. Now, managing a global portfolio, we have replaced market cap with strict liquidity screens and also additional screens for political stability.I feel like the constraints have been lifted and discipline installed aimed at superior returns. I am also a student of history and am confident when the institutional world divided equities into its current structure; they too felt liberated, disciplined and deliberate.Case in point is Milwaukee, WI based Rockwell Automation (NYSE: ROK). When I first bought this stock for our investors, it was early 2009. It has remained a core holding. It is the poster child for firms domiciled here and doing a material amount of its business outside the US. Its stunning stock price growth is attributed to its taking advantage of the confluence of several factors: markets recovering and expanding faster than the US, US Government stimulus, a falling dollar and regional offices on the ground from Mexico to Mozambique to Malaysia. The firm also sells to several industries broadening its opportunities and hedging its bets, broadly describing itself as helping factories run more smoothly.Earnings were last week and revenue increased year-over-year and sequentially as did earnings (see Q4 results here and earnings call transcript here). Compared to last year, sales in the US increased 33% and Asia was also up 33% while Latin America increased 31%. My point is that this quarter’s growth can be summed up beyond the stimulus in the US. These facts help cloud and illustrate in our new global society how out of touch our definitions are for domiciled-based investing. ROK has currency exposure doing business in so many countries. One can argue that because the company manages currency as a non-core business that investing in ROK is actually more risky than investing in companies domiciled within the client countries. In those cases we actively manage the currency risk ourselves. The stock’s volatility as measured by beta on a trailing 12 month basis is 1.8 reflecting multiple outside forces. Its P/E is a hefty 26.29 as of Monday’s close and its Price to Sales is slightly over 2. These numbers are high but since the market’s recovery, ROK has outpaced its sector and the S&P 500 year-to-date and since the market’s low point March 9, 2009.On Tuesday, I sat with a great investor who has put client money to work longer than me. He asked me our criteria to sell this stock. I outlined our sell discipline and then got specific on ROK. My answer: when its price gets ahead of fundamentals or true headwinds are encountered in the markets its revenue is derived. Until then, we continue to measure and balance fundamentals to price, examine cost structures and of course, where and with whom the firm does business and its prospects for growth. We ignore where they are domiciled, although as citizens, we are pleased to see them in Milwaukee.Disclosure: Mr. Corn is Chief Investment Officer of E5A Funds LLC.

No new position named, and there can’t be much of one if Gelly has time available to advise his former employer. It is also somewhat uncomfortable that Gelly is leaving just after the company received $1.7 billion for the sale of a large division. That money needs to be put to use, and typically the CFO is instrumental in such decisions.

Management reiterated on the call their past comments that the tax rate can jump around from quarter to quarter due to the timing of various items. This all brings us back to April, 2005. The stock sold off sharply Wednesday because the company “missed” its earnings target for the quarter. Problem is, Rockwell doesn’t give quarterly guidance. The high ticket prices of their equipment means there is too much volatility in quarterly numbers just because a sale occurs a few days earlier or later than the quarter end. No matter.

Of course, the company went on to exceed the annual guidance it had provided, the selloff marked the low of the year and by the following April the share price had nearly doubled.

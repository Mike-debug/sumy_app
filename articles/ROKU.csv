This company is not at all what it was when it had its IPO just three years ago. I think a lot of investors have trouble keeping up with the pace of innovation of Roku and struggle to see the value and the moat. In this article, I'll try to explain the company's strengths, and I will couple it with recent developments that only show clearer where Roku is going.Roku has been a pick in Potential Multibaggers, my marketplace, since February 2020, and it has almost doubled since then (it's up 97%). But I think there is a lot more growth left for this company, and I wanted to share with you why that is so. But before we look at the story of today, we go back in history a bit to see where the company comes from.Roku was founded by current chairman and CEO Anthony Wood:(Source)As Michael Liedtke of Associated Press wrote succinctly in 2014:You know what often happens with best supporting actors: if they execute well, they can become stars in their own right.Just as most visionary leaders, Anthony Wood has a very interesting history. Roku is not his first business, it's his sixth, and therefore, he named the company Roku. It's the Japanese word for 6.Wood is credited with inventing and commercializing the DVR, the digital video recorder, in the late 1990s with his company ReplayTV. As a fan of Star Trek: The Next Generation, he was often very frustrated that he missed episodes because of his busy schedule and he wanted to solve that problem. He did.One of his early backers was Marc Andreessen, now probably the most famous and successful venture capitalist, but then just starting out in VC after he had sold the company he had founded, Netscape, to AOL. Andreessen showed that he was a sharp observer. He is quoted in a Fortune article:Andreessen saw very early on what Roku could become and has become right now. Another example of Wood's visionary foresight is this quote of him in 2012, when DVRs were still a lot more common than streaming:Wood wanted more unscaling and individualization of the TV programming. Even with a DVR, you were dependent on the broadcaster that had to air the movie that you wanted to see. And DVRs had limited recording capacity, so you still had no unlimited choice. In 2002, Wood sold ReplayTV to Sonic Blue (which went broke two years later), and later that year, he founded Roku.There was no possibility of TV streaming yet in 2002. Bandwith was still limited then, and Roku started by developing SoundBridge, a digital audio device, SoundBridge Radio, and PhotoBridge, for digital pictures. It also launched BrightSign, a sort of music subscription for retail environments.These products ""bridged"" the company until the technology and the market would be ready for Wood's vision of the future of TV. Roku gathered valuable people, laid out a basis for software development, explored brand marketing and formed a retail distribution network.Then, in April 2007, Wood was appointed as Vice President at Netflix (NFLX) and he helped to develop a player for Netflix. The project was top-secret and was named Griffin, after the name of a character in the film The Player (do you see the pun?) played by Tim Robbins.(Tim Robbins in The Player, source)It was a streaming device, and in December 2007, it was ready for launch. But despite the big efforts of a team of 20 full-time employees for years to develop and design the product, the project was killed by Netflix CEO Reed Hastings just before launch.Hastings got scared that if Netflix made and sold its own hardware, the company would get into trouble with other hardware producers, especially Apple (AAPL). How could Hastings have called Jobs to put Netflix on an Apple TV if he was a competitor on the hardware side? I think Hastings made the right decision there.The device that was developed was spun out of Netflix to... Roku, the company of Netflix's VP, Anthony Wood. Wood left Netflix to fully concentrate on Roku again, and Netflix invested $5.7 million in Roku. A year later, Netflix sold already again for a profit of $1.9 million for the same reason it had killed the Player: hardware neutrality. In mid-2008, Roku launched the Roku Netflix Player.Despite the fact Roku has been a great stock to own (it's up 853% since its IPO 3 years ago), I think a lot of investors still misunderstand the company. They seem to still associate Roku with the dongles and streaming sticks:(Source)If they think that's what's it all about, they miss the bigger picture. Roku is much more about the platform than about its hardware. The hardware is a way to get into people's houses.Cord cutters love it that Roku takes care of them. They can just use their ""old"" TV and transform it into a smart TV. Roku has a whole hardware product line of several boxes, sticks, TVs and wireless speakers. And that is what most people associate the company with.Roku is the only big player that is independent and neutral in the big streaming war that is going on between the big players like Apple TV (Plus), Amazon Prime/Fire TV (AMZN), and Google's Chromecast/YouTube Premium (GOOG, GOOGL). A lot of investors are worried about Roku because these giants operate in its space. But you shouldn't forget that they have been there for a very long time, and despite that, Roku could become the biggest of them all. A part of this will be because Anthony Wood knows the industry like almost no one else.The big misunderstanding about Roku is that it is all about the hardware. People who think that ignore reality. And where to look better to separate facts and fiction than in the numbers? This is taken from the company's most recent 10-Q:If you look at the revenue from Platform and Player, you can see that the Player brought in $111.296 million. That includes all sticks, boxes, TVs, sound systems, and what have you.But the platform revenue was much more important, coming in at $244.777 million. In other words, the player revenue only brings in 31% of the total revenue, while the platform totals 69%. The most visible part of Roku is not the most valuable. That already shows that the focus of people on Roku as a hardware company is not correct.Five years ago, 84% of Roku’s revenue came from hardware and just 16% from the platform. You can see how fast the company's story is changing, and this trend is only in the first innings.Roku has become the operating system of a lot of smart TVs too. If you look at the operating systems of computers, you see that Microsoft (MSFT) has done much better than hardware producer IBM.(From Roku's most recent 10-Q)If you look at the gross margins, you can see that Roku gross margin on the player is just 7.5%. That may seem low, but it even was negative in Q4 2019. For the Platform, you see a gross margin of 56.5%, much higher.These numbers show how Roku primarily makes money: on its platform.The company makes money from advertisements on The Roku Channel but also on subscriptions. If you have a Roku-enabled TV, if you subscribe to Netflix, Roku gets a cut on that subscription, the same way that Apple gets a cut if you buy an app in its App Store.Roku's ARPU (average revenue per user) is $24.93, up 18% YoY. Just for comparison: Netflix's ARPU in the US and Canada is $159 on a yearly basis, like Roku counts. I think this shows how big Roku could become. After all, its international expansion has only started, unlike that of Netflix. Netflix is a $235 billion company, while Roku has a market cap of just $28 billion, more than 8 times smaller.Skeptical investors often ask: but what's Roku's moat? That's a good question, so I will try to answer it. Not just in this paragraph, but in the next few too.I think it's already clear from the numbers now that the valuable part of Roku is its platform, not the device. The moat is in how the platform works.You could look at it in this light: the Windows Phone of Microsoft was a good piece of hardware, almost as good as the iPhone according to some and better than almost all Android phones according to most. It was not a success, though. The reason is that it lacked the huge number of apps that iOS and Android had.The same goes for Roku: it has so many apps (TV channels) that are free, and much more will be made.Let's take an example. Suppose I wanted to create a Potential Multibaggers channel on Roku. I would have to create a customer developer account and I could start right away. With the Direct Publisher method, I could start my channel very easily.Maybe I would have to look for a developer who is familiar with the software, and that could cost me something like $1,500 or $3000 or so to set up my channel, but I wouldn't have to pay any fee to Roku to get my channel going. If I want a fully customized channel that supports subscriptions, I could build the app from the ground up, but I would be able to monetize it in several ways.I think you can see the potential for a ton of companies, organizations, influencers, individuals with talents, and entrepreneurs.If Roku doesn't charge me for my TV channel, how does it make money then?The most popular form is video advertising. There are two models: the inventory split model and the revenue share model. In the inventory split model, I would have to look for sponsors myself. 70% of the ads would be from my personal sponsors, and I can keep that money completely. Roku would fill the other 30% and monetize that.The revenue share model means that Roku takes care of 100% of the ads on the Potential Multibaggers channel, and I wouldn't have to do anything to monetize my channel. Roku keeps 40% of the proceeds, I get 60% minus fees.If I would build the channel from the ground up (so not the standardized Direct Publisher method), I could also monetize in a lot of ways: I could ask for a subscription fee, I could charge a pay-per-view, I could ask for a donation or monetize through product placement.There has been a lot of talk about e-commerce on Roku, but for now, that's not a substantial source of revenue yet. But it's definitely a big opportunity, and I think it will be a sizeable way to monetize in the future. I can see influencers selling things on their personal TV channel. And Roku will profit, as it takes a cut on everything.I think this shows how great Roku's platform is, and with CTV exploding because of cord-cutting, we are only at the beginning of a new wave. I think you see the potential of how this might evolve. Roku already has more than 20,000 apps/channels, and that number keeps growing. Amazon has about 8,500, Apple only has 6,000. Just like in the mobile phone market, more users and more apps mean more money for developers, so there will probably only be a few winners. I'm pretty sure that Roku will be one of them.On The Roku Channel, you can watch a selection of movies, 24/7 live news (in the US and Canada), children's programming, and much more. You can also add premium subscriptions, like Disney+ (DIS), Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.The free content is monetized by ads, and for the subscriptions, Roku takes a share of the subscription revenue.The Roku Channel has now become an app store for premium paying and non-paying channels. It has grown into a full-blown platform in that way.The Roku Channel was even launched on Amazon's Fire TV, and I think that's a gamechanger. If you look at the hardware side, Amazon's Fire TVs and sticks are the only real competitors for Roku's products. This was the situation in May of this year:Roku has also just launched an app for Apple and Android devices. With the Fire TV inclusion and the apps on Android and iOS, this will grow the addressable market for The Roku Channel in a really impactful way.The Roku Channel can only be monetized by ads on the other platforms, not by subscriptions, which is logical, as Amazon also takes its cut for a paying subscription like Netflix. But that doesn't matter - a lot of money will be made in the huge explosion of TV channels by brands, companies, artists, producers, influencers and many more.With this expansion to iOS, Android and Fire, Roku can monetize much easier worldwide. Roku has started to expand internationally by introducing its operating system in TVs and by launching the sticks and dongles. That strategy will probably work very well in most of the world, as it did in the US and Canada.But The Roku Channel could already be launched before on platforms popular in those countries that Roku wants to target. It could have a double effect: the monetization could be much higher from the start, and people could also start buying Roku hardware because they know The Roku Channel, and that would, in its turn, again fortify the company's position.I think this will make Roku much bigger than it already is - and that spells o.p.p.o.r.t.u.n.i.t.y. in the stock market. With The Roku Channel, the company has a software side that will grow in importance. Worldwide, there are plenty of people who want free content, and that's what The Roku Channel can offer them.Roku is still an underappreciated company, as a lot of investors still associate it with the hardware side of the company, while it's all about the platform. The Roku Channel, which is now on Amazon's Fire TV, in Apple's App Store and in the Google Play Store, has become a platform in its own right. This company has ample room to grow for years and years.If you have enjoyed this article, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name. In the meantime, keep growing!"
4381454,105872,2020-10-26T18:08:27-04:00,Investors typically mistake Roku as a company selling only low margin hardware but Roku derives most of its revenue through advertising.Roku needs to improve its monetization to improve its future valuation.Roku's business is being accelerated long-term by the COVID pandemic.Roku has a large international opportunity ahead of it.Roku has undervalued stock price in comparison to its potential growth as both a leading content aggregator and a leading advertising platform in Connected TV.,"Source: MSN MoneyWhen I first became aware of Roku (ROKU) as an investment, I made the typical mistake most investors make when initially looking at Roku, which is to assume that Roku is simply a hardware company selling low margin bars, sticks, and boxes for streaming. If Roku were simply a hardware company, then its stock would be distinctly unattractive selling at a P/S of 19.70 and an Enterprise Value/Revenue of 20.22, especially considering that Roku has no earnings and competes vigorously against Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in hardware/software for streaming and also competes against other advertising platforms.The reason why the market has bid Roku's stock up is investors have recognized that Roku is moving towards becoming a very dominant advertising platform through the company's OneView ad platform. I consider Roku a buy here at today's prices because I believe the market has undervalued Roku's ability to monetize its users and the international growth opportunity.Source: RokuRoku has a complex history, which is why Roku often confuses investors with the initial first look. Roku was founded in October 2002 by Anthony Wood as a company that sold cheap dongles that allowed users to stream OTT. Anthony Wood originally made a name for himself by founding ReplayTV, a company that developed one of the first DVRs that allowed viewers to skip commercials. Anthony Wood's initial business foray with ReplayTV flopped because at the time, Anthony Wood failed to understand how advertising supported a large majority of the TV industry and he was also surprised at how big the backlash would be in attempting to fight a content industry based upon an advertising model. The downfall of ReplayTV was accelerated when a feature was introduced called Commercial Advance, which was essentially a remote control with a 30-second ad skip button. In response to Commercial Advance, media companies brought a lawsuit against ReplayTV that challenged the legality of commercial-skipping. Anthony Wood eventually saw the light and sold ReplayTV.Shortly after selling ReplayTV, Wood formed Roku LLC and made little progress until he sat down a few years later with Netflix (NFLX) CEO Reed Hastings and got appointed Vice President of Internet TV for Netflix to guide Netflix's own streaming player project, code-named Project Griffin. Reed Hastings, eventually, got cold feet about launching Project Griffin and eventually, Netflix decided to both invest in Roku and fold Project Griffin into a new Roku company that became incorporated in California in February 2008. At the same time, Anthony Wood left Netflix after a 10-month run at the company. Six years later in 2014, Roku got into the software game by creating the Roku OS, which is Roku's proprietary operating system designed strictly for Smart TVs and began licensing the Roku OS to television manufacturers like Hisense, TCL, and Philips. On September 28, 2017, Roku had its initial public offering and began trading on the Nasdaq exchange. It was also in 2017 that Roku launched a self-serving advertising product for advertisers to be able to serve ads to Roku viewers, which was the beginning of the monetization of Roku as an advertising platform.In November 2019, Roku bolstered its advertising technology capabilities with its acquisition of dataxu video advertising platform which has been rebranded as the OneView advertising platform. Today, it is extremely important to remember that Roku is more of a software and advertising platform than it is a hardware company. The biggest mistake that investors make when valuing Roku is looking at Roku as primarily a hardware company and failing to understand that the big revenue maker for Roku is its advertising platform. Many investors forget that dongles, boxes, and, even licensing a TV OS to various TV manufacturers is only a means to an end of distributing Roku's advertising platform and The Roku Channel.Roku is more of an ""If you can't beat them, then join them"" story in that Anthony Wood learned that it might be better to support the advertising industry rather than fighting it. Roku is now among the pioneers of a new business model that supports the streaming of content to the TV in whichever way a content producer wants to fund their content, whether it be SVOD, TVOD, or AVOD and unlike ReplayTV, Roku will do everything it can to assist the advertising industry.Roku has a mission to build a platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem worldwide and within that mission, Roku found a greenfield, lucrative software business that could be monetized by measuring the reach and effectiveness of ads on streaming apps, in which the data generated could then be used for precise ad targeting. The primary monetary opportunity that Roku has in front of it is within the Linear TV advertising budgets which have been slowly shifting over to connected TV. Roku's ultimate fate in how the company gets valued comes down to how well it can monetize its subscribers.Currently, Roku seems to be gaining the most ad market share from digital programmatic ad budgets (Google ads, Facebook ads), as opposed to gaining share from Linear TV ad brand-building budgets. In other words, Roku has recently been taking some ad spend from companies like Google and Facebook, while gaining market share from Linear TV ad budgets has been much harder. With Roku's stock trading at a P/S of 19.70, any valuation upside from this point on means that Roku has to start gaining market share from Linear TV brand-building budgets. The Linear TV ad budget is roughly a $70 billion opportunity or roughly $500 bucks per TV household.Roku is a first mover in the connected TV industry in the USA and has the largest scale. According to eMarketer research, Roku has about a 47% percent market share of connected TV users in the U.S., which is currently compromised of roughly over 85 million total users. Many analysts think Roku is the most likely company to be the winning aggregator of Connected TV apps within the USA. As the biggest Connected TV app aggregator, Roku benefits from an enormous Flywheel effect. The largest aggregator of Connected TV apps will gain the most viewers. Most viewers allow Roku to gain the most data and reach for their OneView Ad platform and for content discovery. Roku's targeted advertising, data, and reach then attracts even more content providers that then design apps for the Roku platform, thereby increasing Roku's lead as the largest aggregator of connected TV apps.The real key for Roku, however, is not just in the quantity of TV apps but more in the quality of the content providers. Roku has been using its current scale to accumulate more premium content providers like Hulu and Peacock that can provide more premium ad impressions for advertisers. The main Achilles' heel for Roku is that recently there has been a widening gap between engagement and monetization, which is concerning since Roku's valuation is directly dependent on the company's ability to monetize its user base.An investment in Roku at current prices primarily assumes that the company can better monetize the OneView ad platform and raise its ad ARPU/mo. According to a recent Wells Fargo report, Hulu SVOD has an $8 ad ARPU/mo vs. ROKU at <$2. Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall estimates that if Roku can grow its ARPU/month by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15%, then Roku can reach $3.60 ARPU/month by 2025, thereby justifying Roku's current valuation.Connected TV advertising spending in the United States from 2019 to 2023Source: StatistaConnected TV advertising is a growing trend and is projected to continue expanding to $14 billion by the end of 2023. Roku is a direct play on connected TV ad spending, and for Roku to grow its future valuation, it will have to begin growing market share in traditional TV brand-building budgets, which could be difficult because traditional media companies like a CBS or Peacock (NBC/Comcast) have been reluctant to turn over their ad inventory to Roku. As an example, the recent tense negotiations between Peacock and Roku seemed to be primarily about ad inventory sharing.Roku Revenue 2016-2020Source: MacrotrendsEven though the advertising market has recently slowed due to COVID, Roku has pretty much maintained +40% YoY revenue growth since its IPO on Sept. 28, 2017, and the lowest YoY revenue growth rate that Roku has achieved since the IPO has been 37% in the March 2017 quarter, which was the first quarter in which YOY growth started getting measured. In order for Roku to continue to keep its current valuation, the company must maintain relatively high revenue growth, which amazingly Roku has achieved even through the pandemic. Roku will also probably need its international initiatives to start contributing to revenue growth over the next several years to maintain its high growth rate.Roku Gross Profit 2016-2020Source: MacroTrendsGross profit for Roku grew 29% year over year in Q2 to $146.8 million resulting in a gross margin of 41.2%. The reason why I look at gross profit and gross margin is because those metrics, in particular, present a tangible measure of the quality of the management team and shows how successful a management team is in both generating revenue and managing the costs of labor and raw material. Roku has maintained its gross margins between 40% and 45.5% since its IPO, which is good for Roku's current business model, which also includes manufacturing hardware.Roku Free Cash FlowSource: MacrotrendsIn a perfect world, I would like to see expanding free cash flow generation. However, companies in the early stage of an expanding opportunity often reinvest their operating cash flow back into the business to grow their market position and Roku has many areas to reinvest its cash flows at high rates of return, with the Roku Channel perhaps being the most attractive area of upside opportunity. I expect that Roku will continue investing in areas like the Roku Channel, international expansion and the OneView ad platform over the next several years, so I am not currently concerned with their cash flows today. After Roku gains enough scale to properly monetize their opportunity, however, I would then like to see consistent growth of free cash flow as the company matures.Last, but not least, Roku has significantly increased its cash and liquidity position in Q2 by raising $350 million in equity capital. Roku ended Q2 with $887 million of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments and has $70 million of available liquidity under a credit facility. Roku's debt to equity for the quarter that ended in Jun. 2020 was 0.42. I believe Roku's current balance sheet will allow the company to ride out any further disruption in the advertising industry from COVID.Roku is only just getting started in its next stage of growth which is the international opportunity. Up until now, I have mostly mentioned the domestic US business and I have only lightly touched upon the international opportunity which might be the biggest factor in deciding Roku's future valuation. Roku's advantage is that it has the best OS for Smart TVs. Roku's disadvantage is that in Europe, Alphabet is already becoming well entrenched with Android TV and in Asia, large TV manufacturers that already have a meaningful install base use different TV operating systems. LG (Korea), Panasonic (OTCPK:PCRFY) (Japan), and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) (Japan) use software from the Smart TV Alliance. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) uses Tizen which is OS designed originally for smartphones. South America and Africa, however, is a wide-open greenfield opportunity for all players.Last year, Roku made their European entry by announcing at the consumer tech show IFA in Berlin that manufacturers could license the Roku OS to build smart TVs for sale in Europe starting with the UK market and I believe Roku is next interested in establishing a presence in Germany. Hisense recently became the very first European Roku TV partner. Then, in April this year, Roku started distributing The Roku Channel in the U.K. on Roku devices, Sky Q set-top boxes and the NOW TV dongle. Then, in September, The Roku Channel become available as a standalone mobile app for iPhone and Android devices. The wide distribution of The Roku Channel in the UK is a sign that Roku has built a big enough user base in the UK to start monetizing The Roku Channel via advertising and Roku's audience development tools.Roku has also expanded into Brazil this year. Roku is partnering with AOC in Brazil to create AOC Roku TV, a new smart TV built for the Brazilian market that will feature the Roku OS. Globoplay, a Brazilian subscription video on demand service, will be one of the first feature services on Roku in Brazil. The fact that Roku chose Brazil as the next country to expand might be a sign that Roku intends to compete in areas that do not have a substantial competitor presence yet, as companies like Amazon and Google have been slow in moving into South America on the streaming side. Roku doesn't reveal very much about its international plans beforehand but who knows where it will go next, although it seems obvious that Europe and Latin America are two areas of interest. Roku does have a small official presence in Asia and has a deal in the Philippines with PLDT announced in 2016. Roku also has a deal with Kwesé as an exclusive African partner announced in 2017.COVID has two different effects on Roku. One is a short-term effect that is negative and the other is a long-term but positive effect. The short-term effect is that the pandemic has completely devastated TV advertising. According to Media Post:Source: Media PostThe ad slowdown has been recognized by Roku as far back as May when Roku made statements indicating 2020 ad sales would grow at a slower pace and Roku actually recorded higher cancellations in the first quarter as advertisers decided to preserve cash due to uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and Roku's stock reacted by dropping sharply.The long-term COVID effect is that COVID has accelerated the cord cutting trend. According to a recent Roku study released in July, the following trends were noted:The increased momentum around cord cutting has helped Roku increase incremental active accounts by 3.2 million in Q2 2020 to reach 43 million and streaming hours increased by 2.3 billion hours over Q1 to 14.6 billion. So, Roku is significantly increasing both its user accounts and its audience engagement, partially due to COVID. Secondarily, the pandemic has caused a horrendous 2020 upfront market due to the TV shows shutting down production, sporting events being cancelled and many brands cutting back on advertising. Some brands like P&G have announced that it will skip next year's upfronts altogether. Procter & Gamble (PG) has decided that it will negotiate directly with media outlets going forward. Brands are also looking for more optionality during the age of COVID. The possibilities of a deep recession make brands reluctant to commit to long brand-building advertising campaigns. One of the advantages of Roku's OneView is that as a self serve ad platform, it provides optionality for brands to both quickly start and stop ad campaigns at their convenience. It is because the upfront market has collapsed, a greater portion of Linear TV brand-building ad budgets have potentially opened up for connected TV ad platforms like OneView.Among the biggest risk that I see is competition from Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung on the hardware/software side. Recently, there have been talks about Google being a significant rival to Roku. Among the biggest things investors misunderstand about Roku's competitive positioning is knowing the specific distinctions that separate Roku from its large competitors. So, why has Samsung Tizen, Android TV, Fire TV, and Apple iOS found difficulty surpassing the Roku OS?One answer is that Roku has the only purpose-built operating system for a TV. The Roku team designed its operating system from scratch to run on low cost hardware. Roku's operating system is designed to use basic chips that have less power and are designed to run on a tight memory footprint. On the other hand, key competitors like Android TV uses Android, Amazon Fire TV uses the fourth version of Android, Samsung Smart TVs use Tizen, and Apple uses iOS for its players. Tizen, Android, and iOS are all originally phone operating systems that are designed for fast, very high powered chips. What this means is that Roku smart TVs are cheaper to build than systems based upon Android, Tizen, and iOS, which is a structural advantage for Roku Smart TVs. Effectively, TV manufacturers know they can build well made TVs based on the Roku OS for a cheaper price than TVs based upon Tizen, iOS, or Android because TV manufacturers know they can use a lower priced chip to build the TV. Roku CFO Steve Louden mentioned this advantage when discussing key differentiators between Roku and competitors at the KeyBanc Future of Technology Conference on September 15, 2020:Another risk for Roku is that Roku is in increasing competition with content producers with the most important content producers being old media. Recent negotiations with some old media content producers have briefly turned sour before a deal was signed. Two examples are Roku versus Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). Currently, HBO Max is the only content producer that is in a dispute with Roku. Investors worry that carriage disputes similar to what has taken place in the past between cable companies and content producers will also occur in the streaming industry. If a major content producer like Netflix, Disney+, ESPN, Amazon, or Apple+ gets into a major dispute with Roku in the future that might indeed cause problems for Roku.There are two ways Roku can mitigate the risk of a carriage dispute. The first way is through sheer scale. If Roku were a cable company, it would be the largest in the country with 43 million subscribers and AT&T (NYSE:T) would be second with 22.3 million subscribers. The larger Roku grows its subscriber base, the less desirable it will be for content providers to have extended contract disputes.Another way is through Roku's audience development platform which includes free programs for helping drive content discovery such as Roku Search, Instant Signup, and Featured Free. Another tool available for audience development is Roku's Self-Serve Promotions tool which enables any content producer to buy targeted display ads on the Roku home screen. Another valuable tool for audience development is The Roku Channel, where content providers can advertise specific shows and advertise premium subscriptions. Roku considers their audience development platform as the best in the business and Roku's management has taken credit for being an important part of Disney+ massive audience growth. Roku's tools that help build and maintain audience is a powerful attraction that helps somewhat mitigate content producers getting into contract disputes with Roku.While Roku presents itself as a ""Neutral"" platform, in reality, there is a decent sized chance that in the future Roku will produce original content exclusively for The Roku Channel and be in more direct competition for ad inventory and eyeballs with other content producers. In February, Jim Cramer on Mad Money mentioned the possibility that Roku in the future could increasingly be seen as a competitor rather than a partner. As an advertising platform, Roku competes with Hulu, Amazon, Comcast ad platforms as well as The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD), which is seen by advertisers as a truly neutral third party. Last but not least is that Roku's valuation moving forward will likely also depend on the progress of Roku's international expansion. Roku faces stiff competition in Europe and Asia but faces much less competition in South America and Africa. If international growth disappoints in the future, there is a good chance that Roku's stock price will take a hit.Currently, Roku does not have earnings, has a price to cash flow of 333.19 which is a very, very rich valuation but fairly prices in growth that Roku is expecting within the USA from cord cutting, the re-emergence of the advertising market after COVID, and the monetization of customers measured in ARPU. The next stage of Roku's growth is within the international opportunity and Roku is at the point where it might also start to begin trading based upon the perception of how well Roku is doing internationally. Besides the fact that the international opportunity might take a few years to show meaningful growth, it is important that investors also recognize that Roku's overall valuation is dependent on the success of, or lack thereof, of Roku monetizing the OneView advertising platform and The Roku Channel as well as the international growth.How investors think about Roku at current prices depends on an investor's time frame. Near term, meaning over the next year, Roku seems fairly valued based strictly upon US subscriber growth and monetization. Over the long term, meaning 3 to 5 years, I consider Roku a strong buy based upon the expected increased monetization domestically and international growth."

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Roku (ROKU), the world's most popular smart TV platform, has had a tremendous run all year. The company's well-timed pivot toward being a company that focuses primarily on advertising and platform revenues (now about two-thirds of the company's revenue versus one-third hardware, a ratio that is the reverse of when the company went public in 2017) meant that Roku was a strong beneficiary of the rapid rise in streaming hours this year amid the global lockdowns. Though ad rates have suffered this year due to companies' widespread decision to cut back on marketing to conserve cash, Roku has still been able to leverage its customers' surge in usage to grow platform revenues at an impressive ~50% y/y pace.The market has rewarded Roku well for its strong execution. The stock is up more than 60% year-to-date - and, it's important for investors to be aware, a large portion of these gains came in the last month alone.Data by YChartsNow, there are certainly real catalysts backing Roku's recent rapid ascent, which we'll discuss in more detail in this article. The company has launched a new lineup of high-end hardware devices that, beyond the immediate boost to hardware revenues (which Roku investors hardly care about anyway), will help Roku to compete in the higher end of the smart TV market and diversify beyond its reputation of being an entry-level smart TV. In addition, Roku has also resolved some key carriage disputes that help the company broaden its pool of content and improve its users' retention. At the same time, however, it's difficult to continue to be bullish on Roku after recognizing the the stock is up so sharply. I was fortunate to have entered a long position in Roku in July when the stock was in the low $110s; now, my view on the stock is neutral and I've closed the trade in anticipation of better prices down the road.Heading into the 2020 elections, I do think volatility will grip the markets again in last quarter of the year, and investors would be wise to position themselves defensively - and away from richly valued momentum stocks. The best move here is to lock in gains and step to the sidelines.Let's also briefly cover the latest news on Roku. In late September, the company unveiled two new high-end products, the 2020 Roku Ultra and the Roku Streambar.Let's start with the refreshed Ultra product. Priced at $99.99 and branded as ""our fastest and most powerful player ever,"" the Ultra is now Roku's highest-end smart TV that comes equipped with HDR and more advanced wireless capabilities. Take a look at how the Ultra compares with Roku's previous existing players in the chart below:Figure 1. Roku Ultra comparisonSource: Roku.comThe new Ultra is an improvement over last year's Ultra model in a number of ways. Importantly, the new Ultra includes Bluetooth support - meaning that you can now connect other Bluetooth-enabled devices like phones to play music through the new 2020 Ultra. The new Ultra also comes equipped with better wireless coverage than the prior model, meaning it can function better when it's further away from the wireless router in your home (PCMag notes that the range has improved by ~50%).The Roku Streambar, meanwhile, is a completely new product. Priced at $129.99, the product offers HD sound and is meant to help Roku compete against other soundbar products such as Sonos' Playbar, while also doubling as a streaming device. The product fits right underneath the company's existing Smart Soundbar ($179.99), intended for larger rooms and more open spaces.Figure 2. Roku StreambarSource: Roku.comTo me, Roku's additions to its higher-priced lineup goes beyond the kick to hardware revenues in Q4. The more important piece is that Roku can more effectively expand its market of buyers. With the refresh of these products at the top of Roku's price range, the company can effectively compete at all ends of the price spectrum, starting from its $20 starter devices to its higher-quality >$100 devices. The reason Roku is the #1 smart TV platform is because its hardware lineup covers so much breadth, and the successful launch of the new Ultra and Streambar is key in defending this advantage.The other piece of recent news on Roku - and likely the news that is more responsible for Roku's recent rally more than the hardware launches - is Roku's new agreements that dramatically broaden its reach in the streaming world. In mid-September, Roku finally announced that NBC's new streaming service Peacock would finally be available on The Roku Channel. This is months after Peacock's July launch, a rollout that was almost certainly crimped by its absence on the largest U.S. streaming platform. The two sides had disagreed on a number of issues, including revenue splits and whether Peacock would be a standalone app (NBC's preference) or be part of The Roku Channel (Roku's preference). Roku won this battle, which gives it control over the ad inventory and how consumers on its platform discover Peacock content.Beyond the customer engagement and revenue/ad opportunities that Peacock provides, I think this victory demonstrates the important fact that streaming services can't afford to be excluded from Roku, no matter the cost. Roku has the broadest reach of any other TV operating system, and so finally Peacock had to cave. In my view, the resolution of this carriage deal is a positive signal that HBO Max (a far more prominent streaming service, and also still clogged up in negotiations) will get resolved to Roku's favor in the near term as well. In other bullish partnership news: Amazon (AMZN) also announced that The Roku Channel would be available on Amazon Fire devices. Roku can even now be activated through a voice command on Amazon's Alexa. Debuted in October, this means that even users without Roku hardware can now access Roku Channel content (including, now, Peacock) and further cements Roku's move away from hardware and into platform services. To me, this is a signal that Roku has done a good job of building up a large library of content on The Roku Channel, to the extent that even one of its most prominent competitors in the entry-level smart TV space would agree to let Roku encroach in its space. Roku's new hardware lineup, its inclusion on the Amazon Fire ecosystem, and the inclusion of Peacock are all notable revenue drivers for Q4 and beyond, so it makes sense that Roku has rallied generously in September and October. But the question for investors now is: has the stock gone too far?At present share prices above $220, Roku trades at a market cap of $27.25 billion. After netting off the $885.8 million of cash and $97.2 million of debt on Roku's most recent balance sheet, the company's enterprise value is $26.94 billion. Versus Wall Street's revenue expectations of $2.15 billion (+35% y/y), Roku trades at a rich 12.5x EV/FY21 revenue multiple. Considering Roku's gross margin profile is still relatively low (roughly ~60% margins for platform and ~10% margins on hardware, and ~40% on a consolidated basis), this is a rich premium to pay for a company that has yet to hit profitability. Lock in gains on this trade and invest elsewhere for the time being."

If its market share starts a downward trend as I predict, its stock price could drop 20%-30% from here.Roku has about 40% market share in streaming devices today. It has a 49% market share in the OTT (Over-the-top) device and about 31% market share in the smart TV market.Given Roku's solid operating record in the OTT devices space, I expect Roku to continue its 49% OTT market share leadership.Smart TV is the key battleground in the future. In the Conviva State of Streaming Q2 report, one significant trend is Smart TV's total viewing time increased from 7% to 15%, grabbing market shares from desktop and mobile phones while OTT devices viewing time remained the same. By 2026, I project 80%+ TV streaming viewing time will be via smart TV, and less than 20% via OTT devices.Let us examine Roku's 31% smart TV market share. It is largely driven by TCL's recent surge in North America. The chart below shows top TV brands by unit shipment in North America. Note TCL's rapid surge to the top in 2019, and 3 out of the top 5 TV manufacturers use in-house streaming OS, while TCL/Funai use Roku/Android. In 2019, smart TV represented 90% of total TV shipments in North America.Source: chart compiled by the author using the data cited above.TCL, like Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), LG, has its own streaming TV OS called Falcon. It is widely distributed in the Chinese market with over 16 million active accounts. It also partners with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to build Android TV, and the street rumored that it tried to negotiate advertisement revenue sharing with Roku with no success so far.TCL/Roku was and still is a win-win partnership. It brings a familiar Roku experience to the US consumers when a foreign brand TCL was initially introduced. As TCL solidifies its smart TV market leader position in North America, I think bargaining power slowly shifts to TCL.I think, going forward, it will be increasingly challenging for Roku to maintain its smart TV market share without offering a material reciprocation to its prominent TV partners such as TCL.Its OTT devices market share carries less weight as streaming viewing time shifts to smart TV. I think, in an optimistic scenario, Roku maintains a 30%-35% streaming TV market share in 5 years (i.e. it maintains 25%-31% smart TV and 49% OTT market share), with substantial downside risk in the event its major TV partners such as TCL shift to Android or use their own streaming OS.I project total active accounts grow to 113 million, APRU to $37, and platform revenue at 4.1B in 2026. NPV of all net income prior to 2026 plus 6x P/S, it values the stock at $132.Note 1: This valuation excludes player revenue as Roku's business model unlikely to generate meaningful operating profit from player revenue.Note 2: Take into account its share dilution history, I project its outstanding shares to increase by 15% by 2026.Source: created by the authorIf Roku maintains about 30% streaming TV market share in 2026, it equates to 65-70 million active accounts in the US, around 60% of projected total active accounts. I choose 6x P/S in 2026 considering its projected low 2 digits growth by then.For bull scenarios, if ARPU shows strong growth in the coming quarters (currently, I project 5-8% annual growth to $37 APRU in 2026), its valuation could rise significantly.For bear scenarios, any material partnership change with TCL (and/or to a less degree Funai and Hisense) could negatively impact its active user growth, especially if TCL chooses to switch to its own operating platform in North America (low probability, but shall watch closely), or significantly shift productions to Android TV. In my opinion, an advertisement revenue-sharing agreement with prominent TV manufacturers is a painful yet prudent approach that provides stability to Roku's long-term growth.What Roku achieved in the last few years are truly remarkable, its ability to navigate through narrow paths, to carve out a prominent space among powerful competitors is second to none.Roku also operates in a sector full of potential growth and tailwinds. However, its current valuation priced in user/monetization growth that is dependent upon its relationship with primary TV manufacturers like TCL, and its ability to expand internationally.There is a lot to like about Roku. However, I think its path forward will be highly volatile and might face significant headwinds along the way. I will monitor closely and consider building a position if it drops to around $110-120 range.As I am researching Roku and TV streaming eco-systems, I stumbled upon a few companies that I think at least one of them might present a better investment opportunity than Roku. I am gathering info and hope to present my idea in the next 1-2 weeks. If you are interested, I would appreciate you following me and hope you might like it.

Roku Inc. has already made an immensely successful debut, bedding in its credibility in the entertainment space.Source: WallmineI maintain a positive outlook on the short- to mid-term prospects of the firm:Here I crunch the numbers behind how Roku has performed statistically during earnings and marry this with my provisional bullish thesis. Accordingly, I explore possible positions which could be taken to capitalize on the streaming stalwart and reflect on how equity holders can capitalize on the event. Since its IPO in 2017, Roku Inc. has very much been the poster child of the home entertainment growth story. To date, the stock has gained 67.3% and 999.5% over a 3-year period.Source: BenzingaThe stock is presently trading slightly below its 52-week high which echoes resilience lately witnessed in Nasdaq price movement. Well beyond its 250-day moving average (+62.5%), this remains a security which is fully valued. Options markets remain liquid for Roku, with circa 47,000 contracts exchanging hands daily and maturities expiring on a weekly basis. This allows considerable opportunity not only from an earnings perspective but also from a contingency planning perspective; having more frequent maturities, a liquid market and a relatively closely followed stock provides safeguards for position management. The company currently maintains a market capitalization of $27.9B with price to sales of about 19X. The company remains ever so present in the high growth, cyclical consumer discretionary segment – a segment presently in vogue but susceptible to continual risk.Source: Market ChameleonInitially, it is paramount to assess dividends and hard to borrow fees. This determines whether holding a short position would be exposed to dividend risk, and if so, what hard to borrow fees exist on short positions. In the case of Roku, no dividends are currently paid and hard to borrow fees are 0.25% (per Interactive Brokers). Prudence is important here as stocks with high short interest may have such substantial hard to borrow fees that any short position would be too onerous to carry. Case in point is Nikola Corporation (NKLA) which until recently commanded 750% hard to borrow fees.Source: Market ChameleonIt is useful to verify volatility mechanics pre and post earnings. Roku’s current ATM implied volatility rank is 73.6 which is moderate. However, this remains 4.6% above its 20-day moving average, indicating implied volatility is trending higher. This current implied volatility figure is currently 41.3% above its 20-day historical volatility of 52.1. It is visible in the graphic above that spikes in options trading volume subsist around earnings dates and volatility is compressed thereafter. This provides an option of selling volatility, at least on a provisional basis, when positions are assessed later. In Roku’s most recent released earnings, implied volatility dropped to 59.2 resulting in an implied volatility crush of 21%.An important part of validating which strategy to develop is understanding price mechanics. Large price swings outside of implied moves make short directional-neutral plays such as strangles and straddles extremely risky. In this instance, predicted average moves were +/- 14.1%, whereas actual average moves were 19.1% (!) The graph below clearly demonstrates that Roku has been volatile around earnings. This has not always manifested itself in implied prices. In the last 3 moves, Roku has remained range bound and to the downside. However, in earlier stages of the stock’s life (Nov. 8, 2017 for example), the implied earnings move was +/- 15.6% and the actual move was +54.9%. It is noteworthy that swings like this have become less marked as the company has matured, with moves to the downside within implied price move brackets in the last 4 earnings periods all save Nov. 6th, 2019. Consequently, a defined risk position is arguably more suitable than an undefined one.Source: Market ChameleonLong straddles have in the past commanded a 67% win rate which correlates with large swings in stock pricing at earnings (see above). This discounts somewhat the viability of directionless trades such as short straddles, strangles and butterflies.It is subsequently critical to appraise price action mechanics pre and post earnings. In the graphic below, Roku’s volatility gradually expands going into earnings. Based on last 12 quarters of data, Roku habitually moved up, gaining ~7% in the 2 weeks preceding the event. This information, including knowledge that volatility also increases, allows us to consider long positions. Something as elementary as a long call, which would benefit from both price appreciation and an expansion in volatility (increases in volatility always accompany price increases in long options) would be a possibility. However, note that 58% of the time, shares moved lower post earnings, signifying that an exit would have to be planned accordingly.Source: Market ChameleonAnalyzing stock price performance data, in combination with all the information developed thus far, the following can be extrapolated:Some important data sets have been developed regarding both options characteristics and mechanics which we marry with my moderately bullish thesis. With the information categorized, the following can be extrapolated:Source: Market ChameleonGiven the above, credit put spreads fit in nicely with the strategy.In this actionable example, a credit put spread with a short 25 delta put and a long 15 delta put is selected, holding it 2 weeks post earnings. Moving forward, we will be able to see how the position prevails.The most important takeaway for an earnings play is to develop a thesis and marry it with a system. Personally, I am interested in statistics and probabilities. For long-term investments, close scrutiny of the financial reports is equally paramount.In this example, we covered:Overall, I remain bullish on Roku and intend to effectuate the above-mentioned options play into earnings.

It is the best pure-play stock on worldwide streaming transformation and remains undervalued relative to its long-term growth runway.In this article, I've dived deep into the business model and discussed the forces in play on advertising revenue during the pandemic, which may shed some light on what's in store for the company in the coming quarters. Note that this isn't a full thesis and excludes important factors such as competitive positioning and management analysis. My intention with this write-up was to zero-in on the business model, therefore providing a foundation for explaining ad revenue, which I believe is a major stock price driver.I'm optimistic about Roku outperforming their sales growth consensus forecasts in the short term, and at a 1-year EV/S of 15.0x, there's enough long-term upside potential to warrant a generous spot in my portfolio.The business model for the company is particularly unique, and there appear to still be misconceptions regarding how things fit together across the online investing community. If we can get the big picture of how the Roku machine works, we can isolate the key levers and drivers for revenue generation in the coming quarters. For my thesis, achieving clarity on what makes the model special has been a critical factor in my investment decision.IntroductionTo start with, Roku functions as an operating system for televisions that is becoming increasingly popular worldwide (43 million active accounts and counting). Think Android for mobile phones, or Windows for PCs; there's a similar market for televisions. Content publishers such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, Disney+ (NYSE:DIS), and more recently, Peacock, can be compared to software or apps that are installed on the OS. Roku also has its own apps, such as ""Roku Channel"" which hosts movies and television for free. As the app ecosystem becomes richer with millions of end-users, its monetization potential also increases. Roku realized this years ago and began capitalizing on this ecosystem by layering videos and screen real-estate with advertising. After all, linear TV ad spend had to find a new home in a cord-cutting world. Ad-free services (e.g. Netflix) remained ad-free, but other vibrant content apps from prominent publishers and the free Roku Channel offered a large ad inventory that could reach an expansive viewer base. Content publishers had the options of either revenue sharing after providing their whole ad inventory to Roku's system, or ad-inventory sharing where Roku would reap the shared inventory profits. Negotiations regarding these deals have depended on leverage where Roku's scale as a content distribution network has helped secure favourable terms. Ultimately, product-market fit for Connected TV advertising was achieved fairly quickly, and the company has been growing rapidly ever since, as has its share price.Network EffectsRoku is an interconnected system of content publishers, advertisers, and users that come together on a single platform. The chart below is my interpretation of how the relationships between the company and its various stakeholders work.Source: AuthorI've listed the three categories of stakeholders and the value proposition (the green text) each category attains by engaging on the platform. The above model isn't far off from other digital advertising powerhouses such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that bring content, users, and ads together. It is important to note that this is a platform company. Platform business models have reinforcing network effects that promote substantial organic growth. The bigger the platforms get, the wider the moat, and the higher the monetisation potential.The more viewers are onboarded, the more incentives content publishers have to get onto Roku. The platform is at a stage where not being on Roku is detrimental to even large content publishers as they miss out on millions of Roku households. The ad inventory that's generated on the platform is a function of the number of users and viewing hours on AVOD (Ad-supported video on demand) content. High-value ad-inventory offers more opportunities for advertisers to get on board and reach consumers. Roku's advertising technology (the ""OneView"" ad platform) optimizes spending and delivers relevance and results due to the vast pool of data collected from content publishers and its user base. The proceeds from ad spending on Roku can be circulated back to AVOD content publishers (in the case, revenue-sharing agreements), incentivising more content to come to Roku. The cycle has positive reflexivity and promotes organic growth this way. The value propositions for all stakeholders rise through these symbiotic relationships.As one would expect, the speed and scale at which these network effects come into play begin with onboarding as many viewers as possible on the platform. Roku knows this and has been fairly aggressive in capturing households, burning cash along the way to invest in growth.How Roku Grows Its UserbaseGiven the global opportunity for Connected TV and streaming, the company is in a race to capture viewers and televisions against Google's Android TV (including the new ""Google TV"" OS) and Amazon's Fire TV (NASDAQ:AMZN). There are two main ways a viewer gets onboard the Roku operating system: streaming players and pre-installed ""Roku TV"" televisions.Source: AuthorStreaming players are what we've come to know of when we hear Roku. The company directly sells plug-in sticks, set-top boxes, and more recently, soundbars and speakers to consumers. Using the operating system analogy, these players are how users install the Roku OS on their existing TVs. The other distribution channel is to license their OS to existing TV manufacturers using the ""Roku TV"" brand (similar to how a new Dell laptop has Windows 10 preinstalled due to an existing licensing deal). This eliminates the decision for consumers to buy separate streaming sticks altogether once they're purchasing a new Roku TV. OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) include TCL, Hitachi, and Hisense among others. While readers might be wondering about Sony (NYSE:SNE)/Samsung (OTC:SSNLF)/LG (OTC:LGEAF), note that one of three smart TVs being sold in the US is a ""Roku TV"" (Source: Q2 Shareholder Letter). The partnered brands are targeting lower and middle markets and have achieved some impressive scale (especially TCL) despite the more well-known high-end manufacturers. This is strategically favourable, in my opinion, as the lower and middle-market consumers are more likely to go for non-subscription based ad-supported content such as the free Roku Channel (better for overall ad-based profits).As one would expect during COVID-19, more people bought streaming players, leading to an acceleration in account growth, surpassing 43 million Roku active accounts. From the lack of entertainment alternatives during the pandemic, total streaming hours surged forward, along with the continued onboarding of more content publishers. That brings us to the broad conclusion that the supply of advertising inventory grew. Let's look at how Roku deals with the demand side of that inventory.The In-built Advertising BrokerageRoku is both, a supplier and a broker of ad inventory. It is a supplier through Roku Channel, but also a broker since it accesses partial or whole ad inventory and data from other AVOD content publishers depending on the pre-existing deals. Unlike linear broadcasted television, where advertising spots and time slots are auctioned off based on Nielsen ratings, the way Connected TV advertising works is far more advanced. I'd compare it to automated electronic stock exchanges with data science-backed intelligence balancing demand, supply, and cost optimization of ad spend to produce quantifiable results. Investors who know of The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) would be well aware of how sophisticated programmatic advertising has become.Source: AuthorThrough their users' viewing habits, Roku has collected data points that inform their advertising platform, OneView, on how to best allocate ad spend. OneView's foundational tech was acquired when Roku bought over dataxu, that specialized in programmatic connected TV advertising. It is important to note that the tech itself is an important factor. Improving ad spend ROI isn't just competing with linear TV ad spend, but total ad spend that may be allocated to other digital platforms such as Search and Social Media. The digital advertising game is heavily influenced by the robustness of the technology to deliver maximum bang for your buck to reach users and convert them to buyers. Ad revenue potential doesn't scale just linearly with the number of users, but exponentially as larger userbases produce more data that in turn improves the effectiveness of the ad-broker. This effect can be partially measured in ARPU, or annual revenue per user, which has steadily been increasing over the last few quarters in the case of Roku.Source: E-MarketerThe tech-ad revenue relationship is what the market misses in platform companies in my opinion, by mistaking linear growth in users for linear growth in revenues (when there's an exponential element as well). Differences between Twitter (~330 million users) and Facebook (~2.5 billion users) don't just show an 8x multiple in digital ad spend (as the active user number multiple would suggest), but a ~23x difference going by the e-marketer chart above. While there are a variety of factors that may contribute to the differences, it makes logical sense to attribute success to larger data pools from larger inventory, and therefore better relevance and ad-targeting intelligence. The powerhouses above don't make money just because they have you using their products (user engagement), but also because they know and understand you. Ideally, this factor would play to strengthened revenue drivers in Roku's business as it scales across vast data instances of users, user behaviour, content publishers, and other engagement metrics.A Mixture Of Headwinds & TailwindsIn my last article, I remarked upon the different forces at play that may impact Roku's Platform Revenue during the pandemic. The theory was that a fair proportion of pre-pandemic Roku ad buyers would stop spending on the platform, while a new cohort of ad buyers would make their way onto Roku. I attributed the latter effect to a large disruption in quality advertising inventory in the linear-TV market, especially since sports and live events turned off while streaming became dominant entertainment when quarantine was enforced. Ultimately, the pandemic resulted in both headwinds and tailwinds for the company, although it is difficult to predict to what equilibrium those forces would level off. Roku's Q2 sales growth of 42% yoy provided some colour that the business has stayed resilient in the face of global ad-demand contraction.Source: AuthorOne positive aspect we should consider is that the rate of churn of the old ad-buyers would have a lower drag on total revenue right now than they did in say March/April. I've tried to explain this effect as an abstraction in the diagram above (the pink dots). We also know from Q2 results that several new ad-buyers (purple dots) were indeed onboarded as they moved following consumer eyes with a contraction in linear TV and an expansion in streaming TV ad inventory. I have reason to believe this trend of new ad buyers will continue. Theoretically, if churn has reduced, and new ad-buyer additions remain the same, we can expect a large sequential jump in Platform Revenue in Q3.Possible Acceleration in CTV Ad Spend in 2H 2020Now, readers might ask: ""Hey Abstract, that's just a made-up diagram and you've randomly put too many purple dots to fit a biased view"". Well, the above is just an analogy so take it with some salt, and a few sources of data have supported strong ad-spend flow to Connected TV in the coming two quarters.Source: IAB Proprietary Research; ""COVID Impact on Ad Spend 2020: The Transformation Of The Television Marketplace"" (Published 06/16/20)Source: IAB Proprietary Research; ""COVID Impact on Ad Spend 2020: The Transformation Of The Television Marketplace"" (Published 06/16/20)Source: IAB Proprietary Research; ""2020/21 COVID Impact on Advertising: Survey 6 Results"" (Published 09/02/20)The charts above were taken from the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) that publicly publishes survey results and other research/intelligence on advertising from respondents across nearly every sector. Across both digital and traditional advertising channels, CTV ad spend is expected to see the largest increase in ad spend in Q3 and Q4 relative to the previous year based on a survey conducted in June.Total US television advertising is a $70B market, and going by the estimated outlook for FY2020, the linear TV spend will record a major contraction. What is interesting to me, however, is the difference between the isolated Q3/Q4 estimates for CTV (+25%/+27% in the middle chart) vs. the FY2020 estimates (+19% in the bottom chart). The inference I draw from this is that the back half of 2020 is expected to accelerate in CTV ad spend vs the front half of 2020 in terms of growth rates. 1H 2020 CTV ad spending has likely grown well below the 19% rate, which is why 2H 2020 projections are in the ~25% range thereby balancing out the total. This could mean that we'll experience strong tailwinds for Roku in the latter half of 2020. The inference also broadly echoes our understanding that Q1/Q2 disruptions in ad-spend were particularly severe relative to where they are now.Readers should note that this is imperfect information, and it is entirely possible my judgement could be wrong, given the data at hand. But I like the odds of a Q3 surprise, given this imperfect information. I'd also like to point to the recent surprise in Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP) earnings, which helped drive up Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) share prices as well. It factors into a broader theme that digital advertising is making a comeback, and the early results for Q3 social media ad-spend are playing out well when compared to Social Media IAB estimates.Supply Side DevelopmentsMost of the noise surrounding Roku has been on the content side, with the closing of the Peacock deal and other OEM partnerships. From what we know, Roku has access to some of Peacock's ad inventory, and the deal might have led Roku to compromise on their otherwise greedier ad revenue sharing take rates. Over the long term, however, this strengthens Roku's position to negotiate deals with other content publishers such as HBO Max, that are missing out and don't really have much leverage in negotiations right now. Ultimately, I don't think the number of content publishers is particularly important as streaming hours have plateaued in this environment.Source: Comscore, ""The State Of OTT"" (Published 09/2020)Viewers watching Peacock on Roku, for instance, would take away time from some other app, perhaps Netflix or The Roku Channel. The important question is whether more people are tuning into AVOD (Ad-Supported Video On Demand) vs. SVOD (Subscription Video On Demand) on the Roku platform. The bigger short-term driver for the stock price, in my opinion, isn't another content publisher deal, but the recovery in CTV ad revenue demand as it directly impacts the financials. If appetites for CTV ads have drastically improved and Roku stands to benefit, it could re-rate the company's future growth trajectory.Source: Koyfin; Roku's Quarterly Revenues & Growth RatesQ2 recorded a decelerated sales growth rate of 42.4% yoy. Leading up the pandemic, Roku was accelerating comfortably scoring growth in the 50% range. Given what I discussed above, we could see some re-acceleration in Q3 2020, especially since the sequential jump between Q2 and Q3 2019 was relatively muted.Source: Koyfin; Share Price Action & EV/S MultiplesRoku's EV/S multiples are slightly higher than what they were a year ago. The price has soared in recent months, but I still believe there's a lot more upside. Given the company's demonstrated product innovation, adaptability, and execution, the Roku brand can take over more users and expand well internationally. An NTM EV/S of 15.0x is not unreasonable if sales remain over the 40% yoy range in the coming quarters, which I believe is likely. There are multiple tailwinds at play, from growing CTV ad demand to OneView's tech, and continued cord-cutting globally. There's an immense opportunity, and the company is leading the race to become the Android/Windows of TVs.From a short-term perspective, analysts have a consensus estimate for Q3 sales growth at 40.84% yoy according to Koyfin. I believe the forecast is conservative, and there's a very high probability of outperformance based on everything I discussed on ad-demand recovery through this article.ROKU is a ""Buy"", in my opinion. The business model sets the company up for excellent organic sales growth through network effects, leading to a wider moat as the platform scales. Platform-style models such as these turn into juggernauts for growth and command an appropriately high valuation premium.The OneView technology is an internal tailwind to ad-revenue growth and enables the company to get smarter and more effective at optimizing ad spend, attracting more ad-buyers to the platform. I expect headwinds from the pandemic to fade, and tailwinds to continue forward as ad-buyer churn reduces and more ad-spend finds its way to CTV, hopefully at an accelerated rate in 2H 2020 compared to 1H 2020. The odds of Roku outperforming their ~40%yoy sales growth estimate for Q3 are high, given my analysis.I imagine several readers here would be sitting on large unrealized gains on their ROKU positions. As far as ""Letting your winners run"" goes as popular investment wisdom, this one fits the bill. I am long ROKU."
4376633,105812,2020-09-28T11:36:31-04:00,"Roku's platform aggregates streaming content, enabling users to manage their subscriptions and make payments from one place.
        One-third of households don’t have traditional TV, and another 25% have started cutting back on services. This is making it difficult for marketers to reach cord cutters.
        Roku’s OneView platform helps digital advertisers manage campaigns across OTT, desktop, and mobile devices—this enables them to reach more than 4 out of 5 homes in the United States.
        Roku's user base reach 43 million in Q2'20, representing 42% annualized growth since Q2'17. Over the same time period, streaming hours have grown at 61% annually.
        Roku's revenue growth has accelerated each year since the company went public.","Roku’s (ROKU) platform aggregates streaming content, providing a simplified user experience, while helping both content publishers and digital marketers reach a wider audience. Roku is capitalizing on two pervasive trends: cord cutting and the growth of digital advertising—and these trends are only gaining traction, making Roku an excellent longterm investment idea.My investment thesis can be summarized in three points:1. Roku is the top streaming platform in the United States in terms of streaming hours (I.e. user engagement). This makes Roku’s platform valuable to both content publishers and digital marketers, affording Roku an enormous market opportunity. 2. Roku has collected a massive amount of user data. Roku’s demand-side advertising platform (OneView) helps unlock the value in this data, enabling marketers to create, manage, and optimize targeted campaigns that reach over 80% of US households.3. Over the last three years, Roku's user base has increased at 38% annually, while streaming hours (I.e. user engagement) have increased at 61% annually. This has translated into 47% annualized revenue growth since 2017. Roku generates revenue from two different business segments: player and platform.1. Player Revenue is earned through sale of Roku streaming devices, which currently vary in price from $29.99 to $99.99. Roku also sells other hardware, such as Roku Smart Soundbars and Roku TV Wireless Speakers.Source: Created by the author using images from Roku.2. Platform Revenue is earned through subscription services, billings services, licensing, and digital advertising. These are discussed below in more detail.While Roku does not provide specific details regarding OneView's monetization, Roku’s Senior VP, Scott Rosenberg, said this during the Q2’20 earnings call:In other words, OneView allows Roku to monetize third-party ad inventory, even though they are not the seller of that ad inventory. This includes ad inventory both on and off the Roku platform, as OneView allows marketers to manage campaigns across OTT TV, desktop, and mobile devices.Julian Mintz, Roku’s head of west and central ad sales, spoke to this in a recent interview:This is a huge move for Roku, as it opens the door to an enormous market opportunity. To put some numbers behind this, the global market for digital advertising and marketing is expected to grow from $323 billion in 2020 to $640 billion by 2027, representing 10.3% annualized growth. This means that digital advertising should become an increasingly large part of the global OTT services market, which is set to reach $157 billion by 2024.So, let’s take a closer look at OneView, as I believe it represents the majority of Roku's total addressable market at the present time.After acquiring the demand-side advertising platform (DSP) Dataxu in 2019, Roku released the OneView DSP. Roku’s OneView platform combines Roku’s first-party data—which they claim is the largest TV data set—with Dataxu’s identity and attribution tools. Marketers can also integrate third party data. The result is a DSP that allows marketers to plan targeted campaigns, programmatically buy ad space, and measure results. Roku also offers guaranteed outcomes (such as website visits or mobile app downloads) to marketers using OneView.But the benefits extend beyond Roku’s platform. OneView can buy ad inventory from any source to which Dataxu had access. For instance, OneView can buy ad inventory on other OTT platforms, like Hulu. OneView can also buy ad inventory from Xandr, AT&T’s (T) sell-side platform, which is widely used across TV and digital media (mobile, online, social media). The upshot is that marketers can use OneView to manage campaigns across OTT, desktop, and mobile. This means marketers can target ads on Roku's platform based on a user's web or mobile activity, and vice versa—for example, if you recently searched the web for ""tax filing deadline"", you could receive an ad from Intuit (INTU) TurboTax. Or if you recently saw an ad for Intuit TurboTax on Roku's platform, a similar ad may pop up the next time you're browsing the web or scrolling through a social media site. Accordingly, Roku estimates that the OneView platform can reach more than 4 out of 5 homes in the United States. So, as the digital advertising market continues to expand, Roku is poised to capture significant value.Additionally, I believe Roku will continue to improve OneView and innovate around the platform. Recently, for example, Kroger (KR) partnered with Roku to launch a new shopper data program. This combines Kroger’s data from 60 million households across 2,800 Kroger stores with the reach of the OneView platform. This will benefit consumer packaged goods (NYSE:CPG) marketers, as they are able to better target consumers and, through attribution tools, measure campaign performance.But the opportunities for this platform reach beyond advertising, into television-based commerce and digital payments. Roku Pay already enables users to purchase subscriptions and make payments through the platform. So Roku could, theoretically, extend this functionality and enable users to make other purchases as well. Jordan Rost, Roku's director of ad marketing, commented on this in an interview with Built In. He explained that, one day, Roku users may be able to use Roku Pay to purchase anything—for example, sneakers featured in a Roku ad.Roku’s competitive advantages arise from (1) intangible assets and (2) high switching costs.Roku’s primary advantage lies in certain intangible assets. These include its well known brand name, the proprietary technology behind its agnostic platform, and its ever increasing trove of user data. Roku is not always a neutral platform—for example, Peacock launched on July 15, 2020, but wasn’t available on Roku until September 21. But Roku’s platform is content agnostic, in the sense that Roku does not produce content, so it does not compete with other content publishers. The same cannot be said for its competitors. Amazon (AMZN) has Prime Video, Apple (AAPL) has Apple TV+, and Google (GOOGL) has YouTube TV. These competing platforms are incentivized to emphasize their own content, because more subscribers means more money, which may detract from the user experience.How important is this?Well, it depends on the user. If the bulk of your streaming content comes from Amazon Prime Video, then you probably won't care if Amazon’s search emphasizes its own content. But if you value a platform that treats all included content equally, then Roku is probably a better option.In addition to these intangible assets, Roku also benefits from high switching costs. Once a user has purchased a Roku streaming device or Roku TV, and taken the time to setup all their subscriptions and become familiar with the user interface, switching to another platform would take time, effort, and (probably) money.Roku’s advantages have helped them consistently grow their active user base and increase user engagement. And as these metrics have grown, Roku's platform has become more valuable to content publishers and marketers. As a result, the average revenue per user (ARPU) has been consistently on the rise.Let’s look at these key metrics in more detail.Roku focuses on three key metrics:The chart below shows active accounts growth over the last three years.Source: Created by the author using data from Roku Investor Relations.As indicated above, active accounts have grown at 42% annually since Q2'17. In the most recent quarter, growth accelerated YoY to 41%, as active accounts reached 43 million. But, as the next chart indicates, streaming hours have grown even faster than active accounts.Source: Created by the author using data from Roku Investor Relations.Streaming hours have grown at 61% annually since Q2'17. And in the most recent quarter, growth accelerated YoY to 66%, as streaming hours reached 14.6 billion. In the Q2'20 earnings call, Roku management indicated that streaming hours spiked near the beginning of the COVID-19 lockdown, and though they have moderated since then, they are still above pre-COVID levels.Finally, the graph below shows ARPU growth over the last three years.Source: Created by the author using data from Roku Investor Relations.As indicated above, ARPU has grown at 30% annually since Q2'17. Growth has been decelerating, though, measuring in at 18% YoY in Q2'20.Even so, overall growth in these key metrics has been strong. And that has translated into rapid revenue growth. Since 2017, Roku has increased revenue by 47% annually. This is shown in the chart below.Source: Created by the author using data from Roku Investor Relations.Revenue growth has accelerated each year since Roku went public—29% in 2017, 45% in 2018, 52% in 2019. And in Q1'20, revenue growth reached 55% YoY. In the most recent quarter, however, growth decelerated to 42%. But this was likely driven by temporary decreases in advertising spend due to COVID-19 business closures.As evidence of this, Roku reported that monetized video ad impressions grew 50% in Q2'20—strong growth, but a sharp deceleration from previous quarters. For example, one year ago, in Roku's Q2'19 earnings call, they stated that monetized video ad impressions more than doubled year over year. So, as the pandemic situation improves and advertising spend returns to normal, I believe that Roku's OneView platform could reaccelerate revenue growth in future quarters.Amazon is Roku’s closest competitor in terms of streaming device marketshare. Amazon last reported user metrics in Q4’19. At that time, Roku was in second place with 36.9 million users, compared to Amazon’s 40+ million users.So far in 2020, Amazon has not updated these metrics. This is slightly perplexing, as the company provided updates each quarter in 2019. Does this lack of news indicate that growth is slowing? Or is Amazon simply playing their cards close to the vest?Even if Roku is still in second place in terms of active users, I believe they can close the gap and take the top spot in time. Roku estimates that, in 2019, one in three TVs sold in the U.S. were Roku TVs. And while Amazon has released Fire TV Edition televisions, they are not as prolific. If Roku can maintain or accelerate that trend, they would be well positioned to surpass Amazon and maintain that lead, as smart TVs have a much higher switching cost than streaming devices.In May 2020, Kantar—a data, insights, and consulting company— ranked Roku as the top streaming platform in terms of streaming hours. So even if Roku’s user base is slightly smaller than Amazon’s, its user base appears to be more engaged. And marketers value an engaged user base.Emarketer echoes this sentiment, calling Roku the top connected TV platform in the United States. They estimate that Roku users will account for ~47% of connected TV users this year. Emarketer also speculates that, by 2022, Roku will command more than half the market, and that Roku is likely to maintain a strong lead. If this is true, Roku is well positioned to capture value from an enormous and expanding market.One last thing I'd like to mention is that Google is reportedly building a streaming service aggregation feature into the Chrome web browser. This feature—which is neither available to consumers, nor definitively confirmed for release to the public—is currently referred to as Kaleidoscope. There is very little known about this project, but investors should keep this on their radar.In addition to this, Google is reportedly creating a new streaming device, codenamed Sabrina. This device is rumored to be the successor to Chromecast Ultra, but unlike Chromecast, content will not be streamed from smartphones or computers. This device will reportedly feature Android TV software and a dedicated remote, meaning this would be a direct competitor to Roku's streaming devices, just as Android TVs compete with Roku TVs.Roku is not currently profitable. But at ~16x sales, the stock is pricey—though it's hard to compare Roku to competitors like Amazon using the PS ratio, as Amazon's business includes segments (E.g. Amazon Web Services) that differ significantly from Roku's business.Regardless, 16x sales is still a high number when compared to the S&P 500 average of 2.3x. And as you might expect, this high valuation has come with substantial volatility. In the last year alone, the stock hit a low $58 in March 2020 and a high of $200 in September 2020.Regarding risks, I'd be remiss if I didn't point out Roku's size relative to its competitors—companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple are giants by comparison. These are some the largest, most dominant businesses in the world. Amazon has over $71 billion in cash and current investments on its balance sheet; Google has over $121 billion in cash and current investments; and Apple has over $93 billion in cash and current investments. But Roku has only $885 million in cash on its balance sheet—in other words, Amazon currently has 80x more capital available. This could be a significant disadvantage, as it is unlikely that Roku could match these competitors' investments in research and development, or sales and marketing. And that in turn could lead to Roku losing marketshare, either through their inability to keep pace with technological advances or an inability to successfully attract new users through marketing.However, so far, Roku has managed to hold its own against these giants. Roku has amassed a large user base, and that user base appears to be very engaged. And at the end of the day, that's what marketers want—a large, engaged user base. And regarding valuation, Roku certainly trades at a lofty price. It is completely possible that Roku's stock prices gets cut in half again, as it did in March 2020. But quickly growing companies with enormous market opportunities often trade at pricey valuations. I don't think this should dissuade potential investors. But if you do invest, do so knowing it will probably be a bumpy ride. Today, one-third of U.S. households don’t have traditional TV, another 25% have started cutting back, and the digital advertising market is worth over $300 billion. Roku capitalizes on these trends, and as a result, its platform has become increasingly popular amongst users, content publishers, and digital marketers.Roku’s agnostic platform sets it apart from competitors, all of whom are also content publishers, and are therefore incentivized to push their own content. As a result, Roku’s platform is a good choice for almost any user, regardless of their preferred streaming services.Regarding key metrics, Roku is growing active users, increasing user engagement, and increasing ARPU. More importantly, growth in active users and streaming hours actually accelerated in the most recent quarter. And growth in these key metrics has driven strong, accelerating revenue growth each year since Roku went public.Additionally, I believe Roku will continue to innovate around the OneView platform, expanding its partnerships to provide marketers with more data, enabling them to better target different consumer segments. And, in the future, Roku's may blend its advertising platform into the digital payments space, leveraging Roku Pay to allow consumers to make purchases on (or even off) the platform. In summary, Roku is a leader in the streaming devices market and, through the OneView platform, a formidable competitor in the digital advertising space. And as more people cut the cord, transitioning from linear TV to OTT, and as the digital advertising market continues to expand, Roku is well positioned to be a longterm winner for investors."

It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. Click here to find out more »Mission and NarrativeRoku, Inc. (ROKU) is a market leader in an emerging space and is poised to transform the way we consume media over the next decade. Founder and CEO Anthony Wood is a titan in the space as the inventor of the DVR. He also founded Replay TV which was acquired in 2001. His next goal was to revolutionize the way we watch TV. Enter Roku in 2002, so named from the Japanese word for 'six', as it is Mr. Wood's sixth company. With Roku, he began to lead the charge from traditional, linear TV to Connected TV (CTV). CTV differs from linear TV as these devices are connected to the internet and may include personalized content delivery. Roku can also be considered an over-the-top (OTT) service provider: it circumvents traditional cable subscriptions and provides content through an internet connection (such as a CTV device). Simply stated, OTT content (such as Netflix (NFLX) and Disney+ (DIS)) can be watched through CTV (such as Roku TV). Beyond this, Roku is a platform via its operating system. A Roku device is a genuine one-stop shop for digital media.Image credit: Ray Bhatia at Demand LocalThe media that Roku delivers come in a variety of formats: subscription video on-demand (SVOD) can be purchased from household names like Netflix, Amazon Prime (AMZN), Disney+, and Hulu. Users can sign up for these services on Roku or import their existing accounts. Roku does not charge an extra fee, but does take a percentage of subscriptions purchased on its platform from the respective vendor (with the exception of Netflix). Next, there is transactional video on-demand (TVOD). TVOD includes purchasing a particular television show or movie (for example, the Mulan offering that Disney+ is planning for $30). And finally, there is advertising video on-demand (AVOD). This content is free in the sense that it is ad-supported with no cash cost to the user.Roku delivers AVOD in various ways, including its crown jewel The Roku Channel (which is really a bit of a misnomer, since the ""channel"" is actually a service that provides hundreds of different channels and on-demand content). This offering creates a win-win-win-win for Roku, content developers, advertisers, and the end user. Roku generates revenue from advertisements, content developers obtain a platform to spotlight their content, advertisers may connect better with their CTV audience than traditional models of linear TV, and users don't need to spend a dime to enjoy hundreds of channels of content (aside from the up-front purchase of the relatively inexpensive Roku streaming device or Roku TV).This all seems relatively straightforward, but it begs the question: what is Roku's market and why does it matter? As I see it, we are at the early stages of a mass exodus from packaged cable. So-called ""cord cutting"" may occur for a number of reasons, some of which include expensive prices for bundled cable, limited viewing options, and lack of internet connectivity. Pre-COVID estimates projected a 17% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for cord-cutting from 2017-2022, going from 25 million households up to 55 million in just five years. Roku ran an internal streaming study in Q1 2020 and found that of customers that cut the cord, only 1 in 5 intended to go back to traditional pay TV. These cord-cutters will not abstain from digital media. So, where do they go?Source: ConvivaUsers that abandon traditional cable models have a variety of places to find new content. They may use mobile or desktop devices, but the largest share of viewing hours are on CTV. In past years, gaming consoles such as the Playstation 4 led the way to internet-connected TV, but we have begun to see a major shift toward CTV platforms such as Roku, Amazon Fire, Google Chromecast (GOOG), and Apple TV (AAPL). Even more recently, Roku has seen itself pulling away from the CTV pack including its greatest domestic competitor in Amazon Fire. Roku is now hosting more than double the streaming hours of its top rival. Furthermore, Pixalate stated that Roku had a whopping 59% of programmatic ad market share in 2019 which was 3-fold higher than second place Amazon.Source: PixalateConviva found in May 2020 that Roku is dominating the competition when it comes to overall share of global CTV viewing time with 44% vs second-place Xbox (MSFT) with 10%.Similarly, user growth has been accelerating. The number of worldwide OTT subscribers is projected to eclipse 650 million by 2021, a greater than 10-fold increase from 46 million as recently as 2012. And, as CTV has become mainstage, Roku has continued to grab more market share than its competitors. Conviva's Q2 2020 State of Streaming showed Roku representing a hefty 49% share of CTV devices compared to its second-place competitor Amazon Fire TV with 29%. Roku has more than 43 million users as of Q2 2020 (boasting 3.2M new users just in Q2, the highest quarterly growth ever outside of a Q4 holiday season). And here I will emphasize that user count is important. TV advertising dollars follow eyeballs. That means that wherever the lion's share of viewers are is prime advertising real estate. And Global TV advertising spend is expected to grow to north of $225 billion dollars this year.Yet, most of these advertising dollars have not found their way to OTT where more and more eyeballs are going. According to Magna Global, in 2019 OTT accounted for 29% of TV viewing but only drew a minuscule 3% of TV ad budgets! This mismatch alone suggests a change is imminent, but there are many more pieces in the OTT puzzle.COVID-19 has had a major negative impact on advertising budgets. The Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) has called 2020 ""one of the most challenging years for the advertising sector since the Great Recession of 2008."" Heralding this is a 21-40% decrease from pre-COVID estimated video ad spend in 2020.Source: Internet Advertising BureauYet, the IAB also noted that CTV was growing. More than half of clients were migrating their funds from broadcast and cable TV toward CTV. In the end, they project that CTV spending will be up 8% Year-over-Year (YoY): a small decrease from pre-COVID estimates, but a gain nonetheless.Roku has been capitalizing on this shift already. Its average revenue per user (ARPU) grew 18% YoY in Q2 2020. ARPU is an important metric that helps measure the value of each user. Its rapid growth helps illustrate Roku's staying power in a tumultuous market. Roku has already managed to grow ARPU to over $24, a metric that wasn't reached by social media giant Facebook until 2018.Source: Created by author using data from FacebookSo, not only is Roku funneling in hordes of new users, but it is finding ways to engage them and monetize their use. This highlights a key part of the Roku thesis: their business model. Roku has not been stingy with sharing their strategy. CFO Steve Louden has outlined a sequential, 3-step process that is essential to understanding the Roku thesis:Understanding this process also helps to make sense of Roku's financial data which we will address further on. It is particularly impressive that Roku is managing to execute all three steps simultaneously. We have already discussed Roku's impressive new account growth, spurred forward by the pandemic and shelter-in-place/work-from-home initiatives. Some estimates suggest that Roku will be in over 40% of American households by the end of 2020.Source: Created by author using data from RokuUser engagement has also been increasing. eMarketer estimated that the average time US consumers spent on SVOD (including services such as Hulu and Disney+) is greater than one hour per day for the first time ever. And the growth of Roku's ARPU capitalizes on their third step. Impressively, Roku's monetization has grown simultaneously with active account growth, a combination that screams revenue generation. This can be thought of as a land-and-expand strategy adapted to CTV and Roku's unique platform.Indeed, Roku's unique platform is one of its greatest selling points. To begin to conceptualize this platform, it is helpful to know that Roku has two market components that work hand-in-hand. The first is its players and integrated smart TVs. The second is Roku's platform: the operating system and offerings available on these devices.Roku's players include standalone units that can connect to a user's existing television such as the Roku Premiere and the Roku Streaming Stick+.Source: RokuThese enable a user to get quickly connected to the Roku platform. They are essentially ready to go out of the box, and are very inexpensive (the former at $39 and the latter at $50 at the time of this writing). Attach the respective unit to your television or media receiver, and you're ready to go. The remote is in the box, and there is no need for complicated software installation.Similarly, there are Roku televisions that are manufactured by one of several partners including TCL, Sharp, Philips, and others. These Roku TVs require no separate hardware as Roku is already installed. Roku sees this as a joint victory for themselves, TV manufacturers, and consumers. The TV manufacturer can improve their margins by not having to write or update their own operating system (which can be quite costly), as Roku will provide ongoing updates and support for end-users. Roku gets its platform more widely distributed, and the TV makers take 0% of platform revenue. Finally, the user feels this synergy benefits their billfold, as Roku televisions tend to be sold at quite a discount to competitors. For example, I found two comparable 50"" 4K LED smart televisions online with the Roku version selling at $130 less!Roku televisions are also extremely popular. As of this writing, they occupied the #1, 3, 4, and 5 spots of the Amazon Top 5 best selling televisions.Source: AmazonOnce the Roku hardware is in place, it is time for their platform to shine. The operating system (OS) is intuitive and easy to use. The user simply chooses the apps they want to download (such as Hulu or HBO) and quickly has them added to a dashboard. When downloading apps and watching media, it is the Roku platform installed on the hardware device that is the software engine. The engine is quite powerful, and the OS is sticky. I have been using the same Roku streaming device since 2014 and found that it held up incredibly well. It is much easier and faster to use than a gaming console, and has some perks such as buttons for specific channels that may vary by model.Source: redditThe Roku OS is quick to switch between streaming services and easy to navigate. The Roku Channel is free and hosts a variety of content. This offering may do particularly well in markets outside the United States, where users tend to be less affluent and more tolerant of ad-supported material at a reduced cost (in this case, free). Roku hosts over 10,000 channels internationally, many more than its competitors. And more content means a greater possibility for traction in international markets. The majority of Roku's revenue is currently generated domestically, but they are focusing intently on international growth. Roku televisions already represent one of every three sold in the United States, and have grown to one in four in Canada. They have begun focusing on markets in the UK, Brazil, Mexico, and Latin America.Runway, Risks, and ReviewsRoku has a massive Total Addressable Market (TAM). Over 70 billion dollars are spent each year on TV advertising in the US, part of the >$200B spent globally. This is one part of the TAM. CEO Anthony Wood sees their market as potentially all 1 billion worldwide broadband users. Finally, Business Wire projects that the global OTT streaming market will grow from $104B in 2019 to $161B in 2020 at a CAGR of a whopping 55%! They further forecast that this will stabilize, reaching a $169B market by 2023. Whichever metric you pick, these imply a very low market penetration (~1%) with a massive runway for Roku to utilize.A runway is best utilized when it is clear of other traffic. Competition is natural and healthy in business, but Roku is a standout in the field. They are the only pure play CTV platform that is content-agnostic. In other words, they do not offer their own content. The Roku Channel, for example, is entirely driven by content made outside of Roku. In contrast, Amazon offers the Fire TV platform, but they also run the Amazon Prime Video services full of original programming. When working with other players in the space such as Netflix and Disney+, Roku's agnosticism is likely to be attractive and grant them additional perceived trustworthiness over competitors that have a stake in the game. Roku's moat is also bolstered with near-frictionless entry to the platform. This starts with competitively-priced devices and TVs. These are then quickly installed and adapted to by users. From there, it is easy to generate brand loyalty. For example, the author just ordered a new Roku unit and a Roku TV earlier this year (the latter prior to even having a stake in the company).Roku does not just provide a platform for users, but a rich source of data for advertisers. Roku has a walled garden where it houses user information that encompasses all apps used on the platform. However, they keep this arrangement simple for the user: only one privacy agreement needs to be completed, and that is with Roku itself. Roku then anonymizes user data when interacting with third parties. But in this interaction is something very important, and that is the power of targeted advertising. Interpublic Group has found that video ads on Roku's platform were 67% more effective than ads on linear TV. And ThinkTV noted in 2017 that TV ads were more conducive for active watching than Facebook and even YouTube (by a large margin).Source: ThinkTVFurthermore, MarketingCharts showed that CTV viewing hours have been growing substantially and represented almost half of impressions in 2019, whereas mobile, desktop, and tablet all decreased to 27%, 16%, and 3%, respectively. Putting this together, Roku's walled garden of rich data in a crucial, emerging space is likely to be of keen interest to advertisers. This can be illustrated by the recent partnership between Roku and Kroger to explore measurement targeting and optimization of ads according to what consumer packaged goods leave the shelves.An investment in Roku is not without its risks, however. First, there is the competitive landscape, which has already been touched upon several times. Roku has no shortage of competition and has not since its inception (Google TV was the first offering domestically). However, Roku has handily been expanding market share through user growth, increased engagement, and elevating ARPU which are encouraging signs.Another risk is if Roku loses its premier spot as a content aggregator. For example, HBO Max and NBC Peacock were launched in 2020 and have yet to contract with Roku, Amazon Fire, and others (however, it should be noted that users can access HBO content through Roku in other ways). As of 2018, nearly 40 million people in the United States had HBO. After acquisition from AT&T and the launch of HBO Max in May, 29% of HBO Now users failed to upgrade to HBO Max, and part of this is thought to be lack of migration to Roku and similar services. According to Roku executives, there are ongoing talks with HBO and NBC, but failing to acquire these offerings, or worse, having Amazon obtain an exclusive offering could hamstring Roku's growth efforts.There are also a few other potential risks. TV manufacturers that host the Roku platform could potentially demand revenue sharing, which would impair Roku's margins. In a similar vein, Amazon or other competitors could cut costs for their hardware offerings, forcing Roku to follow suit while driving margins down. TV manufacturers could begin to offer their own operating system and scrap their contract with Roku, although this would be a very expensive and labor-intensive process without a convincing benefit, in the author's eyes. Finally, Roku may not be as viral internationally, and it will be important to keep an eye on their ongoing expansion efforts.No company is without its risks. Yet, in contrast Roku has many incredibly positive things going for them. The company is very well-liked by the public and reviewers. It is rated at or better than its competitors the majority of the time. CNET rated the best streaming devices of 2020, and Roku claimed the trophies for Best streamer overall and Best budget streamer. Some reviewers were vocal about wanting to see Roku offer voice-control options similar to Amazon's Alexa (which is integrated into Fire). Roku's executives heard loud and clear and have begun implementing voice-control options for the platform. Roku has a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 71, and employees rate it a 4.0/5 at Glassdoor, with 85% approving of the CEO.As mentioned earlier, TV advertising dollars have seen COVID-perpetuated headwinds. Despite this, Roku's Q2 looked stellar. Quarterly revenue growth was up 42% YoY. Although a deceleration, the top line was still very strong. Source: Created by author using data from Roku financial statementsGross margin (GM) was 41% including a platform GM of 56%, both of which are decreased compared to a year ago. Operating margin has been negative in three of the past four quarters, including Q2. Management has addressed this and shared that they expect margins to be tighter in the near-term due largely to impacts from COVID, not only due to ad spend, but also due to Roku's renewed expansion efforts. In that vein, Sales and marketing represented 18% of revenue compared to 15% a year earlier. Research and development costs were 24% of revenue, down from 25% last year. Roku has emphasized these metrics will likely stay elevated in the near future as they actively acquire new users in markets both foreign and domestic while working to keep the competitive edge of their products.Despite the conditions of TV-ad spend, ARPU grew 18% YoY in Q2. Free Cash Flow has hit a milestone of moving into positive territory in the past few quarters. Roku had significant cash-on-hand and a good debt vs. asset balance suggesting they have the ability to ride out the storm should things get darker before they brighten.Roku's valuation is 14.9x based on Enterprise Value (EV) to Last Twelve Months (LTM) Revenue, and 11.2x when using forward-looking Next Twelve Months (NTM) sales as of this writing. It is hard to compare Roku with similar companies as it is the only pure play CTV option. However, these valuations are well below many of the well-recognized players in the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) arena which are currently averaging well over 20x EV/LTM Revenue. SaaS offerings do tend to have better margins than a hardware-dependent offering such as Roku, but by design Roku's revenue generation is predominantly through its platform rather than its hardware.The market may be hesitant to embrace Roku for reasons including COVID-induced advertising headwinds compounded by Roku's lack of forward-looking guidance which paints a picture of relative uncertainty. The market may also see that Roku's Earnings Per Share (EPS) and EBITDA have remained mostly negative, even more so in the past two quarters.Source: Created by author using data from Roku financial statementsHowever, I believe these are short-term concerns that wane in the perspective of a multi-year time frame.COVID-19 has significantly slowed global ad-spend. Roku executives have estimated that advertising dollars will not be back to pre-COVID levels until at least mid-2021. Yet, in spite of adversity, Roku has been capitalizing on this time by winning active accounts and promoting greater user engagement. In other words, they are working to get eyeballs so that when the advertising dollars come back they will flow to Roku.The bullish thesis behind Roku is essentially encapsulated by betting that the future of TV involves OTT content and CTV devices, while betting on Roku to be a winner in that race. We have evidence that shows this thesis in action. Roku is already winning the CTV race. And data suggests that CTV is eventually going to win the TV race (over linear). Netflix and Disney+ are growing their markets every day, entertaining households across the globe. And subscribers will continue to need avenues to watch content. Roku provides this avenue inexpensively with a strong platform. TV advertising dollars are already underrepresented in the CTV space given the proportion of users, and with accelerated cord-cutting and flocks of new users driven to Roku, the advertisers will eventually follow. Roku's walled garden of rich user data can potentially generate better engagement and outcomes for advertisers. And Roku is investing in machine learning to help optimize their ads and provide users a better experience by targeting more relevant content. We have yet to even see the impact of the impending 5G revolution, which may expand Roku's addressable market.Roku's ability to stand tall with strong year-over-year revenue growth and increasing ARPU despite significant economic headwinds suggest that it may defy cyclicality. In a tough market, Roku stands out among other companies that have more obviously suffered. However, the market does not yet appear to fully value the Roku bullish thesis. Some of this may be short-sighted, as it will likely take years for the thesis to entirely unfold.However, that also leaves plenty of time for the thesis to change. Things to watch in the interim include Roku's impact in international markets, continued proportion of domestic market share, and classic metrics of active accounts, user engagement, and ARPU. The author will be watching for margins to improve over time, albeit not in the near-term. Profitability should come with monetization, and right now Roku is focused more on users and engagement. It will also be important to watch what transpires with HBO Max and NBC Peacock as Roku works to cement its status as the content aggregator.Overall, Roku is a market leader in an emerging space which only looks to grow its burgeoning market share in the coming years. TV advertising is a huge market that has yet to fully embrace CTV, but will provide a massive revenue stream as it does so. Roku is perfectly positioned to capitalize on this move with stellar, competitively-priced products and a sticky, easy-to-use platform that aspires to be a digital media all-in-one solution. This is a stock I plan to buy and hold over years. We may have a bumpy ride in the middle, but I believe that those who hang on tight will be rewarded in the end."
4375858,68055,2020-09-23T08:00:00-04:00,"Comcast’s Peacock streaming service bowed earlier this summer while setting itself apart from others as the only streamer built on being “free,” but with added pay elements for those interested.As a “free” ad-supported service that opens the door to a more traditional revenue split with various platforms but a deal couldn’t be reached with Roku and Amazon.This led to a stalemate which ramped up last weekend when Comcast and Roku nearly came to blows with customers caught in the middle, before cooler heads prevailed.The whole thing painted Comcast in a negative light which didn’t thrill investors, but was indicative of a larger problem with streaming services many shareholders and consumers tend to overlook.Cord-cutting doesn’t mean being free from “big media” and the same type of carriage disputes that plagued the traditional model have evolved with streaming – and in many ways are worse.","(Credit: Comcast)Part of what’s been interesting about the rise of streaming TV is seeing how traditional TV has had to adapt to stay relevant. Yes, you could easily argue it's no longer relevant, period. But with many of the traditional players investing in streaming, it’s more realistic to say they just pivoted.For Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), that meant taking a unique approach to the medium. Instead of just another streaming service, the team honed in on a differentiator and built its “Peacock” service model around it – that differentiator was free content.Well sort of.Saying Peacock is free may be a catchy ad campaign but it's also kind of a half truth. Yes, there is a free ad-supported tier but to fully be engulfed in the channel and specifically its originals, you need to level up to a premium plan.Still you do get thousands of hours of 100% free content so it is hard to fault them, but there is some buyer beware to be aware of.The problem though with being ad-supported is revenue sharing and that’s what led Peacock to its biggest problem – distribution. Yet while that particular problem has begun to get less complicated in the past week, at the same time they made another one far worse.And this one impacts not just their investors but anyone investing in the streaming space.First as always, some background.Peacock’s big problem was the revenue split and that is why it launched without the support of the big guns like Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) and Amazon Fire (NASDAQ:AMZN). Realistically, going at it without those two is akin to making a movie and saying you won’t do business with AMC and Regal.You can do it and still get your film out there, but less people will see it and you’ll make less of a return on investment.The problem for Comcast was it didn’t want to give Roku and Amazon the cut they are used to receiving – which for Roku is usually around 20% of subscriptions fees or 30% of ad revenue (if that sounds familiar it should – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has the same type of policy). So this set off a stalemate between the two sides, one that also was shared by AT&T’s HBO Max (NYSE:T).It was glaring.For HBO Max, which has its own problems, to compound the situation even further really hurt its launch. For Peacock, given a large component is the “free” aspect, it wasn’t as hurtful and more just not the smartest approach to business.Long story short, the feud ended last week when the two sides reached a deal and Peacock is coming to Roku but here’s the problem for investors.The how.This wasn’t a situation where the two sides sat down and had a calm rational conversation before deciding they could work out their differences.No, Comcast played hardball… unnecessary hardball.Comcast threatened to pull their “TV Everywhere” channels from Roku… the very definition of cutting off its nose to spite its face. Simply put, this would have removed access to NBCUniversal programming via streaming apps that was supposed to be free if you had a cable/satellite subscription. That’s 11 network apps, 12 NBC-owned station apps and 23 Telemundo-owned station apps. As it pertains to Roku, it’s a small portion of its total business and truth be told they would not have missed itViewers on the other hand... yeah, they would have noticed.Part of the reason why the traditional model is in danger is because of absurd carriage disputes that leads to blackouts in key markets. In other words, if CBS is feuding with AT&T, a number of people in key markets don’t get key programming including football.That’s just one example and no matter the players, it doesn’t exactly endear people to cable companies.And yet here we are with a brand new version of it for streaming.While cooler heads did prevail and a deal was made, the potential existed for a bad situation for consumers overall.It’s also important to note Roku is not exactly faultless in this area either, just earlier this year it and FOX got into a fight three days before the Super Bowl that threatened to keep the big game off one of the biggest streaming platforms around.FOX used the same playbook as Comcast, basically laying the blame on Roku and saying it was using its customers as pawns to get what it wanted. Roku meanwhile fought back by basically saying we WANT to show you the game but since our original deal is ending, legally we don’t have the rights.It was the same thing situation here as evidenced by Roku’s note to subscribers pre-deal.The different here is that this time it looks like Comcast was the aggressor and tried to strong-arm Roku by threatening to basically take its ball and go home. I personally liked Roku’s “insignificant amount of streaming hours and revenue on our platform” line, mainly because as I referenced earlier, it’s true.It also made Comcast look like the villain in a convincing fashion.The point in all this is cord-cutters think they have a safety net where because they aren’t beholden to a cable company they have unlimited flexibility.They don’t.Comcast is tied to Peacock just as Spectrum/DirecTV is tied HBO Max – that’s two of the biggest cable/satellite providers that are getting your money one way or the other. And remember all of these TV-Everywhere apps are only free provided you can authenticate your service with a cable/satellite provider.The truth is you can cut the cord all your want but you are still connected to something.Even Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), as big as it is and as filled with originals as it is, still has to make deals with the old guard as it uses acquired content as a significant supplement. Hulu and Amazon also check that box. And the deeper you go, the more complicated it can get as six companies basically own the media.With that small of a pool, there’s bound to be some feuding.The Comcast/Roku battle puts a spotlight on the whole thing and its scary. Roku may not be completely innocent in general but in this particular case, Comcast thought it could push them around to get what it wanted. You can basically plug any of the big six into that role and plug any player like Roku into that other slot and see how this can repeat time and time again.The other aspect that is really interesting to me though is Comcast’s decision to play rough with Roku over Amazon, which tells me one of two things happened – either Comcast saw Roku as a better target for Peacock over Amazon thus valuing it more or it just saw Roku as a better target, period, and thought it would have an easier time getting its way with a smaller player.Either way, it shows what could happen down the road.For investors seeing one of your investments basically puts its customers in the crossfire is never a good look but it's one we may have to surprisingly get used to. It can also significantly tip the scales in one’s favor over another and depending on where you have your money invested, it could be to your benefit or detriment.Cord-cutting may have its advantages but money is still exchanging hands in some fashion and that makes things get complicated quickly.It just proves there’s no such thing as “free.”"

Keep an eye on it.","Roku (ROKU) could cement its position as a toll collector on the path to one of the most expensive corporate wars in history. As the battle for content intensifies, perhaps this platform-agnostic device maker is precisely what shareholders need to emerge as ultimate victors.After digging around a bit, I believe Roku's secret sauce could not only help propel its global expansion but also stave off competition or acquisition from trillion-dollar juggernauts that have dug their heels into the media battlefield. Here's a closer look at Roku's fascinating value proposition.Source: Quote CatalogAs billions pour into the media world, there's been a flood of content for consumers to enjoy. Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) and Disney (DIS) alone are expected to spend a combined $29 billion on creating original content this year. Nevermind, the billions more that Apple (AAPL), HBO and Comcast (CMCSA) expect to spend to attract eyeballs. Meanwhile, let's not forget that free platforms such as YouTube and niche streaming platforms such as Twitch are just as popular.In other words, consumers are spoilt for choice. What they don't have is convenience and a suitable price. The combined monthly cost of a bundle of these popular streaming services could easily exceed $100. Meanwhile, the device and streaming platforms are frustratingly fragmented. You can't play Apple TV+ content on Google's Chromecast or watch Twitch on certain versions of Android.It's an expensive and messy experience that's exacerbated by the deep pockets of the tech giants and defensive nature of old media companies. Altogether, that leaves plenty of room for an improvement to the user experience. That's where Roku seems to have struck an elegant solution.Roku's secret sauce is neutrality. When a gruesome and global war is raging, it's lucrative to be politically-neutral like Switzerland. The company isn't perceived as a threat or a competitor by any of the content creators. Meanwhile, it's small enough to minimally annoy device manufacturers such as Amazon or Google. This allows Roku to have the broadest possible collection of streaming apps on its platform.This neutrality and platform-agnosticism is so critical to the company's business model that it was the driving force behind its spin-off from Netflix in 2008. Here's an excerpt from Fast Company that paints a clearer picture:Netflix CEO Reed Hastings was having serious second thoughts. The problem? Hastings realized that if Netflix shipped its own hardware, it would complicate potential partnerships with other hardware makers. ""Reed said to me one day, 'I want to be able to call Steve Jobs and talk to him about putting Netflix on Apple TV,'"" recalls one high-level source. ""'But if I'm making my own hardware, Steve's not going to take my call.'""From the customer's perspective, having access to every streaming app through a single device is a compelling offer. To sweeten the deal further, Roku has also managed to lower the price of its entry-level streaming device below its largest competitors. The Roku Express (~$30) is the cheapest streaming device on the market at the moment.That combination of broader and cheaper access to the best content in the world is the driving force behind Roku's success. According to Comscore, Roku controls nearly half (49%) of the U.S. market for over-the-top streaming devices. The Chromecast and Firestick are distant runner ups.Source: ComscoreRoku is by far the most popular streaming device in the U.S., which is arguably the most critical market for content creators. However, the only way for Roku to keep fueling its growth engine is to expand overseas. If the company's value proposition (convenience, access and cost) holds up in foreign markets, it could dominate the global market by a similar margin as it does back home.Roku has been heavily focused on the U.S. for much of its existence. Its lineup and content deals have all been focused on capturing domestic market share. It's only in the past two years that the company has seriously invested in overseas expansion. And there's already signs that the devices are just as popular abroad as they are back home.Search data from India seems to indicate that Roku is the most popular streaming device in the country. In fact, the search data chart looks eerily similar to Roku's market share chart in the U.S. However, the Amazon Fire Stick outsells Roku in India for now.:Source: The Drum / JanaThis year the company also launched its Roku Channel in the U.K., marking further expansion in Europe. A few months earlier, it launched its devices and streaming channels in Brazil while expanding its offering in Canada and Mexico. Roku CEO Anthony Wood has said that international markets represent ""a greenfield with a lot of potential."" He's absolutely right.Roku's international growth could follow the same trajectory as Netflix. In fact, I believe Netflix's global expansion is the best benchmark for Roku's eventual market size. It's a critical piece in the stock's valuation model.Roku is neither profitable nor cash flow positive. This makes it a Horowitz-style hyper growth stock that needs to be measured based on venture capital metrics. With this in mind, here's a rundown of Roku's key performance and fundamental indicators.Let's work our way backwards through these metrics to arrive at a justified market cap for this company.Roku faces three key risks that could cut its growth drastically in the years ahead. The first major risk is a slowdown in online streaming as the global economy reopens and people spend less time confined to their home. Netflix warned about this in their previous earnings report. Here's an excerpt from their shareholder letter:The second major risk the company faces is a decline in advertising revenue. Businesses of all sizes cut back on their advertising spend when the economy dips. In the middle of the biggest economic disaster in a generation, it may be fair to assume a major pullback in advertising in the months ahead. In fact, the Roku team highlighted this risk in their recent earnings call:The final risk is growing competition from both domestic and international players. The company already faces intense competition from tech giants like Amazon and Google. In recent years, devices such as Facebook's (FB) Portal TV, Comcast's Xfinity Flex and Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) SHIELD have amplified the competitive heat. In regional markets like India, local players like Reliance Jio have even launched their own streaming devices.The confluence of these three risks could drag down Roku's growth rate. This is why I assume that annual growth in users will decline from 40% to 20% CAGR in the years ahead. At that rate, total users could grow from 43 million to 74.4 million by 2023. However, if the grow rate is even slower than my pessimistic outlook, the stock price may be even more overvalued than it currently appears.On a side note, I believe we should explore the potential of an acquisition. There have been rumors that Google or Disney could acquire Roku. However, as I mentioned before, Roku's content agnosticism is its secret sauce. Getting acquired by a content creator would defeat the core value proposition. This rules out pretty much all technology and media giants.Instead, if the company does get acquired, I think a non-content, hardware company like Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) or Walmart (NYSE:WMT) would be more suitable. Either way, an acquisition would be at a hefty premium to Roku's current valuation and should unlock tremendous value for shareholders.Good Luck!"
4373210,69905,2020-09-09T07:54:51-04:00,"Roku is still growing at more than 42% y/y.The biggest headwind is that the ad market expected to remain weak well into 2021.Roku is still undervalued, at less than 13x forward sales. The upside will not come from its multiple expanding necessarily, but from Roku simply ticking along at 40% growth rates.","Roku (ROKU) is a very fast growth streaming platform. Even though Roku's results beat expectations, investors are troubled by the fact that the ad industry remains weak.As I made the case in my Marketplace Deep Value Returns, the biggest takeaway is that consumers' demand for Roku remains very strong. Even if the ad market remains weak well into 2021, I believe that sentiment has been largely priced in already into Roku's valuation.Roku is a very attractive investment opportunity and investors would do well to consider it.SourceSource: author's calculationsFor most companies being able to report positive revenue growth rates in Q2 would have been a dream. For Roku, it was up 42% y/y and investors wanted even more. Why?It wasn't so much its results right now, but investors were perturbed by management stating that it would be well into 2021 before TV ad investment recovers to pre-pandemic levels.But focusing on ad pricing misses the big picture for Roku's potential. Even though ad pricing ultimately drives ARPU figures, which were ''only'' up 18% y/y in Q2, the game for Roku right now is a land grab. Attempting to be in as many households as possible.In fact, Roku TV sales accounted for one in three smart TVs sold in the U.S during the quarter.Roku is a platform-neutral operating system that allows TVs to be connected to a large number of streaming services.My previous investment in Discovery (DISCK) taught me an important lesson: great content without distribution is worthless. Getting to the customer is everything.Roku does compete against Amazon's (AMZN) Fire Stick and Google's (GOOG) Chromecast. Those are Roku's biggest competitors. But the market for cord-cutting is expanding at a rapid clip, and it's not likely to be a one-size fit all solution.While gaining market share and scale are huge goals, the market is likely to remain fragmented for a while.As I've mentioned before, think of the smartphone market, and how Apple's (AAPL) market share has slipped to 3rd biggest player, yet it is amongst the biggest companies in the world, despite continuously losing market share.That's the power of investing into businesses that serve rapidly expanding markets. Companies' market share can be less than hoped for and still have huge dominance.The strongest metric in Q2 was the jump in the total number of active users, which was up 41% y/y.For me, this is the most important metric. I'm less worried about near-term oscillations in ad pricing, although that is a huge driver of Roku's revenue growth rate.My thesis here is that if Roku can get into households, it's more likely to remain in households and positively benefit once the ad market recovers.Moreover, it's worth noting that in 2019, Roku's adjusted EBITDA reached $46 million. However, at the time of its Q4 2019 results, its 2020 adjusted EBITDA guidance was for negative $10 million to positive $10 million. Put another way, before COVID, Roku was noting that its EBITDA would reverse trajectory and was possible to turn out to be negative.Consequently, during this environment, management noted that 2020's adjusted EBITDA would be negative and that investors shouldn't be overly troubled by this.Moving on, Roku's OneView appears to be a promising opportunity. OneView enables advertisers to reach more consumers OTT (over-the-top), in desktop and mobile. This is still a nascent operation, and it's too early to see if it will have a material positive impact on Roku's operations -- something to keep an eye on. OneView allows advertisers to segment different groups and use better data to target them.Even though management didn't disclose tangible numbers for OneView, it did state that OneView was up 50% y/y. Thus while this unit remains small, it's still very attractive.Despite reporting more than 40% revenue growth rates during a very challenging environment, Roku remains priced at less than 13x forward sales. The Trade Desk (TTD) is also in the ad market, and that company is also attempting to gain exposure and participate in the cord-cutting environment.And even though The Trade Desk has meaningfully better profitability margins, it doesn't quite compare to Roku's full potential. Meanwhile, The Trade Desk is priced at 27x forward sales, which is more than double Roku's valuation, even though The Trade Desk is not likely to be posting anywhere near the same levels of growth.And both companies have similar issues: investors are uncertain of exactly when the ad market will start to solidify.Back to Roku, for most, the path away from linear TV and towards streaming is a foregone conclusion, as well as, the number of users adopting Roku as their operating system is showing no signs of slowing down, yet investors have mixed feelings over its stock for now.For my bullish thesis to work out positively, I'm affording less weight to Roku's multiples expanding, and more weight to Roku simply staying with roughly the same multiple of 13x to 15x and continuing to grow its top line at north of 30%.Indeed, if we consider the fact that active users were up 41% y/y in Q2, it appears very likely that Roku will be able to beat analysts' estimates over the next twelve months.For investors to be positively rewarded by investing in Roku at approximately $20 billion market cap, all that is necessary is for Roku to continue to grab market share in consumers' households. As Warren Buffett says, if you get overwhelmingly positive consumer market share, the share price will follow.Although management didn't give investors tangible guidance for the quarter, they did note that y/y streaming hours still remain above pre-COVID levels. In other words, not only does the pace of cord-cutting continue to accelerate, but the user engagement with Roku also remains high.Ultimately, even if Roku simply ticks along with this performance, without much in the way of positive surprises, investors should see at least 40% to 50% upside return over the coming two years, as its share price approximates its revenue growth rates."

In the future, TV operating systems will be ubiquitous. That is, presently, only a fraction of the entire world's population consumes content through a modern TV operating system, such as Roku's. TV operating systems will offer a wide variety of applications, content sources, such as streaming and ad-supported TV, gaming options from the cloud, control centers for our smart homes, control centers for home security, and more.A substantial extent of our computing operations will migrate to the television, as processing power becomes cheaper and TV operating systems develop further.Roku has been my and my Beating The Market subscribers' way to play this underlying secular growth trend that I believe is in the 1st inning of unfolding. In fact, the players might've not even taken the field yet from a global perspective.I find it important to view investing through multiple lenses. It's important to take your head from the microscope of individual stock analysis and survey the landscape that's unfolding around you. Having the wherewithal to assess the directions of the currents of change is as essential as having the wherewithal to weigh the value of an individual company, i.e., stock.I like to think of my team and myself as scientists with two primary tools in hand: a microscope for businesses and a telescope for mankind's future. Our microscope allows us to avoid overpaying and our telescope allows us to glimpse into the future of business to ensure we're buying the next Apples (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazons (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebooks (NASDAQ:FB).I believe this is where real, sustainable, sleep-well-at-night alpha is generated. As I share with BTM subscribers,Of course, this sounds nice, but we still need to understand a company's core business as of today! So, let's do that now.Roku is the leading OTT TV streaming aggregation platform in the United States, with over 40 million active accounts. An acceleration in cord-cutting and a transformational shift in ad spending patterns (marketers moving from linear TV to connected-TV) are boosting Roku's platform.My investment thesis is centered around the following points:Today, we will understand Roku's business model in greater depth, after which we will run it through the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model to determine Roku's intrinsic value and total expected returns.Roku is the pioneer of TV streaming that started out as a streaming media player provider and later pivoted to programmatic advertising. A Roku Player or Roku TV user can access hundreds of streaming apps (free and paid) all under one roof: ""Roku OS"" (visible in the image below).Source: roku.comRoku's TV operating system has a simple easy-to-use UI that enables users to discover, subscribe (pay for), and stream their favorite channels like Netflix (NFLX), Disney+ (DIS), and Prime Video (AMZN). The two forms of over-the-top (internet) streaming delivery used by Roku are:Now, Roku is in a low-margin hardware (player) business; however, Roku's primarily a programmatic advertising company. Roku generates the majority of its revenue and almost all of its gross profits by selling ads on its home screen (85+ million devices), a portion (generally, 30%) of the ad inventory belonging to the streaming apps on its platform and Roku Channel.A few years back (around 2013-14), Roku was embroiled in a fierce battle for connected TV platform market share with powerful tech-companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN). However, user trends over the last two years indicate that Roku and Amazon's Fire TV have emerged victorious, with both of them combined consuming nearly ~70% of the market. Source: substack.comData shows that Roku and Amazon Fire TV represent a big chunk of video streamed to television. This also proves that Roku is the number one player in the OTT TV streaming space and an obvious choice for advertising budgets.Source: variety.comNext, let's get down to the nitty-gritty of Roku's business model.At the center of Roku's flywheel are the active user accounts on its platform. In fact, each new active account strengthens Roku's business. If you look at the left circle in the image below, you can understand Roku's new customer acquisition strategy.Roku operates its player business segment (which includes all of Roku's streaming media player sales and TV OEM licensing revenues) at a near-zero gross margin. Such a model enabled Roku to offer its hardware at more affordable rates than its rivals. As more users join Roku's platform, the fixed costs decline, and gross profits rise, which in turn allows Roku to lower both device prices and TV OEM licensing fees. It goes without saying, cheaper devices help Roku acquire new users.Source: substack.comNow, let's look at the other side of Roku's business. With data insights obtained from millions of users on its platform, Roku's 'OneView' DSP offers targeted programmatic advertising to marketers and streaming apps. Advertising is where Roku makes money. As active accounts increase, more advertisers join the platform, which yields a higher ARPU for Roku. A more extensive user base also lends Roku higher leverage in negotiations with streaming apps that want to enter its platform.For example, when a new streaming app joins Roku, it generally has to concede around ~30% of its ad inventory to Roku in addition to ~20% of subscription revenues. The streaming apps are also required to provide free content for Roku Channel. And in some cases, Roku mandates these apps to commit specific ad spend on its platform. Hence, it's quite clear that Roku commands a lot of power in the current environment (similar to what cable TV and satellite TV providers did in the past).Furthermore, the rise in active accounts serves as a primary incentive for streaming apps to be available on Roku's platform. The power of Roku's platform has come to the fore recently in its negotiations with new streaming apps like NBC's Peacock (CMCSA) and AT&T's HBO Max (T). Both the apps are not available on Roku or Amazon Fire TV as they couldn't agree to terms demanded by the streaming aggregation platforms. Recently, Roku's management stated that the holdouts (Peacock and HBO Max) are missing out on Roku's user growth, and it is somewhat true because these streaming apps have failed to garner user numbers anywhere close to Disney+.Now, let's look at some of the key operating metrics of Roku's business to assess its current state.As you can see, Roku added 3.2 million new active accounts to reach 43 million active accounts (up 41% y/y). Additionally, streaming hours on Roku increased to 14.6 billion from 8.8 billion a year ago. The coronavirus pandemic boosted this figure.The overall TV advertising industry faced budget cuts and declines in revenue; however, Roku said that its monetized ad impressions rose by 50% y/y in the last quarter, and ARPU increased by 18% y/y to $24.92 billion.During the last quarter, Roku's total revenues grew by 42% y/y to $356 million. Of these, platform revenues of $244.8 million (68.75% of total revenues) grew by 46% y/y, while player revenue recorded a slower growth rate of ~35% y/y and came in at $111.8 million. The revenue mix continues to shift towards platform revenues. Now, we know that Roku's platform revenues command a higher margin; thus, Roku's gross margin profile should improve from here.Source: Roku Earnings ReleaseAs per market research firm eMarketer, US Connected TV Ad spending is about to grow from ~$7 billion in 2019 to ~$14 billion in 2023 at ~19% CAGR. Since Roku enjoys a dominant market share in the connected TV space, I expect it to benefit directly from the changing advertising pattern.Source: emarketer.comAccording to a Bloomberg report, Roku sees the entire ~$70 billion annual TV Ad spend as its Total Addressable Market [TAM]. Here's an excerpt from the said report:On top of the domestic opportunity, Roku's international growth prospects look very promising. The company aims to grow its presence in foreign markets by leveraging existing relationships with manufacturing partners like TCL. I expect Roku to emerge as a winner in other markets like it did in the US due to a superior content-neutral platform.In this section, we will dissect the long-term trends in Roku's financial statements to decipher the strength of the underlying business. Let's start with a study of the income statement.As you can see in the chart below, since July 2017, Roku's revenue has grown from $436 million to $1349 million at ~45.72% CAGR. During the same period, the gross margins have improved from ~33.75% to ~42.11%, as platform revenues form a more significant proportion of total revenues.Source: YChartsAccording to estimates from YCharts (which are taken from S&P Global data), Roku is expected to grow its revenue to $2,692 million by 2022 at a CAGR of ~34% for the next two years.In the latest earnings report, Roku's management did not provide any guidance for Q3 (and full-year 2020), citing uncertainty in ad spending, which has caused the share price to stagnate (can you spell opportunity?). We might see volatility in Roku's stock due to a lack of short-term guidance. Notwithstanding, Roku's platform is getting stronger as marketers shift their advertising spend from linear TV (traditional ads) to connected-TV (programmatic targeted ads). Hence, Roku's long-term growth story remains intact.Now, let's assess Roku's balance sheet to analyze its financial stability.Source: YChartsAt the end of last quarter, Roku had cash and equivalents of $885.83 million and financial debt of $97.17 million. A healthy cash ratio of 2.147 allays any fears regarding financial stability. However, as we saw earlier, Roku has a negative operating margin, i.e., it still burns cash.In the last twelve months, Roku had a negative free cash flow of ~$46 million. However, for Q2 2020, the free cash flow turned positive ($15.36 million). Now, Roku's management plans to drive active account growth by aggressively reinvesting in its business. Thus, I expect Roku's FCF to hover around zero in the near term before it turns positive in the long term.Source: YChartsRoku's robust cash position represents adequate growth capital, but I expect share-based compensation to cause some shareholder dilution. To compensate for any potential shareholder dilutions, I will assume a 15% dilution in my stock valuation process.To estimate Roku's intrinsic value, I will leverage my proprietary valuation model, with which many of you are already familiar. For those of you who have not yet seen it, here's what it entails:Now, let's check out Roku's intrinsic value:Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelAs you can see above, Roku's intrinsic value is ~$170, i.e., it represents good value as of today. One could even say that Roku is reasonably priced. However, investors must assess the expected returns on any investment before deploying capital.To determine the expected returns, the model calculates a projected FCF per share value (yr-10) and multiplies it with an assumed Price to FCF multiple (35x here), thereby generating a 2030 price target for Roku. Using this price target, the model deduces an expected CAGR return.Source: L.A. Stevens Valuation ModelAccording to the model, Roku's expected CAGR is an enticing 15.5%, which is significantly higher than my hurdle rate of 9.8%. In this market, Roku is one of the few great companies available at a fair price. Hence, I strongly recommend long-term investors to buy Roku at $165.Here are some of the most significant risks to Roku:Roku's platform is getting more influential on the back of growth in connected TV users. As consumer viewership patterns shift more towards streaming, advertisers will need to move a more substantial proportion of their marketing budgets to connected TV platforms like Roku. Such a transformational shift should power Roku's revenue (and FCF) higher in the future. Therefore, I am bullish on Roku's business.Moreover, Roku represents fantastic value for a company that could one day operate in a duopoly of TV operating systems. Thus, Roku fits perfectly within my investing philosophy of ""buying great companies at fair prices."" Also, investors could potentially generate a CAGR of ~15% on long-term investment in Roku. Hence, I recommend Roku as a buy in the $160s and below.Key Takeaway: I rate Roku a buy at ~$165, the price at which Roku traded when this article was written.As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow, and happy investing!"
4367953,105372,2020-08-12T10:40:14-04:00,"The shift to connected TV appears to be accelerating and despite a downturn in advertising Roku continues to grow rapidly.Roku's leading position in streaming devices and smart TV operating systems continues to drive account growth and gives Roku a strong position for international expansion.Companies like Google, AT&T and Amazon are trying to improve their competitive position but currently represent little threat to Roku.As Roku's advertising services mature and Platform revenue continues to grow, the market is likely to continue rewarding Roku with expanding multiples.","The shift from linear TV to OTT services continues to accelerate, aided by COVID-19 lockdowns. Roku (ROKU) is benefiting from this shift but is also facing temporary headwinds due to a deterioration in the advertising market. Despite this, Roku's revenue continues to grow rapidly as a result of increasing accounts and more streaming hours per user. I believe Roku's share price is likely to continue increasing over the next 12 months as the advertising market begins to recover and investors continue to reevaluate Roku's prospects.Figure 1: Global TV Advertising Market(Source: ARK Investment Management)COVID-19 caused a jump in Roku's account numbers and streaming hours on the platform, but this has been offset by a weak advertising market, which Roku does not expect to recover until well into 2021. Streaming hours per account peaked early in Q2 and have since moderated but remain above pre-COVID-19 levels. Roku's short-term performance is likely to continue being driven by a balance between increased Player revenue, subscription growth and increased advertising inventory offset by weak advertising demand.The performance of Roku relative to pure play adtech companies shows the strength of Roku's position as a walled garden with control over proprietary advertising inventory. Roku's revenue growth continues to outperform Magnite (MGNI) and has begun to outperform The Trade Desk (TTD) in recent quarters. The Trade Desk achieved connected TV revenue growth of approximately 40% over the past 12 months and Magnite achieved connected TV revenue growth of only approximately 12% over the same period.Figure 2: AdTech Company Revenue to Roku Revenue Ratio(Source: Created by author using data from company reports)COVID-19 lockdowns have highlighted a potential shift in the release of movies which could benefit Roku. Disney (DIS) is releasing Mulan through Disney Plus for $30 on September 4th, the same day it is released in some theaters. New movies are generally released in cinemas exclusively for 75 or more days, so this marks a significant shift for Disney. If the move has success it may lead to shorter exclusivity periods for theaters or a simultaneous release on streaming services for a fee. Roku would receive a percentage of any pay per view streaming on its platform and so would stand to benefit from a move from cinematic releases to home theater. This will come down to Mulan's performance, as Disney's main concern will be maximizing the value of their content.A large part of Roku's potential value is dependent on successfully expanding into international markets. Roku's initial expansion efforts are focused on Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Ireland, Brazil and Mexico. Roku is leveraging its streaming hardware and TV operating system to grow user accounts in these markets, similar to the United States. Roku TV sales account for 25% of TVs sold in Canada and Q2 players sales in the U.K. and Canada more than doubled year-over-year. Roku is also launching the Roku Channel in the U.K. and Canada and has added major local services in Brazil, Latin America and the United Kingdom. Roku's revenue is currently generated predominantly in the United States, therefore international revenue should help to drive growth in coming years if the service can gain traction.Figure 3: Roku Search Interest(Source: Created by author using data from Google Trends)In 2019 Roku acquired Dataxu (rebranded as OneView) for their Demand Side Platform (DSP), device graph technology and analytics platform. The acquisition was for $147.3 million, which consisted of $77.6 million in cash and $69.7 million in stock. OneView integrates Roku identity and data which allows targeting, measurement and performance optimization for advertising. OneView simplifies buying for advertisers and allows Roku to benefit from all advertising transaction in the Roku ecosystem, even those between an advertiser and a publisher on Roku.Many companies are engaged in efforts to position themselves to capture more of the programmatic advertising value chain. For example AT&T (T) acquired the DSP and Sell Side Platform (SSP) provider AppNexus in 2018, which may help them to monetize their Time Warner content. Roku appears to be following a similar strategy to Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB), developing a walled garden and utilizing proprietary data to grow its ad business beyond its own network. This could be a compelling value proposition for advertisers as 54% of Roku users are cordless and Roku can provide a single platform for marketers and content owners to reach a global audience and measure performance using the largest TV identity dataset. It should be kept in mind that the connected TV advertising market is relatively immature, and a significant portion of TV ad buying is still not done in real time.Figure 4: Programmatic Advertising Value Chain(Source: Created by author)Google and Facebook dominate the programmatic advertising market due to their share of user attention and external publisher networks. In 2019 Google, Facebook and Amazon (AMZN) commanded almost 70% of digital ad spend in the U.S. and this share is increasing over time. These walled gardens offer integrated programmatic solutions at a global scale, making them easy to buy for advertisers. Additionally, the walled gardens have deterministic user data at scale, which is a big advantage as the digital world becomes more cookieless. Roku can potentially bring all of these advantages to the connected TV market.Figure 5: Potential Programmatic Advertising Value Chain(Source: Created by author)Figure 6: Platform Take Rates(Source: Ark Investment Management)A number of companies are undertaking initiatives to protect user privacy, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) being the most prominent. This will negatively impact digital advertisers as their ability to target consumers and attribute performance will be reduced. Apple utilizes Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) for the following:This functionality can be limited by users but so far this option has been hidden in a settings menu. Going forward Apple's limit ad tracking function will be made more prominent and users will explicitly have to opt out to allow tracking. It is expected that very few users will do this which will make targeting and attribution more difficult. Adtech companies claim the impact will be minimal and have already navigated similar changes to web browsers, but the general consensus is that the long-term impact will be negative. This change will affect companies who offer mobile targeting, such as Google, Facebook, Twitter/MoPub (TWTR) and The Trade Desk. The impact on Roku of these type of initiatives is currently unclear. On one hand Roku could benefit as connected TV advertising may become more attractive relative to mobile advertising. On the other hand Roku's ability to utilize proprietary data to drive off platform advertising may be reduced.Roku's customer acquisition for their platform is largely dependent on their ability to maintain a leading position in smart TV operating systems. Roku TV sales currently account for one in three smart TVs sold in the United States, which is becoming increasingly important as smart TV sales continue to grow.Roku's lead in operating systems is the result of purpose building a smart TV operating system which offers superior cost, performance and user experience. This is coupled with engineering and factory support for manufacturers in addition to at cost or below cost pricing.Table 1: 2018 U.S. Wi-Fi Household Smart TV Market Share(Source: Created by author using data from Statista)Relationship with customers - Roku's position as a leading supplier of operating systems to TV manufacturers is an advantage but it may not be sustainable. Vendor selection by manufacturers is likely driven by a combination of cost, quality of the operating system and the ease with which it is integrated with the TV. There are a number of operating system competitors and with the right value proposition they could easily take market share. In addition, if the TV market becomes overly concentrated, Roku could be forced into revenue sharing agreements with manufacturers.Platform - Roku operates a three-sided platform (users, content owners, advertisers). This is an advantage as a large platform offers content owners an effective distribution channel for content monetization. It also offers advertisers a large audience, which Roku can leverage with user data, and it offers users a simple interface for all of the content they wish to view. While this is not necessarily a sustainable competitive advantage it is generally difficult to start a platform and get it to reach a tipping point, particularly in a maturing market like streaming where the main players are already established. There are only a handful of companies that can realistically compete with Roku at this point.Economies of scale - Roku benefits from economies of scale on the manufacturing side for their players and developing the operating system for smart TVs. Hardware and software are only important to the extent that it assists with customer acquisition though.Roku benefits from economies of scale in their advertising business as advertising purchases are still largely negotiated beforehand, not through real time auctions like most digital advertising. As Roku gains users they gain user data which improves the quality of their offering for advertisers. Advertisers can better target their audience, improving their ROI which then allows Roku to charge more for their advertising inventory. This could become particularly compelling as Roku scales globally as TV advertisers have never had access to global audiences through one distribution channel before. Roku is leveraging this advantage with their acquisition of Dataxu.Roku's gross profit margin continues to deteriorate as a result of declining margins in both its Platform and Player segments which is somewhat offset by an increasing contribution to revenue from the higher margin Platform segment. Roku's operating margin remains slightly negative as a result of continued investment in research and development and customer acquisition. Roku's long-term value is largely dependent on the level at which Platform gross profit margins stabilize and the contribution of Platform sales to total revenue.Figure 7: Roku Profit Margins(Source: Created by author using data from Roku)Figure 8: Roku Platform Revenue(Source: Created by author using data from Roku)Figure 9: Roku Segment Gross Profit Margins(Source: Created by author using data from Roku)Player revenue is primarily from the sale of streaming players and Platform revenue is primarily from advertising sales and related services, subscription and transaction revenue shares, sales of branded channel buttons on remote controls and licensing arrangements with TV brands and service operators. Roku's advertising revenue comes from first-party video ad inventory (including The Roku Channel), native display ads on the home screen and screen saver as well as ad inventory obtained through content publisher agreements. Supply is supplemented by re-selling video inventory that is purchased from content publishers and, to a lesser extent, direct sales of third-party inventory on a revenue share basis.Platform cost of revenue mainly consists of the cost of acquiring advertising inventory, content licensing fees, including premium content, payment processing fees, third-party cloud service fees and allocated personnel-related costs. Roku has stated that higher Platform costs are the result of higher costs to acquire advertising inventory, content related costs and credit card processing fees. At this stage it is unclear how Roku's Platform margins will change over time, but it will likely be a balance between:Roku's Player sales are primarily through consumer retail distribution channels including major brick and mortar retailers, such as Best Buy (BBY) and Walmart (WMT) and online retailers, primarily Amazon. Roku's concentrated distribution for Players puts the company in a weak position, although this concern is lessened by the fact that player sales are only required for customer acquisition. Amazon is probably Roku's main Player distribution channel and also one of Roku's main competitors, which creates the risk of Amazon favoring Fire TVs over Roku devices.Table 2: Roku Customer Concentration(Source: Created by author using data from Roku)Roku's current lack of operating profitability is not a concern as the company's operating expenses are broadly in line with comparable companies at a similar size. Operating expenses should be expected to decline though as the company continues to scale and growth moderates.Figure 10: Roku Operating Leverage(Source: Created by author using data from company reports)High R&D and sales and marketing expenses are likely to continue for the foreseeable future as Roku needs to maintain its lead in smart TV operating systems and continue expanding the company internationally. High operating expenses are not a concern provided they continue to result in strong revenue growth.Figure 11: Roku Operating Expenses(Source: Created by author using data from Roku)Roku's revenue growth is yet to show any signs of decline and this is likely to continue as Roku becomes more adept at monetizing their existing users and grows their international user base.Figure 12: Roku Revenue Growth(Source: Created by author using data from company reports)Figure 13: Roku Active Accounts(Source: Created by author using data from Roku)Roku's average revenue per user is a function of the number of hours users spend streaming and the rate at which that time can be monetized. Roku continues to grow both the number of streaming hours per user and the monetization rate and there is reason to believe that both of these factors still have significant room to grow.Figure 14: Roku Streaming Hours(Source: Created by author using data from Roku)Roku's average daily streaming hours per account is still less than 4 hours which is significantly less than the average daily hours of TV figure for Americans. If Roku were able to double the number of streaming hours per account, this would drive a significant increase in advertising inventory, although it is unclear to what extent Roku would be able to sell this inventory.Figure 15: Average Daily Hours Watching TV for Americans(Source: The Atlantic)Roku's user accounts growth appears to be on a similar trajectory to Netflix (NFLX) and provided they maintain their leading position in smart TV operating systems, I believe Roku could end up with several hundred million accounts globally.Figure 16: Roku Account Growth(Source: Created by author using data from company reports)Roku faces a number of risks which are centered around their ability to grow the number of users and capture the value created by their ecosystem. The smart TV manufacturing market is relatively concentrated, and this potentially gives manufacturers bargaining power. Roku already provides their operating systems at cost or possibly even at a loss, but manufacturers could eventually go as far as demanding a percentage of the revenue generated by Roku's platform on their TVs. Similarly, if the content producer market becomes overly concentrated Roku's value as a content aggregator will be diminished. Content producers would be able to negotiate deals which limit Roku's take rate and make Roku's margins on advertising and the Roku Channel slim. This risk is exemplified by Roku's current issues negotiating deals with Peacock and HBO Max.There is also the risk of companies like Apple, Amazon and Google gaining traction in the streaming device or TV operating system market, although this is a risk that Roku has faced since the company's founding. Google appears to be shifting focus to the connected TV market by introducing new streaming hardware (Google Android TV dongle) as well as attempting to place restrictions on Android TV. Google may be able to create value for consumers by integrating streaming hardware with the Google ecosystem (Google Assistant, YouTube etc.) but so far Google has struggled to compete in a range of areas outside its core business (consumer tech, social networking, messaging, music streaming and television). Roku is in the process of developing its own voice control platform, which is a defensive move against Google, Apple and Amazon.Amazon is one of the most serious threats to Roku but as the importance of smart TVs increases, Roku is extending its lead. Amazon now has over 40 million Fire TV users and has the ability to integrate advertising and ecommerce. Amazon utilizes Fire OS which is a fork of Android that was not specifically designed for TVs. Google has recently stipulated that any company wanting to license Android TV and Google's apps for its smart TVs cannot make devices that use forked Android versions. Failure to adhere to these terms could result in a company losing to the Play Store and other Google services for all of its devices. This move is likely aimed at weakening Amazon's position and helping Google to take control of Android TV, although regulators are likely to take a dim view of this tactic.Table 3: U.S. Platform Marketshare(Source: Created by author using data from Variety)Despite Roku's recent increase in share price it is still modestly priced relative to peers considering its growth rate. It is not clear what is driving this relative undervaluation, but it may be the result of Roku's weak margins or an assessment of Roku's competitive positioning.Figure 17: Comparable Company EV/GP Ratio(Source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance)The market appears to be reevaluating Roku's prospects as revenue becomes increasingly dominated by the platform segment. As platform revenue continues to grow relative to player revenue, it is likely that Roku's revenue multiple will continue to expand which will support share price growth.Figure 18: Variation of Roku EV/GP Ratio with Platform Revenue(Source: Created by author using data from Yahoo Finance)Provided that Roku can maintain a leading position in streaming hardware and smart TV operating systems it is likely to continue building a competitive advantage for its platform business. Based on a discounted cash flow analysis I estimate that Roku is worth approximately $240 per share."
4368656,102764,2020-08-14T02:06:05-04:00,"Roku is reporting an acceleration in operating performance across the board.The recession is weighting on advertising demand, but this is a transitory problem by its own nature.The company is planting the seeds for sustained growth in the long term.Current valuation provides abundant room for sustained revalorization in the years ahead.","Roku (ROKU) delivered remarkably solid earnings for the second quarter, but management was quite conservative regarding the outlook for a recovery in advertising demand. Because of this, the stock has pulled back after earnings, and it remains below the much important area of $170 per share.However, investors who are focusing too much on the transitory impact of the recession could be missing the forest for the trees. The economy comes and goes, but Roku is building the foundations for sustained growth in the years ahead, and the stock offers compelling upside potential from current price levels over the long term.Source: TOSRoku delivered very solid numbers for the second quarter, with revenue reaching $356.1 million and increasing 42% versus the same quarter in the prior year. The number was materially ahead of the $311.55 million expected on average by Wall Street analysts. This kind of performance is unquestionably healthy, especially for a company that depends on advertising.However, management provided a grim outlook for advertising demand in the near term. According to CEO Anthony Wood:Leaving macroeconomic factors aside, the company is executing very well and driving an acceleration in many of the most important operational metrics.Some key highlights for the quarter:In a nutshell, revenue growth decelerated somewhat due to economic factors, but the company is still driving accelerating user growth and engagement. Management cannot control economic conditions, but they can control how they face challenging times, and they seem to be doing a very good job at protecting and even enlarging Roku's fundamentals.Data by YChartsInternational expansion could open the door to massive growth opportunities for Roku in the long term, and the company is barely getting started in terms of capitalizing on such an opportunity.Player sales in both Canada and the UK more than doubled year-over-year during the second quarter, and Roku TV sales account for more than one in four smart TVs sold in Canada. Management also highlighted a strong performance in emerging markets such as Mexico and Brazil over recent months.Valuation is an art as much as a science. Having a fixed valuation target for a company is too rigid and short-sighted, and value estimates should always be dynamic and probabilistic as opposed to static and deterministic.The value of the business depends on the earnings and cash flows that such a business is going to produce in the future. The future can never be known for certain, only estimated, and those estimates necessarily carry a large margin of error.A stock is not undervalued when it has low valuation ratios. These low valuation ratios simply reflect the fact that the market has low expectations regarding the future of the business. The stock market is not always right, but it is right more often than not.When the valuation is reflecting mediocre growth prospects and the company has in fact mediocre growth prospects, then the stock is not undervalued at all. The stock is undervalued when the market is underestimating the company's fundamental quality and long term growth potential.The chart below shows consensus revenue numbers for Roku over the coming years. As we can see, growth rates are expected to remain high but decelerating over time.Source: Seeking AlphaIn order to see the data more clearly, the table shows the average revenue estimate, the year over year growth rates, and the forward price to sales ratio for Roku based on Wall Street expectations in the years ahead. The table also shows the lowest and the highest revenue estimate among the analysts following the stock.Source: Seeking AlphaTo begin with, even if we take the average estimate of $2.12 billion in 2021, the stock would be trading at a price to sales ratio of around 8.7. This is not excessive at all for a company growing revenue at more than 30% under rather conservative assumptions.Even more interesting, the gap between the high and low estimates for Roku is quite large. For 2021 we have a high estimate of $2.39 billion and a low estimate of $1.86 billion, a massive difference of over 28% for the high and low revenue estimates next year.If you believe that the actual numbers will be closer to the high end than the low end of the estimate range, then Roku is actually much cheaper than what it seems to be at first sight.For your reference, the most bullish revenue estimates put Roku stock at price to sales ratio of 7.6 for 2021 and 5.5 for 2022. These numbers are actually quite compelling.When a company outperforms growth expectations investors can be rewarded with both higher than expected revenues and expanding valuation multiples. In simple terms, if revenue grows faster than expected the price to sales ratio tends to increase too, providing a double boost to the stock price.When looking at the risks, advertising demand is intrinsically cyclical and depending on economic conditions, and Roku has fully acknowledged that the recession is hurting revenue growth in the short term.It is too early to tell how long it will take for demand to fully recover, and this will be an uncertainty factor weighting on Roku stock until we get more clarity on the economic horizon.Roku is also facing competition from companies of all sizes, including giants such as Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), among many others. Roku has proven over time that it is not afraid of competition, and a deep focus can be a crucial source of advantage for Roku. The company is 100% focused on online TV, which puts it one step ahead of the tech giants with lots of areas of focus and different priorities.Those risk factors being acknowledged, the fact is that Roku is executing exceptionally well during challenging times. The company is driving accelerating user growth and expanding its ecosystem across the board.Once the economy improves, and it will most probably improve over the coming months, Roku will be able to translate solid operational improvements into accelerating revenue growth and probably improving profit margins too. Programmatic is the future of advertising, and connected TVs will keep stealing dollars away from traditional TV advertising over the years to come. Roku is in the right place to capitalize on these opportunities.International markets are practically virgin territory for Roku, and recent data in this area looks quite interesting. If Roku succeeds in international expansion, then the stock could deliver massive returns from current price levels."
4363735,105617,2020-08-03T06:09:40-04:00,"Roku was unable to strike deals to bring HBO Max and Peacock to its platform.Roku established itself and prides itself on being a neutral OTT platform, but its actions regarding those two platforms are the opposite.Users seem frustrated with not having access to HBO Max and Peacock, and prolonged frustration could lead to users leaving the platform.","The streaming sector is one ripe with competition, and new services are constantly being launched to provide 'exclusive' content - take HBO Max and Peacock for example. As the 'streaming wars' continue, Roku (ROKU) doesn't look as attractive as it used to as an all-access streaming provider as it can't quite capture as much of the new market as it needs to keep customers satisfied.Image from USATodayRoku does not fill the same spaces as Netflix (NFLX) or Hulu - it doesn't provide original content nor is it likely to do so; rather, Roku provides access to Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+ (DIS), as well as dozens of other channels. But as some of the network providers start to create their own stand-alone streaming services, such as Peacock and HBO Max, some of the largest services recently pushed to market, Roku is facing potential customer losses since it does not carry those streaming platforms.While much of the debacle boils down to disputes between user data, money, and 'value sharing', Roku simply does not have all the cards in its favor - it's lacking enough market power to reach agreements on favorable terms.In May 2019, Roku claimed that ""the strength of our brand, the scale of our active account base, the advantages of our purpose-built streaming OS, and the engagement of our users make Roku an increasingly important partner for content publishers, advertisers and TV manufacturer"" - but that doesn't seem to be the case anymore.Roku also writes itself as a ""neutral OTT platform"" but Roku is not as neutral anymore. Roku claims to be ""an attractive partner [since it does] not focus on competing with content publishers on our platform, but instead, look[s] to partner with publishers to build their audiences and maximize our mutual success"" - if that is still the case, why is it trying to snub new providers like HBO Max and Peacock for its own gain?If Roku was still a symbol of a neutral OTT platform, one would expect to see the newest content services like HBO Max and Peacock on the platform - but they aren't, and aren't likely to be. Roku is acting like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and trying to get its cake and eat it too, but it's not abiding by its neutrality in this case.Roku might ""simply [be] looking for 'a reasonable share' of the value they create for partners"" as put by an insider at an OTT provider, but media execs are on the other side of the fence, believing that Roku and Amazon have been ""asking for 'egregious' terms.""While it's understandable that Roku and Amazon are looking for what they deem to be a fair deal, the benefits to Roku and Amazon from supporting those two platforms in particular align more with the egregious feel. For Roku, ""funneling HBO subscriptions through the Roku Channel has many benefits, including a cut of subscription revenues, greater insight into users’ viewing habits, and the chance that users will stick around to watch ad-supported content"" - in the case of HBO Max, Roku was unwilling to accept a lower cut of subscription revenues.In the case of Peacock, advertising rights were the forefront of the dispute. A spokesperson for Peacock stated that ""Peacock is free to use and free to any platform who wants to distribute it. If Peacock is not available on a platform at launch, it is not because we didn't make it available, and it's not because we didn't make it available for free."" Roku wanted ""the ability to insert its own advertisements at limited points during a viewing session"" which Comcast (CMCSA) did not wish to allow.Had Roku still been abiding by its idea of providing a neutral OTT platform, there should have been no reason why it was not able to successfully integrate both HBO Max and Peacock on to its platform. But it's not - it's putting its profitability at the front, and its neutrality and customer satisfaction in the back.With the recent releases of HBO Max and Peacock, customers are growing frustrated since they are not able to access them through Roku, and trying to find answers through Google. 10 of the 15 'breakout' queries related to Roku on Google have to do with Peacock, HBO Max and Roku, while the other 5 relate to Disney+ and Roku.On the Roku Community where Roku users can go for support, there is a lot of discussion about the two streaming platforms and their unavailability on Roku devices. Two different threads (one and two) have over 300 replies combined, with many of the users venting frustration at Roku for not supporting HBO Max and Peacock.If users like these do begin to leave Roku due to its inability to provide these and potentially other streaming services, Roku could be heading down a slippery slope - where it is trying to constantly scale revenues at a rapid rate, but also dealing with the fallout of losing customers due to frustration and dissatisfaction.Here, it doesn't have to do with growth - Roku's recent Cord-Cutting Study showed that the ""shift to streaming"" momentum stemming from the pandemic is likely to continue. Roku is a powerhouse when it comes to growth scaling, albeit with its expenses growing at a faster rate, pushing its net loss wider pretty consistently over the past six quarters. But quarterly earnings estimates look to be showing the upcoming Q2 earnings as a likely inflection point for quarterly losses. If Roku can't provide the value its customers desire at the value Roku desires is necessary from streaming services, growth might not be able to inflect earnings and bring Roku back towards profitability.Roku is still expanding globally and should continue to see solid revenue growth as expansion continues overseas. That's not something to worry about. But Roku's actions regarding HBO Max and Peacock are.It seems that Roku wants to push content providers and new services to give Roku larger revenue cuts as well as advertising and user data, earning Roku more without doing more. Yet this is seemingly coming at the expense of customer frustration and its inability to provide coveted streaming services.If Roku can't come to fair terms with HBO Max and Peacock, it might struggle to reach fair terms with any other upcoming streaming services in the future. Roku is no longer providing the OTT neutrality that it established itself upon, and is trying to squeeze more than it should to benefit itself and its revenues rather than provide an openly neutral streaming platform. If this trend continues, Roku could start to fall behind in the streaming wars."

This investment is worth considering.When I wrote my article on Roku last week, a lot of interesting questions surfaced in the comments section, that compelled me to describe Roku's investment opportunity from a different angle.Roku is a TV streaming platform. Arguably, the biggest appeal of Roku is that it is platform neutral. It doesn't matter whether the household is watching Netflix (NFLX) or Disney (DIS). Roku simply takes a small fee for connecting up the household to the content provider.Moreover, Roku is able to coexist with publishers and uses analytics to recommend to users unbiased search results and recommendations.The appeal for advertisers is that it enables them to reach the consumers they wish to target that have cord cut from linear TV.These households still need to be reached somehow. Advertisers could certainly opt for the likes of The Trade Desk (TTD) when it comes to reaching households that are cord-cutting, but I don't think that's the main investment risk to Roku.Saying that Roku competes with Amazon Firestick (AMZN) and Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Chromecast. However, this competition has existed for years, and this competition is not new.In fact, as we can see below, Roku's growth rates are impressive.Source: author's workA further insight worth considering is that for a long while, Netflix used to trade off the increase in the number of active users. I don't believe that's the case right now, because investors understand that the US market has saturated for Netflix and that International subscribers are worth substantially less to Netflix.However, in the case of Roku, we can see that its Active Accounts continue to increase year-year-year (green box).Source: Q1 2020 Press StatementMeanwhile, in the red box, I've noted that ARPUs are also pretty high. While I would expect that during Q2 2020's weak ad market its ARPU to come down meaningfully, I suspect that its increase in active accounts may surprise many on the upside.In fact, we know from the earnings call that April saw Roku's Active Accounts increasing by 38% year-over-year. Assuming that Roku's platform has a low churn rate, many of these new households are highly likely to stay on the platform for some time being highly accretive to Roku's bottom line.For now, given its strong growth rates, investors are willing to turn a blind eye to its lack of bottom line profits.However, for what is largely a connection service between two parties, Roku's platform gross profit margins are fairly mediocre, with gross margins of mid 60s% -- hardly something that gets the pulse going.Source: author's workPlease note that I've not included its most recent Q1 2020 platform gross profit margin (56.2%), as I wanted to shine a light on where its gross profit margins were while the economy was strong back in 2019.Presently, the climb back up from mid 50s% to mid-to-high 60s% is a substantial climb, and I'm unsure of whether Roku will succeed. For its part, Roku argued that COVID-19 played a role in unexpectedly compressing its margins through weaker video ad sales.On the other hand, if Roku's gross margins were to meaningfully contract further over the next few quarters, I would reconsider this investment opportunity.Accordingly, if Roku's gross margins were to continue to compress, I would suspect that this margin erosion is not temporary and it's being driven by a loss in pricing power -- and my opinion, the whole bullish thesis breaks apart in that event.Right now the market is looking elevated for most stocks. This doesn't necessarily mean that we are in bubble territory.But it's not fair to argue that the market is totally irrational either. Indeed, there are some pockets that are trading incredibly cheaply and are quite grounded, while others that have left and gone into the stratosphere.However, given that Roku is very likely to have a low churn rate amongst households, I believe that Roku should trade at a higher multiple than just 14x sales.There are many SaaS businesses that I suspect have a higher net churn rate than what they ultimately report and they are still getting priced at 20x sales. And they have been trading at this valuation for a long time.Consequently, in this 'new normal' environment, stocks that are likely to be growing at north of 30% over the coming few years and have significant visibility are not likely to remain priced at just 14x sales.Source: SA Premium ToolsAlthough Roku is not being operated for maximum profitability, its platform gross margins need to stabilize for the bullish thesis here to remain intact.Having said that, Roku's growth rates are very strong and investors are not paying a large premium at just 14x sales for a disruptive company that will be growing at more than 30% over the next couple of years. This investment is very attractive."

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Roku (ROKU) has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the coronavirus all year. We've seen tremendous strength in virtually all stocks relating to entertainment, with streaming services like Disney+ adding a boatload of new users that took Netflix (NFLX) years to accumulate and gaming companies like Activision Blizzard (ATVI) showing record levels of engagement and in-game spend. Roku has been no different, with the #1 smart TV provider continuing to gain millions of new accounts and increasing streaming hours. In the second quarter, Roku noted that it represented one of every three part TVs sold - given its entry-level pricing and established brand name, it's well positioned to capitalize on the growth of both streaming and smart TVs overall.Yet in the immediate aftermath of earnings, investors took advantage of the stock's year-to-date gains to lock in profits, sending shares down ~5% despite the lack of red flags in the quarterly results:Data by YChartsHeading into the earnings season, and not just for Roku but in general, we're looking specifically for the trends that will stick when the pandemic ends. To put it in other words, near-term results don't mean much because the coronavirus has warped everything - for some companies in a good way, and for some others bad.Roku, specifically, is in the midst of situations that have been brought on by the coronavirus:The first is a positive, the latter a negative. Yet in my view, it's the former that will actually sustain - we would postulate that most new users signing up to Roku and who enjoy it during the pandemic will continue to use it when the pandemic is over - while the latter problem, ad pricing, already has a near-term light at the end of the tunnel with many companies commenting on pricing rebounding toward the tail end of Q2.The bottom line on Roku: the bullish thesis for this stock remains unchanged, as the coronavirus has introduced many people to Roku for the first time, and once the company can muscle past near-term advertising weakness it can continue to build its huge ad-supported platform.There are many things to highlight out of Roku's second quarter, and the overwhelming majority of them are positive.Starting with the growth trends - as previously mentioned, Roku grew its active accounts by 3.2 million in the quarter, representing a 41% y/y rise in its active accounts. This is up four points relative to Q1's 37% y/y growth rate.Figure 1. Roku platform trendsSource: Roku Q2 shareholder letterIn addition, we note that Roku's streaming hours rose 65% y/y in the quarter - its best growth in streaming hours in recent memory (and given that streaming hours ultimately impacts the volume of ad impressions that Roku can serve, this is the key revenue driver).One quirk that may have irked investors and contributed to some of the slightly negative post-earnings reaction is that Roku discovered an error in its prior reporting of streaming hours. From October 2018 through March 2020, Roku notes that it had counted pause time (as in, when you're playing a movie but paused halfway through) in its streaming hours - which overstated streaming hours by ~6% throughout that period. As a result, Roku's Q1 streaming hours growth was actually 47% y/y versus the 55% y/y it originally reported.While this is definitely an embarrassing fluke on the company's part, it really does nothing to weaken Roku's story. In fact, it even highlights the strength of the Q1-to-Q2 acceleration in streaming hours from 47% y/y to 65% y/y.We note that, due to the rise in hours streamed per user, Roku was able to increase its ARPU (average revenue per user) by 18% y/y despite the weakness in ad pricing.Overall, Roku's revenue surged 42% y/y to $356.1 million, dramatically beating Wall Street's expectations of $314.5 million (+26% y/y) by a sixteen point margin, one of the best beats in the tech sector so far.Figure 2. Roku revenue trendsSource: Roku Q2 shareholder letterWe note that these beats also came accompanied with some positive news on the margin front as well. Despite the ad weakness that has cut into platform margins this year, we saw a slight improvement sequentially going from Q1 into Q2, adding to hopes for a back-half rebound in profitability. On the hardware side - even though it's really the platform that generates the majority of Roku's gross margin dollars, and players are sold at a low price to capture market share - we note that Roku's decision to stop promotional spending in light of the already-strong demand environment has led to a 206bps y/y improvement in player gross margins.Figure 3. Roku margin trendsSource: Roku Q2 shareholder letterRoku's EPS in the quarter of -$0.35 also dramatically beat expectations of -$0.55, and the company remained cash flow positive, with year-to-date operating cash flows of $80.1 million representing a huge improvement from $14.0 million in the prior-year period.Perhaps one of the sticking points to investors - and potentially one of the reasons the stock dived slightly post-earnings - was due to Roku's somewhat cautious commentary around the ad environment. In the Q2 shareholder letter, Roku wrote as follows:I think, however, that Roku's remarks need to be taken with a (huge) grain of salt. Though this commentary seems directionally bearish, several points that need to be considered that reduce the blow of this comment:In other words, stay focused on the big picture here. It's highly unlikely that the weak ad environment will cut that deeply into Roku's results (the huge Q2 beat is an indication of that), and in the long run the user base will continue to trend upward as ad pricing normalizes.Roku is one of the companies best-positioned to capitalize on the growth in streaming and the current extreme demand that we have for entertainment. Investors should look past near-term advertising weakness (irrespective of Roku's cautious comments, which other internet advertising companies have nullified) and focus on the tremendous extension of Roku's reach and its continued #1 position in the smart TV market."
4357437,69905,2020-07-08T05:36:02-04:00,"Roku's rapid revenue growth is astonishing.Investors are concerned about Roku's ad pricing power during Q2 2020 having a negative impact on its results, although I believe this is temporary.On the other hand, the streaming world is becoming increasingly competitive. There are too many players and not enough hours in a day.There could still be some upside potential here, even at this valuation.","Roku (ROKU) is growing at a breakneck pace. Even if Q2 2020 results are worse than expected (which I doubt), the long-term tailwinds to this platform are very attractive. This stock now trades with at 12.3x trailing revenues, a decline from plus 15x trailing revenues in 2019.Although there are many competing platforms in the market right now, this well-managed company with strong insider ownership still has very attractive profit margins. Altogether, this stock is worth considering.Source: author's calculationsThe above graph illustrates Roku's revenue growth rates. This revenue growth rate is astonishing.Presently, investors are concerned about ad pricing how much this will impact its performance in Q2 2020. When Roku reported its Q4 2019 results at the time, its guidance was pointing towards 42% revenue growth rates.Right now, given the widespread weakness in ad market, many investors are concerned that Roku's revenue growth rates could be marked by a substantial deceleration.On the other hand, I suspect that not only will this impact be temporary, but that it could be slightly offset by a meaningful increase in active accounts, as households take advantage of Roku's many different trial options.At the end of June YouTube TV (GOOG)(GOOGL) raised prices by 30%. This informs me of two separate characteristics.Firstly, that there's space in the family budget for more expensive YouTube TV. I felt that given the number of jobs being lost in the economy, that YouTube would probably be less aggressive with its pricing increases. However, the facts point in a different direction.Secondly, and more pertinent aspect here is that YouTube TV is not even likely to be the primary streaming platform for many households, with Netflix (NFLX) more likely than not being given preference in many households.Also, by no means an exhaustive list but here are a few more players that Roku has to contend with Hulu Live TV (DIS), Dish Network Corp.'s Sling TV (DISH), AT&T Inc.'s AT&T TV Now (T).All these different alternatives combined all fighting for a piece of the pie are more likely than not to be a significant concern for Roku's profit margins.Source: author's calculationsI have not included Roku's Q1 2020 gross profit figure (56.2%) in the graph above not to obfuscate what Roku's gross profit margins were under a normalized environment, such as that throughout 2019.Also, I've not focused on the hardware sale above. I've opted solely to represent Roku's gross profit margins from its streaming revenue and I suspect that readers will agree that these margins are very attractive.Succinctly, these high margins are the reason to consider this investment opportunity.When is looking through Roku's financials I noted that they were very 'clean'. Meaning that the growth is organic, without questionable entries or reliance on M&A to grow its top line.Given that I look through many companies, my immediate instinct is that this management team must be strongly aligned with the performance of the company. So lo and behold, reading through the proxy I see the following:(Source)Although I don't know how this story will ultimately play out, we can be assured that this management team is positively incentivized to deliver strong shareholder returns, given just how much skin in the game they have.Source: author's calculationsThere are concerns that ad spending reductions are likely to affect Roku's near-term profit margins. However, I contend that not only are Roku's ad reductions likely to be temporary, but I would not be surprised to see if they are less severe than many analysts expect.However, we are still left with the issue that paying 12.3x trailing revenues is a punchy valuation for a company without long-term customer lock-ins. Of course, bulls would retort that throughout 2019 investors were positively euphoric to pay more than 15 times trailing sales, thus being asked to pay just 12.3 times trailing sales is a bargain opportunity in comparison.Furthermore, looking out to next year, analysts expect that Roku is being priced at less than 8x forward sales.Source: SA Premium ToolsAs you can see in the green box, this multiple is fairly respectable and not overly punchy. Furthermore, the growth rates that Roku needs to deliver to reach this target revenue are not excessive.As discussed above, Roku's valuation is a serious concern. In the event of a further multiple compression, this largely GAAP unprofitable company could see shareholder returns turn significantly negative at a rapid clip.Roku's appeal is largely contingent on its ability to grow and retain users. With so many other streaming platforms already available, the competition is intensifying with the passage of time. Given that there's only so many 'Streaming Hours' in a day for users to sit down and watch Roku's content, this puts a cap on just how much Roky's revenues could grow.Indeed, combined, we can see that Roku's multiple and shareholder returns are mostly reflective of investors' sentiment. If sentiment turns sour at any point, investors could see its share price falling rather quickly.Roku is growing at a very strong clip and is highly likely to resume similar growth rates in 2021 once the ad market has stabilized. Investment sentiment has been dented because of the likely impact of ad weakness on its Q2 2020 results.I argue that investors are overly gloomy this stock and that once Q2 2020 is reported, investors may come to reappraise Roku in a new light."
4354531,23903,2020-06-18T14:29:52-04:00,Roku has enjoyed event-driven acceleration of user metrics in the past two quarters.A decline in platform gross margin combined with the accelerated growth of operating expenses has caused an inversion of these metrics for the first time in Q1 2020.High market liquidity has allowed for Roku's current high market valuation while discounting longer-term risk factors.,"(Daily chart for ROKU with 50- and 200-day moving averages shown in green and red, respectively. A trend support line at $100 and down-trending resistance line from last year's highs are shown in purple highlight a compressing trading range. Chart source: Yahoo Finance.)After the COVID-19 panic sell-off last March, the US indexes came roaring back even as many states began to shut down. It became quickly evident that shelter-in-place orders would not universally negative for corporate earnings. Roku (ROKU) appeared to be a prime beneficiary as its video streaming platform offered Americans a cheap form of entertainment as they idled at home. Yet despite Roku's perceived event-driven advantage, its stock has underperformed peers and even the broader Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) index after peaking a year ago. A continual worrying trend of declining margins and increasing expenses only intensified after Roku's platform segment gross margin fell below operating expenses as a percentage of revenues for the first time in the first quarter of 2020.Roku has proven to have extremely high visibility into its quarterly revenues and has beaten Wall Street revenue estimates every quarter for the past three years. The first quarter of 2020 was no exception as revenue estimates of $309 million were surpassed by $12 million. With internal operating costs more predictable, the company has also not missed analysts' average EPS estimates as a public company. GAAP EPS loss of -$0.45 came in exactly inline with expectations and adjusted EBITDA loss of -$16.3 million was $1.7 million less than its previous low end guidance for a -$18 million loss.What is different this time is Roku did not beat analysts' EPS estimates for the first time as a public company. After a huge Q4 2020 report, many including myself expected subscription revenues to further gain momentum in the first full quarter after the debut of Disney's (DIS) Disney+ and Apple's (AAPL) AppleTV+ late last year. Additionally, Roku had two full weeks to potentially add to subscriptions after many states imposed shelter-in-place orders in the second half of March. Even as a long term bear, I was prepared for Roku to crush expectations and rally hard has it had in the past. The inline quarter was truly a disappointment which sent Roku shares down almost 8% the following day.Part of the reason for Roku's top line beat was due to incremental sales of its hardware player. In addition to higher hardware sales volume, Roku was also able to limit product discounting in a quarter since demand was high and supply was limited. As a result, player segment gross margin hit 10.5% which was the highest level in almost two years. To give some perspective, Roku posted negative -0.7% player gross margin in the previous quarter and 4.4% in fiscal 2019. In Roku's Q4 2019 earnings conference call, management guided for full year player gross margin to average 0% so the 10.5% posted in the first quarter was really a big surprise.Yet despite the surprise profit boost from Roku's player segment, bottom line results just met expectations. The first explanation is Roku's platform gross margin came in lower than expected. First quarter 2020 player gross margin declined by 630 basis points sequentially to 56.2%. Year over year platform gross margin degradation was even worse at 1370 basis points. Although management did previously guide for platform gross margin to average in the high 50s% to 60% in fiscal 2020, I did not expect Q1 figures to fall below this range. For a company that has historically under-promised and over-delivered, any disappointment is further magnified.To further negatively compound the profitability picture, operating costs continued to rise. Although average annual revenue growth has remained impressive at over 50%, operating costs at all levels rose at a higher rate shown in the table below. Excluding an estimated $1.2 million amortization expense related to a recent acquisition, total operating expenses rose by almost 75% compared to the first quarter of 2019.(Data compiled from Roku's quarterly results. Q1 2020 results exclude an approximate $1.2 million one time amortization charge. Dollar figures in millions.)As a combined result of declining margins and rising operating expenses, Roku's profitability profile inverted for the first time in Q1 2020. Even with an estimated $2.1 million of amortization expense removed from platform cost of goods sold, first quarter platform gross margin of 57% was well below the quarter's 60.8% operating expense ratio. Combined with lower margin hardware sales, adjusted consolidated gross margin of 44.7% produced a staggering negative -16.1% operating loss margin on a GAAP basis.(Data compiled from Roku's quarterly results.)Obviously, if these two operating trends do not reverse, Roku's losses will look even worse regardless of any revenue upside surprise. At the company's previous $1.6 billion revenue guidance for 2020 before it was retracted due to COVID-19, GAAP operating loss could exceed $200 million. On a positive note, Roku could still remain close to adjusted EBITDA neutral since a very high percentage of the company's operating expenses are non-cash share-based compensation. In Q1 2020, stock-based compensation was 9.5% of total revenues.Roku's declining operating margin has resulted in a continual downward revision of Wall Street estimates. Although current fiscal year 2023 earnings are still expected to remain positive at $1.79, analysts now expect Roku to post annual losses for the next three fiscal years.(Data compiled from analysts' average EPS estimates. EPS represents estimates at the end of each quarterly period.)Current Wall Street expectations call for Roku to lose -$0.19 in annual EPS for fiscal 2022. To check if this estimate is valid relative to the company's current profitability profile, I will refer back to a Roku article written last year which forecast ARPU growth shown in the table below.(Projected ARPU growth assuming annual growth rates of 27% in 2019, 22% in 2020, 17% in 2021, and 15% in 2022.)Roku ended 2019 with an ARPU of $23.14 which slightly surpassed my previous $22.80 estimate. The company's Q1 2020 ARPU of $24.35 was also above the previous trend so my forward ARPU estimates will need to be lifted. Using a lower ARPU decelerating growth rate of 4% per year, Roku's estimated 2022 ARPU would be raised from the previous $37.40 estimate to $40.00.Although Roku's active account growth accelerated in the past couple of quarters, growth may have resulted from non-recurring events such as new subscription offerings from Disney and Apple. COVID-19 also likely augmented first quarter figures and may further contribute to second quarter totals. Since an argument could be made COVID-19 did not raise the long term subscription potential but rather pull forward demand, subscriber growth may revert back to historical trends in the second half of 2020 and beyond. The target estimate of 60 million active subscribers by the end of 2022 remains a likely scenario.If we assume operating expenses revert back to 50% of total revenues from the 60% posted in the first quarter, Roku would be at operating break even by the end of 2022. Assuming non-operating income and taxes are negligible, GAAP EPS would be close to the current Wall Street estimate of -$0.19. Of course, this assumes Roku stabilizes recent gross margin degradation and grows revenues at a faster rate than operating expenses.The problem is not with fiscal 2022 estimates. With stricter operating controls, the estimate above should be achievable. The problem is moving past 2022 because we currently do not know the upper limit saturation level for both active subscriber and ARPU. For example, Netflix (NFLX) subscriber count for US and Canada stalled for three quarters around 66-67 million prior to the COVID-19 boost recorded in Q1 2020. ARPU rates at 50% higher levels than currently is also entering into unknown territory. As the table below shows, user metrics have for the most part remained within historical trends. If sequential ARPU growth rates cannot be maintained in the second half of 2020, then the stronger figures posted in the past two quarters were more related to external events than true sustainable growth.(Data compiled from Roku's quarterly results.)Even if Roku can maintain similar growth in 2023 compared to 2022, current analysts' revenue estimates of $3.66 billion appear unrealistic. The estimate for $900 million in absolute revenue growth in 2023 over 2022's $750 million would require an acceleration of growth at a higher scale. Typically the law of large numbers would challenge this estimate. Although plausible, analysts' growth projections for Roku appear more of an extrapolation of current growth rates than a true representation of the competitive nature of the video streaming industry. Similar to how estimates have gradually been lowered in the past several quarters, figures past 2022, in my opinion, may yet be lowered as well.If investors were solely looking at Roku's user metrics, its stock would be ripping right now. Although active users and revenue per user growth in the past two quarters may have benefited from non-recurring events, the growth acceleration has to be taken at face value until proven otherwise in future quarters. However as the chart below shows, Roku shares have underperformed the broader QQQ indexes during the past several quarters. Relative to direct peers who enjoyed perceived COVID-19 benefits, Roku's underperformance is even more extreme.(Daily chart for ROKU with 50- and 200-day moving averages shown in green and red, respectively. QQQ's relative performance is shown in blue. A trend support line at $100 and down-trending resistance line from last year's highs are shown in purple. Chart source: Yahoo Finance.)With the exception of last March during the panic selloff, ROKU has held the $100 level numerous times during the past year. Although its recent underperformance is a little concerning from a long perspective, weakness near $100 should be bought with tight stops if broken after several closing prints. On a slightly bearish note, a descending trendline exists from last year's highs. Several closing prints above $130 could signal a breakout and be potentially dangerous for shorts given the nature of today's high liquidity market.Given the narrowing trading range shown in the chart above, Roku's second quarter earnings in about six weeks could prove pivotal. Barring a complete general market meltdown, ROKU may continue trading between $100-$130 until early August. Since most of the US was shut down during the second quarter, Roku could post accelerated user metrics but investors should keep in mind everyone expects a good quarter.Since Roku did not give forward guidance for the first time due to COVID-19, there could be a wider gap between actual results and analysts' estimates. The current Wall Street revenue estimate for the second quarter is $313 million which would just be 25% annual increase over 2019. In other words, official estimates are very low but investor expectations could be very high. If volatility lessens in the coming weeks heading into earnings, options straddle might be the best short term trade. Otherwise, risk adverse investors may want to wait for Roku's results instead of betting directionally beforehand.Unless Roku can reverse its recent negative margin and cost trend, my longer term argument Roku may not be able to grow into its current valuation remains valid. Investors are currently paying 65x 2023 estimates when a lot of variables are still up in the air. For the next three years, Roku is still expected to lose money despite maintaining a fairly high revenue growth rate. With saturation levels for both subscriber and ARPU still uncertain, long term profitability is still highly speculative especially when profit margins have been slowly declining.Without original content to retain subscriber loyalty, Roku remains vulnerable to competition from much larger players. Roku requires its subscribers to continually replace their hardware units with another Roku device. If main content providers decide to offer their content exclusively on a competing platform, it may be difficult for Roku to retain its subscriber base. Despite a myriad of risk factors, bull does have a short term advantage. Extremely high liquidity in today's markets should offer bulls a time buffer to allow Roku to grow into its current high valuation."

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.After receiving a constant bid from the markets throughout 2019, throughout which Roku (ROKU) shares jumped massively from around $30 in January 2019 to an all-time high at $170 in September, shares of Roku have taken a substantial breather in 2020. Initially Roku was a big outperformer in the markets as investors bet that lockdown orders would glue more and more people to their TVs. But at the same time, the declines in internet advertising (especially with recent news surrounding ad pullbacks from social media platforms, though that more directly impacts companies like Facebook (FB) and Twitter (TWTR)) robbed back some of the benefit of increased usage, and also slowed down Roku's recent progress on gross margins.Now, the stock is down ~15% year-to-date:Data by YChartsI've been back and forth on Roku stock, most recently recommending caution in mid-April when Roku was trading in the mid-$130s. Since then, however, shares have have dropped 15% while the broader market has advanced nearly 10% - so I'm now reversing my stance to bullish. Roku is a perfect ""buy the dip"" situation.As I have noted in recommending internet advertising-oriented stocks like Twitter, the near-term decline in advertising is temporary. Despite the charged media updates on advertiser retaliation, most industry observers have actually observed that ad spending began the path to recovery in May. Yes, Roku was hurting in Q1 and will continue to hurt as it reports Q2 results that were heavily impacted by ad pricing declines - but over time, the company will be able to benefit from a substantially larger (and more engaged) user base when pricing returns to normal.Roku is a tremendous and popular platform that is in the midst of converting its business to become a purely advertising-driven, recurring revenue company. We've seen from counterparts in the software sector that companies transitioning to recurring revenues have typically seen huge appreciation in share prices (as investors value that recurring revenue stream far more than Roku's one-time hardware sales). I like the fact that most of Roku's hardware is entry-level priced, making it a great gateway to the smart TV world for new buyers.Keep monitoring share price movements and buy anywhere in the low $110s.Before we get into Roku specifically, it's useful to take a close look at how streaming companies have performed this year.Data by YChartsOn the back of massively expanded user bases plus increased engagement, shares of Netflix (NFLX) have risen 37% this year, while Spotify (SPOT) in the months of May and June caught its first major breakout since going public at ~$150 a share in 2018, and is now up nearly 2x in the year-to-date.You'll notice, however, that Roku has been left behind. This is due to Roku's exposure to advertising driving decelerations in revenue growth and gross margins, but as I mentioned earlier, Roku's surge in users and engagement is permanent while the decline in ad pricing is rather temporary.Let's now see how Roku's financials played out in the first quarter. As previously mentioned, the disappointments in the quarter came largely from the advertising side - as marketers pulled back budgets to conserve cash, sending ad rates downward. Dynamics in internet advertising are changing again - marketers are pulling back from social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, at least in the short term - but this could also mean that this budget could be re-diverted onto streaming platforms like Roku, helping to accelerate the recovery to normal pricing.Figure 1. Roku 1Q20 resultsSource: Roku 1Q20 earnings releaseStill, Roku was in growth mode in Q1. The company's 37% y/y increase in active accounts and 49% y/y increase in streaming hours produced an impressive 55% y/y growth rate in revenues to $320.8 million, of which 73% was derived from platform. And in spite of a negative stock market reaction post-earnings, Roku still managed to beat Wall Street's expectations of $309.2 million (+46% y/y) by nearly a ten-point margin.Roku has cited uncertainty as a reason for pulling its guidance for Q2 and beyond, but there will be counterbalancing impacts that will color Roku's Q2 results. The first is that, as mentioned in Roku's shareholder letter, user trends continued to accelerate into April, with streaming hours up 80% y/y. We don't know, however, if this surge in hours will be sufficient to counteract the drop in ad pricing.We do think, however, that current consensus estimates are very light. Per Yahoo Finance, Wall Street consensus thinks that Roku will generate only $311.2 million in revenue in Q2, up only 24% y/y. The notion that Roku's revenue growth will decelerate thirty points in Q2 when streaming hours surged from 49% y/y in Q1 to 80% y/y in April is unrealistic - especially when we consider that ad pricing has only fallen about 15-20% since the pandemic, and has seen recovery in May and June.Here's some useful qualitative commentary on the Q1 earnings call from CFO Steve Louden on how advertisers have behaved since the pandemic began:One of the impacts of lower ad pricing, of course, is that the revenue decline ate into Roku's progress on the gross margin front. Roku's platform gross margin fell fourteen points in the quarter (roughly corresponding with the estimated decline in ad pricing), though a richer platform-to-player mix as well as a 209bps boost in hardware margins kept Roku's overall gross margin to decline only 483bps.Figure 2. Roku gross margin trendsSource: Roku 1Q20 earnings releaseI'll echo the same comments here: we shouldn't read too much into Q1's decline, especially as advertising revenues are already on the rebound. Roku has managed to generate impressive mid-60s platform gross margins over the past six years, and additional monetization opportunities in areas like TVOD are additional tailwinds to expansion.And in spite of these margin declines, we like the fact that Roku managed to grow operating cash flows to $45.9 million in Q1, despite a loss of -$10.7 million in the year-ago quarter:Figure 3. Roku cash flow trendsSource: Roku 1Q20 earnings releaseRoku also maintains enviable liquidity on its balance sheet, with $588.3 million of cash against a relatively minor debt balance of $167.4 million.Roku's year-to-date slide in spite of strong user sign-ups has driven me to revise my previously bearish opinion on the stock. With the rampant demand for at-home entertainment and the surge in streaming hours, I believe Roku is well-positioned to capitalize on its much larger account base as advertising prices continue to stabilize. Right now investors are shying away from internet names due to the negative news flow on advertising cancellations for social media companies, but I think the impact to Roku will be minimal if not even benign.Look for an entry point in this stock, especially if it continues to dip further."
4346032,40781,2020-05-11T10:39:22-04:00,"Takeaways from Roku's Q1 earnings report.
        Why shares fell and why investors are missing the big picture.
        Roku CFO Steve Louden sees stabilization in April as advertisers come back while traditional TV budgets make the move to OTT.","Shares of Roku (ROKU) dropped nearly 8% on Friday despite the company reporting first quarter revenues and earnings that topped Wall Street estimates.Strong earnings and user growth wasn't impressive enough for some investors who took profits off the table — after shares more than doubled in less than two months — due to concerns over a possible advertising crunch due to COVID-19.Here's a look at Roku's Q1 numbers as well as how the company has performed on the top and bottom lines over the past four quarters.With Roku having already pulled its full-year guidance going into Q1 earnings— like nearly every company has done given the uncertainty about how the pandemic will play out — management's comments in its shareholder letter noted that growth in its ad business could see a slowdown. This sent investors into a frenzy and sent shares down more than 10% during after hours trading before finishing down 7% on Friday.But as anyone on Wall Street knows, it's all about the future. It's not about the next week, month or quarter, but what will happen years from now. Great examples of this include Amazon (AMZN), Beyond Meat (BYND) and Tesla (TSLA) just to name a few. Even Uber (UBER), which posted a quarterly loss of nearly $3 billion, saw shares climb more than 6% on Friday. We feel investors are absolutely missing the point on Roku as the COVID-19 pandemic has only solidified and accelerated the company's position, which will continue to fuel its growth.During the conference call, we thought it was interesting that nobody has been talking about the comments made by Roku CFO Steve Louden who said they've seen things starting to stabilize in April. Below is the Q&A between Louden and William Blair analyst Ralph Schackart.Ralph SchackartQuestion: I believe you talked about seeing decreased ad cancellations in April. Can you just maybe provide some more color, are you starting to see your advertisers come back? Steve LoudenAnswer: We did see an uptick in cancellations and pipeline slowdown in mid-March. Since then, (in April) we’ve seen it stabilize. ... While the rest of the year is uncertain, we still expect substantial growth in the ad business through the year.Unfortunately for investors, Roku didn't get the same love from the market that Facebook (FB) received after the social media company announced that ads had stabilized in April during its Q1 report. Here's the comment from Facebook CFO David Wehner during the earnings call.With the announcement that ad revenues had stabilized in April, shares of Facebook soared as much as 15% in after-hours trading. Yet, the market punished ROKU and sent shares down more than 10% in after hours trading before settling down nearly 8% on Friday.We feel investors focused their attention on Roku's shareholder letter which talked about an increase in ad cancellations or delayed starts throughout March, and completely missed the point that Louden made during the conference call that things stabilized in April.First, the main difference from Roku and that of Facebook and Uber is that those companies focused their talking points more on the recovery in April, instead of what happened in March. Unfortunately for investors in Roku, management did not do the same which led to investors selling first, and asking questions later. Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein also noted this in his post-earnings report.Second, part of the selloff was due to Roku's big run into earnings over the past two months. It's hard to blame investors for taking profits after shares more than doubled in less than two months. But at the same time, we argue that shares should have never fallen as low as they did ($60) during the market meltdown in March, because Roku was going to be one of the few companies that would greatly benefit as a stay-at-home play. So while it has been a great run, we feel there is still plenty of upside remaining for investors going forward.Another important point we'd like to mention is that ad cancellations have been mostly offset by ad-spend that has moved over to Roku from traditional TV budgets.With no live sports, and with production halted for TV shows and movies, advertisers are moving where all the eyeballs are going. This, of course, is great news for Roku which saw streaming hours reach a record 13.2 billion hours last quarter. This is up 1.6 billion hours over the prior quarter and 4.3 billion hours year-over-year.While Roku will continue to benefit from people cutting the cord, the current environment will only accelerate that process. Whether lockdowns end or are extended, the company will continue to benefit as advertisers make the switch in order to get the best return on investment, especially in times of budgets cuts for ad spending.“There’s still going to be a significant financial recession or great Recession,” said Louden, in response to the question whether ending lockdowns of cities will return things to normal. “And so they [advertisers] are going to have to justify their marketing spend more heavily. ... And so I think this will be a big catalyst, where the advertisers are taking a harder look at their allocation.""While the company didn't get into more specifics that investors and analysts wanted, management did give a glimpse of what was taking place in April. The number of new accounts rose by more than 70% compared to a year earlier while the number of streaming hours climbed by roughly 80%.Even analysts at Wedbush and Loop Capital — some of the biggest Roku bears — have started changing their tune and have continued to raise their price targets. Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter raised the firm's price target on Roku to $136. Why is this notable? Well, consider just one year ago, Pachter raised his price target from $55 to $65 on Roku this time last year.With unemployment reaching nearly the great depression levels with more than 20.5 million jobs lost in April alone, the economy is going to take awhile to rebound. This should increase cord-cutting as people look to save money and are starting to realize just how much streaming companies offer, including Roku's own channel which allows customers to watch hundreds of channels for free.As we noted earlier, investors seemed to have missed some important points from Roku's latest conference call and earnings report as the COVID-19 pandemic has not only helped fuel the company's growth, but has solidified and accelerated Roku's position in the streaming market. Long story short, the Roku growth story remains, and its future looks brighter than ever.While we believe Roku is a clear long-term winner, we'll continue to trade around our core position to capture the nice returns that come with its wild swings. If shares dip back to the $100 range, we'll be doubling our position as shares will likely make all-time highs by the end of the year."
4346198,24960,2020-05-11T15:05:30-04:00,"Roku has been growing at quite an impressive rate. However, we expect slower growth in the next several quarters.It has been investing quite efficiently to grow its revenue and active accounts.We expect Roku's fair value could be $130 in the next two years. Thus, 2-year future growth has been priced into the stock.","Roku (ROKU) has recently reported mixed first-quarter results. Its revenue came in at $321 million, higher than the previous estimates by $11.77 million. GAAP EPS was -$0.45, matching analysts' expectations. However, the company mentioned that the growth of its video advertising business has been slowing down due to COVID-19. The market sentiment turned negatively, pulling Roku's share price from more than $138 to $126 per share at the time of writing. We think that Roku is not cheap now, and the share price might continue to experience downward pressure in the near future.As many people are staying at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Roku has experienced substantial growth in users and revenue. In the first quarter of 2020, its total net revenue jumped by 55% year-over-year. The company added a 2.9 million incremental active account to reach a total of 39.8 million accounts. The average revenue per user (ARPU) was $24.35, 28% higher than the same period last year. The streaming hours were up 49%, from 8.9 billion hours in Q1 2019 to 13.2 billion in Q1 2020.However, the high growth always comes at a cost. To achieve revenue and users' growth, Roku had to increase operating expenses significantly during the same period.Source: Roku's Press ReleaseIn the past four quarters, the operating expenses grew by 76%, from $111.6 million to $196.3 million, resulting from a 102% increase in sales & marketing, a 58% rise in R&D, and an 80% increase in G&A expenses. As a result, the loss from operations has expanded by 5x to -$55 million. Its adjusted EBITDA has fallen from $10 million to -$16.3 million. Roku has taken advantage of the current staying-at-home trend to acquire more users. We think it is a smart move. When people have got Roku's streaming stick, as users do not have to pay any additional monthly fees, they would just keep using Roku's platform. We think Roku's operating losses will keep expanding in the next several quarters, due to the declining advertising revenue growth and the increased operating expenses. However, we do not think investors should worry about its operating loss expansion. As we pointed out before, Roku has done an excellent job of investing in its growth. From 2017 to 2019, Roku invested an additional $166.8 million, to generate additional revenue of $616 million and extra gross profit of $295 million. The operating losses increased by only $45.4 million in the same period. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that Roku would continue to invest in growth efficiently in the future.Although the company delivered operating losses, the operating cash flow came in as much as $45 million in the first quarter of 2020.Source: Roku's Press ReleaseRoku's operating cash flow was positive because many of its expenses, including stock-based compensation and depreciation and amortization, were non-cash. We always believe that stock-based compensation is an excellent way to motivate employees, rewarding them along with the overall company's growth. Furthermore, the decline in accounts receivable increased the operating cash flow by nearly $32.46 million. In the first quarter, the company has drawn down more than $69.3 million in credit facility, boosting net cash position by almost $590 million, more than enough to cover its total debt and operating lease liabilities of $480 million.Even after the recent drop, we do not think Roku is cheap yet. At $126.7 per share, it is valued at nearly 12x price-to-sales, much higher than Netflix (NFLX), a global leading streaming service provider. At the time of writing, Netflix is valued only 9.2x sales.Source: YchartsNetflix also experienced high growth in paid subscriptions due to the global lockdown. In the first quarter of 2020, the number of paid subscribers jumped by 22.8% to 182.86 million. Although Roku might deserve a higher valuation than Netflix because of its higher potential growth, however, it is certainly not cheap. Roku's valuation has been lower than Netflix before. At the beginning of 2019, Roku's sales multiple has dropped significantly to 4.8x, roughly 55% of Netflix's 8.5x sales multiple.By 2022, Roku is expected to generate $2.73 billion in revenue. If we conservatively value Roku at comparable sales multiple to Netflix at roughly 9x, Roku could be valued at $24.57 billion. Assuming that Roku's total share count would increase by 20% for stock-based compensation and more equity offering, its total number of shares can reach 144.84 million. As a consequence, its fair value per share would be $130 by 2022.Roku's growth in revenue and active accounts has been quite impressive. Furthermore, the company has done a pretty good job of investing in its growth. However, we expect slower growth in the next two quarters due to COVID-19's negative impact. As we estimate its fair value could be $130 per share in the next two years, its 2-year future growth has been priced into the stock."

We lower our target price to $147.25 (earlier $149.25).* Numbers may not add up due to rounding; EPS figures are GAAP.Q1:20 revenues were $320.8 million, up 55% YOY, attributable to growth across both its segments - Platform (+73% YOY) and Player (+22% YOY). The company showed strong business momentum with 37% YOY active user growth and 49% YOY streaming hours growth. On the monetization front, the average revenue per user (ARPU) increased by 28% YOY to $24.35 versus $19.06 in Q1:19. ROKU delivered a gross profit of $141.1 million up 40% YOY, but gross margins declined 483 bps YOY to 44.0% in Q1:20. ROKU reported a total adjusted EBITDA loss of $16.3 million in Q1:20. The figure was well ahead of company expectations. Given the uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, ROKU withdrew its outlook for the full year 2020. Management did note that they expect an adjusted EBITDA loss for FY 2020. We adjust our estimates based on the results and management's commentary.TV streaming is a highly competitive industry with the presence of large technology players such as Amazon (AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) which have far higher resources. The U.S.-China trade war could adversely affect business operations as the majority of ROKU's hardware is manufactured in China.Revenues up 55% vs. the prior year. Total revenues increased 55% to $320.8 vs. $206.7 million in the prior year quarter, and down sequentially vs. $411.2 million in the preceding December quarter. The increase was largely attributable to revenue growth across both its segments. Platform revenue grew 73% YOY to $232.6 million, accounting for 73% of total sales. Player revenue grew ~22% YOY to $88.2 million. The total number of player units sold during the quarter increased 25% YOY while the average sales price (ASP) was down 7% YOY.Active User Momentum continues. The company added 2.9 million new accounts in Q1:20, and the total number of active accounts reached 39.8 million, up 37% YOY. The total number of streaming hours was 13.2 billion, an increase of 49% YOY versus 8.9 billion hours in Q1:19. Roku platform engagement continues to strengthen as more content shifts to streaming and more consumers cut the cord. ROKU predicts that by 2024 roughly half of all U.S. TV households will have cut the cord.ARPU remains above $20. The company indicates that, in the medium term, the most significant factor driving Roku's financial performance will be increasing monetization of its growing installed base. The ROKU Channel launched in 2017 as a free, ad-supported channel has expanded to include premium content subscription. On the monetization front, the average revenue per user (ARPU) increased by 28% YOY to $24.35 versus $19.06 in Q1:19.Gross profit up 44% YOY. Total gross profit was $141.1 million in Q1:20, up 40% YOY, marking the sixth consecutive quarter above $100 million. Platform gross profit increased 39% YOY, and Player gross profit increased 48% YOY. Overall, gross margin was 44.0% for Q1:20, down ~483 bps YOY.Adjusted EBITDA loss at ~$16.3 million was ahead of management's outlook due to a slower-than-expected increase in operating expenses. Q1:20 OPEX was $196 million, up 76% year over year.COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating the shift to streaming. ROKU management highlighted a few data points so far in Q2:20, which suggests rapid adoption of streaming. Active accounts grew roughly 38% year over year in April 2020. Also, streaming hours grew ~80% YOY in April 2020, driven by an increase in streaming hours per account of roughly 30%. ROKU's ad business has been impacted with cancellation levels most pronounced in late March 2020 but have since decreased in early to mid-April. The ad business will continue to grow substantially on a year-over-year basis, but at a slower pace and lower gross profit than originally expected for the year.Given the uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, management withdrew their outlook for the full year 2020. Management did note that they expect an adjusted EBITDA loss for FY 2020. Long term, management noted that the current crisis could further accelerate the adoption of streaming.Earnings EstimatesFor 2020, we forecast revenue growth of ~34.8%, resulting in $1,522 million of revenue. We model a gross profit of $647 million (or margin of 42.5%). GAAP operating expense is forecasted at ~$839 million. We model stock-based compensation of ~$127 million and an estimated $30.2 million of D&A. As such, we forecast an Adjusted EBITDA loss of ~$33.8 million for 2020. This forecast is in line with management's focus on higher investments in 2020, which is likely to put pressure on adjusted EBITDA and EPS.Valuation and RecommendationWe value ROKU using a P/S multiple since the company does not earn a profit. Given the shift in management's focus away from hardware to software & services, we believe that Roku should be valued more like an internet software and services provider than a maker of a consumer device.We believe ROKU should trade at a premium to the higher end of the peer group range given a ~33% smart TV market share, expanding user engagement metrics, and high revenue growth. We value Roku at a 10x P/S multiple. We apply this multiple to our 2021 forecast, and then discount that target back our computed cost of capital. The multiple-based target price after discounting back to the present comes to $147.29, which we round down to $147.25.The exhibit below summarizes our peer group multiples.The Exhibit below shows stock price targets using various combinations of sales and P/S multiples. Our sales per share estimate for 2020 and 2021 is $12.6 and $16.2.

Shares of the streaming leader are down by more than 40% from their highs of the past year, accumulating a 22% decline year to date.Data by YChartsAdvertising demand is quite cyclical and vulnerable during a recession, and this is being reflected in the company's numbers. Besides, the recent appearance of Android-powered TCL smart TVs in the U.S. is creating additional uncertainty around Roku stock.But the big picture still looks quite solid over the long term. Investors in Roku need to be willing to tolerate substantial uncertainty and price volatility going forward, but the risk and reward trade-off looks clearly attractive at current prices.Roku reported healthy growth metrics for the first quarter of 2020. However, the decline in advertising demand during the recession is having a negative impact on profitability levels.Source: SEC FilingsUser growth and engagement remain stronger than ever. Roku added 2.9 million active users during the quarter, ending the period with 39.8 million active accounts. Roku users streamed 13.2 billion hours in the period, an increase of 49% year over year, and sales of player units grew 25%. The average revenue per user, or ARPU, reached $24.35 on a trailing 12-month basis, increasing 28% year over year.The company is feeling the impact of the recession due to weaker advertising demand, which is hurting profit margins. However, tighter advertising budgets also mean that advertisers are increasingly focused on maximizing effectiveness and measurability, which favors programmatic advertising in general and Roku in particular over the traditional linear TV advertising industry.In the words of founder and CEO Anthony Wood:Even while expecting a decline in total U.S. advertising expenditures in 2020, management considers that Roku will still be able to deliver substantial revenue growth during the year, albeit at a slower pace and generating a lower gross profit than originally expected before the recession.The key point to consider is that the negative impact of the recession - declining advertising spend - is temporary in nature. On the other hand, Roku is still benefitting from major tailwinds, such as growing streaming demand and superior effectiveness from programmatic advertising in comparison to linear advertising venues.An additional reason for concern among investors in Roku is that TCL has recently started selling Android-powered smart televisions in America. However, management clarified at the Bank of America Global Technology Conference 2020 that Roku's relationship with TCL remains as strong as ever and that the company keeps working on multiple new products with TCL.A recent note from Rosenblatt provides further support to the idea that this is not much of an issue, since Roku still has nearly three times the market share of Android, and Roku also comes well ahead of Android when it comes to value and functionality.The area around $100 per share has worked as support on multiple occasions over the past two years. If past history is any valid guide for the future, it would be no surprise to see buyers stepping in as the stock approaches $100 again.Source: TOSIn terms of valuation, the stock is fairly reasonably priced considering the company's long-term growth prospects. The table below shows revenue forecasts and the price-to-sales ratio implied by those forecasts in the years ahead. Roku is trading at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 6.3, which is hardly excessive for a company that can sustain revenue growth rates well above 30% over the middle term.Source: Seeking AlphaProfit margins will be affected by weak advertising demand during the recession, but the business model allows for attractive profitability at the fundamental level, and it makes sense to expect Roku to deliver expanding margin in the years ahead if management executes well.The online streaming revolution is here to stay, and it will only get stronger going forward. Favorable demographic trends are a major tailwind for streaming, and Roku leads the industry by a wide margin. Besides, the company is barely giving the first steps in international expansion, so Roku still benefits from an enormous room for growth.Source: Strategy AnalyticsIn simple terms, shares of Roku have been hurt by the recession and by excessive negativity from investors regarding the news from TCL. But the market is usually too short-sighted, and it can be easy to miss the forest for the trees when you pay too much attention to the recent developments.Recessions will come and go, and buying a fundamentally sound business during a period of transitory weakness can be a good strategy for superior returns. Competitive risk is a major factor to watch, but it is not a reason to stay away from Roku at this stage. The company is still the undisputed market leader, and the size of the opportunity should be large enough for Roku and other players to perform well over the long term.The industry is rapidly evolving, so a position in Roku carries significant risks, no doubt about that. However, smart investing is not about avoiding all risks, but rather about assuming the risks that are well-compensated when considering both the probability of success and the potential payoff versus the downside risk. At these prices, there is a good probability that investors in Roku will be well-rewarded with strong returns going forward."

That being said, the value proposition for ROKU services will translate to growth, and eventually operating leverage.ROKU is a unique growth story, one that will take time to play out, and needs to see profitability down the road. That being said, I like the fundamentals here.Rating initiated at HOLD. PT set at $135.","Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is one of my more recent purchases. I got in Roku after they pre-announced, and bought in at ~$105. At the time, I had no intention on initiating a full position. That being said, I like the Roku story at this price, and I like the valuation going forward. People, myself included, have misunderstood the Roku story for a while. Roku is not a hardware company. Roku brings in the user with a small and simple Roku box that allows for the streaming of different content on the platform. Once you are on the platform, you are locked into the ecosystem and this is where Roku begins to make money on off of advertising. At the time of the IPO, Roku's advertising business was a much smaller factor in the expansion of the overall business. At the time, hardware sales were the lead generator of business for Roku. This was management's way of bringing consumers into the Roku ecosystem. Once customers began consuming the content Roku aggregates, they became increasingly locked in on the Roku Platform. As of Q4, 63% of total revenue from Roku comes from the platform itself (i.e. CTV advertising and revenue-share). This is much more recurring, faster-growing, and higher margin revenue than the sale of hardware products.As Roku has transitioned to generating the majority of its business from advertising and platform-based revenue, the company has seen a degradation in margins, particularly in the sale of hardware products. While margins were already pretty slim on the hardware business, margins are basically zero now. Roku is likely keeping margins at zero to cut prices on their players. By cutting prices, they will entice consumers to buy Roku systems. This locks more consumers into the Roku ecosystem, thus bolstering Roku's platform revenue. So, long-term, I would expect margins on the hardware side to be flat to slightly negative (low single digits on the negative side) as Roku attempts to drive more consumers to the platform. In addition, hardware revenue will likely correlate almost directly with the addition of new accounts to the platform.As Roku transitions towards a more recurring-revenue, higher margin software oriented platform business, I believe growth trends will continue to improve. Roku is working extensively on eliminating the complexity of purchasing advertisements by beginning to navigate to a self-serve based ecosystem. The linear TV advertising market is valued at $70 billion. As the cord-cutting trend continues to accelerate and platforms like Roku begin to pick up steam, the overall growth of the market will lift Roku's business. People need to understand, Roku will see the benefits of advertisers progressing away from the older, lower ROI, less targeted linear TV advertisements and toward targeted CTV advertising. This overall growth backdrop combined with the fact that Roku has the most market share in programmatic advertising means the Roku growth story should have enough fuel for years to come. And this is reflected in sell-side growth expectations.(source: SA)Consensus expectations are for continued growth in the 30% area for years to come. And the overall advertising backdrop, and Roku's unique positioning within it makes continued growth extremely likely. Combine this with Roku's licensing deals with TV manufacturers, and it is likely that the expansion of the Roku brand and general revenue growth will continue for years to come.Considering the fact that the addressable market for Roku to attack is so large, Roku has plenty of long-term tailwinds going its way to bolster growth over the years to come.The only real thing I find troublesome about Roku is the company's contracting margin profile and how that impacts their path to profitability. As of right now, the company continues to bleed cash and is unprofitable, so I can only put a valuation on Roku on a revenue basis. From 2018 to 2019, overall gross margins contracted on both the player and platform side. Gross margins contracting on the player side is fine, as they are using the hardware to lure consumers into the ecosystem. The more worrisome trend is that we are seeing a similar contraction on the software side.(source: Roku)As competition in the CTV ad space continues to grow, I would not be surprised to see a continued contraction in Roku's platform gross margin. Right now, operating expenses are trending in the opposite direction, with robust growth working against Roku's ability to generate operating leverage. All things considered, if Roku continues to invest in growth, which they likely will, operating leverage will likely be negatively impacted. So, profitability is likely on the horizon for now as Roku focuses on growing the top line.Now, on to the trickiest part of being bullish on Roku: the valuation. As I mentioned earlier, Roku is not profitable. So, I will not be putting a price target on the stock based off of earnings. Rather, my price target is based on revenues. Considering that the market is basically writing off 2020 because of the draconian impact the coronavirus will have on first half numbers, my valuation is based on my 2021 estimates. For 2021, I am going to stick with the consensus revenue estimate of $2.04 billion. Considering the fact that 2022 should be a 30%+ growth year, followed by 20%+ growth years in the future, I believe Roku should command a solid growth multiple. I am going to go with a 9X revenue multiple to reflect the growth premium this company should get. On 9X $2.04 billion in revenue, my exit '21 valuation is $18.36 billion, $153/share. That being said, I am going to discount this back 12% to exit '20. My year-end price target is then ~$135. The stock is at $130 right now, so despite my fundamental optimism, the upside profile just isn't there right now.Roku is a well-positioned growth story that is beginning to make the jump to profitability. While margins on the platform and hardware side are both contracting, revenue growth will drive the valuation. As of right now, Roku shares are slightly undervalued, but there isn't enough upside in the stock for me to move to a buy rating. That being said, I am long the stock at ~$105.TIPRANKS: HOLD"

In light of these sizable gains, Roku has seen five significant drawdowns ranging between 41% to 67%. Therefore, when considering if Roku will go boom or bust this year, I believe it will do both.When I first began bullish coverage on Roku at $30, the company had a misunderstood business model. At the time, I pointed out that Roku was an ad platform first and a hardware player second. At the time, the market was backward-looking as Roku’s device sales made up 59% of total revenue in the six months leading up to its public offering.Through 2019, its device sales made up only 34% of its revenue, while the remaining majority came from its platform. What investors initially failed to realize was that the hardware player was a means to its high-yielding ad platform. Roku has an added advantage from the data it has on consumers due to owning the hardware and the many content apps that need access to an OTT device.With this history, my guess is investors will get Roku’s story wrong again this year as the company must choose between its top line and bottom line. COVID-19 offers an important opportunity for Roku as OTT usage is skyrocketing and the company must expand globally for long-term growth. (I’ve covered extensively why the domestic market is no longer pertinent in my Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) coverage).Often times, growth and earnings are at odds with one another as revenue requires sales and marketing (or other investments), which ultimately eat at the bottom line. Or, in Netflix’s case, revenue growth and free cash flow are at odds. Conceptually, most investors know there is a cost to hyper-growth, but in practice, it’s hard to see one of your portfolio companies miss those magical analyst estimates.Despite monetizing through ads rather than subscriptions, Roku’s best role model for becoming a global media company is Netflix. What Netflix has done beautifully is ignore the pressures that comes with being a public company in favor of being a hyper-growth company. This included taking on debt and other risks to gain ground. While I’m not suggesting Roku should take on the debt levels that Netflix has, it wouldn’t hurt for Roku to do whatever it takes to solidify itself as the leading global AVOD channel and ad platform this year.Roku predicts that by 2024, roughly half of all U.S. TV households will have cut the cord or never had traditional pay-TV.Earlier this year, Roku began its expansion into emerging markets by entering Brazil. Strategically, Roku has partnered with the electronics company AOC to launch AOC Roku TV. The AOC TV/Roku platform will feature popular local content from Globoplay. With over 5,000 channels and over 1,000 free channels, Roku should do well in emerging markets. (I’ve also covered this in detail in a previous analysis.)Furthermore, Roku has announced fifteen TV brands that come integrated with the Roku platform models. These models are available not only in the U.S., but also in the UK, Canada, and Mexico as of 2020. This kind of strategic partnership with TV models will help the company scale globally, which is a critical next step for Roku.Roku recently stated that its commission revenue is  expected to jump as viewing hours have increased due to COVID-19. However, it will still feel the shock of ad demand drying up.Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein cut the price target from $165 to $110. He forecasts Q2 ad platform growth to be around 18% YoY from the previous estimate of 62% growth. With that said, AVOD views are expected to grow 50% and streaming hours increase by 22%.Needham forecast one or two more quarters of ad weakness, with ad growth uncertain in 2021. Analyst Laura Martin, who has a strong track record on this stock, said Roku may be able to withstand the storm with its unique model. “A key thing that differentiates Roku in this environment is that it doesn't set its ad-prices at auction,” Martin said in a Tuesday note. “It uses a direct sales force to set negotiated prices, just like traditional linear-TV. We believe that, even though ad-demand has been falling, Roku is still charging $30 + CPMs, and instead, is cutting the number of ads it runs per hour.”Any weakness in Roku’s price will likely be temporary, considering its financials and positioning. Although you could argue this is the case for many advertising companies, connected TV ads are in a growth trend while mobile is reaching saturation.Unlike many ad-tech peers, Roku is well-diversified. According to emarketer, Roku collects $1 million for letting a service like Disney+ (NYSE:DIS) take over the Roku home screen. Other companies like Netflix pay $1 for every Roku sold with a Netflix quick-launch button on them.For every new market Roku expands into and every unit sold, these numbers will only increase with Roku’s brand and helps diversify the company from varying levels of ad demand.The company released a preview of Q1 results on April 13, 2020 and reported revenue in the range of $307 to $317 million. This suggests a growth of 51% YoY.For Roku, it matches the same growth we saw in Q1 of 2019, which shows the continued demand in this growing space. Roku estimates 39.8 million active users as of March 31, 2020, which is a net increase of 3 million since December 31, 2019.It estimates streaming hours of 13.2 billion, which is a 49% YoY increase.Gross profits were in the range of $139 to $144 million, which suggests a growth of 40% YoY, while net losses were in the range of $60-$55 million, compared to a net loss of $9.7 million for the same period last year.As Roku scales internationally, profitable earnings are not expected within the next year. This is the part that Wall Street can often be uncomfortable with; however, it should be factored in that Roku’s revenue growth is solid. As stated above, it has little competition in the niche area of OTT and it dominates with manageable debt.Knox RidleyRoku has moved in a clear uptrend off the March lows. It recently hit a wall of resistance, which includes a key level around $125-$120, the 200-Day SMA, as well as a downward sloping trend line from its recent peaks.With low participation at current prices, as exhibited in the volume, it will need to find more buyers to break through this region. The MACD shows weakening momentum on the daily chart and the RSI shows that its uptrend has broken, as well. We can expect a pullback in Roku in the coming days/weeks.The key support level to watch is the $102-$86 region. If this zone is broken, we can expect a retest of the recent lows. However, if it holds, we expect new highs for Roku in the coming months."
4338618,103480,2020-04-20T16:05:17-04:00,"Roku is one of the expected beneficiaries from a pickup in streaming hours, with shares roughly flat for the year versus a ~12% decline in the S&P 500.
        The company has done a good job diversifying away from lower-margin hardware into platform ad sales over the past year, but now that revenue stream is under pressure.
        Ad budgets are expected to decline through the remainder of this year as companies strive to conserve cash; macro headwinds could derail ad spending into 2021 as well.
        The stock is currently trading at ~10x forward revenues and pricing in a good deal of optimism amid unprecedented uncertainty.","Streaming companies are having a heyday right now. With most of the U.S. and many other countries across the globe still on lockdown, many consumers are stuck at home without much to do other than to stream shows on television. Analysts are predicting the coronavirus to accelerate the process of cord-cutting, with many people that are either new to streaming or underutilizing streaming services pushing viewership hours up to record highs.Roku (ROKU) is expected to be one of the big beneficiaries of this shift toward streaming. With its lower-end hardware devices pricing in the ~$30 range, Roku is often described as one of the entry-level, introductory products into the streaming world, and a recent Roku update tells us that the company added 3 million new active accounts in the fiscal first quarter ending in March, bringing total active accounts to roughly about 40 million (for reference, that's about on par with 50 million subscribers at Disney+, and about one-quarter of Netflix's ~167 million subscribers - though the services aren't exactly an apples-to-apples comparison as Roku is an operating system that opens the doorway to these streaming offerings).Owing to enthusiasm over the surge in streaming, investors have flocked to Roku as a virus-shelter stock this year, with shares roughly flat versus double-digit declines in the S&P 500 and the Dow.Investors should be careful with such a propped-up stock, however. There's no doubt that Roku will enjoy a surge in streaming hours and new account ads from the present lockdown situation - but how will that translate into revenue growth and profitability? I see three primary concerns with investing in Roku at current share prices:No doubt that this company has a bright future with the accelerating trends toward cord-cutting and streaming, especially with Roku's entry-level pricing. But there will be an opportunity to buy into this stock at a lower price, after the market has fully digested the negative impacts of ad slowdowns and Roku's expected profitability hits.There's been a particular optimism among tech stocks, especially internet names, that are expected to see revenues lift (or at least, remain insulated) as a result of the stay-at-home orders. But whereas we can see that Amazon.com's (AMZN) retail arm is lifting because people are taking their shopping online, we don't know the net impacts to Roku yet.Prior to the start of this year, Roku had been on a strong growth binge. Over the past year, Roku has grown its active accounts by nearly 40%. Selling hardware at low prices (essentially, at cost) has been Roku's main strategy over the past year, and it's paid off via a substantial increase in accounts, streaming hours, and ad dollars - which has yielded higher ARPU (average revenue per user).Figure 1. Roku user trendsSource: Roku Q4 earnings releaseThis has tilted Roku's revenue base in favor of its platform (advertising) revenues, which has long been the key piece of the bullish thesis in the stock. Eventually, Roku would lose its dependence on its zero-margin hardware products and build a profitable business on its ~70% gross margin platform. As of the end of the fourth quarter, Roku's platform revenues has tilted to 63% of its total revenue base - up from 55% in the prior year.Figure 2. Roku revenue trendsSource: Roku Q4 earnings releaseThis means, however, that Roku's revenue stream is now more exposed to the expected volatility in advertising. Ahead of its Q1 earnings release, Roku has pre-announced expected results, offering us a glimpse at how the coronavirus will impact Roku's business (at least for the March slice of that quarter in which the lockdowns were in place).As previously mentioned, Roku is expecting to grow its active accounts by ~3 million to 39.8 million total accounts, while streaming hours will grow by 49% y/y. Net revenues will be in the range of $307-$317 million, representing a growth range of 49-52% y/y - roughly in-line with Roku's growth rate in Q4.Figure 3. Roku Q1 pre-releaseSource: Roku guidance updateBut alongside this guidance update, Roku also pulled its guidance for the full year, which had originally called for 43% y/y growth and breakeven EBITDA. The key message here: we don't know how the weakness in ad pricing will translate to full-year revenues. And because about two-thirds of Roku's revenue now comes from its platform, expected ad volatility will have a bigger impact on its overall business.Figure 4. Roku original FY20 guidanceSource: Roku Q4 earnings releaseMany industry analysts and observers expect ad revenues at internet giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (GOOG) to decline by roughly 20%. Another ad industry publication notes that pricing on YouTube ad inventory has fallen between 20 and 30%. Roku will essentially face the same problem that companies like Facebook and Zoom (ZM) have this year: a surge in revenue won't necessarily accompany a surge in usage.In 2019, Roku's platform revenue growth more or less fell in-line with streaming hours growth. Fourth-quarter streaming hours grew 60% y/y, versus 71% y/y growth in platform revenues. If Roku's baseline streaming hours growth is now around 50% y/y, but video ad pricing has fallen by roughly 25%, then we should expect Roku's platform revenue growth to be somewhere around 40% y/y. Considering platform revenue contributes two-thirds of Roku's overall revenue base, with the remaining hardware piece growing at ~20%, we shouldn't be surprised if Roku substantially misses its original overall revenue guidance of 43% y/y, instead of beating it as some investors are hoping. Let's now turn to another concern for Roku: the company's path to profitability still isn't clear. Now, in Roku's original outlook for 2020, it was hoping for Adjusted EBITDA of -$10 million to positive $10 million, which is essentially breakeven. That, however, represented a downward trajectory from the company's FY19 adjusted EBITD of $35.8 million, which clocked in at an EBITDA margin of 3.2%. Figure 5. Roku FY19 Adjusted EBITDA trendsSource: Roku Q4 earnings releaseNow that Roku has yanked its outlook for the year and will face unprecedented weakness in ad pricing, it's highly likely that the company's expected EBITDA margin deterioration will exceed the 320bps loss that its original forecast provided for. GAAP profit metrics are an even farther way off. Roku's GAAP net losses swelled from -$8.9 million in FY18 to -$59.9 billion in FY19; earnings per share went from -$0.08 in FY18 to a staggering -$0.52 in FY19. Given investors' preference for safe and profitable stocks amid a near-term recession, this continual slide in profitable may deflate some of the enthusiasm in Roku stock.Roku's cash burn isn't egregious, but it's still FCF-negative. Roku generated $13.7 million in operating cash flows in FY19, but that was offset by $77.2 million in capex spend, totaling -$63.5 million in FY19 free cash flow. Figure 6. Roku cash flowsSource: Roku Q4 earnings releaseThe good news is that Roku has a well-funded balance sheet to absorb the prospect of deeper losses in FY20. Roku has $515.5 million of cash on its balance sheet as of the end of Q4, against relatively minor $99.6 million in debt. The strength of Roku's balance sheet should give investors some comfort in the company's ability to navigate through the crisis, but won't fully offset disappointment from declining margins. Figure 7. Roku balance sheetSource: Roku Q4 earnings releaseGiven all the red flags emerging for Roku - from revenue deceleration from weaker ad pricing, to expected margin deterioration - does the stock price in too much optimism?At present share prices near $133, Roku has a market cap of $15.85 billion. After netting out the $515.5 million of cash and $99.6 million of debt on Roku's balance sheet, the company is left with an enterprise value of $15.43 billion.Even if we assume Roku can hit its original revenue forecast of $1.58-$1.62 billion (which is unlikely given the shift in ad prices), the stock would trade at a valuation multiple of 9.6x EV/FY20 revenues. For a company with one-third of its revenue dedicated to zero-margin hardware, and with overall gross margins of roughly 44%, this is heady. The bottom line on Roku: there's no doubt that Roku continues to pick up a sizable share of the streaming space, and its focus on its advertising platform will eventually help the company transform into a high-margin, profitable enterprise. But Roku's strong stock performance this year relative to the broader markets has largely been based off the expectation of a revenue surge to accompany the rise in streaming hours, as evidenced by its robust ~10x forward revenue multiple. Roku may end up disappointing investors this year as it trips up over its estimates, and especially if profitability continues to bleed. Stay on the sidelines here until Roku is trading at a better price."
4335731,103647,2020-04-03T09:15:10-04:00,"Roku's streaming hours will benefit from coronavirus impact.
        Long term growth drivers intact despite short term uncertainty around revenue from ads.
        Stock is down over 50% from 2019 highs, making the valuation compelling.","At a time when many businesses (and stocks) are getting decimated from the impact of COVID-19, there are some that are surviving, and indeed thriving. Most of the businesses doing well in these uncertain times are in some way related to the fact that a lot of us are confined in our homes.According to Nielsen, Americans staying home are spending a lot more time watching TV, and specifically, streaming; in the first three weeks of March, Neilsen estimates that the total number of minutes streamed to TV increased 85% year over year to 400 billion. Not only that, video streaming services are stealing share from linear TV; Nielsen found that for the week of March 16, streaming accounted for 23% of all TV viewing, compared with 16% during the same week last year.The first stock that comes to mind when you think of streaming is obviously Netflix (NFLX). However, Roku (ROKU) is also a pure-play streaming company that should benefit from this trend.Roku’s business model is simple: To acquire users on to its streaming platform, Roku sells stand-alone streaming players. The revenue it makes selling these falls under its “Player Revenue” Segment. Roku says that it does not aim to make money selling players; so the gross margin on this segment is deliberately kept low to acquire the maximum number of users.Roku also licenses its OS to TV brands to sell co-branded Roku TVs as a means to acquire users. In 2019, nearly one in three smart TVs sold in the U.S. were Roku TVs, which means that this is a significant source of user acquisition for the company.Roku then monetizes these users, or “active accounts”, by selling digital ads on its own channel (The Roku Channel) as well as on other AVOD channels on its platform. The company also gets a cut of the revenue from content distributors if users subscribe to a streaming service, or purchase a movie through its platform. This “Platform Revenue” had a gross margin of 65% in 2019, and is the main focus for the company.The key drivers of Roku’s platform revenue include:I will now discuss the trends in each of these key metrics.Active AccountsIncreasing active accounts is the primary driver for Roku’s business growth. A large base of active accounts increases Roku’s leverage with content publishers as well as advertisers. You can see in the chart above that the year over year growth in active accounts has been decreasing, which is to be expected given that the growth is coming from an increasingly large base.According to Strategy Analytics, Roku players and TVs accounted for over 15% of all streaming devices in the US in 1Q19, establishing Roku as the market leader with a 36% lead over the next TV streaming platform, Sony Playstation. With its best-in-class and easy to use product, I expect Roku to continue to gain share in the rapidly growing streaming devices market in the U.S., and with the international market still largely untapped, I expect active accounts to continue to grow at a healthy rate in the coming quarters.Streaming HoursAn increase in the number of hours streamed on the Roku platform leads to increased ad inventory, and increase in revenue share from subscription and transaction video on demand. Thus streaming hours growth is key to Roku’s platform revenue growth.Growth in hours streamed on Roku devices depends on the increase in the number of active accounts, as well as on those active accounts streaming more content. The chart above shows that streaming hours growth has been falling for the past three quarters. In its 4Q19 shareholder letter, management attributed part of this fall to the rollout of the “Are you still watching” feature, which prompts users to confirm they are watching after a period of inactivity. Roku started rolling out this feature in 3Q19 to make this metric more reliable, and expects growth in this metric to continue to decline in the coming quarters as a result.However, this is also the metric that should benefit most from the coronavirus impact as users confined at their homes stream for longer hours. Recognizing this opportunity, Roku recently announced its Home Together initiative which offers users free 30-day access to a collection of over 20 premium channels through extended trials from within The Roku Channel.Growth in streaming hours is a metric that I will track closely in the coming quarters to understand the magnitude of the positive impact on Roku, and whether the growth continues to keep pace once the virus subsides.ARPUThe bull case on Roku revolves around the company’s ability to consistently increase its ARPU over time as advertisers leverage its user data and insights to improve ad targeting, allowing Roku to command higher advertising rates from a larger number of advertisers. You can see in the chart above that ARPU growth has stabilized between 25-30% for the past five quarters.In 2019, Roku once again doubled its total ad impressions after doubling them in 2018, which shows that the company’s ad impression growth is outpacing growth in streamed hours and bodes well for ARPU growth.Roku recently completed the acquisition of video advertising platform dataxu, which will help advertisers plan, buy and optimize their video ad campaigns that run on Roku’s platform with a data-driven approach. The addition of dataxu to Roku’s suite of advertising tools will help the company continue to increase its ARPU.According to Magna Global, OTT accounts for 29% of TV viewing but has captured just 3% of TV ad spend, which implies that there is lots of room for OTT streaming companies like Roku to increase user monetisation.ARPU growth is also a metric that is likely to be negatively affected by the coronavirus impact. With large parts of the economy shut down, advertisers are cutting down their ad budgets. According to IAB, while ad buyers report that they are reducing ad spend, 35% of advertisers are increasing OTT/Connected TV device targeting, which should mitigate some of the negative impact on Roku.I believe that as advertisers shift ad spend to OTT due to coronavirus impact and see better results from more accurate ad targeting, they would be more comfortable allocating a larger proportion of their budgets to OTT even when the virus subsides, thus accelerating the trend of increased ad budget allocation to OTT TV.ValuationFor the purpose of valuation, I like to compare Roku to Netflix, as both companies benefit from similar secular trends and have relatively similar gross margins.The chart below shows the EV/Forward Revenue multiple for both Roku and Netflix.Note that Roku traded a premium to Netflix for much of 2019; at its peak in September 2019, Roku was valued at a multiple more than twice that of Netflix. Since then, Roku stock is down more than 50%, and its EV/2020 Revenue multiple is now lower than that of Netflix.With Netflix now at a relatively mature phase in its growth, I believe that Roku still has lots more room to grow, both in the US, and internationally. A higher growth potential implies that Roku should trade at a premium to Netflix on EV/Forward Revenue basis.At the same time, Roku has more uncertainty built into business as compared to Netflix- in these uncertain times, Netflix’s subscription-based business model should hold up better than Roku’s ad-supported model. In addition, Roku’s international expansion plans also carry significant execution risk. Thus the valuation premium justified by a higher growth potential needs to be weighed against these additional risks.Although Roku faces some headwinds from coronavirus in terms of uncertainty around ad sales, I believe that the long term growth drivers for the company remain intact: cord-cutting will continue, and may even accelerate due to the impact from coronavirus; as the connected TV market grows, the discrepancy between OTT TV viewing and ad spend would continue to narrow; Roku’s strategy of partnering with TV manufacturers to acquire users would help maintain its market leader status; and the international market represents a huge opportunity for the company that remains largely untapped.In my view, over these past years, Roku management has shown that they can execute well, and with Roku’s EV/Forward Revenue multiple lower than or similar to that of Netflix, I believe that Roku is undervalued.When Roku reports its 1Q20 results, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a jump in sentiment around this stock if streamed hours show strong growth due to the coronavirus impact, and the hit to platform revenue is not as bad with advertisers shifting ad spend from traditional to OTT TV. With its long term growth potential intact, I would recommend buying the dip in Roku driven by the coronavirus uncertainty."
4338031,24960,2020-04-16T13:58:43-04:00,"Roku has been growing rapidly, in both active accounts and streaming hours.The operating loss expansion in the past several years is not a concern, due to its low additional capital employed compared to the additional revenue and profit it has generated.It is not a bargain anymore, we think it is worth $113 per share.","Roku (ROKU) has surged more than 11% after giving out brief updates on the impressive growth in streaming hours and active accounts in the first quarter of 2020. The stock has bounced back close to the level at the beginning of March. With the consistent growing operating performance and its market-leading position, Roku is a good stock for long-term growth investors. However, we think at the moment Roku is not a bargain anymore, so it is better to wait for the lower price.What we like about Roku is the consistently high growth in monthly active accounts, streaming hours and average revenue per user (ARPU). Its active account number has increased from 19.3 million in 2017 to 36.9 million in 2019, while the total streaming hours has risen from 14.8 billion hours to 40.3 billion during the same period. Its ARPU also experienced spectacular growth of more than 68%, from $13.78 to $23.14.As many people are staying at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, this streaming media company has seen significant growth in user base and streaming hours. In the first quarter of 2020, Roku estimated to gain 3 million active accounts, while the streaming hours would reach 13.2 billion, a dramatic year-over-year increase of 49%. Along with the growth momentum in the user base and streaming hours, its revenue was expected to be higher than prior analysts' outlook, staying in the range of $307 million - $317 million. If its first-quarter 2020 revenue is $310 million, its quarterly year-over-year growth would be 50%.In the past five years, Roku has been the leading streaming media player in the U.S. In the first quarter of 2019, Roku’s market share was 39%. Amazon (AMZN) Fire TV ranked second, with a 30% market share. As a result, the two companies had nearly 70% of the total installed base of streaming media players in the U.S.Source: Parks AssociatesWith the huge ecosystem and large user base, Amazon Fire TV is Roku’s fierce competitor. In January 2020, Amazon announced that it had more than 40 million users, beating the number of Roku’s active accounts. Although Roku had overall better reviewed than Amazon Fire TV Stick because of the lower price, better app selection, and more intuitive interface, Roku needs to consistently improve product technologies and expand product offerings to beat Amazon, regaining the market-leading position.Many investors worry about the company’s operating losses which has kept expanding over the years. Since 2017, its operating losses have gone up from $19.6 million to more than $65 million. However, if we compared its additional tangible capital employed, its additional revenue and the gross profit it has generated, we think Roku has done a pretty good job.Source: Author’s tableFrom 2017 to 2019, to grow its revenue by $616.1 million, Roku has employed additional capital of only $166.8 million. The additional gross profit generated was $295.4 million while the operating losses increased by only a small amount at $45.4 million. The expansion of operating losses resulted from triple-digit growth in all of its operating expenses in the same period.Source: Author’s table Commonly, the company has to ramp up investments in R&D and Sales & Marketing in the period of high growth. In the next several years, we expect the growth of these expenses will decelerate so that Roku can deliver operating profitability. Furthermore, many of its expenses are non-cash, including stock-based compensation expenses and depreciation and amortization. As a consequence, while Roku has had operating losses, the company has delivered positive operating cashflows.Source: Roku’s 10-K filingWe expect Roku will keep producing positive operating cashflow in the future. The stock-based compensation, an actual non-cash expense, which is necessarily used for management’s and employee’s incentives to drive the company’s growth in the future.After the recent bounce back, we think Roku is no longer cheap. It is more expensive than Netflix at the time of writing. Although Netflix has a much larger user base, having 167.1 million subscribers globally and 1 billion watched hours per week, it’s valued relatively cheaper than Roku. Netflix’s current price-to-sales ratio is only 9.2x while Roku’s P/S ratio is already 10.9x at the time of writing.Source: YchartsWe expect at least Roku can meet the expectation of $1.54 billion in revenue in 2020. If Roku has similar sales multiple to Netflix’s 5-year average at 8x, Roku can be worth $12.32 billion, or $113 per share."

Roku and Connected TV stand to potentially capture ad spending from this dislocation.Buy Roku at an NTM EV/Sales of 10.2x for its long-term market potential. It is still undervalued despite the rally.","Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) makes for a solid growth pick based on its long-term potential. With a rapidly growing total addressable market, even faster top-line growth, and an excellent management team, there's further upside at a Fwd EV/Sales of 10.2x. The company's growth runway is extremely long and Connected TV Advertising offers immense potential, with programmatic advertising trends to help. This article is focused on discussing the pandemic-related structural shifts in the television advertising landscape and how they might influence Roku's growth trajectory.Image Source: Q4 2019 Shareholder LetterRoku's April 13th Press Release provided a reason for optimism, as the company guided higher revenues for Q1 and in-line profitability margins. Management remarked on the acceleration in user account growth and streaming hours on their platform which they experienced in the two weeks leading up to March 31st.We know that cord-cutting is an inevitable trend, and we have established that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and streaming services have enjoyed a boost out of this environment. I believe that users of traditional broadcast/cable television will conclude that they don't need to pay over a $100 a month for their Cable TV subscription, especially with the lack of live sports content on it. The current situation will continue to meaningfully accelerate cord-cutting, not just the adoption of streaming.User engagement, accounts, and streaming hours are however one side of the coin when considering the top-line impact for Roku. The other side is whether advertisers will spend more or less than expected through their platform. The prevailing forces in the economy point to businesses cutting ad budgets significantly. To evaluate the impact on Roku, one needs to investigate the TV advertising inventory available and the transition from linear/broadcast to Connected TV advertising. I attempt to do this and draw inferences in the coming sections after positing some broad hypotheticals given the uncertainty.Source: E-Marketer (TV Ad Spending in the US) (US Connected TV Ad Spending)Pre-pandemic forecasts from E-marketer estimated the total ad spend opportunity in the US at $72B and Connected TV Ad Spend at a rapidly compounding $8.88B for FY 2020.Let us focus on the larger of the two markets. If $72B was the estimated spend in 2020, let's assume that advertisers would have allocated capital efficiently and there was $72B in intrinsic value in the advertising inventory for the year from broadcast and cable. Now with the current situation, what value does the same market represent?This is where I think the consideration of sports advertising becomes a huge factor. Sports accounts for roughly a third of total television advertising spend in the United States. In a non-pandemic scenario, that would have accounted for $24B of the $72B over a full year. It is hard to imagine that the now sports-culled inventory is offering the same intrinsic value to TV-advertisers. Imagine all those AT&T, Verizon, Autos, and Food and Beer commercials that amassed viewer engagement during the commercial breaks at NFL halftimes because you could not wait to see what happens in the game. All sports have come to a unanimous halt. My guess is it will at least take a few months for them to return after a definitive recovery is underway. This quality entertainment has been replaced with re-runs and content that is spread too thin. We might add a discount to the $72B of 25% and put it at $54B, which isn't as far-fetched an assumption. For a two-quarter period, which is the current likelihood, that's $27B down from $36B.While it is broadly understood that the overall demand for TV ad inventory has reduced as budgets are slashed, so has the supply (and such the value) of ad inventory available. This should leave businesses with otherwise predetermined TV ad budgets (or even drastically reduced budgets) to be searching for the right deployment for maximum impact.This is where Connected TV appears to be shining brighter than ever, offering more value to be unlocked with efficiency through programmatic tech and granular user data to be exploited. For the companies that typically advertise on regular television, and still have ad budgets, there are alternative means to invest in for ad campaigns. Do those otherwise sports commercial budgets go to Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) or Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), or do they even just try Roku? Surely, CTV is the closest thing to pushing television designed ads on the bigger screen for home viewers. If billions in broadcasting/cable advertising inventory value have been evaporated and billions in ad budgets have been cut, it only takes a small fraction of the traditional TV ad budget to move towards CTV to have an outsized effect on the overall CTV market. What we essentially have is a reduction in the quality of broadcast/cable TV inventory and an increase in the quality of connected TV inventory due to the pandemic. This should add fuel to CTV Ad Adoption trend and prepared companies will stand to benefit greatly. Capturing this dislocation can potentially manifest in a revenue/earnings surge in Q2.These broader structural mechanisms are how innovative smaller markets can potentially grow right through macro headwinds, even in recessionary environments. From Netflix's earnings and Roku's guidance, CTV is winning user attention. Wherever user attention is, advertising will follow. Despite the pandemic uncertainty, the streaming trends leave me optimistic for Roku's capture of the dislocated advertising spend.In Roku's case for preparation, they added about 9 million active users from a year ago, onboarded Apple TV+ and Disney+, and acquired Dataxu to accelerate their in-house ad capabilities. The company looks very different from where it was just two years ago. And to understand the true power of targeted advertising done right, one only needs to look at Facebook and Google that do it at mass scale. The value of Roku's ad capabilities lies in the data they've collected from their users that linear TV just cannot match for efficient actionable insight. That data's value compounds across users, streaming hours, and channels. Roku is a leader in all three.Source: Author, data from Seeking Alpha; ""FCF = Operating Cash Flow - CapEx""Roku's performance continues to be top-line driven, as it burns cash to capture as many viewers as it can. At under 40 million active accounts, there is a far greater market to capture both domestically and internationally. Market saturation for Connected TVs won't be reached for a few more years. As of FY 2019, the company is on an accelerated growth trajectory clocking at 52.0% yoy on an LTM basis. This level of growth justifies some cash burn and an FCF margin of -5.62% is not unreasonable. I don't expect profitability to be a reliable indicator for the financial health of the company and won't be surprised with higher cash burn to boost the top line going forward. As the revenue base expands, the revenue growth rate will naturally decelerate but I expect it to stay above the 30% range for the coming 2-3 years.Source: KoyfinAt an NTM EV/S of 10.2x, the stock is significantly more expensive than it was a month ago but is cheap when compared to historical multiples from six months ago. As I discussed, I see the shakeup of the broader TV advertising industry as an opportunity for more ad spend to find its way to the Roku platform and stay there. Roku's value proposition will continue to grow with programmatic trends, a stronger Dataxu integration, and as they continue collecting data from their expanding user base. With an enormous market opportunity ahead, Roku is a buy at this price in my opinion.Many investors are concerned about a drop in ad spending, but few have investigated the supply of high-quality inventory in the first place. I view the shake-up of TV advertising as a likely catalyst for Connected TV adoption in this environment, despite it being ad-revenue dependent. Regardless of near term headwinds/tailwinds, Roku is strongly positioned to capitalize on its long-term market opportunity as the go-to television platform/operating system. It is a buy at the current price in my opinion."
4337013,21798,2020-04-10T19:48:27-04:00,Roku is poised to outperform when the bear market ends and a new bull market begins.The company dominates market share for streaming platforms.Roku's above-average growth is likely to continue as consumers continue to 'cut the cord' in favor of streaming.,"If you are looking for a stock that is likely to significantly outperform the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) in the 2020s once a new bull market begins, then Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is one to consider. Roku's stock did take a sizable fall over the last few months which was larger than the market's decline. However, this creates a better buying opportunity since the company is set for strong long-term growth. Roku is benefiting from the trend of the cancellation of traditional cable TV services ('cord-cutting') in favor of TV/movie streaming platforms.Roku dominates market share for streaming media platforms. Roku has about 39% market share, ahead of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) 30% share from Fire TV. This demonstrates Roku's attractiveness in the eyes of consumers for streaming. Roku beat out large companies such as Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for streaming platforms.Another important statistic is that Roku also dominates the market for programmatic ad market share at 59%. This means that Roku is getting the most revenue for video ads on its platform as compared to other companies. Amazon has the 2nd highest ad market share at just 19%. So, again, Roku demonstrated its ability to outperform larger companies. That should help the company continue its growth in existing regions and into new regions.The reason for Roku's success is a result of the user-friendly format for the company's streaming platform. Consumers without smart TVs can purchase one of Roku's streaming devices. Roku also secured licensing deals with smart TV manufacturers. Roku now has 15 brands that integrated the company's streaming platform into their smart TVs.The main driver for Roku's stock to outperform the broader market is likely to be the company's above-average revenue and earnings growth. Granted, Roku is not yet profitable. However, the gross margin has been increasing as advertising revenue has increased. The company is on track for profitability in about 2022.The stock has been an outperformer during the bull market as it increased from the low $20s up to the $170s from the IPO in 2017 to the stock's peak in September 2019. However, the stock did have a tendency to experience sharp declines of over 50% multiple times during this period. So, investors might want to consider trading in and out of the stock on oversold and overbought conditions. Otherwise, you would have to have a strong stomach to hold the stock over the long term.Roku's revenue growth is expected to exceed 30% annually for 2020 through 2022 (consensus). Of course, those estimates could change because of the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19. The good news is that consumers are limited to what they can do at home during the shutdowns. Streaming TV shows and movies are among the activities that are available. Therefore, the COVID-19 situation may not have a significant negative impact on Roku's revenue as compared to many other businesses.Profitability is on the way as Roku increases the gross margin. The GM increased to 44% in 2019, up from the 30% range a couple of years ago. Continued GM increases can allow the company to reach positive earnings in about 2 years. The anticipation of future profitability along with Roku's strong revenue growth has a good chance of driving the stock for above-average gains over the next couple of years.Since Roku isn't profitable yet, the price to sales ratio is a reasonable metric to use because it is based on revenue instead of earnings. Keep in mind that Roku tends to maintain an above-average valuation. The reason for that is because investors tend to price a premium into the stock, encompassing the company's above-average revenue growth.Roku is currently trading with a trailing price/sales ratio of 8.9 and a forward price/sales of 6.7. This is still above the S&P 500's average price/sales ratio of 1.97. However, Roku's price to sales ratio improved significantly since it was in the teens in Q4 2019 as displayed in the chart below:Source: YChartsThe reality is that some stocks will maintain an above-average valuation over long periods of time. Roku happens to be one of them as revenue growth has been growing at a strong double-digit annual pace. Roku can probably be placed in the category of outlier stocks like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon which have maintained higher-than-average valuations over many years.Netflix and Amazon had many years where they were growing revenue at above-average paces while their valuations were sky-high. Value investors shunned these stocks for years at their own missed opportunity cost. Even Warren Buffett admitted that he missed out on Amazon's stock growth.Value investors can be quick to say that Roku's value is too high and that the company is not yet profitable. That's true based on standard metrics. However, you have to visualize the future to get the bigger picture of the stock's true potential.Roku has been improving its prospects for profitability. Continued gross margin gains have Roku on track for positive earnings in about 2022. The company is likely to continue growing revenue at a strong pace due to the trend of cord-cutting. Therefore, buying the stock on the current dip in valuation during a period of market weakness can provide a good entry point for a long-term position.Source: StockchartsThe weekly chart above shows that the stock recently bounced higher from an oversold level on the RSI indicator. However, there is still a lot of volatility in the market. Plus, it might be difficult to pick the bottom for the stock, especially when the market could drop again. With the stock trading about 50% lower than its 52-week high, now is probably a decent time to start a position if you're going to hold onto to it for multiple years.Roku is a company that is likely to grow revenue at a strong pace for multiple years. Many consumers have demonstrated their desire to stream TV content/movies over standard cable services. The amount of U.S. consumers canceling their standard cable-style TV subscriptions and those never getting cable TV subscriptions is expected to grow from 48.9 million to 61.5 million by 2023. This trend is likely to help drive revenue growth for Roku.Watch for Roku to continue growing revenue by increasing ad dollars, adding new smart TV manufacturers for licensing, and growing the business geographically. Keep an eye on momentum from the competition to see if the investment thesis needs to be changed or modified.Investors will have to decide how much volatility they want to bear. You can hold for the long term and deal with the sharp drops that have been characteristic of the stock or be more nimble and trade it between oversold and overbought conditions.Roku's stock has a good chance of outperforming the market over multiple years with above-average revenue growth and the cord-cutting trend as a tailwind. At Margin of Safety Investing, we look for stocks that have a good chance of doubling within a few years, and Roku is one with that potential."
4332436,23903,2020-03-17T08:45:35-04:00,"Although Roku has been incredibly accurate with its forward operational guidance, profitability metrics have continually been guided downward in the past several quarters.Wall Street earnings estimates for Roku for the coming three years have been significantly revised lower by as much as 90%.As steep as Roku's recent stock decline has been, it has not kept pace with analysts' downward earnings revisions.","(Daily chart for Roku with S&P 500 relative performance represented by the solid purple line. Roku's 50 and 200 day moving average shown in green and red, respectively. The chart shows Roku's relative stock weakness starting in December 2019 despite new highs being made by the broader averages.)It has been a tough week for Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) as its shares were cut by 20% in the past five trading days. Of course, ROKU's decline may have been largely influenced by the recent global stock market correction. For context, the broader S&P 500 (SP500) (NYSEARCA:SPY) dropped by roughly 10% during the same period. However, when examining ROKU's trading pattern during the past four months, a clear divergence between Roku's stock movement and the broader S&P 500 can be seen. Since the release of Roku's Q3 2019 earnings in early November of last year, its shares have traded much weaker relative to US equity indexes. This price action disconnect may be an indication some longer term investors are reassessing Roku's earnings prospects in the coming years.Roku's Q4 2019 earnings were for the most part slightly better than expectations. Roku posted a GAAP EPS loss of -$0.13 on revenues of $411 million. This beat Wall Street estimates by $0.01 in EPS and $19 million in revenues. In fact, the company has been surprisingly good at forecasting its forward results and has surpassed analysts' expectations every quarter during both 2018 and 2019. The following table shows how accurate its reported dollar figures were relative to even the high-end guidance.(Data compiled from Roku's Q3 2019 and Q4 2019 shareholder letter.)Looking deeper into Roku's user usage and monetization levels as outlined in my first Roku article, revenue per streaming hour has remained mostly in the same range during the past two years despite a significant increase in revenue per active account. The big sequential increase in revenue per active account in the fourth quarter also coincides with Disney's (NYSE:DIS) debut of Disney+ and Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple TV+. Without a proportional increase in revenue per streaming hour, Roku's average user monetization appears to be due to commission from premium subscription sign-ups rather than improving advertising metrics.(Data compiled from Roku's quarterly shareholder letters.)Roku's sequential increase in trailing twelve-month average revenue per user [ARPU] was less impressive as the chart below shows. Since TTM ARPU is a time-averaged figure, it smooths out seasonality as seen with the big sequential increase in revenue per active account. Although TTM ARPU sequential growth was the lowest in the past three years, it is still on track to meet my longer term projected revenue estimates as outlined in a previous article. TTM ARPU should be one of the top three metrics investors should track to determine if Roku can grow into its current rich valuation.(Data compiled from Roku's quarterly shareholder letters.)Gross MarginIn my opinion, Roku's primary investment risk is the lack of business leverage. Roku's two primary revenue streams are hardware sales and platform revenues, which include advertising and sign-up commissions. Since the streaming hardware market has been highly competitive, the company has had to sacrifice margin on hardware sales. In the latest quarter, hardware gross margin was negative at -0.7%. According to the company's fourth quarter earnings conference call,Although my long-term earnings estimate for Roku did not factor much incremental gross profit from hardware sales, the declining margin trend still could continue to trend lower into deeper negative territory. Without original content to attract new users to its platform, Roku may need to practically give away its streaming hardware in order to continually grow its user base. As bad as this may sound, it would actually be a good strategy since the company's platform gross margin was significantly higher at 62.5% in Q4 2019.While platform gross margin was still high in the latest quarter, the trend has been downward from over 70% as the chart below shows. Looking forward to the rest of 2020, management forecasts platform gross margin to continue trending lower and to range in the high 50s% to 60%.(Data compiled from Roku's quarterly shareholder letters.)Operating ExpensesOn the cost side, the trend towards profitability has not improved despite impressive top-line growth. Although general and administrative costs were negatively impacted by the company's recent acquisition and integration of dataxu, operating costs across the board continued to expand much faster than revenue growth. Even excluding dataxu's negative impact, the year-over-year general and administrative expense increase of 56% was still higher than annual revenue growth.(Data compiled from Roku's quarterly shareholder letters.)In fact, annual operating expense growth as a percentage of revenues increased every quarter in 2019, resulting in a full year increase of 310 basis points. Assuming minimum other non-operating income/losses, Roku's 2020 full year guidance implies operating expenses as a percentage of revenues could increase further.(Data compiled from Roku's quarterly shareholder letters.)As a result, Wall Street analysts have dramatically lowered Roku's long-term earnings expectations. 2020 GAAP EPS estimates have been lowered from -$0.29 loss to -$1.28 loss just since the start of November 2019. 2022 GAAP EPS estimates were also lowered from $2.44 prior to Roku's Q3 2019 earnings to $0.26 currently. If these operating trends continue to trickle lower, Roku runs the risk of not achieving GAAP profitability anytime in the near future.Obviously, most, if not, nearly all, of Roku's recent stock decline has been due to overall market panic over the economic effects of coronavirus hitting the US. For this reason, I debated whether commenting on Roku's recent earnings report would be proper since I did not want to fuel any additional negativity, especially after ROKU has already sold off so much. I concluded whatever Roku's share price is at, it would still benefit investors in understanding the company's recent operating trends in order to help each shareholder re-evaluate their long-term investment thesis.On a technical basis, ROKU is heavily oversold as is the overall market. Given the market's recent ability to completely erase large losses with next day gains, ROKU could bounce back at any time. However, the stock is completely technically broken with accumulation/distribution trends diverging extremely negative. Any recovery near $90-100 would be an excellent opportunity to sell out of unwanted positions or for short-term traders to short the stock.(Daily chart for ROKU with accumulation/distribution indicator shown below its candlestick chart. Previous support at around $100 may now be a technical resistance level.)Looking longer term, investors should focus on the numbers Roku produces rather than falling in love with the company's product or headline news. As mentioned, Roku has been extremely good at forecasting its forward quarter results and will likely continue to beat its guidance each quarter barring unforeseen extreme macro-economic impact such as coronavirus. However, despite each quarter's earnings upside surprise, management has guided important operating metrics such as margins and operating expenses to be incrementally negative towards bottom line earnings. Thus, buying Roku on 'beating earnings expectations' alone would have clearly been the wrong trade.As mentioned in my last Roku article, I believe investors continue to discount a major long-term investing risk in Roku. As long as the company remains dependent on external content providers, its business remains fundamentally flawed. Should any of its content providers pull or restructure revenue-sharing agreements, Roku's business model could be broken overnight. For this reason alone, Roku shares should not warrant any market premium, especially when long-term earnings estimates have been continually lowered.Thus, although Roku shares have fallen a lot recently and have dropped by a huge percentage from all-time highs just half a year ago, its stock is still up significantly since the start of just last year. Unless the company reverses recent operating trends to boost bottom-line results, its shares could still potentially retrace back to its 2018 lows especially if the overall markets continue to remain under pressure due to coronavirus or a slowing global economy resulting from its containment efforts."
4333387,105498,2020-03-21T05:23:37-04:00,"If you want exposure to the streaming movement, Roku is a pure play.Despite competition, Roku's market share is still terrific.There is a potential Coronavirus ad-dollar shift that could benefit aVOD services.Smart TV growth likely increases Roku's client pool for ad serving.","In the past, my stock coverage has been limited to profitable media companies with a couple of exceptions. Because of my focus on linear names, Roku (ROKU) is one that I've largely avoided. However, after the selloff from recent highs, I am now carefully scaling into a long Roku position. Like my Chicken Soup for the Soul Entertainment (CSSE) call, this is entirely a speculative play. It could have tremendous upside. It could go bust. As with any investment, proper weighting is important. Now, why I am starting to bid on lots?It's easy to forget that back around the time of, and even following Roku's 2017 IPO, there was some question as to what kind of business Roku even is. Some called it a hardware business, though CEO Anthony Wood refuted that notion. Years later, it's very clear that Roku is, indeed, in the ad business and the hardware business is just the hook. Platform revenue continues to increase both from a profitability and a percentage of revenue standpoint, while hardware (player) revenue goes down.Source: 2019 form 10-KAs just one of several platforms in the ad-supported streaming business, Roku has competition from other aVOD platforms with big name backing. What makes Roku the easier aVOD investment to me is that it is hands down the most focused on that strategy compared to its bigger competitors.Source: *Estimated revenue from Owler **author projection based of third-quarter filingIn ViacomCBS's (VIAC) 2019 form 10-K, the company stated Pluto TV's operating results had an insignificant impact to the company's consolidated financial statements. This makes it hard to justify buying ViacomCBS shares for exposure to streaming. Hulu, though interesting to me, is still just a small fraction of Disney's (DIS) total revenue. We don't know all that much about the Tubi TV operation, but it's likely safe to assume it isn't going to be contributing a large percentage of Fox's (FOX) reported revenue for some time. Ditto for Comcast's (CMCSA) new streaming acquisition XUMO.Speaking of Fox, the recent acquisition of Tubi TV directly relates to Roku for a couple of reasons. First, Fox had to sell its stake in Roku to free up the capital to purchase Tubi. Second, it shows that Fox wanted full ownership of an ad-supported streaming platform. And if that's the motivation, it obviously made more sense to instead put the Roku investment money into a streaming entity that Fox has full control of. Regardless, there are several ad-supported free streaming plays but to my knowledge only two companies give you the leveraged approach to aVOD exposure. Roku and Chicken Soup. Regarding streaming as an investable consumer trend, many of the companies entering the space now have considerable business operations outside of streaming. In most cases, these other operations are in jeopardy because of streaming. To be clear, I think content owners will ultimately be fine. But there is a cannibalization effect in the direct-to-consumer streaming movement that Roku doesn't have to deal with.I've maintained previously that what makes Roku so interesting is the prospect for it to be an operating system, data, and advertising hybrid company. As an operating system, it's just simple. And there's something to be said about that. The simplicity of the product is probably why Roku still has considerable market share.Courtesy: Strategy AnalyticsAnecdotally, my parents are in their 60s. It took a while, but last year, they finally cut the cord. What made the cord-cutting process easy for them to understand and adopt was the Roku express stick. The ease of use and the simplicity of the operating system were essential for them to grasp how the rest of the world is now consuming media. Now there is no going back for them. Roku is what they like and it's what they plan to use until further notice. Even still, user growth is great, but does it matter if you can't monetize that growth in a recession?I say yes. You can't be in the business of selling ads and not fundamentally understand the importance of client acquisition. An action that might not be profitable today could pay dividends down the line. Now more than ever, advertisers want data and attribution for their campaigns. Moving forward, in-market targeting and campaign automation are going to be crucial to cutting impression waste and maximizing the ROI of a marketing campaign. This is why I view the dataxu acquisition as a step in the right direction for Roku.This is a company that appears perfectly positioned to utilize data and consumer insights for targeted, lead-generating campaigns. When we begin to view Roku not as just a distribution company or an advertising company, we can quickly see how valuable Roku can be as a data company for advertisers.When times get challenging, people often turn to TV to either make sense of things or get some much needed distraction. Early Nielsen returns show a TV usage increase of 22% in the Seattle/Tacoma metro. In the past, violent weather situations have boosted TV viewing significantly in the markets dealing with the impact of the storms.The COVID-19 pandemic figures to have a very large impact on TV usage for a considerable amount of time. If Seattle is our first indication of what is to come, those usage figures could trend very high very quickly for the entire country. And frankly, there is only so much COVID-19 coverage a typical person is likely able to handle. When people are stuck in their homes for a long period of time, it stands to reason that streaming will be a beneficiary.It is very clear the economy has come to a screeching halt. If the Coronavirus pandemic drags on for months, as has been hinted, US consumers are likely looking at layoffs. As more people who can't leave their homes lose their jobs, budgets will be examined and costs will be cut. One of the biggest, easiest cost-cutting decisions ever made in my household was cable. Are we about to see an acceleration of cord cutting? It's possible. If that happens, people are likely to turn to the free, ad-supported platforms. This puts Roku in the advantageous position of being both a distributor and seller in this kind of advertising model.Conventional wisdom suggests advertisers slash marketing budgets in a recession. This has certainly been true in the past. In fact, early estimates suggest media companies are staring down billions in lost revenue from losing sporting events alone. But it's possible that some of the big money previously booked in live sports programming gets repurposed. Tim Peterson from Digiday hypothesizes that the live sports money could get shifted to the streaming space.I happen to agree with this hypothesis. Two of the best ways to reach younger viewers who are in-market for consumer products are through live sports or streaming. Live sports are now on the shelf for the foreseeable future. That leaves streaming. In that space, there are only a few invest-able, ad-supported plays and I believe Roku is the best option.One knee-jerk reaction from investors who see the immediate spike in consumption might be to buy Netflix (NFLX). While I have thoughts on that name that I won't get into here, COVID-19 is only a tailwind for Netflix if it grows subscriptions. Netflix does not make any more money if someone streams 4 hours a day instead of 2. If you believe the survey data from CivicScience, Netflix hasn't benefited from the small spike in streaming subscriptions as a result of the virus to this point.Though advertising is the growth area for Roku, smart TVs are a big growth area for streamers. That is why making deals with smart TV manufacturers is a good sign. The company announced new and expanding partnerships with TCL, Westinghouse, Hisense, and Funai at CES earlier this year. It adds Roku's potential reach to what was already an impressive partnership list that includes Phillips and RCA.Source: comScore State of OTT, 2019When we consider that smart TVs are the big growth area for streamers, it shows why it is imperative that Roku continue to make deals with TV manufacturers. Additionally, pricing figures to play an even bigger role for the consumer than it does now. If we are headed to a deep recession, the entry to Roku's operating system is a very low cost proposition for consumers. It can be done for as little as a couple hundred dollars for a brand new TV or significantly less for a Roku stick. Again, the profitability of Roku's hardware business can be sacrificed by the company if it is viewed simply as a client acquisition cost that leads to better advertising returns down the line. With viewing consumption up and cost-cutting likely coming from most households, now is the time for Roku to aggressively acquire eyeballs.If you've read any of my previous coverage, particularly in the media space, you'll note that a metric I typically look at is price to book value. As of submission, the price to book level in this name is about 13. That is many multiples higher than what I like to pay for my long positions. On Roku, I'm making an exception because I view this play as a significant growth stock and not a value play. Additionally, the price to book is now very close to all time lows for the ticker.Source: YCharts.comFundamentally, my thesis could just be incorrect. I view Roku as a potential growth story in the streaming media space. As another contributor points out, that growth might not be something to bank on. It's entirely possible Roku loses share of streamers to other smart TV manufacturers and device makers. It's also possible that ad-supported streaming has a limit. And of course, more broad market declines would very likely continue to weigh on Roku's share price.Though there are clear risks ahead for the economy and consumers, I view Roku as the best pure play in the streaming space moving forward. I take this view because of strong market share, programmatic advertising potential, and boosts in COVID-19 consumption leading to a big shift in ad dollars. As the title states, I am simply scaling in. Despite the aggressiveness of the selloff from recent highs, we cannot rule out lower prices from here."

It sits in the enviable position of a commanding market position where other businesses depend on it to perform.With stunning new data, we learned that, in 2019, The Roku Channel reached active accounts with an estimated 56 million viewers. Those are Roku users driving the average revenue per user (ARPU) higher, and it's a channel that was launched just a year ago.Parks Associates reports that The Roku Channel is one of the top three ad-based OTT services among U.S. broadband households (Q3 2019).That is the power of a platform.Further yet, a sign of true platform status, the United States' largest retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT), with Roku announced in the fall a signature and exclusive smart TV ('onn') which was sold exclusively in Walmart U.S. stores over the Black Friday weekend.With even more models in stores and online now, this is an exciting addition to Walmart's exclusive brand offerings in the U.S., demonstrating the value Roku brings to retail partners and consumers.Roku has evolved into a monster platform that has turned into a runaway train. This is a company with over $1 billion in revenue that grew more than 50% year over year (yoy) while 'platform' revenue grew at a stunning 78% yoy.Every quarter, the company accumulates more accounts, generates more revenue per account, with engagement rising nearly 70%.This is all done while the company has somehow maintained cash flow breakeven, indicating both future earnings power when needed and mindful management set out to go after growth.And this is all in North America, leaving a 10-fold growth opportunity internationally, which the company has begun pursuing as of last quarter.For full year 2019, we have:• Total net revenue grew to $1.13 billion up 52% yoy;• Platform revenue increased to $740.8 million up 78% yoy;• Active Accounts added 9.8 million incremental active accounts in 2019 to reach 36.9 million at year end up 36% yoy;• Streaming hours increased by 16.3 billion hours yoy to a record 40.3 billion up 68% yoy;• Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increased $5.19 yoy to $23.14 (trailing 12-month basis) and up 29% yoy;• Gross profit was to $495.2 million up 49% yoy;• For the full year, nearly one in three smart TVs sold in the U.S. were Roku TVs.Better yet, Roku has touched less than 10% of the worldwide market for users, and ARPU is at a fraction of its potential as well.These are not normal numbers. This is not a normal company.That's the investment thesis, the rest is just conversation.Expect stock volatility - there is nothing tame about a company at over $1 billion in revenue growing 50% year over year and competing directly with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).Even if Roku does what we believe it will, the stock price will not be a straight line. That much we can be sure of.Focus on the future - and future for the stock market is not measured in days or even months - it is measured in years, many years.And now in the context of Wall Street estimates.* Revenue: $411 million versus analyst expectations of $391.47 million. This was a beat* Adjusted EPS: -$0.13 versus analyst expectations of -$0.14. This was a beat* Full Year Revenue: $1.13 billion versus analyst expectations of $1.11 billion. This was a beat* Full Year Revenue Guidance for 2020: $1.6 billion versus analyst expectations of $1.56 billion. This was a beat* Next Quarter Revenue Guidance: $305 million versus analyst expectations of $299.8 million. This was a beatActive Accounts: Added 4.6 million to 36.9 million in the quarter versus analyst expectations of 35.9 million, and 36% year over year growth. This was a beatEBITDA Guidance for Q1: -$21 million versus analyst expectations of positive $4.2 million. This was a missBut, in this case, we like it. We would much rather Roku spend money to grow with its considerable cash balances of over $500 million.A $21 million EBITDA deficit is rounding error, and with guidance as strong as it was, we would have asked the company to lose more if we had a say in it.Note that platform makes up 65% of Roku's revenue, and that segment is growing at 78% year over year.The rest of this dossier is a review of the thematics and technology. For those of you that are deeply familiar with the Roku story, you can skip ahead to the 'Risk' section.As of this writing, Roku trades with a $9.7 billion market cap. Netting out $100 million in cash leaves us with an enterprise value (EV) of $9.6 billion.Based on 2019's full year $1.13 billion, that leaves us with an EV to sales of 8.5.Consensus mean estimates have the company at $1.607 billion for 2020, $2.15 billion for 2021, and $2.842 billion by 2022.Those numbers imply EV to sales ratios of 6.04, 4.51, and 3.41.We certainly have to consider the possibility of revenue reductions due to the coronavirus as advertising dollars could slow, but for now, we have a reasonable handle on valuation, and it's low.For a company that has cash net positive, cash flow neutral (by choice), with a total addressable market that is hundreds of times total revenue and growing at 50% a year, an EV to current year forward sales of 10 is pricey but defensible, in particular with long-term EBITDA margins likely in the 35% range. That would put Roku at roughly $132, still below its 52-week high of $176.55, and fully 65% higher than its current stock price at the time of writing.Let's defend the total addressable market and moat.According to eMarketer, around 56 million households in total will have canceled cable or satellite TV subscriptions by 2023.Approximately 1.7 million consumers cut the cord in Q3 of 2019 alone. Roku research indicates that roughly 50% of U.S. cord cutters are Roku customers, and cord cutters who choose Roku products are highly satisfied with the decision and extremely unlikely to consider returning to a traditional pay TV subscription.Here is a chart to give the text some graphical context. Here is the cord cutting trend, overall:Number of households not paying for traditional TV services in the United States from 2019 to 2023(Source: Statista)Roku is telling us that 'roughly 50% of U.S. cord cutters are Roku customers.'Another way to look at this is through the other end. Here is a chart of cable subscribers in the U.S. Note that downtrend - the households leaving are the ones that are 'cord cutters.'Pay TV penetration rate in the United States from 2010 to 2019(Source: Statista)Again, Roku is taking 50% of these cord cutters onto its platform.There is a monstrous disconnect between the advertising dollars that go to linear TV (cable TV) and streaming TV (cord cutters, et al.).Please read these numbers carefully, and even a few times over, to really grasp our thesis. Here it is:Over the Top (OTT aka streaming non cable) accounts for 29% of U.S. TV viewing, but so far has only captured 3% of TV ad budgets. Stop right there.Read that line again.There is an order of magnitude disconnect between the ad dollars flowing to streaming video versus linear TV based on viewership hours. In order to make an argument that the number will close, that is, the amount of advertising money spent on OTT will reach the viewership hours, we must show that advertising on OTT is at least as effective as cable.This is exactly what happened with social media before advertisers and Wall Street caught on that 'traditional advertising' paled in comparison to the monstrous accuracy of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).We are seeing this same cognition happen again, but this time, we caught it early.So, to be clear, we are not making the argument that OTT commercials are as effective as standard Tv ads. No.We are making the argument that OTT commercials are more effective than linear TV. Yes, just like social media made the same claim and proved it. (We are not saying, nor never would that a Roku ad will ever be as good as a Facebook ad - but that's not the bar - the bar is linear TV.)And here are two factual data points to defend this thesis.Defending the thesis part 1 that proportion of hours viewed will translate into proportion of ad dollars spent: Recall that Magna Global did its own research on the efficacy of Roku ads, and they found this:That's right. It's not that the ad money should simply even out - that is, hours spent watching OTT versus linear TV should therefore dictate ad spend - no, it's that it will be larger to the increased effectiveness of an OTT ad.Defending the thesis part 2 that proportion of hours viewed will translate into proportion of ad dollars spent: On October 9th, we wrote Roku Simply Stunned the Industry So Much that the Industry Doesn't Get it, Yet.This is what happened: Roku changed the entire landscape of TV advertising.It's the first change since the introduction of the television. It's monumental, industry changing, too big for Wall Street to grasp, and Roku is going to win from it.Roku invented a new ad unit - a pop-up ad that aids the advertiser, so a TV ad turns into a web ad. Yes, a TV ad you can click. This is world-changing for the TV industry - it really is. It also follows through on our first ever call on Roku - that it is the Facebook of Television.For now, when an advertiser spends on linear TV, they have terribly inaccurate measures of how many people saw the ad, and virtually, no measure of how effective it was at converting into a sale. You can think for yourselves - when did you see a TV commercial, pick up your phone or go to your computer and buy something?And, when or if you did that, how would the advertiser know it was from the TV ad? They don't is the answer.If you ask the same question to a Facebook or Google advertiser, they could answer that question precisely, to the penny per account, to the second. With Roku's new ad unit, they just moved further from the ""we have no idea how effective our TV ad is,"" to the Facebook/Google version of ""we know exactly, to the second, to the dollar, to the person, to the location.""And so, how large is this market that is totally lopsided with respect to hours viewed versus ad dollars spent? It's enormous:(Source: Statista)Yes, nearly a quarter trillion-dollar worldwide market that is going to move, en masse, to streaming. The portion of that in the United States is forecast at about $75 billion.As Roku points out, 50% of cord cutters go to Roku.Roku gets more viewing time, better delivery of ads, better technology, and a growing account base rather than shrinking one (cable TV is dying).Now, to our third reason where Wall Street has it wrong, we turn to hours viewed. This idea of streaming video, or if you prefer OTT (all the same thing, just different names) is not a wing and a prayer thesis, it is factually larger than linear TV.For the first time ever, streaming video services are more popular than pay TV services. (Source: Statista)Yes. it is not an ""up and coming theme,"" it is now. It is today. It will grow in the future. Stop listening to Internet trolls and Wall Street analysts that don't see it.You don't even need my opinion. You too can use facts.Deloitte and Touche did the research, and they had more to say.In another ominous sign for cable TV, 88% of millennial households reported a video streaming subscription compared to just 51% for pay TV.So, we have not only a secular shift that is accelerating, but a generational shift that is far more abrupt than the mainstream media has been covering. At some point in the future, it is our belief that for every household in the United Sates that consumes video of some sort, it will have a streaming service.So, while Wall Street crows, just a little, about valuation, stop it. Either you see facts and believe them to be true and are able to draw your own conclusions from them (not my conclusions, your own conclusions) or you are unable. That's it.Roku will deliver a little over $1.5 billion in revenue for full year 2020, after raising that guidance number virtually every quarter, but who cares?I don't care about $1.5 billion in revenue for Roku, I care about the $228 billion stuck in linear TV when viewership is dropping, cable TV subscriptions are dropping, advertising technology is dead.I care about where viewers are coming, where viewing hours is exploding, where advertising technology is at its early stages and already far outpaces linear TV performance.I care about $4 billion in revenue. I care about $10 billion in revenue.This is the growth in the number (in million) of streaming TV platform units in use in the United States:That chart (above) was first introduced by CML Pro more than five months ago. One month later, that same chart was 'borrowed' by Roku itself in its own earnings letter to shareholders.And, further yet, this entire diatribe isn't even half of the Roku story.While we have a nice-looking bar chart for the number of streaming OTT subscribers in the United States, that 50 million (ish) users is tiny compared to the rest of the world.(Source: Statista)Strategy Analytics notes that more than one in five Smart TVs sold today run on the Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) developed Tizen platform, while one in ten runs on the Google managed Android TV system. Roku TV captured 4% of global TV sales in 2018.In its letter to shareholders, Roku said:Streaming is a global opportunity, and we continue to see great promise for Roku, as we expand our reach in international markets.While we are still in early days, we believe the strengths that have made Roku the No. 1 streaming platform in the U.S. by hours streamed will enable Roku to be successful internationally as we drive scale, build engagement, and begin to monetize in international markets.Roku now moved to the UK with its partnership with Hisense late last year.Just last month, Roku announced its entry into Brazil.In 2019, Roku also saw strong demand for Roku devices in Mexico and achieved the strongest sales in its history in that market.The company is clearly opening business in Brazil if you look at the job postings. There are more than half a billion more users to go get, with the leading operating system and more TV manufacturer partnerships than all other competitors combined times three.And, surprise (!), on January 21, 2020, Roku announced, officially, that it was expanding to Brazil.More International - Oops, We Caught 'Em. Before this quarter's call, we didn't get a lot of detail about international growth, but a little snooping made it clear that Roku is actively working in Brazil.Earlier in July, the company inadvertently spelled out its plans to enter Brazil in multiple job listings, which stated that it was looking to hire people to create ""the most exciting and widely appealing content for Roku consumers in Brazil - a vibrant, growing OTT market.""Asked about its plans for the country, a spokesperson stopped short of committing to an imminent launch, saying: ""As a global company, we are constantly assessing different countries that could offer new opportunities to fuel our growth. We see great potential in the streaming market in Brazil.""While the data we complied on Brazil is a bit stale, even in 2016, it was quite clear that the country was going to be a major force in the video streaming world:(Source: Statista)But we can do better than that. We can look at the pay TV penetration rate in Brazil from 2010 to 2019: (Source: Statista)We can see that cable TV subscribers peaked in 2016, right when that data snapshot was taken of OTT viewers. With the cord-cutting rate accelerating since then, it must be the case that Brazil is a booming market for the streamers.And here's the real kicker. (Source: Statista)The penetration rate of OTT in Brazil is still just 11%. There is enormous growth potential here as the cord-cutters move to over the top streaming.And we have taken all this time just to focus on Brazil. The rest of the world implications are larger, but we can see why Roku is starting here.Further yet, the company has also been hiring staffers in its Amsterdam office to further expand into Europe, with one industry source telling Variety that this could happen before the end of the year.The risk to Roku becoming the giant we believe it will be are several fold:1. Competition domestically: While Roku is the undisputed leader, when your top competitor is Amazon, Google (sort of) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) (sort of), yeah, there's risk. How could there not be?2. Competition internationally: Roku will try to materially replicate their success in the US to international markets, and while that sounds reasonable, it's not a guarantee. Perhaps, this company grows slower than expected internationally, and perhaps, it's more expensive than believed.Perhaps, further, even though the company has $515 million in cash, it has to sell stock to aggressively go after the new markets, and for that moment in time, the stock will likely drop.3. Something unforeseen: It's possible some other influence that we don't even recognize as a risk pops up to disrupt Roku's progress. While streaming TV is going to dominate then swallow linear TV, it doesn't have to be the case that Roku will win as it is now. Maybe Microsoft or Facebook try something.Or, further, perhaps TV manufacturers decide they want to turn into technology companies and are willing to spend the $1 billion to create a new operating system and are willing to hire a thousand new developers to update the OS several times a day as Roku does.4. Market risk: All of this could play out in the bullish case, but the market dumps, and everything is lower. It happened in December of 2018 when Roku was a $26 stock and many people sold. They all lost money. The stock is now three-fold higher, but that doesn't help the people that sold at $26.That same divergence from reality could happen again, but rather than a snap back in stock price, it could take years to recover.The information contained on this site is provided for general informational purposes, as a convenience to the readers.

Expectations for the company appear to be pretty high based on analysts' estimates, with significant revenue growth in store despite forecasts for the company to post a loss for the quarter.Additionally, when viewing the company's average revenue per user on a quarterly basis, the number seems less than impressive. Currently, the company reports ARPU on an annualized basis, based on information from SEC files. When using a more standard approach using a quarterly basis, those ARPU numbers come down dramatically.Options traders also appear to be betting that Roku stock falls in the weeks ahead by as much as 18% to around $105, while also pricing in a tremendous amount of volatility. You can now track all of my free articles on Seeking Alpha and other websites on this Google Spreadsheet I have created.Analysts are looking for the company to report 42.4% revenue growth in the fourth quarter to around $393 million. Meanwhile, the company is estimated to have a loss of approximately $0.14 per share, which is down from a profit of $0.05 in the same quarter a year ago.Account growth for the company has been steadily slowing in recent quarters, and it can mostly be seen as a leading indicator of future revenue. The more accounts the company brings on to the platform, the more potential opportunities it creates for future revenue.In the latest quarter the company reported ARPU of $22.58 on an annualized basis. According to the company's latest 10-Q, it calculates ARPU as the platform revenue for the trailing four quarters divided by the average of the number of accounts in the current period and the period in the prior year. However, this approach seems to skew the number higher, helped by the more significant accounts and revenue of the more current quarters, while discounting the lower number of the quarters from the year prior.However, if using a more standard quarterly approach, merely using the ending number of accounts and revenue of the latest quarter, one would find that that ARPU is cut to around $5.55, a less impressive figure.While the growth remains healthy, it seems to more accurately reflect the current revenue trends taking place, as opposed to the annualized method, while showing the pace of ARPU growth was much slower in prior quarters.Some options traders appear to be betting that results will disappoint and that the stock will plunge following results. The open interest for the ROKU $120 puts for expiration on April 17 rose sharply on February 3 by 4,350 contracts to a total open interest of about 5,600 contracts. Based on data from Trade Alert, it appears that most of these contracts were bought on the ASK for around $14.50. It suggests that the stock falls to around $105.50 by the expiration date in April, a decline of about 17.75% from the share's current price around $128.25 on February 3. It is not a small bet either, with a dollar value of approximately $6.3 million.The options market is also pricing in a massive amount of volatility for the stock following the results, with shares rising or falling by as much as 16.5% from the $128 strike price using the long straddle strategy for expiration on February 21. It places the stock in a trading range of $107 to $149.The technical chart for Roku is bearish too and suggests the stock falls to lower prices. The stock has formed a bearish technical pattern known as falling triangle, and it indicates that the stock declines to around $116, and potentially as low as $100. The relative strength index is also falling and suggests that bullish momentum is leaving the stock. More important is that that stock is seeing extreme levels of volume on days the shares are falling, which indicates down days are attracting more sellers, then up days are attracting buyers.However, should the stock break the downtrend, which is part of the falling triangle, shares could go on to rise to around $150, it is the next level of resistance.The risk for Roku going into results seems high based on the volatility being priced in by the options markets. Additionally, revenue per user doesn't seem to be as impressive when looking at it quarterly, while analysts have very high expectations for revenue growth in the fourth quarter. It comes together to suggest that the general direction in Roku's stock following results may be lower, not higher."
4330408,104398,2020-03-06T20:15:11-05:00,"Members of the App Economy Portfolio have pressed me to take a stance on Roku when the shares were trading above $160 in November 2019.I pushed back against chasing it due to concerns over valuation, with the company trading at more than 18 times sales at the time.Since then, KPIs of the platform have continued to improve, both in streaming hours and ARPU (average revenue per user).Fast-growing disruptors like Roku tend to be punished harder in the context of a market correction, creating a timely long-term opportunity.After a 44% sell-off over the past few weeks, I gave another look at the story and decided to initiate a long position.","I'll admit it. I have misunderstood Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) for quite some time.You see, I'm a cord-cutter myself, and a happy user of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chromecast. For a long time, I was having a hard time understanding why Roku would have a sustainable business model as a simple aggregator of OTT (over-the-top) applications.Only once I realized that Roku was a pure-play in CTV ads (Connected TV advertising), one of the fastest growing segments of the programmatic advertising space, did I realize I had been wrong all along.After publishing a bullish thesis on The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) back in 2018, I have covered multiple times the importance of the rise of programmatic ads and specifically CTV for members of the App Economy Portfolio.Roku is emerging as the clear leading service-agnostic platform offering an all-in-one place to select and enjoy TV content. As a result, the company is poised to drive publisher's interest and ARPU higher via its CTV ads.CTV ads offer the best of two worlds:In the context of a market correction with a lot of uncertainties surrounding the novel coronavirus, fast growing companies tend to be hit the hardest. Roku has been no exception, falling 44% off its all-time-high in the past few weeks. This naturally creates a fantastic opportunity to get shares of Roku at a much more affordable price.What made me come around and start a long position in ROKU?Let's review.SourceAccording to a forecast from MAGNA, the digital share of US ad spending will rise from 45% in 2017 to 60% by 2022. Digital offerings in advertising can be very precise and at scale. Ad tech growth has become inevitable.Programmatic advertising alone is projected to grow at a 22% CAGR. Even by simply growing with the market, Roku is already positioned to grow at a very rapid pace.It's reasonable to expect that linear TV advertising spend will continue to shift to CTV, reflecting growing investments in ad-supported streaming services as they attempt to compensate for the cord-cutting trend.Total ad spend in CTV is forecasted to exceed $10 billion by 2021 according to eMarketer.Roku is perfectly positioned to benefit from multiple tailwinds:Roku is making money from two main sources:Just like first-party providers in the gaming industry such as Sony (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox, the business model is built on a low-margin hardware used as a gateway to the real value: the ecosystem.With an expected continued fragmentation of the streaming industry, a robust TV ecosystem is becoming increasingly important, and consumers expect to be able to browse and easily access a wide-range of content the same way they do on their smartphones.According to IHS Markit, Roku has become the leader in smart TV OS in 2019. This was the result of sales of its hardware, as well as partnerships with TVs from various brands, including China's TCL.In the first quarter of 2019, shipments of Roku-based sets represented 37% of Smart TVs in North America.SourceIHS Markit did not include gaming consoles in the analysis, but they have increasingly become home entertainment platforms, offering app stores that go beyond gaming.Their reach remains far short of Roku's numbers if we look at the streaming TV platforms devices in use in the US. According to Strategy Analytics, Roku has been the leading platform since early 2018, growing its market share aggressively. Meanwhile, PlayStation and Xbox have plateaued.SourceThe real competition to Roku is a mix of:With Roku being the only company in the mix that is narrowly focused on offering the ultimate service-agnostic experience to users, the company is well positioned to thrive in the secular shift away from cable. But the sheer size and marketing capacity of its competitors is certainly something to keep in mind.With the rise of Roku's market share, user engagement has followed.The company crossed 10 billion in quarterly streaming hours, and the ARPU has delivered a very consistent and predictable growth around 30% Y/Y.SourceRoku is firing on all cylinders by optimizing the three pillars of its growth:This trifecta of revenue growth could drive Roku up and to the right for the foreseeable future, even assuming tough competition in new markets outside of the United States.Roku achieved a pretty phenomenal FY19:If we look at the recent business strength, revenue growth has been oscillating between +40% and +60% since mid-2018, illustrating that the momentum has been very strong over six quarters and counting.Data by YChartsNow, turning to the rest of the income statement, Roku has a stable gross margin slightly above 40% and reasonable marketing cost around 15% of revenue.The company is not profitable yet, but economies of scale should eventually materialize in FY21 and beyond.Data by YChartsI like to put past share price action in perspective of the fundamentals of the business. You can easily tell by the chart below that ROKU shares were trading ahead of themselves late 2019, and the recent sell-off is a welcome opportunity to accumulate shares.Data by YChartseMarketer has done a fantastic job projecting Roku's ad revenue growth as soon as late 2018. So, I wanted to emphasize here their breakdown of what defines the next leverages for the company looking forward.Source1. Selling publishers' inventory: Instead of taking a cut of the ad-revenue from an ad-supported publisher streaming on Roku such as Hulu, Roku gets access to sell some of the publisher's inventory in exchange for the extended audience reach it provides.2. Subscriptions: Roku gets paid when a user subscribes to a new video service via the Roku platform. This model is similar to the iOS and Google Play stores. This makes Roku a platform similar to Amazon Prime Video.3. Giving publishers audience-data access: Since 2018, Roku is allowing publishers to match their own data to Roku's to optimize their inventory on the platform.4. Display ads: Banners and themed overlays on the homepage.5. Channel recommendations: A mix of editorial choices and paid placements, similar to a Game of the Day feature on an app store.6. Selling ads for its own channel: Roku launched its own ad-supported channel in 2017, The Roku Channel, and maintains full control of its inventory.7. Sponsored shows: Another form of sponsoring similar to linear TV strategies around live events.8. Email marketing: Editorial and paid emails to suggest content.9. Remote buttons: Publishers pay Roku to place dedicated buttons on its remotes.10. Deals with TV manufacturers: TV makers like TCL, Sharp, and Hitachi use Roku's software for their connected-TV products. The TV gains an OS at a low cost, and Roku gets an all-important user acquisition tool to drive a continued flow of people to the ecosystem over time.After missing the premise of ROKU before its fantastic 2019 run, I pushed back against the idea of chasing it when was trading at 18 times sales last November.Over the past few days, I have celebrated the recent sell-off as an opportunity to start a position with a multi-year time horizon.Icing on the cake, in a hypothetical long-lasting stay-at-home economy that could be triggered by the novel coronavirus, ad-supported home entertainment is likely to be a thriving business.As far as the market vicissitudes go, things could get much worse before they get better. I will gladly build a larger position over time if the opportunity to buy shares at a much lower price presents itself."

(ROKU)The company announced better than expected fourth quarter results with both revenues and adjusted EBITDA beating our expectations. However, management sees 2020 as a year of investments which is likely to put pressure on gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and EPS. We remain bullish on the business and reiterate our BUY rating. We lower our target price to $149.25 (earlier $155.75).* Numbers may not add up due to rounding.Q4:19 HighlightsQ4:19 revenues were $411.2 million, up 49% YOY, attributable to growth across both its segments – Platform (+71% YOY) and Player (+22% YOY). The company showed strong business momentum with 36% YOY active user growth and 60% YOY streaming hours growth. On the monetization front, the average revenue per user (ARPU) increased by 29% YOY to $23.14 versus $17.95 in Q4:18. ROKU delivered gross profit of $161.6 million, up 44% YOY but gross margins declined 140 bps YOY to of 39.3% in Q4:19. ROKU reported total adjusted EBITDA of $15.1 million in Q4:19. It was well ahead of the company expectations. For Q120, ROKU expects revenue midpoint at $305 million, representing a growth of ~48%. For FY 2020, ROKU expects revenue of ~$1.6 billion. We adjust our estimates based on the results and management commentary. We maintain our BUY rating and decrease our target price to $149.25 (earlier $155.75), with an implied capital appreciation potential of ~31 %.PRIMARY RISKSTV streaming is highly competitive industry with presence of large technology players such as Amazon, Google which have far higher resources. The US-China trade war could adversely impact business operations as majority of its hardware is manufactured in China.Please refer to the end of this report to obtain important disclosure information.QUARTERLY SUMMARY – Q4:19Competitive Dynamics. Management was not too concerned about competition from internet-based bundles such Flex, Comcast’s broadband offering, which aggregates multiple streaming apps. ROKU CEO said that he does not see competing with traditional cable distributors as a big part of its competitive dynamic.OUTLOOK for Full Year 2020ROKU expects revenue for 2020 at $1.6 billion, representing ~42% YOY growth. The company anticipates gross profit outlook for 2020 to be $730 million at the midpoint, up 47% YOY. The platform revenue mix is expected to be roughly ~75% of total revenue in 2020, up from ~66% in 2019. The platform gross margin is expected to be in the high 50s to 60% driven by continued mix shift to video advertising, the inclusion of dataxu and growth of premium subscriptions.The company is guiding for stock-based compensation of roughly ~$135 million and an estimated $35 million of D&A and other income. The majority of operating expenses are headcount related. The company is guiding for adjusted EBITDA to be roughly breakeven for full year 2020.EARNINGS ESTIMATESFor 2020 we forecast revenue growth of ~42% resulting in $1,597 million of revenue, in line with the management guidance. We model gross profit of $730 million (or margin of 45.7%), again in line with the management guidance. GAAP-operating expense is forecasted at ~$905 million. We model stock-based compensation of ~$134 million and an estimated $29.5 million of D&A. As such, we forecast Adjusted EBITDA loss of ~$10.9 million for 2020. This is in line with management’s focus on higher investments in 2020 which is likely to put pressure on adjusted EBITDA and EPS.VALUATION AND RECOMMENDATIONWe value ROKU using P/S multiple since the company does not earn a profit. Given the shift in the management focus away from hardware to software & services, we believe that Roku should be valued more like an internet software and services provider than a maker of a consumer device.We believe ROKU should trade at a premium to the higher end of the peer group range in light of ~33% smart TV market share, expanding user engagement metrics and high revenue growth. We value Roku at 11.9x P/S multiple. We are applying this multiple to our forecast 2020 results, and then discount target back our computed cost of capital. The multiple based target after discounting back to the present comes to $149.30, which we round down to $149.25.The exhibit below summarizes our peer group multiples.The Exhibit below shows stock price targets using various combinations of sales and P/S multiples. Our sales per share estimates for 2020 is $13.5. The unshaded portion of the chart shows resulting stock price targets at various forward P/S multiples (esse n tially all below the industry peer group average) above the current market price of $113.67 as of February 28, 2020.IMPORTANT DISCLOSURESThe following disclosures relate to relationships between Singular Research and Millennium Asset Management, LLC (“Millennium”) and companies covered by Singular Research and referred to in research reports.This report has been prepared by Singular Research, a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium which is an investment advisor registered in the State of California.

Shares may be getting ready to surge back to their 2019 highs, based on the technical chart. However, any gain should be considered suspect over the longer term as the stock's valuation still appears to be stretched.The last time I wrote on Roku was before the company's quarterly results on October 31. At the time, I noted the stock was likely to fall from its then price of $147 to $135. Shares ended up falling to as low as $116. You can track all of my free articles on Seeking Alpha on this Google Spreadsheet.Currently, Roku is nearing an essential level of resistance at $150. Should the stock rise above that level of resistance, it is likely to climb higher towards $161, a gain of 8.6%. There is a technical pattern that has formed in the chart known as a gap. A gap is a space in the chart that is created following a sharp decline or increase in stock price from the previous day close. In this case, should the stock rise above resistance at $150, the stock would likely work its way higher to fill that gap. However, shares could climb to as high as $175 should the stock clear resistance at $161, a gain of 18% from its current price of $148.25 on December 26.The relative strength index is currently trending lower but is attempting to break out and rise above that downtrend. Should that happen, then it would suggest that momentum in the stock has turned from bearish to bullish.However, should the stock fail to rise above resistance at $150, then it is likely to pull back to a region of support around a price of $135.Despite the optimism, the chart portrays the stock doesn't come cheap. The shares are trading at 7.7 times 2021 revenue estimates of $2.09 billion.Data by YChartsRevenue estimates for 2021 have risen sharply in recent months. It was in November they stood at $1.99 billion and $1.72 billion in March. It would suggest that analysts' views for the company have grown more positive over the course of the past year.Earnings are expected to materialize in 2021 at $0.21 per share, which means the stock trades for 707 times 2021 earnings estimates, a fantasy-like valuation. Even when valuing the company on its projected EBITDA, the stock trades at 521 EV/EBITDA ratio.The stock's sales multiple seems more reasonable; then, it was at points in the past. But still, it isn't cheap either, and when compared to other players in the streaming landscape, such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), it is high. For example, Netflix trades around five times 2021 revenue estimates of $29.2 billion. Advertising peers such as Facebook (FB) trade for 5.6 times 2021 sales estimates of $102.55 billion.It would suggest that the company has a lot to grow to fill into the valuation investors have given it. It could mean two things: either the shares are overvalued in the short-term and the stock is likely to trade sideways for some time as the fundamentals grow or it could mean that shares are overvalued and poised to fall longer-term.The significant valuation also means that the company has very little room to maneuver or disappoint. The stock currently prices in perfection and assumes, based on the valuation, the company will be able to grow revenue and eventually earnings very quickly in future years. But one slip up could result in the shares falling sharply and result in analyst cutting estimates.But, for now, momentum suggests the stock keeps moving up."
4313469,105419,2019-12-20T00:02:53-05:00,"As streaming competition intensifies, Roku’s operating system presents an enormous opportunity.Roku has developed a one-of-a-kind advertising platform that is solving the complications of television advertising in a streaming world.As original content providers compete, Roku's growth and margins will remain high.","Bill Gates recently said, ""I’ve paid more than anyone in taxes."" One big reason for that is because Microsoft (MSFT), the company he co-founded, became enormously successful as the dominant personal computer operating system at a time when many people barely understood the concept of a PC. In other words, Gates has made a lot of money.Similarly, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) have ballooned to gigantic market capitalization companies. Many people still barely understand how they make money (the answer is largely targeted advertising). And as competition in the streaming industry continues to heat up - between Netflix (NFLX) Disney (DIS), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and others - a relatively unknown company, Roku (ROKU), is on track to benefit enormously by becoming the operating system for smart TVs. Then, it can use the smart TV data it gathers to offer invaluable personal data, on an enormous scale, to targeted advertisers. Roku’s opportunity is huge.If you don’t know, Roku makes streaming players that connect to your TV, as well as Roku TVs that have the streaming experience built in. Users simply connect them to the internet, set up a Roku account and start streaming.Importantly, Roku has developed powerful search features and a powerful advertising platform that are solving the complications of television advertising in a streaming world. Specifically, it is ahead of the competition in value-added services and quantifiable insights offered to advertisers. This gives the company a huge advantage. More specifically, Roku has incredible pricing power at a time when competition may commodify leading content providers, thereby pressuring their margins lower.Roku will gain on the backs of growing content providers such as Netflix, Disney, Apple and Amazon.Unbeknownst to many, a third of all smart TVs sold in the U.S. come with the Roku operating system already installed. This may not sound like a big deal considering so many people consume content through smartphones, tablets and PCs. However, smart TVs are far less expensive than those other devices. This makes them a much more cost-effective platform for content consumption for many Americans.In fact, the reason so many smart TVs come with the Roku operating system is because it’s cheaper for manufacturers to use Roku’s platform than to create their own. Keeping the cost of smart TVs low is paramount in this cost-competitive space (i.e., the price of the smart TV would go up if the manufacturer didn’t use Roku). And importantly, Roku is gaining momentum. For example, according to Strategy Analytics, Roku is stretching its lead as the No. 1 streaming TV platform in the U.S.Roku’s founder, chairman and CEO is entrepreneur Anthony Wood. Roku is his sixth company, and he has already climbed to No. 195 on the Forbes 400 (his net worth was recently reported to be $3.2 billion). And encouragingly, Wood recently reported owning a 34.3% share of Roku at a $2.1 billion market value. This shows he is significantly in alignment with shareholders.Prior to founding Roku, Wood was vice president of internet TV at Netflix. Also interesting, Roku means “six” in Japanese (it’s his sixth company). And for a little more perspective on Roku, here is how Wood concluded his latest shareholder letter:If you couldn’t guess, based on the fact that Amazon, Disney, Apple and Netflix are investing heavily in the space, the streaming content opportunity is truly massive. According to data from Statista, total revenue for the video streaming industry is already almost $25 billion annually. And it should exceed $30 billion by 2024. However, those stats don’t do justice to Roku’s unique operating model. The company does an excellent job explaining its value proposition in this quote from its most recent shareholder letter:Even though Roku’s revenues continue to grow rapidly (up 50% year over year in the third quarter), estimates call for net income to be negative for 2020. We like the near-term negative net income because Roku is focusing on long-term value creation by investing heavily in its operating system through research & development. For example, last quarter the company generated over $260 million in revenue and then spent over $68 million on research & development. The core technology supporting the Roku operating system offers a critical competitive advantage. And the company is working hard to grow that advantage and maintain pricing power - both very good things. Also encouraging is that Roku’s total gross margin sits at over 45%.(Table Source: Roku shareholder letter)On a price-to-sales basis, Roku currently trades at around 10.4 times 2020 estimates, according to data compiled by FactSet. This is down from over 12x at multiple points in recent months. And the number falls to under 8x as compared to 2021 estimates.However, in our view, Wall Street tends to focus too much on near-term results. These estimates chronically underestimate the long-term growth potential of disruptive growth companies like Roku. For example, the shares now trade 145% higher than the average analyst estimate at the start of 2019. Analysts have continued to update their price targets in lockstep with changes in the share price. We agree with Wood (as quoted earlier) that cord-cutting, content proliferation and competition create a long runway for Roku’s platform to benefit from high-margin growth.Roku is a rare company with many of the exceptional characteristics we look for in a growth stock. And it has an incredible growth trajectory, as it leads the way in becoming the standard smart TV operating system. Roku’s business model allows it to gather invaluable information for targeted advertisers, particularly as competition among content providers grows.And while that competition may likely put pressure on their own margins, Roku’s margins (and pricing power) should remain strong. Further, Roku’s CEO has tied a significant portion of his net worth up in shares. Roku shares have tremendous price appreciation potential in the near and long term.

4316795,23903,2020-01-14T14:11:33-05:00,"Roku has been able to grow its top line revenues and user base at anticipated rates.
        Roku's main profitability metrics including gross margins and operating expenses continue to trend unfavorably for investors.
        Roku's stock has been consolidating in a pennant chart pattern and could significantly breakout to either side since its apex coincides with the timing of the company's upcoming earnings report.","After peaking above $175 last September, Roku (ROKU) has been in a fairly volatile consolidation range. Part of the reason behind the stock's indecisiveness has been inconclusive earnings reports which neither gave additional fuel for bulls to charge higher nor substantial evidence of a broken business model for bears to claw the stock lower. Despite stretched valuations, Roku continues to grind its business forward improving on a number of operating metrics which in theory could result in higher levels of profitability a few years down the line. Roku's consolidation period could be nearing an apex as the stock converges at technical levels just ahead of its fourth quarter earnings release in early February.Roku's third quarter 2019 earnings continued to show almost a mechanical progression in its growth. Key metrics revolving around revenues, user base, and user activity continued to expand at almost predictable rates based on recent past history. As the table below shows, user activity metrics remained with the ranges witnessed since the start of 2018 with the exception of user watch times a fraction higher than previous levels.(Data from Roku's quarterly results.)Perhaps the most important user metric, average revenue per user[ARPU] continued to rise and saw a slight quarterly acceleration compared to the previous two quarters as the table below shows. As long as this metric continues to rise on scheduled, Roku remains on track to potentially post non-GAAP EPS exceeding $2.50 in 2022 as I detailed in my previous Roku article.(Data from Roku's quarterly results.)With the recent launch of Disney+ and Apple+ from Disney (DIS) and Apple (AAPL) respectively, Roku could see incrementally positive user metrics. The first revenue driver would be additional sign up revenue from the company's existing user base. In addition, Roku could also see a bump up in registered users from new customers choosing the company's platform to access these new premium services. Although it's uncertain how much of a material impact these factors would have on Roku's bottom line, the company could post positive user growth headlines which could fuel a rally in its stock.One of the main bear points is Roku is extremely expensive in terms of current and even future earnings potential. Assuming Roku continues to grind away at increasing its user base and ARPU at the theoretical rate I projected in my previous article, Roku is trading at about 50x my hypothetical 2022 non-GAAP EPS. To grow earnings beyond this level would involve reaching user and monetization milestones that exceed those of current industry leaders today. In other words, bulls would essentially be betting Roku becomes the dominant streaming platform in the years to come.Gross MarginEven though the revenue side of Roku's business has been progressing on schedule, costs continue to ramp higher than expected. While not entirely unexpected since Roku did guide for lower margins in its second quarter earnings conference call, gross margin continues to inch lower with each progressive quarter. The annual trend in the company's consolidated gross margin should not be what investors should concentrate on since this figure was stable at 45.4% compared to 45.6% in 2018.The higher mix of more profitable platform revenues masked the actual weakness in the company's seemingly stable consolidated gross margin. Roku's future profitability will always rely on the earnings potential of its platform revenues. The company's other revenue stream, player revenues are expected to post gross margin around 0% in the fourth quarter of 2019 according to guidance given in their third quarter earnings conference call.The gross margin trend for Roku's platform revenues has been steadily declining in recent quarters as the chart below shows. In Q3 2019 platform gross margin fell to 62.6% which was the theoretical level I used in estimating the company's earnings potential in 2022. Continued declines below this level would thus require that estimate to be revised lower. Average Wall Street estimates have already been reduced by half just in the past three months to $1.18 in non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2022.(Data from Roku's quarterly results.)Operating ExpensesAnother potential concern has been increasing levels of operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues. In the third quarter, expense ratio hit the highest level since Roku became a public company at 55.58%. Despite impressive revenue growth, economies of scale have yet to benefit Roku. Combined with the lower platform gross margin profile, the company's main gauge for future profitability diminished to new lows.Guidance for the fourth quarter implies continued high levels of operating expenses. Although the ratio is expected to decline sequentially to below 50%, it will be more the result of higher revenues on holiday hardware sales than actual stabilization in expense growth. Using the most beneficial parameters from the company's guidance, operating expenses on an absolute dollar basis is expected to increase sequentially by 20%. Compared to the same period in 2018, operating expenses as a percentage of revenues are expected to increase by over 600 basis points.(Data from Roku's quarterly results.)Compared to the 40% operating expense ratio assumption in my theoretical 2022 earnings estimate detailed in my last Roku article, this profitability metric is also going in the wrong direction. Of course Roku still has a couple years to either accelerate revenue growth or realign expenses, but recent trends do support analysts' aggressive reduction of future profitability since the company's last earnings report.As noted in the introduction, Roku's stock has been consolidating on both sides of $135 with a high degree of volatility. With its recent weakness, the stock is approaching its 2019 uptrend support as the chart below shows. A declining resistance trendline has also appeared since late November which is expected to cross with the 2019 uptrend support near the start of February when Roku is expected to report its Q4 2019 earnings. If ROKU continues to trend sideways for the next two weeks within this pennant pattern, upcoming earnings could result in a very substantial move in either direction once ROKU breaks either these support or resistance trendlines.(Daily chart for Roku with pennant support and resistance trendlines drown in purple. 50 and 200 day moving averages are also shown in green and red, respectively.)One possible trading play near the pennant's apex as Roku heads into its earnings is an option straddle around the $130-135 expected pivot point two weeks from now. Currently ROKU would need to move over 20% in the two weeks after earnings to be profitable, but the straddle cost should be lower by the end of this month as premiums for the February monthly options diminish. Roku stock has moved as much as 33%, 44%, and 17% in the 10 trading days after Q1, Q2, and Q3 2019 earnings, respectively.Since ROKU is still in an uptrend with its 200 day moving average serving as support not much below current levels, bulls could open a call spread heading into earnings using the premiums from selling naked puts below support levels. This strategy could limit the downside to buying Roku at lower levels should it selloff after earnings but leave upside potential with the spread. While there's still risk should ROKU collapse after earnings, it would be less than owning the stock outright at its level right before its earnings release.Of course the risk remains ROKU could break down from the pennant. Continued compression of profitability metrics outlined above could be the catalyst for further downside earnings revision by Wall Street analysts. If ROKU breaks its 2019 uptrend support and 200 day moving average, the technical selloff could be significant. Using a similar strategy just detailed, bears could open a put spread with premiums from selling naked calls near ROKU's closing high levels in the past year.While Roku's business model has not broken, recent operating metric trends should cause those analyzing its earnings potential in real time to reevaluate future profitability to the downside. I had cautioned in my previous Roku article that even under generous assumptions, investors were paying over 50x earnings three years out. With recent analysts' downside revisions, ROKU is now trading at over 100x estimated 2022 non-GAAP earnings.Investors should also keep in mind revenue estimates have not been reduced. This means Roku would still need to continue to grow its user base at almost a linear rate and become a dominant streaming platforms years from now. So far the company has been able to grind its user base higher albeit lower margins and rising sales/marketing expenses. At some point the cost of this growth needs to revert back to more manageable levels otherwise Roku may never make money no matter how big its user base gets.Another important point I continue to stress is that Roku's platform really offers no additional added value to the user above any of its competitors. The company does not create content and merely distribute it. This leaves it vulnerable since its content providers could choose another platform based on market trends in the future. Roku may have to increase revenue sharing to its content providers to keep them onboard and thus margin could remain under continued pressure.In a full rally mode market with the Federal Reserve keeping interest rates at low levels, investors have been willing to overlook any walls of worry and pay premiums for extrapolated growth. If history is a guide, this market environment is not sustainable. To remain at current high valuations should overall market sentiment change, Roku would need to reverse its recent squeeze in profitability spreads. The company's upcoming fourth quarter earnings report coming up in early February will be even more important than ever."
4307747,92936,2019-11-19T12:13:16-05:00,"The company announced better than expected third quarter results with both revenues and adjusted EBITDA beating our expectations.
        The outlook for 2019 remains robust with management raising revenue and gross profit guidance. We remain bullish on the business and reiterate our BUY rating.
        We increase our target price.","(ROKU) Inc. operates as a TV streaming platform. It sells streaming video players and licenses its operating system to television manufacturers, which enables consumers to watch video content over the internet. ROKU provides its products and services through retailers and distributors, as well as directly to customers through its website. As of December 31, 2018, the company had 27.1 million active accounts. Q3:19 HighlightsPrimary RisksQuarterly Summary - Q3:19OutlookBased on strong Q3:19 results and continued momentum, the company raised its overall outlook for 2019. Management now expects a revenue midpoint of $1.106 billion (earlier $1.06 billion), representing ~49% YOY growth (up from an earlier target of 46%). The company raised its gross profit outlook for 2019 to roughly $492 million at the midpoint, up from roughly $485 million previously. The platform revenue mix is expected to be roughly two-thirds of total revenue in 2019, up from 56% in 2018. The company is guiding for stock-based compensation of roughly ~$84 million (versus $90 million earlier) and an estimated $10 million of D&A and other income. The majority of operating expenses are headcount related. The company is guiding for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $30-$35 million (earlier $30-$40 million) reflecting a ~$5 million negative impact to adjusted EBITDA in Q4:19 related to dataxu operations and dataxu acquisition-related expenses.Earnings Estimates For 2019 and 2020, we forecast revenue growth of 49.0% and 38.1% resulting in $1,106.6 and $1,527.7 million of revenue, respectively. We forecast adjusted EBITDA for 2019 to be ~$33.5 million, in line with management’s guidance of $30-$35 million. For 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA to increase to $65.9 million. Income from continuing operations is forecasted to register a loss in 2019 of ~$(64) million, in line with management’s guidance.Valuation and Recommendation We value ROKU using a P/S multiple since the company does not earn a profit. Given the shift in management’s focus away from hardware to software & services, we believe that Roku should be valued more like an internet software and services provider than a maker of a consumer device.We believe ROKU should trade at a premium to the higher end of the peer group range as a result of increasing margins, a ~33% smart TV market share, expanding user engagement metrics, and high revenue growth. We value Roku at 13x P/S multiple. We are applying this multiple to our 2020 forecast, and then discounting that result at our computed cost of capital. The discounted multiple based target is $155.78, which we round down to $155.75.The exhibit below summarizes our peer group multiples.The Exhibit below shows stock price targets using various combinations of sales and P/S multiples. Our sales per share estimates for 2019 and 2020 are $9.5 and $13.0, respectively.

Melt-ups don't happen in a vacuum; it basically means that the stock market is way undervalued and is being repriced higher, rapidly. It is the same as rust and a Molotov cocktail; both are the chemical process of oxidation, it is just one is a tad faster than the other. The exhibition of more companies getting bought or mergers going on means that the most important players in the market, the enterprises themselves, are buying companies outright while the price is still cheap. There are several interesting developments from the weekend and this morning...KKR & Co. (NYSE:KKR) confirmed the rumor that started at the start of the weekend that Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) was being looked as a private equity investment.WBA's market cap is $56 billion. KKR will likely have to raise $15+ billion in addition to what they have on hand to make this happen. This will be the largest PE acquisition by 25%. This will start a re-evaluation of how much larger sized companies are vulnerable to a PE bid. Perhaps vulnerable is not the right word; some companies would welcome being taken out of the public market.I am also suspecting that Warren Buffett will get out his elephant gun to take down this big prey. Unless of course, he has agita from the Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC) debacle.What does KKR see that we don't see at first glance? There are a number of ways that WBA could create value. KKR could copy the CVS (NYSE:CVS) route and find an ""Aetna"" to become a healthcare services business.Also, what if KKR is seeing what Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is doing with its Amazon ""Go"" business and applies that technology to eliminate huge headcount for the front of the store and to invest in the back of the store, the pharmacy and primary care business. Who knows maybe KKR licenses the technology from AMZN to do it. Think of the costs that would get taken out of the retail business, automating the shelf replenishment and check-out.We have to also make note that KKR was the PE firm that took down TXU for $44 Billion. TXU did not start out so swimmingly, though in the end it worked out so this shows renewed enthusiasm for big deals.Xerox (NYSE:XRX) is prepared to offer HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) almost a month for the companies to examine each others books as it seeks to win over the computer and printer maker for a takeover offer. Xerox, one of the biggest sellers of photocopiers, is willing to give HP four weeks of mutual due diligence so the companies can weigh the merits of the $22-a-share cash-and-stock deal, as well as the envisioned cost savings of such a combination.XRX is looking to reduce costs and perhaps along with HPQ find new ways to grow. On a melt-up, hope springs eternal. I just have to return to my cynical-self, could this deal have been taken seriously without the strength of the stock market?Blackstone (BX) – Blackstone took a majority stake in MagicLab, the parent company of dating apps “Bumble” and “Badoo.” The private-equity firm’s investment values MagicLab at about $3 billion.In another development of acquisitions, Open Text (OTEX) acquires Carbonite (CARB). The Boston-based cybersecurity company that has been shopping itself around for months now said this morning it has agreed to be acquired by Open Text for $1.42 billion, or $23 a share. Carbonite notes that the price is a 78% premium to its shares on September 5, ahead of a media report speculating on a possible sale.These are four multi-billion dollar mergers and acquisitions announced over the last 5 days. Is there any doubt that the market is making a big move to the upside? If the big boys are buying, you should be buying too.This Sunday I wrote a cautious note about the melt-up needing a bit of a rest. I still think we need to consolidate gains. We started down by quite a bit this morning. Perhaps we continue to chop around this week. I want to reiterate that I am not shrinking from my position that we are in a melt-up, and that we are in ""rest-up"" mode.There are still many market commentators that are resisting characterizing the market in such bullish terms. But the market is turning. Look at the utility ETF (NYSEARCA:XLU), it is down, and I would not object if you expressed a bearish sentiment in some put contracts. I would say the same for REITs.Boeing's (BA) 737 Max jet has been taken off flight schedules for both American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) until early March, as they await the return to service of the still-grounded jet, announced on Friday.What BA announced today that changed everything is that it now expects the MAX to resume commercial service in January rather than in Q4, but says it is ""possible that the resumption of MAX deliveries to airline customers could begin in December."" The company also says it completed a test of flight control software with the Federal Aviation Administration in a simulator, though regulators still must sign-off on new pilot training and Boeing needs to conduct a certification flight with officials.Market participants are treating this as another clue that the Max crisis is now winding down. I still see an upside to $390 because at this point there are many participants that now see BA as ""the boy that cries, Wolf"". Once the news comes in earnest that the Max will fly, BA goes higher.Alibaba (BABA) is on pace to post record sales for its Singles’ Day event, although the pace of year-to-year growth is seen as likely to fall short of year-ago levels. This is the 11th year the China-based e-commerce retailer has held the event.My Take: BABA had a fantastic Singles' Day, yet it sold off today. I think this is a classic ""sell the news"" type move. If you are a fast money trader, maybe you can track BABA and pick up some as close to $180 as you can get, then ride it to $200. That said, ANY Chinese company stock is not an investment or a long-term speculation, IMO. It's good for a trade that lasts no more than a week.Apple's (AAPL) newly launched Apple Card is being accused of gender discrimination by the algorithm that determines credit limits. Goldman Sachs (GS), which partners with Apple in issuing the card, released a statement saying it does not make decisions on factors like gender.My Take: This is bad news for GS, not AAPL. That said, this is the kind of bad news that is good news. If you have the patience to hold onto a name like GS and even add to your position as it falls, you will do very nicely with GS. I think GS is the best out-of-the-box Fintech play there is. In fact, if you are looking for a long-term investment that has some potential for alpha, GS is a name you should look at.Amazon.com (AMZN) executive Steve Kessel is leaving the online retail giant after 20 years. Kessel is a senior vice president who has worked on both Amazon’s Kindle e-reader and its brick-and-mortar Amazon Go stores.My Take: AMZN is hurting today, and likely because of losing this key executive.It is not too late to get in. On Wednesday night, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) was sold off ridiculously hard after-hours, and I wrote about this on this past Thursday. I won't bore you by rehashing it, but look at the price action...Source: tradingview.comAs I said on Thursday, this was an ""algo"" powered sell-off. ROKU was sold down +25 points, and then adhering to the script, the algos waited 3 days to the day and are now buying it back up. You probably have a few more points to the upside for a 50% retracement (also according to the script) and then ROKU should chop around for a few days before they start riding it back up higher.ROKU is up almost 6% on no news. It sold off, really on no bad news, other than it has been decided that investing in the business was going to be punished if there are no profits. If you take a look at the chart above, we gapped open down to $116 on Thursday morning from $141, more than 25 points. A 50% retracement means that 12.5 should be where this rally peters out temporarily, so that would be $128.So if you're a white-knuckle trader and you think there is real momentum here, ROKU is trading at $128 right now. I don't know if I would get in now. You could see some more points in it tomorrow morning; if you have the guts, fine. I would wait for that second retracement and jump on that. If you are following me, you know that I am long calls in this name, but I am also in a spread. So if ROKU does fall back, I might use that to roll up my short call.Terex (NYSE:TEX) was upgraded by analysts at Robert W. Baird from a ""neutral"" rating to an ""outperform"" rating. They now have a $44.00 price target on the stock, up previously from $29.00. 44.0% upside.Oshkosh (NYSE:OSK) was upgraded by analysts at Buckingham Research from a ""neutral"" rating to a ""buy"" rating. They now have a $105.00 price target on the stock, up previously from $96.00. 16.2% upside.Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) had its price target raised by analysts at Loop Capital to $1,450.00. They now have a ""hold"" rating on the stock. They noted that the move was a valuation call. 10.8% upside.Tesla (TSLA): Jefferies raised its price target on the automaker’s stock to $400 per share from $300 a share, noting gross margin levels that are consistent with sustained profitability.Chewy (CHWY) was rated “outperform” in new coverage at Credit Suisse, saying the online pet products seller is well-positioned in a robust pet care industry.Cisco Systems' (CSCO) stock was downgraded to “neutral” from “overweight” at Piper Jaffray, which points to a slowing macro environment in Cisco’s markets as well as the lack of any near-term catalyst for the stock.My Take: CSCO is reporting this week and market participants are concerned that Arista Networks' (ANET) disappointing report on a contract delayed with a big Data Center client. I am not sure CSCO is going to disappoint. ANET is a younger company with a much more focused product line and client list. I still believe that ANET is taking share, and they will likely win that contract.BellRing Brands (BRBR), the maker of Power Bar and other nutrition products, was rated “overweight in new coverage at Morgan Stanley, with a price target of $21 a share. The stock went public at $14 per share last month.My Take: Actually about 10 iBanks gave positive recommendations to BRBR. BRBR was spun out of Post in an IPO at $14. I suspect that these banks want more business from Post, so I am going to be a skeptic about this new company.The trades today are BA and ROKU. Just have some patients for both of these names. I think both of them will give you lower entry points tomorrow. If you are really gutsy, BABA goes to $200. Again, I am already in a call spread for ROKU. I would consider BA if it does come back towards $350."
4301062,71685,2019-10-31T15:07:18-04:00,Roku's stock is trading at a very high price to sales multiple.It is even higher than Beyond Meat's.The stock may decline based on the technical charts.,"Stocks and the way they trade can be funny at times and even make absolutely no sense. Take Roku (ROKU), for example, the streaming media device maker. It trades with a price to sales multiple that makes Beyond Meat's (BYND) stock look cheap. Yeah, imagine that.People will point to the opportunities that lay ahead for Roku, such as the growth of streaming media, and since the company doesn't create content, it can be the ""Switzerland"" of streaming media. Well, maybe, it depends on how you think about it.Apple (AAPL) makes a lot of devices and provides a gateway to the internet. The company also generates service revenue from its devices and gives its users a way to communicate with one another. Yet, Apple trades at a reasonable, and I would say cheap valuation of 16.7 times one-year forward earnings estimates and at 3.8 times one-year forward sales. Nowhere near Roku's 11.2 times one-year forward sales estimates or Roku's 235 times two-year forward earnings estimates.Yeah, I get it about the growth and the opportunity, the addressable market - it's about the rate of growth on revenue, yep. Analysts estimate that Roku will grow its sales by 48% in 2019 to $1.1 billion, then by 37% to $1.5 billion in 2020, and 31.5% to $1.9 billion in 2021. It comes to a compounded annual growth rate [CAGR] of about 38.75%. Not bad! For that growth rate, you get Roku's one-year forward price to sales ratio of 11.2.Then there is Beyond Meat, a different business, sure. But the bulls would point to the enormous opportunities for this company too. Currently, analysts see the company growing its revenue by over 200% in 2019 to $283.28 million, then 70% in 2020 to $481.7 million, and another 43% in 2021 to $690.06 million. It comes to a CAGR of 98.7%. Even faster than Roku, but Beyond Meat trades with a one-year forward price to sales ratio of 10.6, based on Beyond's current market cap of $5.1 billion, yikes!Then there is Netflix (NFLX), the company that makes the content viewers want to watch and the reason why Roku has devices to sell, and the company that invented the Roku, image that. Netflix is expected to grow sales by 27.5% in 2019 to $20.1 billion, then by 21.5% in 2020 to $24.4 billion, and an additional 19.7% in 2021 to $29.3 billion. Giving the company a CAGR of 3%, but yet Netflix trades for a one-year forward price to sales ratio of 5.1. The growth rate is about 25% slower than the pace of Roku. However, Roku trades with a price to sales multiple that is more than double that of Netflix.If Roku multiple should decline, it is likely to fall to around its previous highs of around 8. At that valuation, the stock would trade for about 29% less at a price of approximately $103.It seems hard to deny from many perspectives that Roku is highly overvalued currently, and the technical chart appears to agree with that assessment. The stock is now testing what could amount to be an extreme and essential level of resistance at $150, which to this point, has held firm. If the stock fails to rise above it; it would seem the first region of technical support would not come until approximately $135. Additionally, the equity has been rising on declining levels of volume, a sign that the number of buyers in the stock is declining. Also, it appears that a downtrend is forming in the relative strength index, a sign that bearish momentum is beginning to build.When digging further, the RSI has topped at overbought levels three times since March 2019, and despite rising to around 84 each of those three times, the stock has gone on to make new highs, a bearish divergence. If the downtrend in the RSI is now first starting to form, it could suggest that the Roku is in for a long-term move lower. The first significant level of support should this happen would come at a price of approximately $100.Investing isn't easy, and momentum is hard to predict. Momentum is mostly responsible for much of the stocks moving higher. When investors moved out of momentum stocks at the beginning of October, Roku's stock fell sharply. If momentum continues to be healthy and the company post strong results that warrant that momentum, the chart would suggest the stock rises and retests its highs around $180.Picking and choosing stocks is never easy, but when something doesn't make sense, there may be a perfect reason for that. Currently, Roku's valuation doesn't make sense to me. I have been proven wrong in the past in this stock. We'll see what happens this time."
4304664,104412,2019-11-08T17:25:00-05:00,"Roku beat quarterly earnings: 10 billion streaming hours, 32.3 million active accounts, 79% revenue growth and a $22.58 average revenue per user.Roku's main competitor is Amazon, not Netflix, Disney, Apple or HBO.Roku earnings estimates for 2020 and 2021 are $-0.29 and $0.6178 respectively. The company will have decreasing EPS in some quarters up ahead. Profitable by 2021.Roku may trade near the $100 area, as it's a major psychological region. Overall, my projections are quite high for this stock.","Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is a company that has proven nearly every bearish prediction wrong with consistent revenue growth despite being surrounded by steep competition and tech heavyweights in over-the-top media.Roku investors that have been long since its IPO have lived through three 50% price pullbacks. Therefore, the reaction to earnings this quarter was unlikely to phase anyone who has followed this stock for any length of time.I encouraged my readers to not be phased by market reactions when Roku was priced at $30, when it was priced at $60, and when it was priced again at $30. During that sell off, I said the company would become a tech darling and reach $100 in stock price in two years, which was bold to predict 200% returns. Of course, the company went on to reach 350% returns in a short time span of about one year.The market received Roku earnings report on Wednesday after the market closed. Streaming hours passed 10 billion hours in the third quarter, while active accounts increased to more than 32.3 million. The most impressive number in the Roku quarterly earnings was the average revenue per user, which increased to $22.58. This number has more than doubled since the second quarter of 2017.The Roku earnings report showed that quarterly revenue increased to more than $261 million. Platform revenue grew by 79% while ad revenue more than doubled. This was 50% YoY growth and was above the consensus estimates of $256.9 million. The company lost 22 cents a share, which was 6 cents above the consensus estimates of 28 cents a share.Overall, the company beat the consensus estimates, raised guidance, reported strong user growth, and increased ARPU.However, Roku has double-digit negative EPS and will for some time. Roku financial statements show that EPS is declining QoQ. Its consensus EPS forecast of -$0.28 compared to -$0.09 in the year ago quarter. Annual EPS won’t improve either, per analyst consensus, with -$0.50 ending in fiscal year December 2019 and -$0.43 ending in fiscal December 2020.Source: CNBCWe’ve already seen a few companies get crushed by the market if they have a small miss, which is the paradox for growing tech companies who are often penalized by the market by foregoing earnings to capture peak growth, which in turn, becomes rewarded by the market once it materializes into earnings. In other words, if Roku misses anytime in the next couple of years, it will be with EPS rather than revenue. The market, which is confused by the many OTT streaming services and hardware players, will penalize Roku. This most certainly will not be the last time the stock sees double-digit pullbacks.I also foresee the market abandoning Roku and many other solid tech stocks that aren’t profitable yet during the inevitable value rotations. Keep in mind, investors also did this with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) during 2009.As is always the case, the market has a record of underestimating small companies that are battling with other big companies like Apple, Disney (NYSE:DIS), Google, and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). This is why Roku still remains one of the most volatile stocks in the market. This also proves the affinity investors have towards brands rather than technology. Yet, it is the latter that drives growth in new markets.The nuances in strategy and technology are terribly important to understand in the crowded OTT space as it helps to have conviction when a stock drops 50% or more, yet then goes on to be the best performing stock of the 712 stocks with a market capitalization over $10 billion in 2019.Let’s break down what I mean by Roku having very little direct competition.Roku does not compete with Disney+, Netflix, or HBO Go because these are subscription services. Subscription video on demand (SVOD) is in a category of its own as the opportunity Roku is capitalizing on is Connected TV ads (CTV Ads). Advertisers are paying a premium for CTV ads, which is Roku’s market. The distinction between markets is important, and one that Wall Street missed when discounting Roku as a long-term opportunity by labeling it a hardware company for its first couple of years on the market.Roku directly competes with Amazon and Hulu, as they compete for Connected TV ad dollars. However, as the market is well aware, data is king as it allows for better targeting. Hulu has to barter data as it’s a single application without a platform or hardware (i.e., it shares and connects third-party data, including with Facebook). Third-party data is always weaker targeting than first-party data and could be subject to privacy issues.Discounting the hardware and taking a loss is an excellent strategy to maintain a moat on data for advertising. Both Amazon and Roku own the hardware, and at current prices, the hardware likely causes negative or very thin margins. This is similar to the razor-razor blade model, where you discount the razor to sell the razor blades for life.This positions Amazon and Roku for first-party data across OTT applications. Anything data related is subject to privacy issues and anti-trust issues. This is at the core of the controversy with Facebook and Google.Roku is again set apart here, as the company only does OTT. The company does not share the data beyond the OTT player it owns. Amazon, however, is collecting data in a way that could come under antitrust scrutiny as they take e-commerce data and broker this on the OTT player, which is anti-competitive with other ad exchanges.Amazon is well aware of this, and is being proactive rather than reactive by opening up its demand-side platform to other DSPs, such as The Trade Desk, which was announced in July of this year. On a side note, Facebook learn from Amazon’s playbook as reputational damage is hard to shake.Roku, however, does not need to worry about this as data never leaves the OTT hardware that they own, where they have a first-party relationship.Connected TV ads are ballooning because they combine audience data with the viewability and completion rates of linear television. Roku’s valuation at 14 price-to-sales seems high at first, yet the one-year forward price-to-sales is trading at 9.3 due to the forward growth opportunity in Connected TV ads. Roku earnings estimates for 2020 and 2021 are $-0.29 and $0.6178, respectively. Therefore, the market may still be lukewarm with knee-jerk reactions throughout 2020.For example, last November, video-first SSP Beachfront reported that ad requests for CTV had increased 1,640% from November of 2017. While this is only one company’s growth in a single segment, the opportunity is so ripe, it’s hard to quantify. More astonishing is that Connected TV ads surpassed mobile last year for capturing the largest number of impressions and video completion rates.Roku’s revenue growth will be exciting. However, the company is not likely to be profitable until 2021. In the third quarter Roku's income statement report showed that revenue grew by almost 60%. This was almost double that of Netflix and triple that of Google.Traditional metrics show that Roku is not a cheap company to own. Its forward EV to EBITDA ratio of 393, which reflects the lack of profitability. It’s not surprising the stock is trading in the range of $127-$131 following earnings, which was former support.Depending on macro trends, we could see Roku trade around $100 again as this is an important psychological level, as shown below. It's also along the 50% Fibonacci Retracement level and along the 200-day exponential moving average. Long term, I see Roku as one of the most promising tech stocks on the market and have provided projections to my premium subscribers.Knox Ridley, technical analyst, will be covering Roku in depth with technicals next week. He has guided many successful entries on this stock for our premium members, including an entries lower than $100."
4308159,105426,2019-11-20T23:44:55-05:00,"Roku's business model is routinely misunderstood.With 39% of the US OTT hardware market and 32.3 million users in the latest quarterly release, Roku is on track to become the dominant Connected TV Ad option.Roku is currently in its 4th Wave correction, and as long as it stays below the current resistance level, there will be chances for lower entries on a more long term.Above this resistance price point and we could see much higher prices.","Roku’s (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock price is up by almost 500% over the past two years. Compare this to the S&P 500, which is up less than 25%. That’s 20X more returns than the average stock.The upward trend has not been on a straight line. Roku’s stock price has had four major drawdowns that average about 52%. Two of these drawdowns were greater than 60%. Being a volatile company like Roku since its IPO is not easy, and it especially takes increased conviction to stay long on Roku as we approach the end of the current cycle. However, those that were insightful enough to see that Roku is not a hardware play, nor a content generating OTT play, but instead a Connected TV Advertisement play from inception, were able to hold Roku through the drawdowns despite market noise.In this report, I will look at the fundamental case for buying Roku stock. I will also perform a technical analysis of the company’s stock price, as entry and exit are crucial for high-growth stocks. This technical analysis reflects the choppy reaction to the company’s third-quarter earnings report.Roku is one of the most misunderstood names in technology. A common argument against Roku is that it is a small company with no moat in the streaming industry. They also argue that competition from cash-gushing companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will threaten its lead. In reality, the opposite is true. Roku may be small in comparison, yet it still leads with a 39% market share in OTT hardware in the United States compared to Amazon in second place at 30%.In the most recent quarterly release, the company announced that its users had grown to more than 32.3 million. This is nearly double what the company had in Q2 2017 with 15 million users. The average revenue per user has grown from $11.22 in Q2’17 to more than $22.The ad platform segment of Roku’s business is the fastest-growing and most important. It is also a high-margin business. In the 2017 financial year, the segment had more than $225 million in revenue. This revenue rose to $416 million in 2018. In the most recent quarter, the platform segment grew by 79% to more than $179.3 million.Another misconception about Roku is that it is in competition with the likes of Disney+, Netflix, and HBO Go because of the subscription service it offers. In reality, the company does not compete directly with these companies, even with its SVOD platform. This is because Roku is mostly in the business of serving adverts and using its data to provide a better ad experience than its competitors. My partner, Beth Kindig, covers this in more detail in her fundamental analysis (here, here) .The closest competitors to Roku are Amazon and Hulu. Comcast’s (NASDAQ:CMCSA) Peacock, which will be an ad-supported streaming platform, will also be a competitor, but only domestically. This is because these companies compete for connected TV ad dollars, and it's these companies that should be viewed as Roku's competition.Roku has an added advantage because of the vast data it has on its consumers due to owning the hardware. Also, the agnostic nature of Roku’s business makes it favorable for smart TV manufacturers. This is because it does not compete with them on the level that Google or Amazon does.One final note on Roku, valuation is a constant issue that bears have talked about. It is true that the company appears to be overvalued. The company is valued at more than $18.5 billion. This is a premium for a loss-making company that is expected to make more than $1.1 billion this year. The company has a forward P/S ratio of 9.9, which is a significant premium. Consider that companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) have a forward PS ratio of less than 6.The ad business worked out well for Google and Facebook, and the new realm of connected TV Ads should do the same for Roku. Roku is a dominant player in this field, and its growth is showing this. As the company expands globally to a predominantly nascent global market, expect this company to become a global force in technology.The volume activity in Roku tells us a lot about the current environment we are in, as well as what institutions are thinking. “Smart money” or institutions have teams of analysts and professional traders moving large amounts of cash. This typically shows up as massive volume spikes, coupled with noticeable changes in the stock price. The price at which they decide to buy in bulk, or sell in bulk, typically acts as new support/resistance that the price must push through.What’s noticeable is that around the $127 region, we went from seeing predominantly green volume spikes to predominantly red volume spikes. The zones in which we are seeing these large liquidations are in the $158-127 region.This will be a lot of liquidity to make up, and we usually will see a shift in momentum when the reverse occurs, – i.e., large green volume spikes coinciding with a noticeable shift in price. Until I see us break through the $158-163 region, with new increased volume spikes, I would be cautious of the current retracement back to new highs.However, it’s worth noting that this shift could be starting to occur with rising green bars suggesting a renewed interest. I’d like to see institutions take out large positions at current levels before getting excited. So far, the only large volume spike in this region has been to the downside.Insider buying is significantly more notable than insider selling. This is especially true when dealing with a high growth company that just went public; also, there could be numerous personal reasons why insiders are selling. But, it’s worth noting that most insider activity in Roku since its IPO has been selling with relatively few buying. Nobody knows this business better than the insiders, and what they do, or not do, can give insight on where they see growth vs. market valuation. It’s worth noting that no insiders are buying their shares at current prices, which I’d agree makes sense if you are a buy and hold investor with a long time frame. However, in the short term, there could be plenty of momentum left in Roku. Going into earnings, we had cautioned our readers that $131-127 was support and resistance was at the $156-158 region. Any trades in this region on this stock were higher risk. We were correct, as the stock dropped to $119 but quickly bounced back. It has now been climbing and has even posted some marginal gains since prior earnings drop, and we are approaching a critical price cluster.Simply put, if the stock price breaks $163 and closes well above this price, then I’ll be targeting above the $200 region before any major drawdown occurs. However, this will require a broader macro bull market. I think it is more likely Roku remains choppy with lower entries available than where it is priced right now.The internals support this position as well for now. In the above chart, the MACD has rolled over, and just recently flipped back up, suggesting strong short-term momentum. Until it breaks above the most recent high on the MACD, this could be a fake-out. The RSI is confirming caution as well. Until we can break the 70 line, which has historically indicated a bullish posture, I’d be cautious on the current uptrend as Roku continues to trade between support and resistance. We are currently oscillating between the 40 line, which has been a bullish support and the 70 line, which has been a bullish resistance.Many investors are playing momentum with Roku right now, and we believe this is the correct strategy at current prices. Going long Roku today should be done with stops in place or a systematic exit strategy to protect any gains. Therefore, Elliott Wave is the preferred method for increasing the probability for successful entries on long positions for a momentum trade, as well as set ideal targets for a more long-term time frame.Above is the 30-minute chart of Roku going back from its all-time high. My Primary Elliott Wave count has Roku’s stock price completing its larger degree Wave 3 push just above the 138.2% extension at its all-time highs. This is historically a lower top for a typical target for a 3rd Wave, which usually targets the 161.8% extension.At today's prices, If Roku can break back above the 78.6% retracement, take back the 138.2% extension and close above $163, we will likely see a push to the 168.2% extension before any significant drawdown that would constitute a 4th Wave correction (this is shown as an “alt (3)” and “alt (4)” on the chart). As of now, the evidence supports that Roku is in its 4th Wave correction, and as long as it stays below the current resistance, there will be chances for lower entries on a more long-term basis. However, if we close above $163, I will likely add to my current position on the next pullback with tight stops to play renewed momentum as Roku powers to new highs.Roku is one of my largest holdings and has been for some time. I expect this company to continue its trajectory with expected nauseating drawdowns, which I view as buying opportunities until the story changes. Wall Street has continually misunderstood this business, and even with elevated valuations, most investors still seem to misunderstand the space it is setting up to dominate.At current prices, a buy and hold position may not be wise, but if it can break and close above the $163 price range, I'll look to add on the next correction, as Roku powers to new highs. I will likely have tight stops on any additional shares I buy at current levels as I attempt to play any remaining momentum before this long bull market comes to an end.Knox Ridley runs a premium site called Tech Insider Research alongside Beth Kindig.

4300860,40781,2019-10-31T10:28:19-04:00,"After calling the bottom in Roku, here's where we see shares trading in the short-term.
        A look at Roku's $150 million acquisition of Dataxu and why the company will continue to be a takeover target.
        Short sellers and skeptics misunderstood Roku's business model and have paid the price.
        A preview of Roku's Q3 earnings report next week.","With shares up 300% this year — and as odd as it is to say — shares of Roku (ROKU) looked to have bottomed after touching a low of $98.08 just a couple of weeks ago.In August, when shares of Roku were trading around $135, we told investors that a pullback was coming and that it was a good idea to start locking in those gains after the company reported impressive second quarter results with a beat on both the top and bottom lines.It was a very unpopular post as you can imagine as we received a lot of criticism from Roku bulls who laughed at us and told us that ""we were out of our minds,"" ""uneducated,"" and to ""stop spreading fear."" Shares continued to climb a week or so after our post, however, as we predicted, shares of Roku came tumbling down — dropping nearly 50% in September alone — to fall right into our expected range of $100. Investors should remember that we've been bullish on the company for more than a year now — and still are. However, share prices are always fluctuating, and investors should always remember that ""what goes up, must also come down."" With the way shares were trading — doubling in less than a month — it was just a matter of time before the rally fizzled out and brought shares crashing back down to earth. As you can see in the image above, we expected shares would drop back down and fill the gap that was made after the Q2 earnings report in August. As we noted on August 14, with the volatility of the markets due to the ongoing trade war fears, combined with profit taking and short sellers doubling down after getting burned by Roku, shares were due for a correction. And that's exactly what we got. So the million dollar question is... now what?After a blowout second quarter on top of short covering, shares rallied more than 70% to make a new 52-week high ($176.55) early in September. We believe shares will test that level again and will likely do so before the end of the year. Of course, like any investor, we wanted to get the best entry point possible. After our thorough analysis, we felt the $100 range would provide a great entry point for investors who would step in and show support for the opportunity to ride the next wave up — especially for those that missed out on Roku's glorious run earlier this year. And that's exactly what has happened as shares have risen by more than 45% this month.Roku's glorious run over the past year has been fueled by short sellers and skeptics who have simply misunderstood Roku's business model. The company was targeted by some prominent names due to current and upcoming competition. Many were also were fixated on the company's hardware sales declining as well touting how unprofitable Roku was. But let's remember, being profitable is not always needed in the early stages of growth so long as the vision and business model brings a great return on investment. Amazon (AMZN) was like that for over a decade, Netflix (NFLX) struggled for years and who could forget about Telsa (TSLA) just to name a few. Over the past two years, Roku has continued to innovate and make changes which has helped drive accelerating sales growth year-over-year. In its latest report, Roku had revenue of $250.1 million compared to just $156.8 million in the prior year. As you can see in the table below, Roku's revenue growth continues to accelerate year-over-year (YOY) which each passing quarter.While most people think of Roku as physical box top that is connected to a TV, they are truly missing the most importance piece of the Roku story — it's platform!Platform revenue jumped to $167.7 million — up 86% YOY — while player revenue increased just 24% at $82.4 million. This is important because platform revenue (advertising, licensing and subscriptions) is what is and will continue to drive the Roku story, unlike player revenue (streaming hardware). These moves have made Roku the ""content aggregator king"" and also called ""an arms dealer"" by analysts because it hosts more than 5,000 third-party streaming channels.Unlike Netflix, which continues to raise cash and pour billions of dollars into buying or producing its own original content — combined with rising competition from players that have pulled movies and shows from Netflix's library — Roku does not face those same challenges.As more companies look at providing content, Roku will just continue to chug along and enjoy adding more channels to its collection. This was highlighted by Roku's announcement that the Apple TV app is now available on its streaming devices. Of course, shares surged more than 10% on the news as the company continues to show why its the ""content aggregator king.Remember, Roku receives anywhere from 20% to 30% in revenue sharing agreements when customers sign up for premium streaming services such as HBO, Showtime and Starz just to name a few. And with over 30 million users streaming nearly 4 hours a day, streaming companies want in on the action.For those who are not aware, Roku also makes money off revenue sharing agreements. Laura Martin, an analyst at Needham & Co. noted earlier this year that the Disney+ service would give Roku another boost as revenue sharing agreements could be worth more than $200 million a year for the company. This is a great example that shows that Roku is not competing against streaming players such as Disney, Netflix or Amazon, and is simply ""an arms dealer"" in the streaming world. As we noted earlier, Roku has really stepped up its game and made some bold moves to its business model. Instead of solely relying on player revenue with streaming sticks and boxes, the company has shifted its focus to platform revenue and integrating its operating system in smart TVs. These moves have allowed Roku to flourish as nearly 40% of all smart TVs in the United States come equipped with Roku's operating system and technology as it solidifies itself as the market leader in the U.S. streaming market. Last week, Roku announced that it has entered into an agreement to purchase Dataxu, a demand-side platform (DSP) that enables marketers to plan and buy video ad campaigns.Under the terms of the agreement, Roku acquired dataxu for $150 million in cash as well as shares of Roku Class A Common Stock. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year.Shares were down a bit on the day of the announcement as investors digested the news and what it means going forward. According to an article by Silicon Valley Business Journal, DataXu was valued at $390 million in 2016 and the $150 million purchase price is similar to DataXu’s valuation in 2012. This, of course, left some investors skeptical of the acquisition. However, the fact that Dataxu settled for $150 million and wanted shares as part of the deal, should be a welcome sight for investors as it shows just how bright Roku's future is. With the acquisition of DataXu, Roku will continue to accelerate its ad platform while also helping out its content partners to monetize their inventory more effectively. It's no secret that TV advertising is shifting towards over-the-top ""OTT"" services like Roku, and the company will continue to benefit from advertising dollars that are making its way over. With advertisers spending more than $70 billion on traditional TV — and while OTT accounts for 29 percent of all TV viewing — only 3% of TV ad budgets are spent on OTT. With its massive user base as well as campaigns highlighting the benefits of reaching unique audiences that aren't captured through traditional TV, Roku should be able to capture a bigger slice of the advertising pie as advertisers allocate more money towards OTT players due to shifts in audience viewing habits.So why is this a good move?One word: advertising.What do most of the top companies in the world have in common? They are in the business of advertising. Facebook, Google and Amazon — the big three — are expected to take in nearly 70% of digital spending in the U.S. by 2021. It's a very lucrative business and is why Roku is spending $150 million to help take a chunk of the $70 billion U.S. television ad market. After investors couldn't get enough of the company, to its 60% plunge from its all-time highs last month, investment sentiment has turned around as shares are on track to test news highs in the coming weeks/months. From a plethora of analyst upgrades to hedge fund manager Ken Griffin’s Citadel Advisors 5% stake in the company, Roku is back to being the market darling. As we can see from the daily charts, the stock has continued its trend higher after surging nearly 10% Monday after another analyst upgrade. Volume was 24.0 million, well above its average trading volume of 17.4 million. The next level of resistance sits at $150 and if shares can clear that, they will be off to races as it looks to test its all-time high of $176.55. With third quarter earnings on Nov. 6, shares will be even more volatile over the next week or so. We expect shares to hover around the $140-$150 range as investors make their moves heading into earnings by taking some profits off the table. Investors thinking about getting into Roku should remember that it's not for the faint-hearted with its wild price swings, especially on earnings day.If shares continue to climb heading into earnings, we would expect investors to take some profits off the table. While its future is very bright and although we expect shares to beat on both the top and bottom lines next week, we wouldn't be surprised to see shares fall after earnings due to investors having already priced in an earnings beat. We believe Q4 guidance will likely have to be raised dramatically in order to see prevent a sell-off if shares go into earnings trading over $160+. We are still a week away, however, if shares are sitting in the $130 range, the risk/reward is more favorable. But if we are talking about the $160+ range, we believe that shares have more downside potential than upside in the short-term. At that price point ($160), investors would be risking 20% in upside potential if shares tested the 52-week high compared to a 40% drop if shares tested support again at the $100 level. Unless earnings are terrible for whatever reason, we feel shares will most likely trade range bound between $125-$170 over the next three to six months. Below is a look at how Roku has fared over the past four quarters as the company has managed to beat expectations on both the bottom and top lines.For Q3, Wall Street sees revenue coming in at $256.8M with Q4 guidance coming in around $385-$395 million. This would represent a 48% increase YOY, however, that would represent just a 3% increase quarter-over-quarter. On the bottom line, the Street expects earnings per share of $-0.26.With competition ever increasing as companies look to start their own streaming services (Comcast, AT&T, Disney, etc.) Roku is in a great spot as companies face a build-or-buy decision. With over 30 million active accounts, the average revenue per user and streaming hours rising, on top of turning towards international growth, we feel that it is just a matter of time before a buyer comes calling. That is why we recommend having a core position in Roku and another portion trading its wild swings.While investors have high expectations for a company that looks to start turning profits in the next year or so, long-term investors understand that Roku is well positioned in the streaming space and will continue to benefit from cord cutters and ad revenue that will soon follow."
4300428,104227,2019-10-30T13:43:58-04:00,"Roku’s tremendous rise from its IPO price of $14 to nearly $150 today has led some investors to worry that the stock’s growth has gone too far.However, the company has a leading position in streaming and has used it to become a dominant player in OTT advertising.In addition, it is developing even more advertising capabilities and is now looking to compete in the $70 billion TV ad market.Roku is not overvalued because the company will be able to sustain its tremendous growth to 2025 and beyond.","The rise of cord-cutting and shift from cable to streaming has led to tremendous disruption in the television industry. While this change has caused headaches for pay-TV providers, it has created a tremendous opportunity for Roku (ROKU). Riding this wave, the company has been on a tremendous run ever since its IPO in 2017 and has jumped nearly tenfold from its IPO price of $14 to $146 today.Data by YChartsDespite this meteoric rise however, the stock's growth has not gone out of control and actually remains fairly valued for investors. This article will explain why Roku as a business is worth its $17 billion market cap and explain its growth vision and opportunity. It will also analyze the potential threats that investors must be aware of before investing in the company.The key reason Roku has been able to sustain its streak of success is due to its ability to continuously expand each segment of its business. In its most recent quarter, it once again delivered fantastic results and easily beat analyst estimates. Revenue of $250.1 million soared 59% YOY, with the biggest contributor coming from its platform business, which includes advertising and revenue share from subscriptions (for example, Netflix). It also greatly expanded its user base to 30.5 million accounts, adding 1.4 million from the previous quarter.These strong results pushed management to increase its outlook. Now, the company expects to deliver revenue of $1.085 billion in 2019, representing growth of 46% YOY, a rate that is even faster than last year, when it increased by an impressive 45%. Two-thirds of this revenue is expected to come from its platform business, signaling a continued shift away from traditional hardware sales that used to play a much larger role in Roku's business.Roku's financial results show that despite entering the third year after its IPO, the company is not slowing down. It continues to emphasize and make progress on its advertising business, the most important key to its long-term success. In addition, the company is rapidly expanding its user base and looks to aim higher after surpassing the 30 million user milestone this quarter. It is working to accomplish this not only by developing its own hardware products, but also by partnering with TV manufacturers to have Roku built in. Already, over 1 in 3 smart TVs sold in the US have Roku built in, making it the leading operating system for smart TVs.Source: IHS Markit DataOn top of simply adding more customers though, the company has also become better monetizing them. Average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 27% in the quarter, reaching $21.06.What sets Roku apart is its dominant position in advertising. As viewers continue to shift away from traditional television, advertisers have looked towards streaming platforms to promote their products. This shift is good for Roku because it has a clear lead in the streaming market, ahead of Sony's Playstation platform and Samsung's built in Tizen service.Source: Roku Q2 2019 Shareholder LetterThis lead, along with years of built up data and analytics, has allowed Roku to develop an edge in advertising. As CEO Anthony Wood describes, what makes Roku different is that it understands its users and can use this knowledge to help advertisers achieve their goals.Roku's advantage as an OTT service has caused views of its monetized videos to more than double from last year. It has also allowed Roku to create more valuable and efficient ad products to offer to advertisers. Back in May it launched Activation Insights, a tool that will help track and target viewers while they stream on the platform. More recently, the company announced the acquisition of dataxu for $150 million, a move that will allow it to streamline its ad buying platform for marketers.Roku's dominant ad platform is bolstered by Roku Channel, a service that consolidates content from different providers so viewers can have one place to go to stream movies and TV shows. This service accomplishes two goals for the company. First, it benefits creators by allowing them to more efficiently distribute their content. In addition to just being in Roku's app store, their content is also displayed in Roku Channel, putting it in front of even more viewers. Roku Channel also creates an easier experience for creators because it means they no longer have to go through the expensive process of creating an app just to be on Roku. Second, it serves an important function for marketers because it allows them to deliver their messages in a more direct fashion. Additionally, because Roku essentially controls the whole user experience, it can offer more flexible and unique products to clients and help them achieve better results. For example, the company has experimented with interactive pop-up ads to augment traditional video ads and is likely to expand those efforts in the coming years. These features set the company apart because they are simply not possible in traditional TV advertising.Altogether, the opportunity in advertising for Roku is huge. While the company has already achieved some success, the bigger prize it looks to capture is a piece of the $70 billion that is spent on TV advertising each year.Source: Marketing ChartsCapturing a piece of this lucrative market will be essential for Roku to deliver sustainable growth. That is the focus for management as well. As Scott Rosenberg, General Manager of Roku's Platform Business, described, ""we continue to drive great pricing but we're much more focused on the larger prize in our view, which is attracting TV ad dollars generally"" (Source).Beyond growth in advertising and attracting more marketers onto its platform, there are other ways Roku can grow as well. One such opportunity is by expanding into international markets. Currently, the majority of Roku's revenues come from the US market. However, as cord-cutting becomes increasing popular in overseas markets, streaming services like Roku are well positioned to replace traditional pay-TV and thrive in our changing world. At this point, the company remains quiet on its plans to expand beyond the US. However, there are signs that Roku is going to quickly embark on a journey of international expansion. As Variety reported earlier this year, one of the first places Roku plans on entering is Brazil, the country where Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) this year opened its first streaming office outside the US. In fact, the company has already begun to post job listings in the country, possibly an effort to prepare for the company's entry into the market.It is clear that Roku has lucrative growth opportunities ahead and can become an even greater disruptor in the television industry. However, even with high growth potential, is its market valuation, which at $150 a share is over $17 billion, justified? I believe that it is. This year, the company expects revenues to grow by 46% YOY to 1.085 billion. While it will still record a small loss on this revenue, the company is still in its growing stages and is not focused on increasing profits. So, the best way to evaluate Roku's valuation is by analyzing its revenue.As cord-cutting and the move to streaming continues in the upcoming years, it is likely that Roku will be able to maintain its rapid rate of growth. Assuming a 40% average increase, the company will have revenue of $1.51 billion in 2020, within the range of analyst expectations. Taking the same rate of growth, revenue will eclipse $8 billion by 2025. Now, this estimate is a likely high because as with other young companies, growth is likely to slow down after the first few years. But using a 32% annual increase after 2020, Roku will still have revenue of over $6 billion by 2025. Using net profit margins of 30%, this results in profits of $1.8 billion that year and a P/E ratio of under 10.Despite Roku's bright future, investors still must be aware of the threats that the business faces. First is the fact that the company has many streaming competitors. While today it has a sizable lead over its peers, this may not last as rivals such as Amazon Fire TV and Google Chromecast continue to mature and come up with new features that excite consumers. In addition, while streaming is likely to be the future of television, it may eventually move away from TV altogether to cell phones. Such a development would be detrimental to Roku.Also, Roku's method of recognizing revenue makes its revenue susceptible to short-term changes in the market. As CFO Steve Louden describes,In essence, part of the revenues that Roku records each quarter are just estimates. The actual money the company receives is tied to performance obligations and may change over time. Investors should be prepared for volatility in Roku's earnings.Roku has a fantastic business model run by a talented management team that understands how to maximize the company's value. The company has taken advantage of the change in television and has used the rise in cord-cutting to establish itself as a streaming powerhouse and leader in OTT advertising. As it continues to mature and grow its ad capabilities, it will attract even more marketers and be able to compete for the $70 billion prize: TV ad spending. Capturing even a small portion of this pie will be game-changing for the company and allow it to deliver sustainable long-term growth for investors. In addition to all this, international expansion is on the horizon and will be another catalyst for Roku. Altogether, its lucrative growth opportunities along with a track-record of success is why Roku today is worth $150 per share."

Every year since 1957, she'd get on cable TV to address her nation. But in 2007, the Queen did what no monarch had ever done. She set herself up on YouTube.Cable TV is clearly dying. Even an 81-year-old monarch knew it back in 2007! Those who saw this coming early on made fortunes…If you invested in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) back in 2002, today you would be sitting on 24,604% gains.But the party is over for Netflix. Have you looked around at the streaming industry lately? It's like a crowded bar fight.On November 1, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launches its own streaming service called Apple TV Plus. Just five days later, Netflix's fiercest rival Disney (NYSE:DIS) launches Disney+. (You can find my investment case for Disney here.)Next year, Time Warner (NYSE:T) is going live with HBO Max and NBC with Peacock. There's also Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) with its widely popular Prime Video and many more. See what's happening?The world's richest and most powerful companies are invading the ""streaming"" market that Netflix enjoyed a near-monopoly on for years. If you read RiskHedge, you know I've been warning to keep money out of stock market darling Netflix.This was not a popular thing to say when I first wrote it in July last year. But Netflix's worst nightmare has, in fact, come true, and the stock has been almost cut in half.There's, however, an ""invisible"" company playing a key role in this hundred billion-dollar industry. You probably use its service… maybe even without realizing it.It's being watched 3X more than Netflix. And it's starting to rake in hundreds of millions as the TV revolution enters a new phase. The best thing, it's not competing with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or any other streaming service.Instead, video streamers rely on this company - and even pay a cut to it!As you probably know, computers are powered by operating systems like Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows.They support the computer's basic functions and allow you to perform tasks like writing a document or surfing the internet. What you might not know is, these days, TVs need advanced operating systems too. They run in the background, and most folks don't know they're there.But they're very important. Without an operating system, your TV couldn't connect to the internet… which means it couldn't access Netflix, Hulu, or any other streaming service.When most people think of Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), they think about the physical box wired up to a TV.For 17 years, Roku had been in the hardware business. It was the leading provider of physical streaming boxes. 41 million American households now own a Roku device.But Roku's business wasn't flourishing. In fact, for years the company bled money. Until very recently, the stock went basically nowhere. Then everything changed.Here's Roku's stock chart since last December:As you can see, it handed out 234% in profits in less than a year!Roku's management turned its business model upside down. Instead of manufacturing TV streaming boxes, it decided to put its software in TVs and license it.I mentioned Windows earlier…Back in 1985, Microsoft created Windows, the first (and still by far the most popular) operating system for computers. 77% of all desktop computers run on Windows today, according to Statista. It was a turning point for the company. Since Windows' introduction, Microsoft has surged 144,000%.Today, Microsoft is the world's biggest public company! While licensing software may sound boring, as you can see, it's a very lucrative business.Now Roku is building an operating system for TVs and licensing it to TV manufacturers. This is the part of its business that's EXPLODING and shows little sign of slowing down…There are five main TV operating systems: Android TV, webOS, Tizen, Roku TV and SmartCast. The biggest TV manufacturers like Sony, LG, and Samsung all use one of these five.Roku is now leading the TV streaming market, leaving even tech giants Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon, and Microsoft in the dust:Now 1 in 3 smart TVs sold in the US contains Roku technology. That makes it the best-selling TV operating system in the country.But while licensing software to TV manufacturers is a lucrative business, it is not where Roku's biggest money-making opportunity is…Do you know what some of the biggest tech companies on earth have in common? They are all in the business of advertising.Google runs the #1 search engine on the planet. But it earns most of its money from selling ads. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) runs the #1 social network. But again, it earns most of its money from selling ads. Amazon runs the #1 e-commerce store… yet advertising is one of Amazon's most lucrative businesses.Roku is now in tens of millions of TVs, and that number is growing. And while its user base is one-fifth of Netflix's, its daily average watch-time per user beats Netflix's by 3X. Such an engaged audience is a dream come true to any advertiser.Roku now set its sights on building a next-generation TV advertising platform. And it's already paying off.Roku's advertising revenue is rocketing, as you can see below:And last year, for the first time, the company made more money from advertising and licensing than its device sales.Getting in early on geyser-like stocks is alluring. But you have to be careful with Roku…It has been on a wild run this year. As I mentioned, earlier this year, the stock leaped 450%. This month, however, it has taken a breather and slipped 35%.Most of it is emotional selling, which is practically impossible to predict. Roku shows huge promise. In time, I could see it doubling or even tripling from here. But if you're a buyer, know what you're getting into. It's still a small and very volatile stock.The upside is big… but along the way, Roku will likely continue to dole out big, quick drops. My suggestion: consider taking a small position today… but keep it small enough so that a 30% to 40% drop won't hurt too much.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

Q2:19 Performance SummaryPrimary RisksPrimary RisksWhat Exactly Is HappeningRoku Is DominatingSources: Roku Stretches Lead As #1 Streaming TV Platform in US After Record Q1 Performance: Strategy AnalyticsApple TV is not a competitor of Roku. Apple TV is an app that is viewable on Roku. Facebook’s new Portal TV is merely a way to communicate over your television. According to Strategy Analytics’ Connected TV Device Vendor Market Share Q1 Report, “Amazon’s Fire TV OS was the second most sold streaming TV platform in Q1 2019, with 12% of sales, followed by Samsung’s Tizen at 11% and Google (Android TV and Chromecast) at 9%.” Roku accounted for more than 30% of total sales.Comcast’s Xfinity Flex giveaway is not truly a giveaway. In order to use the Flex, you need to have the xFi Advanced Gateway Modem/Router. That modem costs $13 per month rent. There is no Youtube TV, DirectTV Now, PlayStation VUE, or Sling TV on the Flex. Why? Because these products are a replacement to Comcast’s core tv product. It would make sense for Comcast to make their own cable TV streaming package so that they can eventually attempt to re-attract cord cutters. These channels are all available on Roku. Comcast is not a proven threat.With respect to Q3:19, ROKU expects revenue to be in the range of $250-$255 million, up ~47% YOY at mid-point. Gross profit is anticipated to be in the range of ~$114-$119 million and adjusted EBITDA to be between $(5) - $(11) million.We believe ROKU should trade at a premium to the higher end of the peer group range because of increasing margins, a ~33% smart TV market share, expanding user engagement metrics, and high revenue growth. We value Roku at 12x P/S multiple. We are applying this multiple to our 2020 forecast, and then discount that target back at our computed cost of capital. The multiple based target after discounting back to the present is $141.70, which we round up to $142.00."
4299549,69965,2019-10-28T09:54:19-04:00,"Cord cutting seems to have customers running to Roku.
        Roku's Streaming Stick offers all the capability of the competition with none of the baggage.
        The company's runway for growth is far from over, like $70 billion in opportunity far from over.
        Roku seems expensive until we run some projections over the next few years.","One of Peter Lynch’s favorite mantras was buy what you know. With this in mind, I was excited when Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) went public, as I had first-hand knowledge of the company’s products. I didn’t do a lot of research into the company at first and within months of its IPO, the stock had almost doubled. I made the cardinal mistake of assuming I missed the move. I followed this mistake, by making one of my worst calls on a stock. I thought the stock was overpriced in January of this year. All the shares have done since then is move up in almost a straight line. Trying to ignore my previous blunder, and looking at the situation with fresh eyes, I can say Roku likely still has room to run. The company stands to benefit from many new streaming services come to market. Like the old pick and shovel sellers during the California Gold Rush, Roku should be a primary beneficiary of this streaming renaissance.It’s no secret that cutting the cable cord is a real thing. Early on, in order to cut the cord, you had to be willing to go without certain programming. In the days when Netflix and Hulu were pretty much the only options, if you wanted live sports you were sort of stuck. However, the momentum for cutting the cord seems to be picking up steam, due to the rise of multiple over-the-top (OTT) live TV streaming services.According to eMarketer, pay TV may have about 72.7 million subscribers in the U.S. by 2023. If this occurs, this would represent a decline of nearly 28 million since 2015. Depending on what you want to watch, cord cutting may save a lot of money. Research by LendEDU, “found the average cord cutting household in 2018 saved $115.33 per month after killing cable.”(Source: YouTube TV Welcome)Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) YouTube TV costs $49.99 per month and according to Cnet, gives, “more top channels for the base price” relative to its competition. Sling TV plays at the other end of the spectrum, offering two different packages for just $15 each, or $25 for the combination. There are many other options, but the point is the same: It’s no longer quite as scary to cut the cable video cord, because you can stream many of the channels through other services. The one thing all these services have in common, is you need a way to stream them to your TV.Roku said it sold one out of every three smart TVs in the U.S., and the company believes it is in one out of every five U.S. households. Roku isn’t looking to sell you goods or its own services like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN). The company doesn’t want to push you toward YouTube like Alphabet, it just wants you to be able to get to the services you want. If you happen to find the Roku channel, or its home screen advertising beneficial, then so be it. Roku could be thought of as the entrance ramp to the streaming highway.The Roku Streaming Stick and Stick+ seem to offer the best value and performance combination from the company. For customers who want to avoid an external device, they can buy a Roku TV. Since not everyone wants to upgrade their TV, let’s look at how Roku’s streaming devices stack up against a few other popular options.(Source: Amazon.com for Roku Express, Roku Streaming Stick, Amazon Fire TV and Google Chromecast)These first four options offer high-definition viewing on HD capable televisions, affordable prices, and built-in WiFi. There are a few key differentiators between the options that bear mentioning. First, the Roku Express offers the slower 802.11n WiFi option and does not include the voice remote option. The other three, include voice control, and the faster WiFi standard, but Chromecast lacks a physical controller, opting for casting video from your smartphone or other device.(Source: Roku Streaming Stick Plus)If you’re looking for 4K viewing, there are several options, but Roku, Amazon, and Google offer some of the most popular choices. The Roku Streaming Stick+ costs about $49. Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K runs about the same, yet the Chromecast Ultra is a bit pricier at $69. We can see that Roku has positioned itself right in the middle of its competition.There are a few considerations that Roku investors need to be aware of. First, Amazon has a history around Prime Day, and late in the year, of pricing its Fire lineup at a significant discount. Second, Google has been known to copy its competition on pricing. If these two companies decide to be more consistently aggressive with their hardware pricing, this could upset Roku’s hardware business and squeeze margins. This hasn’t been a consistent issue, yet it’s something to be aware of.Roku’s goal is to sell its hardware at a small profit to get customers into its system. The company said multiple times on its conference call, that it would push ASPs (average selling prices) down as a way to drive customer adoption.Roku’s main profit engine is its Platform business. The company sells advertising on its own channel, on the Roku home screen, and elsewhere. In addition, the company offers apps to streaming services. Roku usually gets a cut of the money being paid to access some of these services.This suggests a significant opportunity in front of the company. As new streaming services like Apple TV+, Disney+, HBO Max, and more come online, many will want to be included in the Roku app store. Roku can make money from a piece of these subscriptions. A much bigger opportunity lies in the advertising market that may shift over time from traditional TV.(Source: Marketing Charts – US Advertising Media Market Sizes)According to Magna Global, “OTT accounts for 29% of TV viewing but so far has only captured 3% of TV ad budgets. This same study suggests that an estimated $70 billion is spent on TV advertising. Roku is definitely not alone in going after this transitioning market.Alphabet said, “more than 200 million hours per day (are spent) watching YouTube on TV sets.” The company wants its prodigious advertising community to know that YouTube is a good investment, not only on mobile and computers, but on traditional TV sets as well.Amazon isn’t going to sit on the sidelines and ignore this opportunity either. The company says it has more than 30 million active connected TV users. Plus, Amazon has bid on live sports and developed ad-supported streaming apps to feed its Fire TV business.Roku business plan is different than its peers. The Roku Channel is free and ad-supported. The Roku home screen carries advertising for many products and services, but without an agenda. Where the Player division carries thin margins, the Platform division is a completely different story.Revenue from Platform (aka. advertising) increased by 86% annually last quarter and carried a gross margin of more than 65%. A critical stat for investors, is the relationship between Platform’s gross profit and the company’s total expenses. In the last quarter, Roku’s total operating expenses increased by 60%, while Platform gross profit increased by 74% year-over-year. Given that Platform generated more than 96% of Roku’s total gross profit, as this business continues to increase in size, the path to real profits is obvious.The point is while other companies are trying to be many things to many customers, Roku wants to do just two main things. One, sell its devices to as many people as possible. Two, help companies advertise to reach all the customers streaming video through Roku. With the company’s revenue expected to reach just $1.5 billion next year, going after a $70 billion market opportunity sounds like a long runway for growth to me.There is no way to get around the fact that by traditional measures, Roku looks expensive. Investors looking to hop on the streaming trend could easily go with either Amazon or Alphabet. Both companies are much larger than Roku and both generate positive earnings.Where Alphabet is concerned, the company’s forward P/E of about 23 gets investors an expected 5-year EPS growth rate of just under 16%. The company has beaten analyst estimates by an average of almost 15% over the last few quarters and carries a price-to-sales ratio of 4.6. The company’s traditional YouTube and YouTube TV services will benefit from cord cutters. In an ancillary way, Chromecast will attract users who would rather just use their phone to control their streaming.Where Amazon is concerned, the company’s Fire TV lineup is not about the devices at all. The company wants users to sign up for Amazon Prime and do their shopping through the site. Amazon’s stock isn’t what I would call cheap with its forward P/E sitting around 53. However, analysts are calling for an eye-popping almost 56% annual growth in EPS over the next five years. In an ironic twist, Amazon is technically cheaper on a price-to-sales basis than Alphabet at about 2.6.However, for investors willing to take on some risk, Roku could end up being the 10-bagger that Peter Lynch always talked about. For 2020, the most optimistic analyst is suggesting $0.07 in EPS. This gives the stock a crazy P/E of over 1900. On the price-to-sales metric, the numbers don’t get much better at 10.4. Where I believe analysts are too conservative, are their estimates for Roku’s EPS growth in the next five years, at 18%.Roku sells devices and advertising, but it expects advertising to become a larger part of its business over time. The company’s relatively small revenue base, and the fact that it really hasn’t tapped the international market, smells like opportunity to me. Roku’s revenue is expected to grow by about 37% next year to about $1.5 billion. Just 5% of the pay-TV advertising market would allow the company to more than double its projected revenue for 2020.As older TVs are replaced, there is a good chance users will choose a Roku product. The company is in one in five domestic homes and there is no reason that percentage shouldn’t climb as more customers cut the cord. Roku has been beating EPS estimates by an average of 41% over the last few quarters as well.Roku could very well see its revenue increase by 35% per year for the next five years. Next year that type of growth is already expected to be eclipsed, and as linear TV is further disrupted by streaming, Roku should directly benefit. If the company manages this lofty rate of growth, by 2025 Roku would generate about $6.7 billion in sales. Reaching this goal would only require the company to take about 9.6% of linear TV advertising budgets. In addition, this calculation supposes no growth in these budgets, or any sales contribution from its devices. This doesn’t seem like such a stretch when put in that context.It’s worth noting that Alphabet reported a net profit margin of about 25% last quarter. Though it may take a while, I don’t see a reason Roku can’t get near this number. Alphabet relies heavily on advertising as Roku expects to in the future. If Roku can stay focused on its core competencies, I believe a 25% net income margin is achievable.With $6.7 billion in sales by 2025 and a 25% net margin, Roku would generate about $1.68 billion in net income. If the company kept its share count of 114.57 million, this would work out to EPS of $14.66 per share. At current prices that puts Roku at a P/E of just over 9.Admittedly I don’t think all of this is achievable. Let’s adjust the math a bit. First we’ll assume the company grows revenue by 30% per year instead of 35%. This means the 2025 revenue number comes in at $4.6 billion. Let’s also assume Roku achieves a 20% net income margin instead of 25%. By this same time frame, the company would have net income of about $920 million. In addition, let’s assume the company must issue 12% more shares two different times to raise capital over the next five years. The company issued 12% more shares recently so this isn’t out of the question. By 2025, with two 12% dilution events, Roku would have about 143.72 million shares outstanding.With all these adjustments, by 2025, Roku’s EPS would come in at $6.40. At current pricing, this level of earnings puts the forward P/E at just under 21. Investors can probably accept a 21 P/E, from a company growing revenue by 25% year-over-year. The bottom line, is Roku isn’t for the faint of heart, yet its runway for growth is anything but over. Fast growth investors, Roku is the pick and shovel seller in the streaming gold rush, and it’s not too late to add this company to your buy list."
4297492,99986,2019-10-20T15:53:08-04:00,"Roku is up over 30% from its lows, after breaking its intermediate uptrend line last month.The stock was briefly on sale, but is now back to similarly lofty valuation levels at near 17x price to sales.I believe this rally is an opportunity for investors that bought the dip to take profits.","Roku (ROKU) has been a roller coaster ride for investors the past four months, with a 170% rally, a 40% drop, and now another 40% rally. While past tumbles in the share price of 25% or more have not been a reason for concern, the most recent plunge inflicted quite a bit of technical damage to the stock. Not only did the selling puncture the stock's intermediate-term uptrend line, but it also came on the back of significant selling pressure. Roku's revenue growth rates remain strong, with a two-quarter average of 55%, but the company's valuation is approaching lofty levels again after this bounce. A further push higher is certainly a possibility, but I believe this rally is providing investors that bought the dip with an opportunity to take profits. Outside of a massive beat on the Q3 revenue estimates of $243 million, I would be surprised if the stock made new highs over the next six months. (Source: TC2000.com)(Source: TC2000.com, Seeking Alpha Premium)Just over a month ago, I wrote my first article on Roku and discussed that it was time to take some profits on the stock. The stock was nearly 100% above its 50-day moving average and was up almost 400% for the year as it traded above the $163.00 level. The stock promptly fell apart, dropping below the century mark, but has since recovered the majority of its losses. While this push higher has likely coaxed many investors into thinking that the worst is over, I am less sure of this given the technical damage done to the stock. While previous corrections in the stock were somewhat normal and didn't dent the technical picture, the most recent drop has done some damage. Previous pullbacks were contained to 25% corrections, and all made substantially higher lows vs. the prior 20% plus correction. The most recent drop came within 1% of re-testing its previous low and was 44%, nearly twice the size of past corrections. This is abnormal price action and should have most investors' attention. When irregular price action shows up, it's best to take profits while they're there, rather than be greedy as it paid to be until this recent break. The below quote from Jesse Livermore applies here:(Source: Canva.com)In Roku's case, the stock broke down on heavy volume and has begun to act differently, and this selling pressure is the train coming at sixty miles per hour. While some investors may prefer to whistle through the graveyard and pretend that everything is fine, the technical picture is suggesting that there's a reason to be cautious. In this case, the best course of action is to take some profits or lighten up now as the stock makes a run back towards its previous highs.As we can see from a chart of weekly volume below, Roku sold off on the most massive volume it's seen since its IPO debut over two years ago. Generally, this will put an end to an uptrend, and more selling pressure will show up if the stock heads back towards its highs. This is because anyone that did not sell out on the initial drop is now happy to be getting a second chance to do so. This is the exact opposite of what we saw in December and early January when the stock saw near-record weekly volume.Generally, it's best to be greedy when there's accumulation, and quick to act when record selling pressure shows up. The bulls will likely point to the fact that Roku is now cheap as it's still 20% off of its highs, but this is not the case. Let's take a look at the company's valuation below:(Source: TC2000.com)(Source: YCharts.com)(Source: YCharts.com)The above chart showed Roku's valuation vs. Netflix (NFLX) when I discussed that things were getting too frothy a month ago. The stock was trading at nearly 20x price to sales. It's important to note that Netflix peaked at 14.8x price to sales, and therefore Roku's run to 21.0x sales was roughly 40% above the peak price to sales valuation that Netflix traded at. Even after this drop in Roku's share price, the stock is now back to 16.94x price to sales, more than 10% above peak Netflix valuation. Therefore, while a further continuation of this rally towards the $150.00 level is possible, it would leave Roku overvalued once again and susceptible to selling pressure. (Source: YCharts.com)The Roku perma-bulls will likely argue that Roku should trade at a higher valuation than Netflix ever did. Admittedly, this is a fair point if we compare the company's quarterly revenue growth rates. While Netflix was averaging revenue growth rates of 40% at the time it hit its peak, Roku has managed to put up mid-50% growth rates in the past two quarters. If we provide a 30% premium to Roku's valuation to account for the 30% higher growth rates, the peak valuation for Roku should be 19.2x price to sales. As we saw last month, the company shot past this level as it hit 21.0x price to sales. Based on this, I think there is a good chance that Roku saw its peak on a price to sales ratio basis last month. Why do I think this is likely? A look at the quarterly revenue growth rates below will better explain.As we can see from the below chart, quarterly revenue growth rates have averaged 55% above the past two quarters and 49% over the past year. The current Q3 revenue estimates are pegged at $241 million, and this will represent only 39% growth year-over-year. This would register as a 2,000 basis point deceleration from the 59% growth last quarter, and a 1,000 basis point deceleration from the past year's quarterly revenue growth rate. While estimates are not set in stone, the company is going to need a massive beat to avoid deceleration. Based on the $173.4 million reported in Q3 2018, the company will need to report $275.7 million for Q3 to avoid deceleration. This is a figure that is more than $34 million above current estimates. Based on this, it is highly unlikely that the company can avoid deceleration next quarter.I would classify material deceleration as any deceleration in a growth rate of more than 500 basis points from the prior quarter. Currently, the coming Q3 estimates are forecasting a 2,000 basis point deceleration. To avoid material deceleration, which would be a 54% growth rate vs. the last 59% last quarter, Roku will need to report $268.8 million in revenue. This would also require a massive beat on the $241 million estimates. There is absolutely nothing wrong with deceleration in a growth story, and it is inevitable for any company. The problem is that it can put a dent in a stock when a stock is already sitting at a lofty valuation. Based on this, Roku has some serious headwinds going forward, given the tough comps it's now up against from their prior quarters.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)Let's take a closer look at the technicals:As we can see from the daily chart, the stock has broken its intermediate uptrend line on the recent fall and is now running up to a resistance level at $150.00. As long as the stock remains below $150.00 on a weekly close, I would consider rallies as noise, and just oversold bounces. This current rally has undoubtedly been impressive in magnitude, but it has done nothing to improve the technical picture, which weakened considerably last month.The other problem is that this $150.00 level, which is strong resistance, coincides with a price to sales ratio of near 18 for the stock. At the time Roku will be heading up against tough resistance, it will be trading at an even more lofty valuation. For this reason, I believe the bears will be successful in defending any rallies above this $150.00 level.(Source: TC2000.com)Moving to the weekly chart, the distribution on the chart is evident, and not a great sign for the bulls. The beginning of the massive uptrend that started this year began with massive accumulation and one of the largest weekly bars since the stock's IPO debut.This sell-off has occurred on record volume, and the highest dollar volume ever for Roku. Record weekly selling volume suggests that some funds are taking some money off of the table. This is because 150 million shares traded on the week of September 20th, at an average share price of $124.00, representing over $18 billion worth of volume. $18 billion worth of volume is not retail selling; this is funds booking some profits.Given that we saw this type of selling pressure at an average price of $124.00, it's likely that this selling will pick up again above $150.00. This is because funds that didn't sell all the shares they hoped to will begin selling again.(Source: TC2000.com)To summarize, I believe this 40% bounce for Roku is just an oversold rally and would expect the stock to run into trouble in the $150.00-$155.00 level if it continues. Roku already trades at a lofty valuation, but now has to deal with the issue of strong resistance overhead. This was not a problem for the stock on its way up, as it was at all-time highs with no resistance overhead. I believe this rally to $139.00 is providing a selling opportunity and would be shocked if Roku managed to make new highs over the next six months. We likely saw the peak price to sales for Roku at 21.0x last month, and even at current levels, the valuation is not cheap by any means. Investors should be watching for a minimum of $250 million in revenues for Q3 2019, any miss on this number is likely going to see the stock re-test support at the $98.00 level."
4300339,105372,2019-10-30T11:01:23-04:00,Television advertising is a large market and consumers switching to video on demand could create an opportunity for streaming platforms to capture some of this market.Advertising on VOD platforms is a fairly new market and is still a relatively inefficient method for monetizing user attention.Roku’s streaming hardware and software is leading to widespread adoption of its platform which could lead to significant revenue growth if user attention can be more effectively monetized.,"Television advertising has historically been a huge market and remains important to this day, but as consumers shift to video on demand (NASDAQ:VOD) the question arises whether TV advertising dollars will shift to VOD as well or to other forms of media. I believe television advertising serves an important function, helping companies to build brand awareness, which is not adequately met by other forms of media. Data indicates that there is consumer demand for free or lower price VOD supported by advertising and if a significant portion of television advertising spending shifts to VOD there is a huge opportunity, which I believe Roku (ROKU) is well positioned to capitalize on.Global advertising spend is expected to approach $600 billion in 2019, growing at a rate of approximately 5%. Advertising spend is currently depressed relative to recent history, although the reason for this is unclear. The decrease in advertising spending relative to GDP coincides with the rise of the internet and possible explanations for the decline include increased efficiency of digital advertising and consumer attention becoming fragmented making brand building advertising through traditional means like television, radio and newspapers more difficult. While future trends in the global advertising market are difficult to predict due to continued rapid changes in the consumption of media, it remains a giant market which is increasingly dominated by digital advertising.Figure 1: US National Advertising Spending as a Percentage of GDP(source: ARK Investment Management)Global digital advertising spending is approximately a 300 billion USD market in 2019 and is projected to grow at a rate of approximately 10% per annum going forward. Digital advertising continues to be dominated by Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG) with Amazon (AMZN) also rapidly expanding advertising revenue, but the shift to online consumption of music, television and movies is creating an opportunity for other companies.TV advertising spend is approximately $215 billion globally and growing despite TV’s waning command over consumer attention. With VOD services proliferating it appears a tipping point has been reached in the consumption of television and movies and as younger demographics rapidly move away from traditional television, advertising dollars are likely to follow. If TV advertising spending follows viewing trends it is possible that US TV advertising declines from approximately 60-70 billion USD to 30 billion USD over the next decade. Figure 2: US TV Consumption vs Advertising Spend(source: ARK Investment Management)Advertising on VOD services is in its infancy and is currently an ineffective means of generating revenue given how much consumer attention it garners. This is likely to change as VOD advertisers improve the services they offer marketers and a larger portion of marketing budgets is allocated to VOD, increasing competition for advertising space.Figure 3: North America Advertising Revenue per User Hour(source: ARK Investment Management)While there is obviously a large opportunity, it is unclear how the VOD advertising market will play out and who the winners will be. Most companies competing in the VOD market either do not have an ad supported offering or are more focused on their subscription business. A fragmenting streaming market and a lack of low cost or free streaming services supported by advertising have created an opportunity for Roku, which it is capitalizing on.The current limited ability of VOD advertising to generate revenue is likely the driving force behind streaming services focusing on their subscription businesses, particularly for producers of original content who have large content budgets they must cover. Market data shows that there is consumer interest in ad supported VOD services and I believe this business will grow as streamers become better at monetizing user attention through advertising and as the user base continues to grow. Approximately 70% of Hulu’s viewers are on the $5.99 per month ad supported plan versus 30% on the $11.99 per month ad free version. Hulu’s ad business generated approximately $1.5 billion revenue from 25 million subscribers in 2018. Hulu’s advertising revenue of $60 per user pales in comparison to subscription revenues which can be upwards of $120-150 per user.With the likely decline of television and radio advertising in coming years and the continued decline of print advertising, a vacuum for brand building advertising is likely to develop. Brand building is distinct from targeted advertising in that it seeks to build consumer awareness of and fondness for the brand, leading to future not immediate sales. Brand building has traditionally been achieved through mass marketing or sponsorship and it is possible that VOD will replace television as one of the primary mediums for brand building.VOD is a potentially attractive market for advertisers as the audience is generally younger and has a higher income than the overall population. For example almost half of adults aged 22-45 watch no traditional TV. In addition, digital advertising can provide more data on ad performance to purchasers than traditional television by combining granular information of users’ viewing behavior and advertisements seen along with online behavior across devices.Roku segments its business into players and platform, with player revenue coming from the sale of streaming hardware and platform revenue coming from advertising, content distribution, audience development, billing services and licensing activities.PlayersStreaming hardware is a commodity product with most companies using their products as a means to drive add on services. Roku is no different, with their players merely being a means of attracting consumers to the Roku platform. Players are a low margin business and Roku’s player margins have declined over time as they increasingly use the segment as a customer acquisition strategy.While Roku’s hardware business is currently a source of profit and an effective means of attracting platform subscribers it is also a business which will likely face long-term headwinds due to demographics and changing consumer preferences. There is a general trend amongst American households to own fewer televisions and this is related to age, with younger households having on average significantly less TV’s than older households.Figure 4: US Televisions per Household(source: EIA)Figure 5: US Electronic Devices per Household by Age(source: EIA)PlatformRoku’s platform is the future of the company and if they can continue to attract users and better monetize their user base, it could be bright. Account number growth is being driven by selling streaming hardware, partnering with TV brands through the Roku TV licensing program and licensing relationships with service operators (50% of account growth comes through licensing partnerships and service operators).source: Scott Rosenberg (Roku General Manager of Platform)Similar to Roku’s hardware business, the Roku TV licensing program is a customer acquisition strategy which is unlikely to be an important source of revenue or profits in the long term. Also similar to hardware, the licensing business may face long-term headwinds as data indicates younger demographics have lower ownership rates of Smart TV’s.Figure 6: US Smart TV Users 2018 (% Internet Users)(source: emarketer)Roku’s primary drivers of revenue going forward are likely to be commissions on subscription VOD and advertising. They also have a premium subscription for the Roku Channel in which they resell ad-free premium content. Advertising is the fastest growing segment and I believe the future of the company. Roku’s platform business has relatively high margins, although this may change in the future if competition increases. Cost of platform revenue consists of advertising inventory acquisition costs, payment processing fees, third-party cloud service fees, content licensing fees and allocated personnel-related costs.Advertising revenue is generated by the Roku Channel which Roku Platform users have access to and display ads on the Roku homepage. This is a relatively new business but if Roku can demonstrate its efficacy to marketing managers it could lead to significantly greater revenue.source: Scott Rosenburg (Roku General Manager of Platform)Figure 7: Roku Advertising Revenue(source: emarketer)Roku’s future success is dependent on establishing itself as the platform of choice for the consumption of VOD services. Investors should therefore not be too concerned with Roku’s current profitability or cash flows provided they continue to establish themselves as the dominant platform in the market. Roku’s transition from hardware to software and advertising makes future profitability highly likely, particularly if there is limited competition in the space.Figure 8: Roku Operating Profit Margin(source: Created by author using data from Roku)Over the last several years Roku’s platform revenue as a percentage of total revenue has increased dramatically, a trend that appears likely to continue. The transition from a hardware business to a platform business has been the driving force behind improving profitability and not improvements in pricing or expenses.Figure 9: Roku Platform Revenue(source: Created by author using data from Roku)Roku’s Player business has low margins which have tended to decrease over time as Roku has increasingly used players as a customer acquisition strategy. Roku’s Platform margins are relatively high, although these have also been decreasing over time. It is not clear what the driver of this is, but if this trend continues it could be a cause for concern for investors.Figure 10: Roku Segment Gross Profit Margin(source: Created by author using data from Roku)Roku’s operating expenses have been relatively flat or increasing over the last few years. Given the importance of scaling the business, this should not be a cause for concern in my opinion provided the higher R&D and sales & marketing expenses lead to growth in the user base.Figure 11: Roku Operating Expenses(source: Created by author using data from Roku)Roku’s growth rate has been somewhat erratic but shows no signs of slowing down. This is important as continued high growth is needed for Roku to justify their current valuation.Figure 12: Roku Revenue Growth(source: Created by author using data from Roku)Roku’s user base and average revenue per user continue to increase which is a positive sign for the business. Roku’s average revenue per user is currently quite low and will need to increase significantly to justify the current valuation. For comparison Netflix’s (NFLX) average revenue per user is approximately $120.Figure 13: Roku Active Accounts and Average Revenue per User(source: Created by author using data from Roku)Roku’s competitors can be broken into segments; hardware, software, VOD and advertising.HardwareThere are a number of companies competing in the streaming hardware market, generally as part of a larger ecosystem strategy. Roku is establishing itself as the market leader, likely at least in part due to their neutrality toward streaming services and a strong position in hardware bodes well for Roku’s Platform business.Figure 14: US Streaming Devices(Source: Strategy Analytics)SoftwareThere are a large number of companies competing in the market for Smart TV software including Google, Amazon and Roku with some hardware manufacturers also developing their own software. The larger competitors in the space are using Smart TV software as part of a broader ecosystem strategy and I believe this will be a fairly commoditized market which offers limited profits.VODAlthough Netflix is the traditional powerhouse, competition in the VOD market is increasingly rapidly with Apple and Disney (DIS) launching services and other providers expanding their offering. Roku has also moved into this space with the launch of the Roku Channel. I believe increased competition in this segment will allow Roku to thrive, as a fragmented streaming services market where users have to subscribe to multiple services to access the content they want increases the value proposition of the Roku Platform. If the VOD market were to become winner take all or even dominated by 2-3 companies, Roku’s function as a service aggregator could become unnecessary.AdvertisingAdvertising supported VOD is still in its infancy, but Roku and Amazon are establishing themselves as leaders in the category. 70% of Hulu subscribers are on the ad supported plan and advertising revenue generated $1.5 billion in 2018. Amazon’s pursuit of live sports for their streaming services also places them in a strong competitive position as live sports are a natural fit for advertising. Amazon’s ability to integrate advertising and ecommerce is another strength which competitors will find difficult to replicate. If the VOD advertising market continues to grow it could also lead to services like Disney, HBO and Netflix offering basic packages supported by advertising. This could lead to the cannibalization of subscription revenues though, so it is not necessarily in the best interest of those services.Based on a discounted cash flow analysis I estimate an intrinsic value for Roku of approximately 150 USD per share. I believe Roku still offers significant upside but it must continue to scale users rapidly and remain a neutral platform which VOD companies are willing to partner with. Roku must also show an improved ability to convert user attention into advertising revenue."
4292493,23903,2019-09-19T12:25:07-04:00,"Despite rapidly growing revenues, Roku's profitability metrics have not improved with scale.Gross margin still a long-term concern for Roku because it does not own any content.Increasing competition by large branded content providers could completely eventually marginalize Roku's first mover advantage.","Roku (ROKU) has been on a tear lately. After its second quarter 2019 earnings, momentum continued to gain propelling its capitalization above $20 billion for the first time. While Roku's operating results surpassed Wall Street expectations, the company still lost money at the GAAP level. Upon closer examination into Roku's key operating metrics, little actually improved besides its active accounts, which drove its revenues higher.While investors should take everything into perspective since Roku's current valuation already factors in a lot of good news, I do not want to understate the fact Roku reported a very good quarter. In terms of revenues, Roku reported $250.1 million for the second quarter, which easily beat analyst's expectations of $224.9 million. GAAP net loss also surpassed expectations by a wide margin at -$0.08 in EPS loss compared to the expected loss of -$0.21. Roku also upped its 2019 midpoint revenue forecast from $1040 million issued in its Q1 earnings report to $1085 million. The combination of these factors sent shares soaring by almost 21% the following day.After dissecting Roku's earnings, many operating metrics were not as favorable as the company's reported headline revenues and EPS surprises. First and perhaps most important was that platform gross margins fell to 65.4%. This marked the first time since becoming a public company that Roku posted platform gross margins significantly below 70%. In addition, management guided for a continued decline in their second quarter earnings conference call:The vast majority of Roku's gross profits are derived from their high margin platform revenues. The company's hardware business normally averages gross margin in the high single digits and thus does not materially contribute to the company's overall profitability. Even for this low margin segment, management gave very low annual guidance which implied near zero margins during the holiday hardware selling period, compared to 7.5% average hardware gross margin reported in the first half of 2019:To compound gross margin pressure, the company's operating expenses as a percentage of revenues have not improved with scale. Revenues are expected to grow by over 46% in 2019 to over $1 billion. For most businesses with high levels of SaaS revenue, the billion dollar revenue mark has been typically where economies of scale start to kick in, causing operating expenses to drop meaningfully. Excluding seasonal Q4 quarter where hardware sales peak, Roku's operating expense percentage continued to hover around 50%.(Data taken from Roku's quarterly earnings.)As the chart above shows, the constant gap between platform gross margin and operating expense percentage caused Roku to post operating losses except for the seasonal Q4 holiday quarter. Even with the low 38.7% operating expense percentage in Q4 2018, Roku still managed to post just 2% operating margins since a large portion of that quarter's revenues were low margin(2.4%) hardware sales.The following table shows Roku's implied second half 2019 expectations based on its revised annual guidance.(Data taken from Roku's Q2 earnings. H2 estimates based on the high end of Roku's 2019 annual guidance with already reported H1 results removed. All dollar values in millions of dollars.)Again, what is implied for the second half is for continued gross margin contraction with relatively flat operating expense percentage hovering around the 50% level. Thus even as revenues continue to ramp higher at very respectable annual growth rates, Roku expects GAAP losses to accelerate.As I noted in my previous Roku article, the company gives a number of metrics which we can use to project its potential earnings power a number of years into the future. It's a good idea for investors to have some kind of indication what Roku could earn in the future since after all it's hard to value the company in its current money losing state. This section will revisit those calculations to determine if potential earnings went up or down after results posted in the second quarter.Revenues per Streaming HourThe first method I used was based on revenues per streaming hour. Although Roku's current revenue mix within its platform revenues do not current best fit this method, this metric should still be tracked and could have greater value in determining Roku's earnings power as ad revenue increases. As the table below shows, second quarter metrics were still within the ranges set in previous quarters.(Data taken from Roku's quarterly earnings.)My forward quarterly revenue projections were based on generous assumptions using the formula below:Quarterly Revenues = 60 million users x 3.5 hr/day x 91.5 days/quarter x $0.025/hr monetizationSince neither revenues per streaming hour nor average daily hours watched surpassed those generous assumptions, my previous earnings estimate do not require upward revision.As I also noted, the average daily hours watched may not exceed 3.5 hours per day so this may be a fixed long term number. According to Statista, the average American watched about 3.44 hours of tv per day in 2018. Nielsen projected that this number was around five hours a day among adults. By comparison, recent analysis estimated that the average Netflix (NFLX) viewer watched just 71 minutes per day. It's worth keeping in mind that even if consumers use Roku devices, apps other than the Roku Channel could be used thus potentially bypassing the company's monetization.Revenues per Active UserThe second method that can be used to project future earnings is with ARPU [active revenue per user], which Roku uses a trailing twelve month value. This method is overall more accurate providing average daily hours watched remains fairly constant since it better takes into account the recurring nature of its subscription and referral revenues. While Roku's ARPU has been steadily increasing, its annual growth rate has been clearly decelerating as the table below shows.(Data taken from Roku's quarterly earnings.)The deceleration is important to note because Roku's ARPU is based on a trailing twelve month value and thus slowing growth could imply recent numbers are closer to a top. We are not there yet since 27% annual ARPU growth is still very strong but if growth rates drop below 10-15% it would be a red flag for investors.The other metric needed to project future earnings from ARPU is Roku's active accounts which stood at 30.5 million at the end of the second quarter. As with ARPU, active account growth has been slowing as the chart below shows.(Data taken from Roku's quarterly earnings. The blue line represents sequential growth while the orange line represents annual growth. Q4 2018 sequential growth spiked due to seasonal holiday additions.)Since my theoretical future earnings projection assumes Roku will reach 60 million users, or roughly the level Netflix's US user base has stalled at, new additions would need to average about 8 million annually to hit this target by fiscal 2022. Despite annual growth rates slowing for this metric, Roku could still be on track to hit 60 million if annual additions maintain recent rates on an absolute level.If we assume ARPU can still grow at the recent 27% annual clip for the rest of 2019, then at 22%, 17%, and 15% for the three succeeding years following, ARPU could still hit levels required to reach my fiscal 2022 revenue target used in my previous article.(Projected ARPU growth assuming annual growth rates of 27% in 2019, 22% in 2020, 17% in 2021, and 15% in 2022.)Despite revenues projections for each model still on track to hit my fiscal 2022 target, Roku's gross margins are in question. My original assumption used generous platform gross margin of 71%. With Roku already guiding gross margin for this segment below 65% with hardware gross margin below 5%(compared to my original 10% assumption), my original earnings power projection for Roku three years from now already seem overly generous.While operating expense percentage hasn't improved and still hovered around 50%, my original 45% number could still be valid assuming Roku's expenses eventually decrease with scale in the next 2-3 years. Considering a large percentage of recent operating expenses(around 14-15%) has been share based compensation, the potential for operating expense percentage to eventually hit 40% wouldn't be inconceivable. Thus to project potential 'best case' forward estimates using generous assumptions, 40% operating expense percentage will be used in this theoretical example.Finally, using the ARPU revenue model detailed above and assuming Roku hits fiscal 2022 ARPU of $37 with 60 million active users, we can update theoretical earnings at that point in time.Annual Platform Revenues = ARPU x Active Users = $37 x 60,000,000 = $2.22 billionAnnual Player Revenues = $400 millionPotential Fiscal 2022 Earnings Estimate:If we assume share based compensation eventually drops from 8-9% of revenues currently to 5%, non-GAAP EPS would be about $2.76. Thus Roku at $150 is currently trading at about 55x potential fiscal 2022 non-GAAP earnings.This compares to three analysts who on average estimate fiscal 2022 revenues to be $2.73 billion and EPS to be $2.37. If this EPS estimate is GAAP based, then current expectations for fiscal 2022 call for margins to be slightly higher, operating expense percentage to be slightly lower, or a combination of the two compared to figures I used above.While the above theoretical earnings projection may be generous, it is still probable assuming recent trends resume for the next few years. Of course should certain key growth metrics stop decelerating despite growing scale or even re-accelerate to the upside, the projected earnings above could even be conservative. However the contraction in margins highlighted by management in the company's latest earnings conference call has caused a reduction in potential earnings estimation three years out, compared to the rough extrapolation made in my previous Roku article.Investors should keep in mind that while these theoretical earnings could be meaningful in three years, this time frame is an eternity in the tech universe. A lot can happen in three years considering Roku is competing with some of the biggest companies out there, such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Sony (SNE), Tizen, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) just to mention the streaming platform competitors named by Roku in its Q2 earnings:The key risk for Roku is the lack of content ownership. Roku's platform entirely relies on content provided to its Roku Channel which needs to be renewed every 2-3 years, and on content subscription services which it can generate revenues through resale or referral. While Roku had a first mover advantage and became the most popular streaming platform thus giving it an initial advantage, its content providers hold the real long term leverage.Providers who offer Roku content for its Roku Channel may want higher advertising revenue sharing ratios in the future. With so many competing platforms existing, these content providers hold the leverage to choose better terms after existing contracts expire. This may put pressure on Roku's platform gross margin in the future.There is also a risk content could be pulled entirely for their own service similar to what happened with Netflix when Disney (DIS) announced its own streaming services. Since Netflix still produces its own content, the Disney loss was bad but not catastrophic. For Roku, it could mean a complete disintegration of its ad revenues if lost content can't be replaced. In addition, Roku would also need to continually find new content to keep its existing users base active on its own channel.Prior to the introduction of its advertising business, Roku generated platform revenues through the resale and referral of subscriptions. The resale took the form of offering subscription services through a partnership with a content provider. For referral, Roku earned a 20% commission for subscriptions paid through its platform. Most likely referrals came from new first time Roku users who didn't already have streaming subscriptions and thus it was more convenient to add/pay for new services through Roku's platform than to sign up separately at the content provider's website for example.Again content providers really hold the long term leverage regarding commissions Roku can extract. The choice is limited for smaller content providers since their goal may be to expand viewer base at whatever commission rates each platform demands. It could be a different story for larger branded content providers.For example when Disney rolls out their Disney Channel at just $7 per month, it may seek much better terms than paying Roku 20% this subscription price. It could even force subscribers to pay directly to activate a new subscription instead of allowing Roku to collect the payment. It could even partner with an exclusive platform forcing users who want their service to switch platforms. As a result, Roku may have very little leverage in retaining revenues for popular in demand content.For this reason, Roku's long term platform gross margin may continue to see pressure putting the above theoretical earnings projection at risk. Without a content leverage, Roku also runs the risk of being completely marginalized as a platform. These combined factors should discount any forward earnings projection instead of granting Roku the large market capitalization premium it current holds. Momentum may continue to favor Roku's stock in the short term, but longer term risks have not gone away for Roku."

As a result, I won't be buying shares until we have a decent correction.","Source: MashableRoku (ROKU) is currently trading ahead of average analysts’ price target ($129/share). There is no strong signal that Roku will recreate its huge successes outside the United States. Due to a strong demand for tech stocks and stocks built on a tech platform, its valuation doesn't betray a market top. We have more room to go from here as data indicates a heavy preference for video streaming services in the near term. This is going to stretch the valuation and I won't be adding more shares above the current price.Bears are calling a top on Roku's valuation due to the level of competition in the video streaming space. When you remember what tech giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have done to their competitors in the early stages of their growth, it's easy to worry if Roku will survive a counteroffensive onslaught of Amazon (AMZN), Google and Apple not to add other brands like Comcast (CMCSA), Disney (DIS), and AT&T (T).What's Roku's competitive advantage?Roku pays attention to details where others don't. While most competitors are about gaining market share by slashing the price of streaming devices and TVs, Roku takes it a step further by curating the best and widest array of content for viewers. It helps content providers onboard new customers and it partners with TV manufacturers to include its operating system in smart TVs. It also provides targeted advertising to its viewers while providing measurement tools to advertisers to improve ROAS.Essentially, Roku doubles down where others stop. It is this extra effort that has helped in accumulating users and advertisers. A lot of detractors think content publishers will leave for other platforms. Given Roku’s current momentum, the company is fast becoming the Google Search of the video streaming market.I’m sure bears made the same argument in Google’s formative years that website publishers will pull out of Google's crawlable web catalog. In reality, content publishers need aggregators like Roku to survive. Platforms like Netflix (NFLX) need TV viewers for survival. As the chart below depicts, most viewers prefer to consume long-form video content using a TV.Source: VoxGoing forward, the likes of Netflix and Hulu need Roku to survive. Netflix’s success is Roku’s success. At 38% of the U.S. streaming install base, Roku is fast approaching the critical mass in which content creators won’t be able to overlook it.Roku has also stated its willingness to sacrifice gross profit in pursuit of market share. Roku will take the most hit in a market share tug-of-war as bigger competitors have cash in excess of Roku's market cap. Regardless, the future of video streaming is bright. A third of the U.S broadband household owns a streaming device, according to a Harvard business school research. In the short term, there remains enough to go round for big players. Investors can forget about profits from device sales as competitors are retailing their streaming sticks at next to nothing.Instead, the focus will be on the TV ad revenue, which will be the bread and butter of Roku’s revenue going forward. Added to this is the revenue from its partnerships with TV manufacturers to include its OS in new smart TVs, and subscription sales through its platform.When we examine these platform revenue streams, there is no reason not to expect them to keep growing. The UX for streaming video content will only get better as faster networking standards are released (5G). This will drive more households to cut the cord.Source: Google TrendsThe data suggests that Google Chromecast is already skating where the puck will be. In fact, if you check the YouTube search result, the Amazon Fire TV Stick comes up first. This might raise some skepticism about Roku’s ex-US market. It’s hard to see Roku raking in the same volume of revenue and ad dollar it is making in the United States.In terms of financial efficiency, Roku's operating expenses have increased while COGS has dropped. This is due to the mix shift in revenue from hardware to advertising. Operating margin hasn’t improved. Investors should watch out for the growing stock-based compensation as it serves to mask the true value of its free cash flow. This is often the first sign that we are deep in overvaluation territory.On its balance sheet, Roku carries $385 million in cash and short-term investment. Its inventory isn’t bloated though accounts payable and accrued expenses have ballooned in recent quarters.Roku trades at a P/S of 20 and an EV/Sales of 21. y/y, revenue growth is approx. 50%, profit margin is 44% while EBITDA margin is -2%. Given that margins won’t be improving anytime soon due to competition, I will be wary of initiating a significant position at the current price. I know some investors are feeling the FOMO pain, but it's best to keep the emotions in check as a correction at this point will be worse than a rally.While Roku has created technology solutions that will make it easy for consumers to access and stream their video content, there is no clear evidence that the business will enjoy the same level of success it is enjoying in the United States as it intensifies its global expansion strategy. The valuation suggests there is a strong probability for a final upward valuation ride. After this, it will dawn on everyone that U.S. ARPU is significantly different from non-U.S. ARPU. This will clarify all cloudy projections and kick-start the first phase of the correction of the stock.Investors should watch out for a rally towards a market cap of $25 billion driven by more demand for media and video streaming stocks in the near term. Afterward, let’s all brace for the unimaginable.Lastly, if a rally doesn't happen before the next earnings report, investors should brace for a correction as the stock has already priced in an earnings beat and a subsequent guidance raise."

The technical chart for the stock looks very weak and suggests the stock may have further to fall. Meanwhile, the options market suggests the quarter's results are highly uncertain, and pricing in a big swing for the stock. The stock is trading at a very lofty valuation and a significant premium to Netflix (NFLX). Additionally, there have been signs that average revenue per user has been slowing over the past several quarters. The last time I wrote on Roku was on April 9. At the time I thought the stock would fall to its then price of $59.30 to $55. That was proven dead wrong. You can track all the stories I have written on Roku and the free Seeking Alpha website on this Google Spreadsheet I created. Analysts currently estimate that revenue for the second quarter will climb to $223.3 million, representing growth of 42.5% vs. last year. Meanwhile, the company is expected to lose about $0.20 per share.The stock currently trades at 7.9 times its one-year forward sales estimates of $1.4 billion in the year 2020. That is substantially higher than Netflix, which trades at 6.6 times one-year forward sales estimates. It is also much higher than Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB), which generate nearly all of their revenue from advertising.In the first quarter, Roku had total revenue of $206.7 million, of which platform revenue accounted for $134 million or 64.8% of the total revenue. The remaining revenue generated was from the sale of its hardware devices. It's worth noting that the stock from a historical perspective is trading at its highest valuation on a price to sales basis ever. Also, for the first time, Roku is trading at a valuation that's higher than Facebook, Netflix, and Alphabet. It also would seem that if one based Roku's valuation on a pure platform revenue basis, and subtracted out the player revenue, that price to sales multiple would be significantly higher. Additionally, when digging into the average revenue per user (ARPU) it's growth rate has been slowing consistently since the start of the first quarter of 2018. That's mostly because growth for active accounts and platform revenue growth has slowed. There's no doubt that growth is healthy. However, it's worth considering that as growth continues to slow in the future, the multiple investors will pay for the stock will likely contract.(Data From Roku)The technical chart suggests that the stock heads lower in the weeks to come. It appears that a pattern has formed known as a rising wedge, a bearish reversal pattern. Additionally, a technical gap was created on May 8 following the company's first quarter results. The two patterns create a bearish scenario for the stock, which suggests that the equity could work its way lower to fill that gap to a price of roughly $70.Another bearish indication is that the relative strength index reached overbought levels as high as 82 - a level above 70 is considered to be overbought. The problem is the RSI reached those overbought levels when the stock was around $96 in May. The stock continued to rise to as high as $112 by mid July. However, the RSI began to fall despite the stock making new highs, that's known as bearish divergence, an indication that the stock falls in the future.The options market is pricing in a tremendous amount of risk around the quarterly results. The options for expiration on Aug. 16 indicate that the stock may rise or fall by around 19% from the $98 strike price. It means the stock could trade in a range of $79.25 and $116.75 by the expiration date. By comparison, the options for the S&P 500 SPDR SPY ETF indicate it could rise or fall by just 3% from the $285.50 strike price by the same expiration date. The market is suggesting that Roku's stock could see a move that's six times greater than the S&P 500 over the same period. As the options market would suggest, there's a great deal of uncertainty around these results. The company has done an excellent job of managing investor expectations in the past. Over the past eight quarters, the company's revenue has topped estimates eight times. It means that there's a high likelihood the same happens again. Should the company top estimates and deliver better than expected forward guidance, it would likely mean the stock moves higher. Based on the technical chart above, should that happen, it seems likely the stock moves back to its previous highs. Roku's valuation should give investors pause. If growth rates continue to decelerate, it seems only natural that investors pay a lower multiple for the stock in the future. Should the company disappoint, the technical patterns laid out above could play out following the results, which means a lower stock."

This quarter was 86% yoy growth while the previous 2 quarters were 77%-79% growth.Source: Roku investor relations, own calculationsWhat this tells me is that Roku is nowhere near saturation or that growth might be slowing because of competitors eating market share. As a matter of fact, in the Q2 investor letter, Roku shows a report from Strategy Analytics (below) that Roku's market share in terms of streaming installed base is now 39% in the US. In the graph, you can clearly see that the growth rate of the installed base is way better than all the competitors.Of course, this is due to the fact that Roku licenses its OS to TV manufacturers (for a fee), so the installed base expands much faster than if they would solely depend on selling their own players. But then again, Android OS can be found on TV sets from other brands as well, so they should be having that same advantage. Conclusion, it seems that Roku is beating the competition.Looking again at the numbers, total gross margin decreased to 45.7% from 48.8% in Q1 2019. This is slightly alarming although gross margins have been around 45% in Q3 2018 as well and rebounded after that. On the other hand, in Q2 2018 they were making almost 50% margins, so that's still a decrease when comparing to the same quarter last year.Anthony Wood, CEO of Roku had the following explanation on gross margin being down:The fact that lower ASP of players resulted in lower gross margin is known, as the strategy is to onboard as many users as possible on the platform. But he also mentioned lower gross margins resulted from a mix shift to video advertising and new premium subscriptions. Apparently, the margin Roku makes on premium subscriptions (Hulu, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) etc.) is lesser than what they usually make. We should be watching this going forward as Mr S. Louden (CFO) stated that:Elsewhere in the call, management explains that the consumer price of subscriptions (like a Disney (NYSE:DIS) + subscription) would be recorded as gross revenue, while the part that is paid to Disney is COGS. So, the net amount retained divided by gross revenue is the margin. Supposedly, the margin on these subscriptions is lowering previous gross margin levels.Also shown in the table above, operating expenses were 49.8% of revenue for the quarter, compared with 49.7% in Q2 2018. We would hope that with this kind of revenue growth, operating expenses would become a smaller part of revenue. Excluding stock-based compensation (18 million in Q2 2019), which is a non-cash expense initially, Opex would be 42% of revenue.This is an ongoing story, Mr Wood has stated again in the call that:I do understand him when he says this, especially the part about competitive advantages. At the moment, there are multiple streaming operating systems, and just like the OS on phones, only two have survived, iOS and Android. In the PC market, Windows is by far superior. I suppose he wants to increase scale and capture more market share at the expense of making a net profit. The risk here is that the expansion will be too slow, enabling capital-intensive competitors to put a foot between the door. I think he wants to achieve a platform with major scale first, before stopping with reinvesting gross profit.Another argument is that Roku needs the developer ecosystem. As happened with phone operating systems, the reason why Windows phone and BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) have lost is mostly because developers wouldn't make apps for them anymore. The lack of apps resulted in less people interested in using Windows Phone and BlackBerry. BlackBerry actually ended up using Android on their phones. So, now is the time to reach scale and get to the point where consumers and developers are so used to the operating system, that the ecosystem is well entrenched. Please refer to my last article on a general read on why an ecosystem of channels and apps are important for Roku.Another good sign is that Mr Wood stated in the call: ""not ready to reveal plans for international yet"" and "" personally spending more time on international"". It does mean that there are at least plans, but he is not ready to reveal them. This is more positive than the past few quarters where he merely said there was no specific development on International.I also looked on the Internet and spotted a job advert for the position of ""Head of European content distribution"" in Amsterdam. Netflix also have their EMEA headquarters located in Amsterdam. It's a good sign that Mr Wood is allocating more time to international, because we need to hurry up before that market gets serviced by a competitor.Then, there were these two lines tucked away in their Q2 Investor letter that was somewhat confusing:The good news is that besides the brands that already use the Roku OS, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) became another player to use the Roku OS. What is confusing is whether it actually includes TV sets or merely audio products. Either way, the fact that Walmart produces products under their own brand with Roku inside is a positive.All in all, a good quarter with positive developments. What I will be looking out for is how platform growth is going to develop from here, more news on the Walmart partnership, International developments and gross margin news. In the meantime, stay long and strong."
4283209,24849,2019-08-08T11:24:14-04:00,Shares going for substantial premium after rally.Slowing growth will limit future potential.Competition will not stand idly by.,"One of the street's biggest winners on Thursday and in recent years has been streaming company Roku (ROKU). The company had another impressive quarterly report this week, sending shares to all-time highs. While I have been one of the name's biggest supporters over time and started recommending the stock in the low $20s, I do think it's time to step back a bit as the valuation has gotten ahead of itself.(Source: Yahoo Finance)After the close on Wednesday, Roku again smashed analyst estimates for the second quarter, and the company basically always beats if you ignore the one-time EPS miss fueled by the IPO a few years ago. Revenue growth soared more than 59% over the prior year period, although the operating loss jumped a bit as Roku beefed up its operating expenses. Platform revenues were up 86% over the year-ago period, helping to fuel top line growth, although the gross margins of that segment dipped 430 basis points.One thing that worries me is that we are starting to see some meaningful declines in some key growth metrics. Part of this is due to massive growth seen in recent years and the law of large numbers, but it's still worth discussing. As seen in the chart below, quarterly sequential active account growth was less than 5% for the first time in this five-year period. The year-over-year growth rate for account growth has dipped from 45.7% a year ago to 38.6% in the latest reported quarter. Average revenue per user growth was less than 27% over the prior-year period, compared to 48% in Q2 2018.(Source: Roku quarterly reports, seen here)One thing that could definitely hurt Roku in the short term is the ongoing US / China trade war. Tariffs placed on consumer goods could either raise the price of the company's devices, or force the company to take a margin hit to keep prices the same. While the company raised its revenue forecast for the year this week, the new forecast doesn't include the impact of tariffs, of which the next round could start in just about three weeks.I brought up the slowing growth in the account base because Roku is likely to face stiffer competition moving forward than it has in the past. The chart below shows how the company currently leads the pack in terms of streaming devices, but are firms like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet/Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) going to stand idly by? Remember, it was just in the final week of Q2 that Amazon launched new smart televisions, and with Apple launching new streaming services this fall, I expect Apple to make a larger move in terms of devices in the coming years. Microsoft and Sony (NYSE:SNE) also will continue to launch new gaming systems that compete as well. (Source: Roku Q2 2019 investor letter, seen here) This all gets me back to the main point of my article, and that's the valuation of Roku. The stock jumped to $83 a share after the Q1 results, and it jumped nearly another 20% between that report and Wednesday's close. Now add another 22% on Thursday, and you have a stock that's currently at $123, a substantial rise from when I first recommended to buy. I'm surprised that we're seeing such a dramatic move after the Q2 report given the rally we already saw going into this report.When I first examined valuation for the name, I imagined a situation where the company was worth 5%-10% of Netflix (NFLX), which had a market cap of $85 billion at that time. We're well beyond that point now, with Roku approaching a $14 billion market cap now. Even accounting for more growth ahead, Roku goes for nearly 10 times next year's expected revenues, compared to less than six times for Netflix. Remember, Roku at this point is not yet sustainably profitable, while Netflix is growing its bottom line quite significantly, and Netflix's cash burn situation is expected to improve. Don't forget that next year's Olympics and presidential cycle will likely hurt total streaming hours a bit, something I've discussed regarding Netflix too.In the end, it's hard for me to recommend buying Roku after the stock has nearly doubled since the Q1 report. While the company announced another quarterly beat, subscriber growth percentages are starting to slow, and there's a good amount of competition in the space. The name has a history of major pullbacks, and President Trump's next round of tariffs could be the impetus for another decline. While I still think the company has a bright future ahead of it, I think the valuation has run a bit too far, too fast."
4268495,104682,2019-06-05T14:48:25-04:00,"Roku is a ""platform for television distribution"", focused on hardware creation, content distribution, and advertising services.The company trades at a high valuation, especially compared to their tech peers.They are issuing an additional 1M shares of stock that they plan to use toward working capital and general corporate purposes.Roku is focused on making TV better, specifically by building a TV-specific operating system.The space they are in is fiercely competitive.","Roku is a technology company that specializes in streaming devices, advertising, content distribution and creation. The company had 29.1M active accounts as of Q1 2019, with users streaming over 9.8B hours in the first quarter alone on the platform. The average Roku user is up to 3.5 hours a day in terms of platform engagement.Roku sells the technology that hosts streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu. The company has recently expanded into advertising, which allows them to collect information from the platform, including user registration data, audience engagement metrics, and ad interaction. They sell this data back to advertisers using the Measurement Partner Program, and they work with over 70% of the largest advertisers in the US.For their advertising partners, they recently released Activation Insights and Reach Insights, which allows brands to measure the amount of user engagement they receive through the Roku interface. For consumers, they released Roku OS 9.1 on April 9th of 2019, which allows for services such as voice command, guest mode, and different exclusive offers for users. The company is doing a lot in a heavily saturated space, and has built out key partnerships with some of the top players in the streaming industry. But there is a balance between growth opportunities and company valuations, and Roku is currently very expensive. According to my DCF calculations, they have an expected share price of $80.57, which is a 14.9% downside from their current price of $92.65. They are currently too expensive to be considered a good investment, despite their growth opportunities.Roku operates in two primary segments, platform and players. The Platform includes the Roku OS, advertising, etc. The Players include their hardware streaming product line, which includes Roku TV, wireless speakers, Roku Express, Roku Streaming Stick, and others. They've expanded their Platform revenue mix from 15.6% in 2015 to over half of their revenue by 2018, increasing at a CAGR of 102.9% over that time frame. The company earns a lot more from their platform segment, with their player gross margin stagnant in the low single-digits. They use hardware to get into people's homes, but the real growth opportunity is within the Platform, whether it be from subscription services or advertising dollars.Source: Capital IQOTT, over-the-top viewing, which connects user to content through the Internet, previously consisted of set-top boxes like the traditional Roku player, but those devices are increasingly being integrated into TVs. Currently, Roku's fastest growing segment are their Roku TVs, and they partner with Chinese manufacturers, like TCL, to create and distribute the product. TCL and Roku announced their partnership to build an 8K TV, which is expected to be released at the end of 2019. It is important to note that the trade war tensions with China could negatively impact them in the future.However, Roku has several different exposures through the television interface. Roku has built an operating system for TVs, completely separate of Android and iOS software. It's TV-specific software, which could provide them a leg up on the competition moving forward. Apple TV has its own OS, but Anthony Wood, Roku's CEO remains confident in Roku's product stating ""We’re much more focused. All we do is we come to work every day and we think about how to make TV better.""Not only does Roku have opportunity through TV distributors, but they are also increasingly expanding their advertising services. Advertisers can buy a range of ads, but ""every ad served on Roku is targeted, 100 percent targeted, one-to-one, personalized"" according to Roku's CEO, Anthony Wood. Roku sells their ads by audience, not by product or brand. They work with the advertisers to determine the potential target market, and they release those ads to the viewers on the platform that exist within that segment.On their most recent earnings call, the company said that advertising was the biggest component of their platform segment. This makes sense, because in order to reach users that stream, advertisers will have to switch to advertising over streaming platforms, which is where Roku comes in. Advertisers are becoming more optimistic about the opportunities of streaming services, according to a report from Advertiser Perceptions.Source: Advertiser PerceptionsThere is a 10% year over year increase in video advertising, with advertisers increasingly focused on using TV for generating brand awareness, represented by upper funnel marketing. Middle funnel marketing represents conversion, so getting users to switch from one product or service to another. For OTT/Connected TV, advertisers are equally as likely to use that specific platform for generating awareness as well as conversion, which is promising for future growth across advertising opportunities.Disney recently announced that Disney Plus would be streamed on the PS4 and Roku, which could give Roku a boost when that product is released in November. Roku will get a share of revenue when people sign up for the service, which could be worth $200M a year, and could boost the market value of the company by 15%.However, the company has other barriers that it will have to work through, including a drop in ad revenue growth as well as fierce competition in the streaming space. Apple TV created tvOs, which allows users to personalize their Apple TV interface. Google, Amazon, and others are all gaining on Roku as well, and it could be hard for the company to keep up in the future.Source: E Marketer The Growth of CompetitorsThe company has a large focus on hardware, but their business model surrounds services and advertising, as well as content distribution.They make money when their users subscribe to services like HBO or Showtime, not when they sell their Smart TVs. That incentivizes the company to keep strong ties with the streaming platforms. The hardware that they sell is just a gateway into consumer households. The company is really focused on generating advertising dollars as well as subscriptions services.However, the company must maintain focus on the hardware, especially as streaming players get built into Smart TVs. That's why they focus on the Roku TV, as well as their various streaming options. They are currently the #1 selling smart TV in the US, with estimates that 1 out of every 3 smart TVs sold were Roku.Source: Broadband TV NewsInternationally, Google Chromecast is preferred by 1 in 3 consumers, and the Amazon Fire TV stick is number one in both the UK and Germany. Amazon Fire TV has over 34M active users, as compared to Roku's 29.1M user base. Roku still dominates the US market, but the other players are quickly catching up.The company's revenue is expected to grow well into the future, surpassing $1.04B in 2019. They currently operate at a net loss, and they are expected to continue to do so until 2021, according to estimates from Capital IQ.Source: Market RealistTheir growth is driven primarily from inflows from their ads and licensing segment. Their hardware revenue rose only 17.9% year over year, as compared to their 78.7% year over year growth in Platform revenue, which has stagnated in recent quarters. Source: Capital IQBecause they don't make any money, their profitability metrics are all negative. They do have a strong gross margin of 45.5%, which is generated primarily from platform revenue. The company believes that gross margin is the best indicator of their performance, especially because their platform and their player service are so different in terms of industry profile.They've increased their gross margin by 16.6% since 2015, which is strong, especially if they can continue to expand that growth into the future. Gross profit has increased to $369.9M for Q1 2019, a 60% increase year over year. Source: Capital IQThe company currently has no outstanding debt, leaving them entirely financed by equity. They filed to issue 1M more shares, with the ""proceeds going towards working capital and general corporate purposes"". They had $15M of debt in 2016, which they've paid off over the past two years. They have a strong debt management metrics, with a current ratio at 2.2x and a quick ratio of 2.0x. Overall, they have a strong credit health panel, weighed down only by operational metrics due to their negative profitability metrics.Source: Capital IQ Roku has a strong network of dealers and suppliers, as well as first mover advantage in an increasingly saturated market. There is a certain degree of brand recognition, especially as the company continues to capitalize upon the different brand opportunities, such as the Disney deal. Streaming will only increase in popularity within the next few years, and the company is primed to benefit from that growth.However, their business model is relatively easy to imitate, and easily replaceable if the top players decide to do it on their own. Their biggest competitors are much larger than they are, and Roku's existing contracts are short term, and can be easily disrupted. Roku does carry a network of almost 30M accounts, which could keep them in the game for a while longer.Source: Business InsiderHowever, the company is overvalued. It carries a 10.9x EV / EBITDA, outpacing even Netflix, a notoriously expensive company based on valuation metrics. They are up 142% over the past year, which would have been a phenomenal buy a year ago. But today, it appears that they don't have much more room to the upside after that run.According to my discounted cash flow calculations, Roku has a $80.57 expected share price, as shown in the sensitivity analysis below. That would represent a 13.7% downside from where the company is current share price. Roku is definitely built for growth, but they are simply too expensive right now. Source: AuthorThere is a lot of uncertainty in their business too. One thing to keep in mind is the antitrust investigation of Google and Apple. It is doubtful that this will provide any immediate call-to-action, but it could be beneficial to Roku in the long run, by potentially stemming the growth of Android TV and Apple TV, respectively. However, it could also be damaging by taking away key partnerships, and result in a growth contraction across the whole industry. The US-China trade uncertainty is also another important risk factor to consider.On a more realistic note, Roku doesn't have long term contracts with any of their partners, and the competition is fierce, and only growing more intense. They have no plans to produce their own content, so their content-brokerage business could be easily disrupted by the top players, who produce their own content, and then decide to produce their own hardware. Roku's growth has definitely been strong and it's had a strong run this past year, and it could continue on an up trend. However, it might be best to err on the side of caution with this stock. Balancing optimism about a company with the financial metrics is always a tough call, but Roku is simply too expensive right now."
4262255,103709,2019-05-09T18:45:36-04:00,"Roku reported a great quarter, beating my expectations.Next quarter, I hope to see 30.6 million active accounts, an ARPU of $20.79, and 9.7 billion streaming hours.Based on a discounted cash flow valuation, I value Roku at $100.","Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) beat expectations in its first quarter earnings on Monday. This has reset analyst expectations higher and sent the price to an all-time high, up 27% on the day and 190% from its December 2018 lows.Given these large gains, my first thought is whether shares have gained too much - is Roku still worth holding at this price? To answer that question, I turn to a discount cash flow valuation.In the first quarter of 2019, Roku reported $207 million in revenue, $10 million in adjusted EBITDA, and an $11 million loss from operations.Source: Roku guidance from Roku earnings release.Roku provides guidance on four metrics each quarter: Revenue, gross profit, net income, and adjusted EBITDA. Roku gives a range for each metric both for the next quarter and for the full year. Roku beat its guidance on each of these four metrics and raised its annual guidance for each of these four metrics.A beat-and-raise is par for the course for Roku. Roku first provided quarterly guidance for the next quarter in Q3/17 and has beaten the midpoint of its guidance in all four metrics every time since then - a 24/24 success rate for ""beat"". Similarly, Roku first provided annual guidance in Q4/17 and has raised its annual guidance, on both the lower and upper ends of the range, at every single opportunity with a single exception (the upper end of net income guidance was reduced in Q3/18) - a 31/32 success rate for ""raise"".This suggests both that Roku provides conservative guidance and that Roku is growing as quickly as the company expects, if not faster.Source: Roku guidance from Roku earnings release.In their earnings release, Roku singles out three metrics as its key operating metrics: Active accounts, streaming hours, and annual revenue per user (""ARPU"").As shown above, each of these metrics increased in the first quarter, with annual growth rates of 40%, 74%, and 27%.Each of these metrics is an important measure for Roku and its investors:Note that selling Roku players is largely irrelevant to Roku's value. Selling Roku devices is a low-margin business, and those sales are only relevant to Roku's operations to the extent they affect active accounts. Because of this, Roku splits its revenue into two segments: Player revenue and platform revenue.In contrast, Roku's ARPU refers to platform revenue. This revenue is earned when a Roku user watches an advertisement on their Roku (in the menu or in apps) or when a user subscribes to a pay service through their Roku device.Since 2014, Roku has grown from a platform of 4.4 million accounts, generating $3.80/user, to a platform of 29.1 million accounts, generating $19.06/user.During that five-year period, Roku's active accounts have grown at an average rate (geometric) of 46%, while Roku's ARPU has grown at an average rate of 38%. Both growth rates have slowed down during the past five years. During the past years, active accounts have grown at 40%, while ARPU has grown at 27%.Roku's platform revenue grows at about the product of these two growth rates - multiply user growth and revenue/user growth to get revenue growth. Roku's platform revenue was up 78% YoY in the first quarter of 2019.As before, Roku's player revenue is largely irrelevant here. Player revenue has been ~flat for the past four years and is likely to remain flat or decline, as more smart televisions ship that have Roku's television operating system built in. During the first quarter, Roku's OS was said to be in one-third of televisions shipped in the United States in the first quarter, up from one-quarter in prior quarters.Roku is gaining market share in a secular growth market. Roku is also monetizing its users better than it ever has before, generating more revenue per user.I value Roku shares at $100/share, based on a discounted cash flow using a 10% discount rate.This valuation is primarily based on two very speculative projections of active accounts and ARPU over the next ten years.Active accounts: Over the next ten years, I have modeled active account growth to slow down from its current 40% annual growth rate to 37% in 2019 and to further slow down each year past that until settling in on a single-digit growth rate in the far future.This model results in Roku have 146 million active accounts in 2028. This figure is close to Netflix's (NFLX) paid membership in Q1/19 (148.86 million), but will be much lower than Netflix's size in 2028, provided Netflix doesn't implode along the way.As with any forward projection, I expect that other investors will have wildly different ideas on how big Roku may or may not get. For example, skeptics may believe that this size is far too high as perhaps competitors will muscle Roku out of the marketplace. Conversely, the dreamers among us may expect Roku's growth to accelerate rather than decelerate, perhaps driving Roku to expand from its U.S. footprint into a strong international presence akin to Netflix.ARPU: While I project a gradual slowdown of revenue, I am projecting a much faster decline for revenue/user. In this model, annual revenue per user will quickly decline from a 27% YoY growth rate in Q1/19 to only a 3% annual (and terminal) growth rate by 2023.This rapid slowdown is based on the slowdown from 2017 to 2018 (from 49% growth to 30% growth) and based on logic. When Roku's video library was unmonetized, and Roku made very little from any streaming user, it was easy to add paths to monetization. For example, the addition of the Roku Channel and other advertising-supported content allowed Roku to provide users with free content and allowed Roku to earn advertising revenue.However, once Roku has fully monetized its users, through both advertisements and through users subscribing to pay services through their Roku device, there is relatively little Roku can do to further monetize their product outside of major innovations that, frankly, I haven't thought up. (Luckily, it isn't my job to think up innovations for Roku.)As a result, I am modeling a relatively rapid slowdown in ARPU growth as the platform becomes fully-monetized. Past that point, ARPU growth will be slow and driven by inflation and the rising price of advertising and ad-free content.Profitability: The rest of my model is built on a few further assumptions and results in the above revenue and margins.This model is built on stable gross margins for both the platform and player segments. Gross margins for each segment are set to be stable at their trailing-year rate, or about 10% for player revenue and 70% for platform revenue.This model is further built on modeling that operating costs will decline as a percentage of revenue as Roku achieves operating leverage. During 2018, Roku spent 46.5% of its revenue on operating costs, up from 42.8% during 2017. In this model, I have begun with 46.5% operating costs and modeled that operating costs will decline to 38% over revenue over the next five years and will then be stable at 38%. In my view, this is a relatively conservative model, given anticipated revenue growth. In this model, operating costs will increase to $1.8 billion/year in 2028. During the trailing twelve months, Roku's operating costs were $387 million.This model is further built on declining player revenue. In this model, I have player revenue set to decline at about 7% per year. This decline is based on the idea that set-top or plug-in players will become less relevant for Roku as an increasing proportion of users will be using smart TVs, especially in ten years. In this model, player revenue declines from $326 million in 2018 to $166 million in 2028. Given the low gross margins on player revenue, this decline is largely irrelevant to Roku's value.After that, I am applying a 25% tax rate and discounting Roku's cash flow at a 10% discount rate. Roku does not have debt and has relatively little non-cash working capital, with accounts payable approximating accounts receivable. Roku's business is not capital-intensive, with only $5 million in capex this quarter (~2% of revenue) offset by $2.8 million in depreciation and amortization.After adding in Roku's cash and equivalents, summing Roku's future cash flows and terminal value using a 3% terminal growth rate, and dividing by Roku's share count, I come up with a present value for Roku of $90 or a ""target price"" of $100, based on a one-year forward price.This was a strong quarter for Roku, to say the least. That feels a bit silly to say, even, given how much share prices are up - the market is well aware it was a great quarter.Given Roku's ballooning share price, I wanted to do a ""sanity-check"" to see if I wanted to cash in my Roku gains, or if I wanted to let it ride into next quarter and beyond.Based on my model of Roku's future cash flows and their present value, I am satisfied in owning Roku at its current price, coming up with a current valuation of $90 and a target price of $100.To be sure, Roku was a better value back in December 2018 when it traded down to only $27/share on bearish sentiment. But, as investors, we don't live in the past: My only decision today is whether to buy more shares, sell my shares, or continue holding my shares, and not whether to buy or sell more last December.There are a lot of risks here. Roku is competing with some of the largest companies in the world, including Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN). Each of those companies is larger and better funded than Roku. But that has always been the case - and Roku is thriving despite that competition.Similarly, my valuation is highly speculative and relies on projections ten years into the future. None of those projections will be correct, and readers ten years from now will laugh at how far off they were. But my model isn't intended to be a completely accurate picture of Roku's future revenue or cash flows - merely an estimate to determine whether Roku's current pricing is sensible.In my view, Roku's current pricing is sensible, and I will continue to hold my Roku shares, even after 200% gains since December.Next quarter, I model Roku to see 30.6 million active accounts, an ARPU of $20.79, and 9.7 billion streaming hours. If Roku hits those numbers, they should beat their guidance once again.Happy investing!"

I don’t play the earnings game often with stocks as my analysis does not change monthly or quarterly. My conviction on Roku is high and can withstand trade war news or a fledgling quarter, which is normal for smaller companies on the edge of incipient trends.The first thing Wall Street got wrong with Roku is that investors thought Roku was a hardware player. Although it's clear now that the ad platform is what will drive the profits, this wasn’t evident in the financials for a few earnings reports. My three pieces of analysis in 2018 were the opposite. I made my readers aware the ad platform was where the growth potential was.The second thing Wall Street gets wrong is assuming Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Amazon (AMZN) can dominate over-the-top television because they are big tTech and smaller companies don’t have a chance. Google struggles here and recently raised the prices on YouTube television to $49, which, for the most part, negates the purpose of cord cutting when you add a few subscriptions like Netflix or HBO Go and end up at the monthly cost of cable. Amazon is pushing into ads for OTT. However, there will be privacy regulations to face as the data powering those ads is being brokered without consent from e-commerce and Prime purchases. You can ask Facebook how that's going for them.Roku has all of the pieces to the stack. The hardware is a razor-razor blade model that locks in their ad-supported platform. They’re OTT only, and this prevents privacy issues for the data they collect from the device (this is why Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) always is in the clear with privacy issues – data stays on the device).Interestingly, the consensus EPS forecast for Roku was negative $0.24 compared to negative $0.07 same quarter last year with analyst expectations of declining growth. Meanwhile, Roku had posted EPS of $0.05 last quarter. Here’s a screenshot of Roku’s earnings per share vs. consensus (see below). Earnings this quarter were negative $0.09.TradeDesk also is a connected TV advertising player and reports on May 9with analysts expecting declining growth from the previous quarter with estimates at $0.07 per share.With that said, advertising is driving record profits for many companies that have already reported this quarter, such as Facebook and Twitter. This is why I was surprised (and didn't agree with) the low analyst expectations for both Roku and TradeDesk as these expectations of -$0.24 for Roku and $0.07 for TradeDesk are some of the lowest in these stocks’ earnings histories (1 year-plus or more).That was my headline last May in 2018 even though Roku did not miss Q1 2018 earnings. My stance on this stock remains the same. Roku is a core holding of mine because of the mega trend toward connected TV advertising. To put it simply, and as I wrote before Q1 2018 earnings were reported, Roku beating or missing earnings is not my focus for a long strategy based on an important trend. I fully expect tech companies to miss earnings from time to time (this creates better buying opportunities). This won’t change my conviction that connected TV advertising is on an important upward trajectory.Here’s some more information on the connected TV market:“Two of the big trends in digital media aren’t compatible: The drive to enforce viewability standards and the shift to mobile, particularly apps.” – DigidayViewability issues are a serious issue for big brands that are averse to mobile in-app advertising because it’s too challenging to track. In addition, many big brands do not need immediate purchases which is called “purchase intent” – which is mobile’s main value over television.For instance, Coca-Cola doesn’t expect you to buy a soda immediately after seeing an ad. Audi doesn’t expect you to buy a car immediately either. So, a lot of the benefits of mobile aren’t worth the downside to these big brands. Advertising budgets shifted to mobile because they had to find audiences, not because it’s a superior method to advertise.Here’s how the two compare:Connected TV advertising, which is Roku’s specialty, combines the best of both television and mobile. It offers 100% viewability and completion rates with the audience data and dynamic ad insertion found on mobile. Forbes covered this in a recent article which stated ad-supported OTT is the future, reporting OTT ads have a 97% completion rate and 100% viewability.In a recent study by FreeWheel, 200 billion video starts found OTT ads had ballooned from 2% to 32% in a four-year period due to heavier investments from advertisers.In the Q2 2018 Video Advertising benchmark study released by Extreme Reach, a tech platform for video ad campaigns, connected TV impressions overtook mobile, accounting for 38 percent of all video ad impressions, down from 33 percent in Q1.Here’s a quote from Extreme Reach:“CTV is clearly on the path to becoming the dominant platform for media consumption, and premium inventory is the most sure-fire audience draw.”– Mary Vestewig, Senior Director, Video Account Management at Extreme Reach.AppNexus, the world’s leading independent advertising technology company, announced in July 2018 that advertiser spend in its connected TV marketplace grew 748% year-over-year vs. the second quarter of 2017 and 68% quarter over quarter. AppNexus currently sees 20 billion monthly connected TV impressions per month.From an investment standpoint, the implications of attracting more advertising dollars than mobile is enormous. Big brand budgets have been looking for a solution to traditional television that isn’t confined to the attention span and limited screen size of mobile viewers. With Roku, that option is finally here.Please note: I’ve also covered TradeDesk, another stock doing well by capturing the cConnected TV advertising trend. There are certain risks to TradeDesk that have personally kept me from buying the stock although many of my readers have seen 400% returns on TTD.This analysis is not an earnings call. The purpose of this article is to revisit a few trends and predictions I made around this time last year with regard to Roku."
4262209,96246,2019-05-09T16:57:47-04:00,"I went to Strong Buy March 14 after seeing the potential earnings upside and getting excited about 2020 numbers.After yesterday's earnings, our price target went to $111.But one question and one answer on the call gave us much more conviction and may have helped the stock launch.","We had the opportunity to ask a question on Roku's (NASDAQ:ROKU) earnings call. It was a simple question, but the answer was oh so sweet. I think it may have helped to catapult the stock, but not sure. The stock was up 8%-9% at the time of the question and the next day kept rising to be up 27%.On Roku's earnings call they managed to slip us in as the last question.Here's what we asked,Before we show their answer, here's what we saw.If you've read our stuff you know we love to look at the two-year revenue growth rates. We add this year's quarter's revenue growth plus last year's same quarter's revenue growth. That gives us an underlying trend. People don't use it for whatever reason. That's fine by me.Here's what we saw.Notice anything?Q1 was a breakout quarter. It was the fastest two-year growth rate we've seen. Business is getting better. When we see an accelerating two-year growth rate we can model future quarters to also accelerate.That takes our EPS way higher than the Street. We're at strong positive earnings for next year (full earnings model: paywall) vs. the Street at negative earnings for next year.Seeing that improving trajectory made me think this story is about to get even more powerful.While revenues have accelerated operating expense growth has stayed the same. If these trends were to continue you can start to get big earnings leverage.That's probably why our earnings numbers are much higher than the Street's for next year. The simple math of faster revenue growth combined with steady expense growth gets you there.That's why we asked Roku, ""Looking out to next year and kind of the trends with the gross margins and revenues, I'm just wondering if you could talk about profitability going into next year. Looks like that you have some leverage going in your favor.""And their answer was confirmation that I think we're right. I don't think the Street with losses for 2020 thought about the EPS leverage potential, but based on the company's answer I think the company sees it coming.Here's what Roku said,I think our 2020 EPS profits are more right than the Street's 2020 losses.The company sees ""a lot of leverage in the business."" I think Street numbers have to come up.Ahead of earnings this is what we told subscribers (paywall),At the time I didn't think to ask the company about my 2020 thesis. But after a great quarter, I decided to lob in my question. I think my thesis was confirmed by their answer. I guess the one thing I was wrong about in my earnings preview was that they did, in fact, ""talk about lots of leverage coming."" I thought they wouldn't. Good thing I asked.As a side note, after seeing the earnings report come out and seeing the revenue acceleration we told subscribers at around 4:20 PM we'd add to positions with the stock up 6%-or-so in the after market. I was just so impressed with the results. That was yesterday at this time, but 20%-plus lower. 24 hours ago. Who knew? If only we could annualize that, right?The Street is nowhere on Roku. They have losses for 2020. Roku is a leader in over-the-top (""OTT"") streaming. Huge swaths of ad dollars are coming from linear TV to OTT. Yet this is so undercovered.SourceOut of 14 people following the company, half like it, half don't. Roku's stock is breaking out to new highs. Revenues are accelerating growing faster than Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) (Netflix' revenue growth is slowing). Roku is telling you there's huge leverage in the business. I think that leverage could potentially blow past estimates next year. And practically nobody's aboard on the sell side.Let's compare that to the type of coverage Netflix is getting.SourceNo doubt Netflix is a great company, but Roku is too and younger and growing faster. I think it's fair to expect Roku gets some new exposure from some new bullish coverage over the course of this year.SourceIf the stock already is breaking out without that coverage imagine what it can do with that coverage.We've had some good ones, but Roku stacks up there with our better ones. You never really know which one has the ability to be up 27% the next day on earnings, but that's what we're looking for. Really what we're looking for are companies with at least 45% 12-month upside, our quarters above the Street, and a ""wow"" story. Roku had all of that. But the accelerating revenue growth was so key for me.That and a great answer to a good question helped this stock catapult. Probably more to go."
4258483,105080,2019-05-02T06:21:08-04:00,"In Q1, we invested in Roku at an average price of $32.35, which returned 99.41% in the quarter.It is in the early stages of the streaming TV growth curve.Roku has a long runway to grow subscribers, while growing ARPU.","The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter.In Q1, we invested in Roku (ROKU) at an average price of $32.35, which returned 99.41% in the quarter. In Roku, we see a situation unfolding in line with the historical fact patterns we have observed in several other industries. Specifically, we believe that the purpose-built operating system developed by Roku for the smart TV will achieve industry scale at the expense of homegrown operating systems, much like how Windows OS (MSFT) overtook mainframe operating systems in personal computers, and Android OS (GOOG, GOOGL) overtook Windows OS in cellular phones. As the aggregator in smart TV operating systems, Roku’s first-mover advantage and industry scale will enable it to grow its subscriber base over 400% from current levels, all while doubling ARPU.The company is in the early stages of the streaming TV growth curve. A 27 million subscriber base provides a critical mass of early adopters as the business is set to cross the chasm towards widespread adoption in the 126 million US household total addressable market. As the movement from linear TV to OTT streaming accelerates, Roku is the aggregator business that owns the funnel of end users. Having this direct relationship with users is important because every new streaming service will have to sign contracts with Roku, as the company controls the demand-side economics. As the depth and breadth of content offering on Roku’s platform grows, the subscriber base and the number of hours streamed will continue to grow. As the subscriber base expands, the $70 billion TV advertising market will increasingly follow subscribers from linear TV to digital TV. As users, hours streamed, and content grow, more data will be collected on user behavior, purchase intent, and engagement, driving the model-driven business to further leverage data and analytics to improve advertiser campaign results, and thus, cost per impression and ARPU. In summary, Roku has a long runway to grow subscribers while growing ARPU, and at our entry price of $32.35, we expect that our investment will compound for years to come."
4290733,99986,2019-09-10T11:23:57-04:00,"Roku has had an incredible run, and is the top performing stock over $1 billion in my scans as of yesterday with a 425% year-to-date return.The company does not yet have positive earnings per share, but continues to see accelerating revenue growth in the high double-digit range.While the stock may be a hold long-term if this growth continues, I believe this is an opportune time for investors to book profits on 1/3 of their position.","While Shopify (SHOP), Carvana (CVNA), and Avalara (AVLR) have put up tremendous gains this year, Roku (ROKU) continues to stand head and shoulders above the rest with a 425% year-to-date return. The company spent most of the year in the #2 rank behind Enphase Energy (ENPH), but Enphase Energy has since seen a 35% since its multi-month tenure in the #1 spot. Much of Roku's move this year is undoubtedly justified with a new product, a reasonable valuation, and revenue growth that continues to accelerate. However, as the stock has continued to spike higher, the valuation is also getting a little frothy at a price to sales ratio of 19.60. In addition, the stock is now officially getting parabolic short-term after several months of being overbought. Based on these two developments, I believe the stock is susceptible to a correction, and the short-term (1-3 month) reward to risk is now poor above $163.00 for the bulls. For this reason, I believe this is an opportune time for investors to ring the register on a chunk of their position.(Source: TC2000.com)There are few publicly traded stocks on the US market with growth like Roku's, and Q2 earnings saw the strongest sales growth rate in the past two years with 59% year-over-year. This was an impressive acceleration from the prior three quarters of 39%, 46%, and 51%, and this led the company to raise its revenue guidance for FY-2019. The company continues to see traction in average revenue per user (ARPU) and active users, with active users pushing above 30 million in the most recent quarter. We can see this in the chart I've built below:Looking at ARPU, we can see that it's growing over 4% sequentially the past five quarters, up from $16.60 in Q2 2018, to $21.06 in the most recent quarter. This figure is up 88% since the company went public a little over two years ago. On active users, the company's net adds last quarter were roughly in line with the prior trend, at 2.1 million last quarter vs. an average quarterly net add of 2.08 over the past four quarters. This remains impressive as maintaining the same growth is always challenging as scale increases. Based on these numbers, the company continues to fire on all cylinders, and there are absolutely no red flags here. Few growth companies in the market have seen such a strong trend in ARPU, and the ability to grow both active users and ARPU at the same time is encouraging.(Source: Author's Chart)(Source: Q2 Shareholder Letter)So let's take a look at how the company's financial growth metrics look: Beginning with annual earnings per share [EPS], the company does not yet have any earnings, which is not surprising for an earlier stage company like Roku. Many IPOs take two to three years or longer before they get positive earnings per share on the table, and this is not a reason to avoid the stock. For the most part, net losses have seen a trend of slightly narrowing with FY-2020 expected to come in at (-) $0.46, but are more or less in the same range over the past several years. While these net losses and a lack of positive EPS may scare off traditional growth investors, I do not believe a company should be written off simply because it does not have earnings yet. The caveat, however, is that the revenue growth better be incredible.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)When it comes to Roku's revenue growth, the company certainly meets this criterion. The company saw $250.1 million in revenue for their Q2 results, up from $156.8 million the prior year, and this translated to 59% growth. This was the strongest quarter in the past two years for the company, and the two-quarter average, which aims to remove lumpiness continues to trend higher. The Q2 results marked the fourth quarter in a row of acceleration in quarterly revenue growth for the company, and this acceleration is occurring from an already exceptional level. This is a positive sign for the growth story, and there's very little to dislike here.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)The one minor issue here even with the two-quarter average trending higher (white line), is that Q3 revenue guidance and estimates are currently sitting at $241 million. While an awe-inspiring number, this will translate to only 39% growth year-over-year given the very tough comps from the prior year of 39%. It is possible that Roku can beat these estimates as they're likely a little conservative, but the sequential drop from 59% revenue growth the last quarter to 39% this quarter will be a reasonable deceleration. Even if the company were to beat these estimates by $9 million and come in at $250 million, this would still translate to low 40% growth. Again, these are exceptional numbers, but it's a reasonable double-digit deceleration from the growth in the prior two quarters. This is not Roku's fault; it's just that they are going up against tough comps. If the company's numbers come in at $241 million, this would mark a slight down-tick in the two-quarter average revenue growth rate from 55% to 49.5%.Based on the above revenue growth, Roku is in the top 1% of all publicly traded stocks for growth metrics. There are lots of things to love about the company long-term, and clearly, the company is having no problem sustaining growth as it scales. The only issue here is that the company's Q3 revenue guidance and estimates are tracking well below the growth rate of prior quarters. This could be a catalyst for a correction if they can't beat handsomely. While this may not make sense to some investors, the market doesn't always have to make sense. Typically, stocks priced for perfection must keep accelerating to sustain high valuations.Moving over to valuation, we can see that Roku is currently trading at a price to sales ratio of 19.60, and anything above 15 is quite lofty. Comparing this to Netflix (NFLX), the highest price to sales ratio Netflix traded at in the last decade was 13.91 times. Roku's current price to sales ratio of 19.60 is 42% above Netflix's peak levels. While the two companies are not the same, and comparing them like this is not going to yield perfect results, this does give us an idea of what valuation prior growth companies in this industry have commanded. Based on this price to sales ratio of over 19.60, I believe the stock is close to priced for perfection here.(Source: YCharts.com)Many investors will argue that valuation has been useless for trading Roku over the past two years, and I would completely agree with them. The issue is that while valuing hyper-growth stocks on valuation is a useless endeavor most of the time; there is a tipping point when things get near 15x price to sales on a trailing-twelve-month basis. I believe we are close to that tipping point for Roku. The fact that Q3 revenue estimates are soft compared to the prior growth rate leaves the company susceptible to some mean reversion. The only way I can see the company avoiding a correction and continuing to march higher towards the $190 - $200 level in Q4 is if Q3 revenues blow estimates out of the water and come in at $263 million or higher. This would be a significant beat and would translate to over 50% growth and would only single-digit acceleration vs. a near-record growth rate the last quarter. Unfortunately for investors, this 'perfect' valuation is accompanied by red flags showing up in the technical picture short-term.Looking at the technical picture, Roku is currently trading more than 110% above its 200-day moving average (blue line) which now comes in at the $76.00 level. When stocks get more than 100% above their 200-day moving averages, often this can be a sticky spot short-term. We saw this in Shopify (SHOP) just last week as the stock approached this level, and has since corrected 10%. While there are no guarantees that Roku has to pull back further from the $163.00 level, I would consider the stock getting parabolic short-term here. This leaves the reward to risk slightly in favor of the bears short-term from $163.00 or higher.(Source: TC2000.com)Moving to a weekly chart, we can see that Roku is running up to tag its top acceleration band, and this level has also been a sticky spot for the stock where it's had trouble in the past. The past tests which came within 5% of this top band were October 2018, and March 2019, and both led to larger than 25% corrections. While the October 2018 test of this band was likely exacerbated by the heavy selling pressure in the markets, the March test of this band was in a strong market and still led to a 25% correction from $73.00 to $55.00. Currently, Roku is 7% off of its highs.(Source: TC2000.com)Given that Roku is priced for near perfection at 19.60 times on a TTM price to sales basis, the stock cannot afford to have any misses or material deceleration in its growth. While net adds for active accounts and ARPU continue to chug along at a steady pace, forward revenue guidance for Q3 is suggesting a soft quarter vs. prior growth rates. This does not mean the stock has topped long-term or can't go higher, but it does say that it's got a potential negative catalyst looming. This is more significant based on the fact it's coupled with my belief it's priced for near perfection here.The market will find any excuse it can to sell off a stock, and this might be the excuse Wall Street uses to prompt a sell-off in the stock. This potential double-digit deceleration in the growth rate is not helped by the fact that Roku is the most extended it has been technically since its IPO. For this reason, I see the reward to risk on the stock as weak currently for the bulls. Long-term, Roku could certainly head higher if its growth in ARPU, active users and revenue continues, but short-term this is becoming a crowded trade for the bulls. I believe this to be an opportune time for investors to take profits on a portion of their position above $162.00. However, I see no problem for those long from much lower levels to hold the core of their position.(TipRanks: Sell)"
4266177,23903,2019-05-23T16:22:42-04:00,"Roku's $10 billion market cap is a pricey 10x 2019 revenues that barely produce any meaningful profits.Even with very optimistic projects three years forward, it would be difficult to justify Roku's current valuations.Risk factors such as increasing competition and a lack of a secure content library could render Roku's effort in increasing its user base useless.","Roku (ROKU) has almost tripled from its $30.64 level entering 2019 and would be worth over $10 billion in market cap after its pending secondary according to an SEC filing released last week. With its share of analyst upgrades and downgrades, the ever changing bull bear question for many investors is if Roku can grow into its lofty valuations. This article will dive into some of its operating metrics and make what might be considered optimistic projections to determine if Roku can ultimately produce earnings under ideal conditions to justify its current market cap.In the first quarter of 2019 Roku reported $206.7 million in revenues and lost $10.7 million on a GAAP level. Excluding $17.9 million in quarterly stock based compensation, its non-GAAP earnings would come to $0.065 per share. For 2019, Roku projects revenues to hit $1.04 billion at the midpoint guidance and earn $0.045 in non-GAAP EPS. The annual guidance thus implies the remaining three quarters of 2019 will only be break even on a non-GAAP level. Roku explained that operating expenses are projected to increase and with $75 million in annual stock based compensation, ROKU's stock grants are a whopping 7.2% of revenues. This compares to 2% for Netflix (NFLX) and 4-5% for online businesses at Roku's current size.The table above shows Roku's key operating figures that help us project its earnings power: revenues per active account, revenues per streaming hour, and daily streaming hours per active user. The data shows a clear trend. Roku has been able to get its users to watch more daily and monetize this usage despite revenues per streaming hour remaining fairly constant, outside of possible Q4 seasonality. Estimating Roku's daily active user streaming hours is one of two critical metrics in projecting its future potential earnings. In Q1 2019, users watched on average 3.4 hours on Roku per day. This seems to be a pretty high number and I'm not sure if it can be improved on by much. Netflix users in comparison watch only 71 minutes per day.The second metric which needs to be estimated is the revenue per streaming hour. Again outside of possible fourth quarter seasonality, the range has been narrow at $0.015-0.016 per streaming hour. At its surface, this appears small but Roku does not break out how it determines its streaming hours so it's uncertain how much of it is from its Roku Channel where most of its revenues are likely derived. I believe it includes other non-monetized channels because I find it hard to believe every active user watches 3.4 hours of old movies and tv shows a day, every day, for an entire quarter straight. With this in mind, this number may not go much higher than the Q4 2018 seasonally high of $0.021/hr if averaged for the entire year.Roku said it had 29.1 million active users in Q1 2019 which compares to slightly over 60 million US subscribers for Netflix. If we assume Roku can eventually reach 60 million users that watch on average 3.5 hours/day and monetize that base at $0.025/hour which assumes a significant increase from recent norms, we can roughly estimate its quarter revenues:60 million users x 3.5 hr/day x 91.5 days/quarter x $0.025/hr monetization =$480 million platform revenues per quarter at 71% recent average gross margin trend.Then assume slightly higher average quarterly player revenue of $90 million at 10% margins which is generous based on recent trends. Quarterly revenues would tally $570 million with a gross profit of $350 million.Another method is to assume ARPU (average revenue per user for the trailing twelve month period) increases. This would be more useful if a large portion of Roku's streaming hours counted can't be monetized, i.e. Roku is only using it as a headline bullet point. ARPU would need to double to reach similar revenues in the same 3 year time frame used for this example. Roku's ARPU growth was 27% in the past year and the company would need to keep growth at this level for the next 3 years to reach the $570 million in quarterly revenues calculated above through non-ARPU metrics.Roku's operating expenses as a percentage of revenues have been hovering around 50% and based on their 2019 guidance, operating expenses for this year is estimated to be around 51.89%. Although Roku hasn't shown any economy of scale at the operating expense level, we can still use generous assumptions to estimate best case numbers. If we assume operating expenses drop to 45% of revenues, or $256.50 million using the $570 million in quarterly revenue assumption above.This leaves net income at $250 million, after a 20% tax rate and without major non-operating adjustments. With Roku's fully diluted share count increasing at about 10 million in the past year and assuming these continued increases due to their generous stock based awards, Roku's share count might reach 145 million in the three or so years it might take to reach 60 million active users at recent add rates. This leaves investors with about $1.72 in quarterly GAAP EPS, or $6.88 in annual GAAP EPS. If we put a generous 20 PE (Roku's growth after reaching 60 million active users would be pretty questionable), the share price would be at $137.6. That would be the 3 year upside using what I consider very generous assumptions and nothing going wrong scenario.Of course bulls can argue Roku can generate more per streaming hour, or users can watch spend more of their lives watching old reruns, or the company could have similar international success. At this point in time, I believe the potential risks far outweigh any of these additional bullish projections.The main risk is competition that will keep Roku's average daily streaming hours at current levels, or even reduce it. Roku has a long list of very big competitors - Netflix, Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Disney (DIS), and Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to name a few of the major ones. These competitors have either similar ad sponsored free content like Roku, or self developed content. It is thus very questionable if Roku can keep its user base watching the 3.5 hr/day assumption above when so much content, including exclusive new content is available.In addition, Roku doesn't own its content and could lose distribution rights from its current content providers after typical 1-3 year contracts expire. It may also not be able to get new content that is attractive enough to keep draw in new users or keep old ones watching. Like how Disney pulled its content from Netflix, there is nothing really keeping Roku's current content providers from starting services of their own, or changing to another platform for better distribution deals. The only way to secure content security is to produce it in house which is risky, or buy it which is costly. Without a secured quality content library, any growth to its user base can become meaningless very quickly.The Roku Channel might have just come at the right time and filled a void prior to Apple and Disney becoming much more of an industry player. Its long term viability given the industry's evolving dynamics is very questionable in my opinion. While it's easy to extrapolate Roku's current operating metrics and come up with high potential EPS, the generous scenario above still wouldn't leave Roku at current levels much multi-year upside after risk factors are considered.Using more realistic assumptions, Roku itself only predicts to be barely profitable on a non-GAAP level for all of this year. If Roku posts similar active user growth rates for next year but if other earnings metrics aren't above recent trends($0.016/hr watched revenue, 3.4 average daily hours watched, and 51.9% opex as a percentage of revenue), the company likely won't post much of a non-GAAP profit next year either. Thus without optimistic improvements in these operating metrics, Roku's revenue growth only barely covers its growth in operating expenses. It's nice to show continued active user growth, but in the end it's meaningless without improved monetization metrics.There are other 'conspiracy' arguments one could make but I think Roku's current valuations, its business model uncertainty, and its questionable earnings potential outside of extreme pie to the sky assumptions should make investors cautious in its stock. This doesn't mean the stock can't continue to go up since when stocks already exceed realistic valuations, the peak in the excess is always difficult to gauge."
4255721,73025,2019-04-22T12:44:45-04:00,"Roku's business model can be divided in Advertising video on demand (AVOD), Transaction video on demand (TVOD) and Subscription video on demand (SVOD).Advertising video on demand (AVOD) is the fastest growing revenue segment.All revenue streams together generate $ 17.95 per user per year.","In this article I would like to explore the core of Roku's business model . Based on what I read in the comments section, it seems some people don't actually understand Roku's revenue streams. I would like to explain the various revenue streams and how they actually make money.The company has 2 revenue segments. The first segment is selling Roku boxes that enables you to get the operating system on your TV. This segment is called the player segment and generates about 46% of 2018 revenue. It is not the most profitable part of the company as gross margins on this segment are approximately 10%. The strategy of the company is to get as many people as possible on the Roku platform and that is the reason the margins are low on these players. Currently, about 27 million users enjoy the Roku platform and much of the recent growth is achieved by preinstalling the Roku OS on television sets. Roku works with TV manufacturers that include TCL, Element, Hisense, Hitachi, JVC, RCA, Philips, Sanyo, Sharp, and Magnavox.The advantage for the TV manufacturer is that they don't have to build their own operating system or source their own. TV manufacturers are in the business of selling TV's and are not in the software business. Building your own TV operating system means updating it constantly, releasing new features etc. and this is a business of it's own. Just like with PC's , Hewlett Packard or Lenovo run Windows on their devices and do not invent their own operating system. Roku can be seen as the Windows of televisions.So although Roku still makes money on selling the Roku boxes, the company is shifting towards licensing the OS. The licensing part is much more scalable. As noted in Roku's Q4 20218 shareholder letter , one in four smart TVs sold in the US has a Roku OS.Platform RevenueOnce people are on the platform, Roku has a couple of ways of making money on viewers. Platform revenue is growing rapidly and in Q4 2018 the segment accounted for 54% of total revenue. Roku earns revenue in three ways: Transaction video on demand (TVOD), Subscription video on demand (SVOD) and Advertising video on demand (AVOD).TVOD consists of channels on the Roku Platform that charge a fee when you purchase a movie or other content and you pay for that content on the fly. Roku receives 20% commission from the transaction and the publisher receives 80%, net of fees and refunds. Transactions include a content purchase or rental (movie, sports event, football match) or a game purchase (angry birds, chess backgammon etc.)Similarities with the App Store.TVOD kind of works the same as the App Store of Apple. It is widely known that the App Store generates billions of revenue for Apple and with Roku having 27 million users it can be worthwile for developers to build apps for Roku's app store. In my opinion, the strength in this segment lies in the fact that users may want to watch a single sports event or download a game without being tied up to a subscription. I would want to be able to watch a golf tournament without subscribing to a sports channel and paying a monthly subscription. TVOD may enable users to access niche offerings like a history documentary or a cooking workshop. These types of niche offerings are not readily available on the main streaming services we have today.Gaming can be another growth driver as the gaming business is shifting towards cloud-based access to games instead of games being played on consoles or PCs. Roku may benefit from this trend by selling games on their platform or selling gaming subscriptions like Alphabet is trying to do now with Stadia. Roku already offers developers in- app billing, which enables a viewer to subscribe to a channel at no cost, but has to pay for specific content in that channel. This feature might be applied to gaming as the trend in gaming is to offer the game for free and then earning on in-game purchases.The TVOD segment does have similarities with the App Store model. It will take time, but the opportunity is there to generate substantial revenues.SVOD offers the ability to enter into subscriptions via the Roku OS. Recently, the company reported that it is now possible to subscribe to channels like Showtime, Starz and Epix from the Roku channel. Ruku then controls the billing and manages the subscriptions. Roku receives a cut from the subscription revenue. See below:The world is switching towards streaming. The cord cutting trend is a fact and instead of paying for a cable subscription where you have no real control on which channels are in the package, the new trend is to compile your own set of subscriptions. Services like Hulu and Netflix are known , but what if I am more interested in subscribing to a golf channel, cooking channel or history channel? Major content providers across the world are starting their own streaming service for a monthly fee.For example Discovery channel is now starting a new service where you pay a monthly fee. The world needs a platform where all these subscriptions can be managed, and that is what Roku is trying to do with SVOD. If you believe that not one platform will be capable of covering one's viewing needs, a platform like Roku with it's SVOD and TVOD offerings enables people to create a-la-carte entertainment.As the company notes in their FY 18 annual report, the third and fastest growing segment is the AVOD segment. This primarily consists of:Video AdsWhen you watch a video on Youtube, you'll notice that a short advertisement clip is played prior to the actual video. Roku does the same thing. So in addition to paid channels or subscriptions as outlined before, there is also a lot of free content. The content is free because ads are placed prior to the content or during the content break. Mostly these are 15 to 30 second video clips. So for example if I want to watch a cooking channel, instead of charging me a fee for watching a cooking lesson, I get to view ads. (let's say from an oven manufacturer). The oven manufacturer pays a fee to display the ad, and that income stream is shared between Roku and the company that provides the cooking show (the publisher). Roku has thousands of channels and therefore this model can be copy-pasted many times. Youtube has proved that people will watch a short add if the content is free.Some publishers won't have access to advertisers like in the example above, so Roku connects you with the advertiser. However , a bigger content provider like a TV channel will probably have it's own access to advertisers, so why share revenue with Roku? Well, Roku has an audience of 27 million users so it is very tempting to access those eyeballs. To complement larger content owners, Roku offers the inventory split revenue model. For smaller content owners, the revenue share model is preferred. Here are the differences:Channel recommendations and sponsored showsAnother revenue stream is called “channel recommendations”. Roku recommends which channels to download/install when you setup your Roku and these can be paid placements/ recommendations.Sponsored shows , another revenue stream, occures when movies or shows are sponsored by the advertiser: (Family movie brought to you by brand X).Similarities and differences with YoutubeManagement has stated that the AVOD revenue segment is the biggest contributor to turnover. Since AVOD is virtually identical to how Youtube operates, Roku in a way makes money similar to Youtube. The similarity is that ads are shown next to the video of the content creator. An advantage Roku may have over Youtube, is that Roku offers the Inventory split model (see above). Since content providers are allowed to source their own advertisers , this model is more attractive for large content owners than Youtube because Youtube doesn't offer this option.The revenue split in general is also different, because Roku pays out 60% of advertising revenue to the content creator, while Youtube pays out 55%. This may be another reason why the Roku platform is more attractive for content creators.Another similarity is the ease of uploading videos. The fact that Roku has thousands of channels and counting is mostly because it's very easy to upload a video on Roku. In 2016, Roku introduced the “Direct Publisher mode, which enables you to start a channel and upload videos without any coding experience. The channel owner simply links to his content (video file) on his PC and you have a channel. So this will definitely help attract new channel content and improve the attractiveness of the platform.Another issue with Youtube is that a lot of content violates copy rights. Roku on the other hand is stricter in what content you can upload to your channel. For example, if I have a channel on Roku, my videos have to link to a video file on a server or my local computer, but I can't link it to Youtube. So the fact that content is more ""clean""on Roku can be a reason advertisers would want to spend more ad dollars on Roku over Youtube.Succes of the modelAll the platform revenue streams mentioned (AVOD, TVOD, SVOD) generate $ 17.95 per user p/year. (ARPU) . On 27 million users that is a lot of revenue. Netflix charges approximately $ 9 per month ($ 108 per year) depending on the plan, but has much higher costs for creating the content. What amazes me in particular is the growth in ARPU as shown below.ARPU has grown to $17.95 , but at the same time accounts have grown from 19.3 million to 27 million in 5 quarters. So every new account generates more revenue then before. This is a very important metric to keep an eye on, since this essentially shows how the AVOD model is catching on. The AVOD model should be scalable , since new channels are being added and thus new ad revenue can be monetized. The success of the platform will depend on how much diversity of content Roku can achieve.Runway for growthIf we look at the ARPU in Q4 2017 compared with now , the compound quarterly growth rate (CQGR) is 5,4%. If we extrapolate this to Q4 2020 we arrive at an ARPU of $ 27.40. It will be interesting to see in the next earnings announcement if ARPU grows consistent with the trend. In the next quarter it should grow to $ 17.95 * 1.0543 = $ 18.92 . Anything below that is below the trend.As I have outlined, Roku has three revenue models, SVOD, TVOD and SVOD. Amongst all three of them AVOD is by far the fastest growing revenue segment, but TVOD and SVOD have interesting growth options as well.The TVOD segment does resemble how the App store works, where Roku receives 20% commission on all purchased apps. Gaming apps could be a growth catalyst in this area. SVOD can benefit from the advent of niche streaming services that come to market. AVOD resembles Youtube in that video ads are placed next to the actual content video's. Through it's direct publisher mode, it is very easy to create channels with Roku and this should increase the diversity of content on the platform.All this has enabled Roku to generate $17.95 per user which is a quarterly growth rate of 5%, a very solid number. We should be clearly watching this number, but at the moment it does show us that this company has a model that works and will work well into the future."
4253888,22786,2019-04-11T03:02:36-04:00,Roku shares failed to break above the mid-$70s.Market is now ignoring the company's strong Q4 report and may erase the post-earnings rally.First-quarter seasonal weakness expected.,"Since the start of 2019, shares of Roku (ROKU) rose by over 90%. The rally stumbled after the stock tested the $70-75 level on two occasions in the last two months. After two analysts downgraded the stock in April, the euphoria following its last quarterly earnings report is wearing off. Did Roku really “double top” and will the stock find support in the low $50s? Shares closed at $58.57 on April 9, 2019.For fundamental investors charts will not give much insight on where the stock will get to next. Still, the “double top” as shown below cannot be ignored. Market traders sold the stock whenever it traded above the mid-$70 level:Source: FinvizMarkets have a short-term memory. Since its fourth-quarter report on Feb. 21, traders could continue the selling pressure, effectively erasing the post-earnings rally. Roku reported EBITDA growing 70% to $24.5 million. Strong demand for players and TVs resulted in 27.1 million active accounts for the year. Roku's users are spending an increasing amount of time on the platform. In 2018, stream hours increased by 9.2 billion to 24 billion.In the fourth quarter, revenue grew 46% to $275.7 million, helped by player revenue (up 21%) and platform revenue (up 77%). Platform margins continue to be healthy, as gross margin topped 40.7%.In 2018, Roku hired more staff, adding 36% more employees and ending the year with 1,100 employees. In 2019, stock-based compensation will add $73 million to costs. Operating expenses grew 67% to $106.8 million.Roku forecasts revenue of just over $1 billion this year and $450 million in gross profit. The company assumes platform revenue will grow to two-thirds of total revenue, while player revenue will come in flat. Gross margin will improve to the low 60% range and assumes video advertising and premium subscriptions adding positively to results.Roku will report weak first-quarter revenues due to seasonality. In fact, management said that player revenue will drop 50% sequentially while platform revenue will fall 20% sequentially. Still, year-over-year revenue will grow 37% at the midpoint and platform revenue will grow 60%.At $1 billion in revenue this year, Roku's shares are valued at around 6.5 times forward sales. That is a high multiple. Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) trades at 3.9 times price to sales while on the music streaming side, Spotify Technology (SPOT) trades at 4.4 times sales.Wall Street is somewhat still bullish on ROKU. Based on 11 analysts offering a one-year price target on the stock, the average price target is $62.60. This would suggest that the stock has only ~7% in additional upside. And with a short float at 11.5%, bears may become increasingly negative by capitalizing on the near-term selling pressure on the stock.At the heart of Roku’s problem is not its valuation but the risk that its business model will face disruption from competitors. On April 3, Amazon (AMZN) asked its advertisers to commit millions on Fire TV to increase its content. This would entice consumers to buy a Fire TV device instead of a Roku or a Roku-powered TV.Neither firm may count on ad-supported content for attracting viewers. Netflix (NFLX) is the big fish in the streaming space whose support could give either platform a substantial boost. For now, Netflix is unlikely to support Amazon due to the competition from Amazon’s Prime services.Roku filed for a mixed shelf offering on March 12. This may dilute existing shareholders and already add to the selling pressure on the stock. Fundamentally, the offering increases Roku’s cash on hand and gives the company plenty of capital to grow the business. Roku may use the capital wisely and make strategic acquisitions or investments that grow its market share.Roku’s nearly 15% drop in the last week alone may have enough negative momentum to send the stock lower. Markets already expect a weak report when the company reports its next quarterly results. If it manages to report better-than-expected results, Roku's stock could re-visit 52-week highs."
4249438,25120,2019-03-18T10:36:36-04:00,"Roku has seen incredible operating momentum, supported by heavy spending.The company is on the verge of breaking the billion revenue mark in 2019 yet is seeing some deleveraging in terms of margins.Growth is superior for now, as the company is the dominant cord-cutting player, with some risks to the business model as well.Having just missed the buying opportunity in late December, I am much more constructive on Roku than I have been in the past, yet cannot just get myself to buy shares at current levels.","In the final days of 2018, I looked at Roku (ROKU) in this article in which I noted that it was seeing growth in streaming and that the stock looked appealing.In that article, I praised the operational growth delivered upon in 2018 as the boom-bust cycle last year has provided an opportunity which I have missed by just a few bucks. The company has fired on all growth cylinders in a successful way, although at the expense of margins, yet dominance might be the way to go in the long run.Roku is all about making life easier for its customers, that is by providing an integrated platform to stream content from multiple content providers. While Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the dominant streaming platform, reality is that the number of options is on the increase, certainly in more specialised niches, sports and music. By combining all these options on a single platform, consumers see their lives become easier, yet the solution has advantages for content providers as well.Content providers with relatively few titles, or a too narrow niche, are arguably too small for their own service and they can monetise some of their content this way, as Roku has created a smart position as middle man this way. That is a smart move, yet we have to recognise that in this economy, the middle man is often being ""cut out"" which creates a long-term risk to the business model.Investors in Roku have seen a roller coaster ride so far, that is since the company went public late 2017. Shares were initially set to go public at just $12-14 per share but have surpassed the $50 mark by the end of the year. Shares fell to the low thirties again in spring 2018, only to trade in the mid-seventies by late summer of that year, before falling to the $30 mark again toward the end of the year, as I recognised the appeal following that drop.After all, valuation multiples were rapidly becoming more compelling. At $30, the 107 million shares were valued at $3.2 billion, or $3 billion if we incorporate net cash holdings at the time. With sales for 2018 seen at $722-$732 million (outlook from Q3), the sales multiples were reasonable at 4 times given the rapid pace of growth, although adjusted EBITDA of $21-$28 million resulted in very high EBITDA multiples and no realistic earnings.The reason why I was upbeat on the $3 billion valuation with no real earnings to show for, yet a solid revenue base, was the following. I saw potential for the company to more than double the customer count from 23.8 million at the end of Q3 to 50 million users not too long from now. ARPU rose by 37% on an annual basis to $17.34 already, as $20 in ARPU results in a potential $1 billion in revenues, but realistically more as there appears upside to the ARPU number. In fact, Roku is already seeing a billion in sales in 2019, including hardware revenues.I noted that such a ""software"" business should be able to post really fat margins over time as this is a technology business in which scale is key, as I would not rule out 50% operating margins and thus $400 million in net earnings power. The $3 billion valuation could easily become an $8 billion valuation in such a scenario with a market multiple being attached to the earnings numbers, even if it could take a year or three to be realised.The key was that real growth in the user base was required. Based on the latest numbers, I will not rule out let's say 60 million users with $25 in ARPU a few years down the road, but somewhat lower margins to arrive at a back-of-the-envelope valuation of $10 billion.The reason for my caution despite the promising business, was that I liked the basic existence of Roku, which is thriving on cord-cutting, yet the reality is that Roku is more or less becoming a middleman which desires quite a large cut for people to avoid having to undergo the hassle of having to install and use multiple services. On the other hand, was the brand recognition, scale and potential for the business to become a take-out target, winch was the caution behind my optimism.Good news came soon this year as the company released strong user numbers in the first week of the year. The company ended 2018 with 27 million users, some 3.2 million more than the end of the third quarter. Growth in terms of engagement and streaming hours comfortably surpassed the actual growth in the user base. Shares jumped to $40 on the back of the good news, as shares rose to the low fifties by the end of February, while shares rose to $65 when the fourth quarter results were released in the final week of February.These results were very strong as sales came in at $742 million, far above the latest guidance. Full year sales growth of 45% even accelerated to 46% in the final quarter of the year, yet this has not translated into profits as the company reported an operating loss of $13 million for the year. While small profits were reported for the final quarter, one has to note that this is a seasonally strong quarter. Some of this growth is ""pushed"" as full year sales and marketing expenses rose by 60%, with even larger increases seen in the final quarter of the year.The real kicker was seen in the guidance as the company sees sales of $1.00-$1.025 billion in 2019, suggesting 35-38% revenue growth. That is the good news however as the company sees adjusted EBITDA come in at flat in 2019, plus or minus $5 million, with net losses seen at $80-$90 million. This compares to $33 million in EBITDA for 2018 and a net loss of $8 million last year.This means that expectations have gone sky-high again. Shares rose to $65 by late February and hit a peak at $75 in early March. With 109 million shares currently outstanding, and 123 million assuming full dilution, the market value stood at $8.2-$9.2 billion at that level, or $8-$9 billion after accounting for the net cash balances. This has boosted sales multiples from 4 times trailing sales in December to 8-9 times forward sales, as margins have taken a beating. The reason for the deleveraging of the expenses is not just the result of increased marketing efforts, as the company is moving internationally as well.That multiple is on the high side again as was more or less recognised by management who filed a prospectus for an unspecified shelf offering on March 12, triggering a retrace to $63 currently, reducing the enterprise value to $6.5-$7.5 billion, depending on the share count. The timing of the shelf offering was very understandable, with shares up 150% in the time frame of just three months. With the continued rapid growth and impressive revenue base, as well as increasingly dominant market positioning, I would be cautious to lean short here just yet.A short is too risky given the growth and dominant and reducing forward sales multiples, although the margin front is disappointing, but that is because the company is aggressively pursuing growth and market dominance. Unfortunately, I missed on the long opportunity late December, as I am in no rush to chase shares on the long side again."
4252673,104722,2019-04-03T21:47:32-04:00,Roku is not a bad company and presents long-term growth potential.The company's platform revenue growth is quite promising.I am rating the stock a sell because I feel current its price multiple is simply too high to be a good deal.,"Source: Roku Products PageRoku (ROKU) was a product that provided me a great deal of joy and value during my undergraduate studies, living with roommates who did not want a cable bill. The product and platform is a fantastic platform for cord-cutters and their library of content is continuously expanding. You can access your favorite streaming applications, cast videos from your devices onto your television, and stream news and sports. I have no doubts that the company will grow and benefit from the trend of cord-cutting in the coming year, but the price is a little ahead of itself for my liking as an investment.Roku IPO Listed On The NasdaqThe company was founded by current the CEO, Anthony Wood, in 2002 and provides OTT (Over-The-Top) content in the form of streaming channels to its customers. The company has an array of physical products used to access the Roku platform. These products include HDMI plug-ins, external boxes, and Roku-enabled televisions. The Roku platform supports a copious number of streaming services in the form of channels, both free and premium, offering pre-recorded and live content. Since Q4 2017 the company has also operated a proprietary Roku streaming channel licensed content from third-party providers and eventually several premium subscription options.Data by YChartsRoku made its debut on the public markets when it listed on the Nasdaq on September 28th, 2017 and since then shareholders have been on a rollercoaster as the market struggles to price this innovative entity. Roku is one of the many hot growth-oriented recent IPOs that delivers impressive top-line revenue growth but fails to turn a profit. This is not an inherently bad attribute but simply means that revenues and price multiples hold more significance to the company than it would to a profitable peer, and in this area, Roku has shined. The company reported the following notable items in their latest annual filing:From a reporting standpoint, Roku reports revenues as two distinct units; Platform Revenue and Player Revenue. The performance in these units is driven by active accounts per period and streaming hours. The graph below represents my expectations in both of these areas through 2020.Source: Contributor Research (Historical data from Roku Shareholder Note)I predict the company to continue its strong trend of adding new active accounts, with 27.1 and 33.8 for FY'19 and FY'20 respectively. Additionally, I expect total streaming hours to continue to grow, reaching 13.4 billion by the end of 2020. Using these projections I have estimated the future performance of Roku's business units.Source: Contributor Research (Historical data from Roku Shareholder Note)Several years back Roku made a noticeable shift as a company when it's the primary source of revenue shifted from player to platform in origination. Since then the divergence has grown and I expect this to continue over the next several quarters. This is very good for the company long-term as Roku is much more viable as a services provider than a pureplay on its hardware in my view, and I believe the appreciation in share price is a direct result. With these figures estimated, I am able to forecast the Roku's statement of income (seen below).Source: Contributor ResearchSome key highlights from my forecast:With these projections and assumptions understood, I turn my attention to my valuation.Source: Contributor Research (Historical data from Roku Shareholder Note)My model doesn't have the company turning an annual profit until 2021 at the earliest. This means we'll have to use the shakier price/sales revenue multiple metric and comparable companies analysis to get to the bottom of what this stock is worth. This presents a fairly unique challenge compared to some of the other companies I've covered using this method, as there are not many obvious equivalent substitutes for Roku that are a similar pure play and that are publically traded. CNBC had an interesting article about how the company is valued more like an internet Giant than a hardware company, and The Motley Fool stated Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is the best comparable entity for Roku. While I do not believe these are perfect matches, I do feel they are better comparisons than, say, GoPro (GPRO) or FitBit (FIT), which lack the platform monetization, therefore they are the best indicators we have.Source: Contributor ResearchThe table above illustrates the potential share values based on FY 2019 revenue per share and the price/sales multiples of the comparable companies. The multiples range from 3.5 from Apple (AAPL) to 12.56 from Snap (SNAP), which gives us a price range of $27.85 - $99.96. The average multiple produced from this analysis is 7.51 which yields an associated price of $59.77. This is notably below the current 10.47 p/s ratio the company enjoys today, and frankly, due to the large hardware element, I feel it is more reasonable.Markets are based on demand, not rationalityThe biggest risk to my sell recommendation is the strong macro performance of the economy and the bull market, propping up price multiples and keeping the price of the stock up. Markets have proven to be relatively efficient, but if I believed they were never irrational I wouldn't be writing about my picks on SeekingAlpha, and I believe they can be irrational for long periods of time. Given Roku's price/sales multiple is near its previous all-time, I am comfortable in my belief it will consolidate to a more rational level, but the possibility should be evaluated by investors before taking action.CompetitionCompetition in the streaming device space is increasing and quickly at that. Similar offerings are available from companies including Apple, Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), as well as from many smart-tv manufacturers. While competition is nothing new for Roku, it will be important that it maintains its prominence as its competitors increasingly mimic the platform's features.Roku is a company of the future that aims to be a key player in the future of streaming media. If you can afford to hold this company for the long-term and are not averse to near-term losses, then this could be a great investment. That being said, I don't think the growth justifies the lofty price multiples that investors have given this stock and that it's built too much on the glass foundation of hype. I am giving Roku a sell and setting my 2019 price objective at $60 per share."

Now recent options bets and the technical chart suggest the stock's decline may only be starting.The last time I wrote on Roku was on Jan. 7, and I called that one wrong: Roku's Rocketing Stock May Crash And Burn. I underestimated how large the short interest had grown to, representing nearly 35% of the float. However, this time may be different, because that short interest through the middle of March has fallen substantially, almost 41%, and now represents just 20.5% of the float.The chart shows that the stock has fallen below a significant uptrend that had been acting as technical support. Now that level of technical support has become resistance at $62. The stock has tried on a couple of occasions to break out but has failed each time.Additionally, the relative strength index (RSI) is now trending lower which would suggest that bullish momentum is leaving the stock. It could result in the stock dropping to around $52. However, should the stock rise above resistance at $62, it would result in the shares rising back to around $70.The open interest for the May 17 $55 puts has been on the rise in recent weeks, jumping to around 3,000 open contracts from approximately 500 in the middle of March. A buyer of those puts would need the stock to fall to around $51.30 by expiration to earn a profit, a drop of about 15%. With the options trading for approximately $3.70, the dollar value is worth about $1.2 million, a sizable amount given how far out of the money the options are. (Roku May 17 $55 Puts, Trade Alert)The calls at the $65 strike price, on the other hand, have seen minimal activity since the end of February despite nearly 10,000 open contracts. It would suggest no bets are being placed that the stock will rise in the future.  (Roku May 17 $65 Calls, Trade Alert) One reason for the stock's sharp rise following the quarterly results was the excessive number of short shares. With a large number of shares short the big move higher was likely the result of a short squeeze. But now the short interest has fallen so sharply that short sellers can once again place bets on the stock falling, and that could help to drive shares lower too.Roku still faces many challenges as it continues to find ways to monetize its 27 million users, with the biggest being the through advertising. But the company has seen its average revenue per user growth slow materially in recent quarters.(Data From Roku) However, that is not to say the company doesn't have long-term opportunities in front of it because it has plenty. Since it's the only neutral streaming media device around, more providers are likely to continue to sign on to with Roku. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the latest entrants to offer its media app on the platform. Meanwhile, HBO has joined the service too, offering its subscription service through Roku. It just isn't clear at this point how much Roku will profit from these additional platforms. But it's a positive trend. Roku is a highly volatile stock, and it doesn't take much to get the stock to rise or fall quickly. It makes trying to predict the direction of the stock incredibly challenging. The options bets could quickly sway from a more bearish outlook to bullish outlook very quickly on just one piece of breaking news. For now, the stock outlook appears to be suggesting it continues to decline, at least over the near-term."

Only people who want to buy exactly a Ford truck, and exactly in the next month, are presented exactly an advertisement for that Ford truck on exactly the days that it is relevant in exactly the zip code that is relevant.The personalization goes even further, and I have spoken ad nauseum about it on TV with the incomparable Peter Armstrong. Facebook knows so much about its users that it’s now facing governmental regulation across the globeEverything Facebook does, every ad, is personal and directed.TV ads on the other hand are terribly inaccurate. We’ve all watched a show, the Superbowl, whatever, and see ads that have nothing to do with us as consumers. They are impersonal and undirected.Yet, still, that advertising market, called linear TV, is enormous. The linear TV advertising market, globally, is at over $200 billion. Here is the chart from Statista.TV advertising expenditure worldwide is expected to grow to $228.8 billion. The portion of that in the United States is forecast at about $75 billion.Now, all the TV advertisers see what directed and personal ads can do - they are buyers on Facebook as well - but they were hamstrung: If you want to reach TV viewers, you have to go rather blindly. Then cord cutting and streaming happened.Roku said in a press release and in earnings calls that that nearly half of its roughly 27 million active users have cut the cord or have never had a traditional pay TV subscription.That means any kind of marketing that is supposed to come through TV ads simply cannot be reached through linear TV — it must go through ROKU for somewhere near 15 million people, growing at 40% a year.Here is the cord cutting trend, overall:eMarketer projected that the number would increase from 24.9 million in 2017 to 55.1 million in 2022.Then there is the Pay TV penetration rate:And while we’re at it, here is the chart worldwide, also from the magnificent Statista:The cord cutters who are now OTT subscribers are still consuming TV — in fact, their appetite is voracious with all the new content coming from… everywhere.Here is a chart of the average weekly time spent with over-the-top TV in the United States (in hours):That’s weekly, friends. As in, over 2 hours a day. And, if we look at Roku’s numbers, we get even better numbers.Q4 streaming hours were an estimated 7.3 billion hours, up about 68% year-over-year, and 18% sequentially, bringing full year 2018 streaming hours to about 24 billion, up about 61% from 2017.With 27 million accounts and 7.3 billion hours over the quarter, that’s just over 3 hours a day. Roku users outpace even the absurdity that is the OTT revolution.With the number of hours of TV getting turned into streaming, and with the digital footprint that ROKU takes up with its 27 million active users (growing at 40% year-over-year), this company has turned TV ads into Facebook ads.But, unlike Facebook, the amount of time people spend with their TVs is measured in hours, not minutes. In fact, the company saw 3.00 streaming hours per active account per day during the quarter based on the 7.3-billion-hour count and 27 million active users. Facebook averages about 50 minutes per day with its users.Certainly, a minute spent on Roku is not as in depth of a data collection machine as a minute on Facebook, but the analogy still holds.The numbers are breathtaking and growing, but ROKU just took its approach one notch higher.Roku is a pioneer in advanced OTT advertising with the industry’s first Nielsen measurement solution, native interactive ad technology, and its recently launched Roku Ad Insights Measurement suite. Roku operates a large and growing dedicated OTT ad sales team.With the launch of Audience Marketplace, Roku is extending these advanced targeting capabilities to major publishers, as part of an effort to enhance advertising flowing through its platform, and to help publishers make their offering more compelling in an increasingly programmatic, data-driven TV advertising market.Every advertisement on ROKU to its users is custom for that individual user.Further, according to Nielsen, 10% of 18 to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are only reachable on the Roku platform in the living room.Not only are tens of millions of people totally unreachable by traditional TV, even the ones that are, if they are on ROKU, they get personalized ads. That reminds me of two other companies that did this to create two of the six largest companies in the world: Google and Facebook.And the evidence that this is working, this time from the CEO (our emphasis added):So, yes, we can see, from a third-party verification, that the idea of personalized TV ads, which a few years ago seemed like an absurd proposition, is working.And the most exciting part of the Roku story may not even be in those lines above.Roku announced its own channel — where it controls everything (as opposed to streaming hours of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) on ROKU). This channel is now available on the web, even mobile, without owning a Roku streaming stick or a smart TV powered by Roku.Then it went further, On January 2nd, 2019, Roku announced it is expanding The Roku Channel to include “Premium Subscriptions.”In addition to 10,000+ free ad-supported movies and TV episodes already available, The Roku Channel will soon offer users the option to add 25+ Premium Subscriptions from providers such as Showtime, Starz and EPIX.Roku brought in about $740 million in revenue for full year 2018, with a total addressable market in the future of over $100 billion. The company guided to $1 billion in revenue for 2019. And just so we know the trend is in the early stages, the streaming TV penetration rate, by 2022, is still expected to just be at 29.8%.First, Roku has the lead in the streaming stick and streaming box market. Here is the latest data we have:But Roku goes much further. The company has built the actual operating system to streaming TVs - we’re talking the glass and metal televisions.On January 7th, 2019, Roku Announced Westinghouse Roku TV Partnership.The announcement read:While it seems like good enough news that Roku snapped up another large scale partner to run their Smart TVs, it’s a little sweeter than appears at first blush.Westinghouse is an Amazon Fire TV (smart TV) customer and Amazon has been displaced by Roku.Roku is also licensed by Element, Hisense, Hitachi, RCA, Sharp, and TCL (the second best selling smart TV maker in the United States).You see, Roku’s business goes beyond “those sticks you use for streaming that time,” and well into the guts of technology — the guts of a new thematic, whether that be a streaming stick, a streaming box, or the actual operating system for smart TVs.This entire year, perhaps the next two years, could be extremely volatile and the competition between Roku and Amazon will heat up yet further.We are looking well beyond the next few years with Roku – toward a tectonic shift away from linear TV, where streaming is everything. A world where content is so rich, that Netflix, Amazon, Google, Disney (NYSE:DIS), Apple and many others will compete for eyeballs, while Roku simply gives them access to the eyeballs.It’s no certainty that Roku will win, but we try to find companies that are ahead of the curve, that play a vital role in the guts of technological themes, and for now, we see Roku as one of those small companies with the potential to grow substantially.We’re not sure Wall Street understands the company, but when we look under the hood, we see a robust hardware, advertising, and platform business. We see a company that happily gives up gross margin on hardware, because the real gold mine is simply getting people to stream video — because, in the company’s view, there is a very good chance they will be streaming with Roku powering the platform.Thanks for reading, friends.The information contained on this site is provided for general informational purposes, as a convenience to the readers.

4230552,25120,2018-12-28T12:40:44-05:00,"Roku has seen solid operating momentum in 2018.Sales and margins are better than expected, although the margin guidance was lowballed.The combination of the boom-bust cycle seen in the share price during 2018 and solid performance creates relative appeal.I like the valuation a lot better here, but I am waiting for a slightly larger pullback before pulling the buy trigger.","Roku (ROKU) has been a name which I have followed with great interest since the company went public. At the start of 2018, I last looked at the shares which traded around $40 at the time, as I warned about the heightened expectations in combination with a lack of progress in margins despite the improving revenue mix. After a boom-bust cycle, which left shares down 25% from that point in time, 2018 has been better than expected from an operating point of view, and I see appeal emerging. Nonetheless, I require just a slightly larger pullback before getting really excited.Roku offers a compelling solution for consumers - an integrated platform to stream content from multiple providers. While many consumers rely on Netflix (NFLX) alone for their share of programs, there are more options out there, and for consumers going after more packages, Roku offers a good solution. This is certainly the case if you prefer live sports or music as well.Note that it is not just a convenient for consumers to access all this entertainment from a single library; content providers (notably with limited offerings) benefit as well. By smartly positioning itself as a middleman, I see the appeal of Roku, although the long-term value-add can be debated.Following a very successful IPO late in 2017, in which shares rose quickly to $50 overnight, I have been somewhat cautious and briefly held short positions. After a setback in spring of 2018, shares joined the FANG momentum rally to a high of $77 before violently selling off again to $30 currently. Given the continued growth and lower expectations, it is time to review the prospects, although one has to realise that even at $30, following a 60% pullback from the high, shares are essentially still trading with +100% gains compared to the preliminary offering range at $12-14 per share about a year ago.Roku has seen solid revenue growth in recent years, yet one has to clearly look at the revenues composition. Roku reported a 28% increase in sales for the year of 2017; the shift in revenue mix is good.Revenues from hardware were actually down 2% to $287.4 million for 2017, but that is not a big issue with gross margins coming in at just 10% or so. Lucrative platform revenues rose by 115% to $225.4 million, with gross margins exceeding 75%. On total revenues of $513 million, Roku was able to cut operating losses in half to $19.6 million, as accelerating growth and changes in revenue mix made investors quite upbeat on the prospects for the stock.Note that around the time these results were released in February, shares traded at $40. With 119 million shares outstanding on a fully-diluted basis, this came down to a $4.6 billion enterprise valuation, at roughly 9 times sales (although this includes a large portion of low-margin and stagnant hardware revenues). For 2018, the company outlined a guidance calling for sales of $660-690 million, although EBITDA losses were still seen between minus $10 and minus $25 million.Ever since, operating momentum has been solid. Upon the release of the first-quarter results, the sales guidance was hiked to $685-705 million, with EBITDA seen between minus $10 million and positive $5 million. The guidance was hiked again when the second-quarter results came out, with revenues seen at $710-730 million, and EBITDA now projected at $11-23 million.When the company released third-quarter results in November, it hiked the sales guidance again to $722-732 million, with EBITDA seen at $21-28 million. So while the mix keeps improving this year, thanks to rapid platform revenue growth, the company is failing to deliver on real operating leverage on the bottom line through leverage of R&D and SG&A costs, among others, as net losses are still seen between $13 and $20 million this year.With a fully diluted share count of 107 million shares, shares represent a value of $3.2 billion at $30 per share, and including $180 million in net cash, I arrive at an enterprise valuation of $3.0 billion. That values shares at just 4 times sales, although EBITDA, let alone earnings multiples, remains sky-high. The reason for that is that despite the rapid and even accelerating growth in 2018, and improving revenue mix, the actual bottom-line results have not seen any leverage at all.In past articles, I envisioned a scenario, where let's say in 2023 an ARPU of $15-20 and 100 million accounts could create a $1.5-2.0 billion service revenue giant. A 50% operating margin and 20 times multiple could warrant a $12-16 billion valuation in that case.The company remains somewhat on track to achieve this. The customer count stood at 23.8 million at the end of Q3 2018. This marked 7 million account gains in the past 12 months, equal to 43% growth. To achieve the hundred-million mark, Roku will need to add 15 million users each year for the coming five years, although the percentage growth is less of course. I must say that I am more impressed with the ARPU generated already, and it has increased 37% year on year to $17.34.Working with a perhaps more realistic 50 million user count and ARPU of $20 going forward, I still end up with $1.0 billion in potential revenues, perhaps $500 million in operating earnings, $400 million in net earnings, and thus $8 billion in valuation.That looks quite realistic and was a reason why I was not attracted to the shares with a $5 billion valuation at the start of 2018, but a current $3 billion valuation looks more compelling. After all, that works down to a compounded annual growth rate of 22% per annum, if achieved in three years' time. Note that the $8 billion valuation was already achieved during the 2018 peak valuation for the shares of course.I like the basic principle of Roku for those cord-cutters who are tired of expensive packages and complicated set-up in terms of streaming these on TV. The truth of the matter is that Roku is sort of an expensive middleman, as consolidating moves from Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Hulu create risks. This is certainly the case as Roku is passing on expensive ARPU onto consumers, and facing the risk of people willing to undergo the ""hassle"" of running multiple streaming services trough separate platforms/apps.Nonetheless, Roku has a real advantage in terms of scale, brand recognition and first-mover advantage, which gives it a competitive edge, and the unique position of the company makes it a takeout target as well. So, while I have been cautiously short again in the $60s during 2018, shares have comfortably fallen back to their neutral zone, with valuations almost becoming compelling enough to start buying on the dip and to take advantage of the ability to trade around positions given the heightened volatility."
4232053,103709,2019-01-08T11:23:51-05:00,"Roku announced user figures for Q4: over 27 million active accounts and 7.3 billion streaming hours.The market was thrilled and shares jumped over 20%.I am surprised by the size of this jump; the results were in line with my expectations.I remain bullish on Roku, especially on potential dips.","On Jan. 7th, Roku (ROKU) released two press releases, one announcing a Westinghouse/Roku TV partnership and one estimating two of Roku's operating metrics:Markets were thrilled by the news. Roku's stock has been heavily beaten down from peaks of $77 in late Sep 2018 down to lows of $26 last month. Roku shares have gained 22% today, as of this writing, back over $40.Frankly, I'm not sure why the numbers today surprised the market enough to spur such gains: They look ~in-line with expectations.I have held a long position in Roku, off-and-on, since late 2017, and have written about Roku on this platform five times since then, most recently in Aug 2018. My investment thesis is based on several factors:Notably, Roku's OTT box sales (""player revenue"") are not a particularly important part of Roku's value moving forward. Those low-margin sales help active user count but do not meaningfully contribute to the company's profit.Rather than a seller of boxes, Roku primarily generates money through platform revenue. Roku earns money on subscription services that people purchase through their Roku device and earns money on advertising-supported content viewed through Roku, including the Roku Channel.In my experience, Roku bears have a few concerns with Roku. Many bears do not understand the story laid out above and lay irrelevant criticisms. I will not address those arguments, since they stem from a lack of understanding. However, there are also valid grounds for concern. Those valid grounds for concern include:(1) Roku is overvalued: Valuation is pretty tricky, especially for a high-growth, unprofitable company like Roku. Last quarter, Roku generated $173M in revenue and lost $9.5M. Given Roku's losses, metrics like P/E or EV/EBITDA are not particularly useful for coming up with a proper price for Roku.My preferred metric here is using a discounted cash flow model, but that model contains an enormous amount of assumptions about Roku's future growth and margins. As a result, that model is unlikely to convert non-believers. Given that valuation is more art than science and the speculative nature of Roku's future cash flows and profits, there's little to refute this view.Simply put, those who believe that Roku is overvalued should invest elsewhere.(2) Roku will be unable to compete with Amazon, Google, and Apple in the future: Roku skeptics often express doubts about Roku's continued ability to compete with much better-funded companies. Roku is a relative minnow swimming with the sharks of FAANG (FNGU). At its strongest, this view might suggest that those behemoths could push Roku aside if they ever set their sights squarely on the TV streaming market.Roku has competed with the same three companies for years - and with Apple for Roku's entire life. To date, Roku has been very successful competing against those giants. As of Sep 2018, 70% of users at a streaming site owned a Roku device, first among streaming platforms. Another source found Roku to have a market-leading 37% share of the OTT streaming market, which is likely a more reliable figure although also older.Thus far, Roku is doing very well in competition against these larger companies. That may not continue forever - but Roku has shown few signs of slipping yet. Further, Roku has managed to steer clear of the battles between content provides, specifically Amazon and Google, that has hurt Fire TV users and hindered Chromecast sales.None of this disproves this thesis. Perhaps in five or ten years, people will control their televisions using an app on their phones, wirelessly streaming the video to their televisions. In that scenario, perhaps Roku would be unable to compete - or perhaps Roku's app would be the app that we use for that purpose. Time will tell.(3) Roku doesn't make revenue from the largest streaming content providers: When I watch Netflix on my Roku, which I do, Roku earns precisely $0. Some Roku detractors, perhaps due to false consensus bias, then argue that Roku will be unable to make money from increased users of online streaming platforms because Roku earns no platform revenue from Netflix and many of the other most popular streaming platforms.In my view, this is a poor argument. The problem with this argument is that it ignore the reality that Roku already earns strong - and growing - platform revenue per active account. That revenue total ($4.37/account last quarter, as shown below) already compensates for the fact that many users do not watch any programming that contains advertising and do not contribute a meaningful amount of revenue to Roku.It is true that Roku will earn nothing - or only a trivial amount - from many of its users. However, that is already baked in to Roku's current results. Further, I suspect that Roku's revenue per user will continue to rise in line with cord-cutting. The Roku Channel is prominently advertised on Roku devices. For users with cable and subscription services, that channel may be unappealing: It is ad-supported content (see a listing of Roku Channel content) when Netflix subscribers can get content without advertising. However, I suspect that this content is most appealing to those who have access to a Roku but may not subscribe to subscription services or to cable. The ranks of those users could increase as Roku's platform is included on more smart TVs.Source: Statista; depicting Netflix user growth as a proxy for online streaming.Roku is part of a secular growth story. The online streaming sector is growing rapidly. As shown above, Netflix (NFLX) - the largest player in online streaming and where the first Roku was developed - has been growing rapidly for many years. Similar growth could be seen at other online streaming services like Google's YouTube and Amazon's Twitch and further growth will come through new services like those from Disney (DIS) and DAZN.Source: ComScore.There are many ways to watch Netflix, Twitch, YouTube, or other streaming services. Those include through desktop computers, phones, tables, streaming devices including Roku, gaming consoles, and using a Smart TV. I suspect that most users that want to watch on their televisions will first see if their Smart TV software allows them to watch a given service and, if not, will then use a gaming console or OTT streaming device, depending on if they already own a gaming console.Roku is involved in both the Smart TV space and the OTT streaming device space. For example, on Jan. 7th, Roku announced a partnership with Westinghouse (linked to above):Notably, this may be an example of a manufacturer switching from Amazon to Roku. Back in July 2017, for example, Westinghouse announced the first smart TVs powered by Alexa.Roku's involvement in both the OTT streaming device space and the smart TV space will give their platform more longevity: Over time, I expect that most users will have smart TVs rather than relying on OTT streaming devices. In that world, it is important for Roku that their smart TV software is installed on as many televisions as possible. The primary competitor in the smart TV operating system space is Google.Source: Author based on company filings.Roku's growth narrative is driven by its growth in two primary metrics: Active accounts and platform revenue per active account.On Jan 7th, Roku announced that active accounts were up to over 27 million, up from 23.8 million last quarter (+13%) and 19.3 million one year ago (+40%). Active account growth is seasonal, with the most growth in the fourth quarter each year, and has been modestly decelerating since its near-term peak growth of 48% in Q3/17:Source: Based on company filings. Roku's platform revenue is growing more quickly than the 40% growth in active accounts. Not only are user counts increasing, Roku is making more money for each active account:Source: Author based on company filings; revenue/user is platform revenue divided by average users in a quarter.Roku's revenue/user is seasonal, with the fourth quarter having the strongest sequential gains in each of the past three years (at 66%, 36%, and 31% in 2016-2018). Roku has not released revenue figures for Q4/18. Roku released their earnings letter on Feb 21st last year, which is likely around when these results will be released. (Note that Roku's earnings letters include an annual revenue/user metric, while the above revenue/user is quarterly.)Roku's platform revenue is much higher-margin than its player revenue from selling OTT devices. Last quarter, platform revenue had gross margins of 71% versus only 12% for player revenue. In my view, player revenue is largely irrelevant - thus the focus here on the platform growth.Roku's platform revenue is just a simple multiplication of their quarterly revenue/user by their active accounts. Based on past platform revenue, I expect Roku's platform revenue per user this quarter to be ~$5.25 to $5.50, resulting in platform revenue of ~$142 to $148 million, compared to $85 million last year (+11% to +16%).Roku does not provide guidance for platform revenue. Instead, Roku only provides guidance for total net revenue ($255M to $265M) and total gross profit ($103M to $110M). Thus far, Roku's forecasts for both metrics has been too conservative: Roku has beaten midpoint on both metrics four out of four times since their IPO, landing higher than gross profit range every time and higher than their revenue forecast range three out of four times (75%).Roku also provides guidance for net income and adjusted EBITDA. They have always beaten their guidance (landing outside the guided range) on both of those metrics as well.Source: Author based on company filings.Roku's users continue to use their devices more and more. In my view, this is a very promising sign for the future as it shows the continued strength of the platform and the entertainment options it offers to users.Here, streaming hours/user is calculated by taking the total streaming hours in a quarter and dividing that by the average number of active accounts in the user. E.g., for Q4/18, by divided 7.3 billion streaming hours by an average of 23.8 million and 27.0 million active accounts (Q3 and Q4, respectively).As shown, Q4/18 will mark the fifth consecutive quarter in which Roku accounts - on average - streamed more content than in the previous quarter.There is not a direct 1:1 relationship between streaming hours and Roku's financial results. Roku sells advertising on a subset of the content viewed on a Roku device, but much of the streamed content is not monetized. For example, Roku receives no income from users watching Netflix and never has. Hours spent watching Netflix are included in the above hours but will have no impact on Roku's revenue. Thus, user engagement lacks a direct connection to Roku's revenue - but it still shows that users are increasingly turning to their Roku for entertainment. That user retention will help Roku over the long term and may lead to more word-of-mouth sales of Roku-enabled devices (OTT boxes or smart TVs) in the future.That said, some portion of Roku's streaming content is monetized. Given the overall growth of Roku usage, it is possible that more users are streaming monetized content as well. Roku does not publish metrics about what proportion of their streaming hours are revenue-generating, or even what proportion of platform revenue is from subscription fees versus advertising.In spite of that, increasing user engagement is a net positive for Roku, and user engagement continues to increase.I continue to like Roku as an investment.Roku's active accounts metric was ~in-line with what I had previously expected. Next quarter (Q1), I anticipate that active accounts will grow to nearly 29 million.Roku's streaming hours were more than I expected. Those hours will not directly contribute to Roku's top- and bottom-line, but they show the continued value of the Roku platform to its users. That user engagement is likely to lead to new customers (e.g., friends/family of current users) and increased consumption of monetized streaming content.Roku operates in a sector with strong secular growth. Roku has the largest market share within its growing sector.That said, the company is battling with behemoths that are hundreds of times its size. Given that landscape, Roku remains a risky investment: This is David versus three Goliaths - hardly a ""safe"" bet. Roku is also unprofitable and trades at speculative levels with an EV/trailing sales of 5.3x. Roku's volatility over the past three months has been extreme: from highs of $77 to lows of $26 and back over $40 today.Suffice to say, this is not a riskless investment. That said, I believe that Roku remains an attractive investment, especially on dips. I would be a bit skeptical about purchasing Roku on the back of a 20% one-day gain; however, I might be inclined to wait a bit and see if that gain ""sticks."" That said, I remain a happy Roku investor, despite the declines from September's highs."
4234500,69965,2019-01-21T07:11:06-05:00,"Cord-cutting isn't the primary reason to consider Roku.I obsessively research electronics; in the Roku comparison, the numbers don't favor the upstart.Buy what you know doesn't mean ignore the price you pay.","It would be all too easy to close my eyes and believe that Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is a can't miss investment opportunity. I'm what you might call an obsessive buyer of electronics. I make it a practice to research the different options before spending money. Multiple times I've done the research and decided that buying a Roku device made the most sense. When Roku went public, I was interested in the shares since I knew the product firsthand. Unfortunately, I've never been comfortable buying the shares based on their fundamentals. Roku represents a great company producing excellent products, but to be blunt, investors expect too much.Some might assume that the phenomenon of cord-cutting is a reason to buy Roku's shares. The company called this out in its last conference call, suggesting as cord-cutting increases, Roku stands to benefit. To expand on this point, a Nielsen study found ""the number of cord cutters in the U.S. has grown by 48 percent over the past eight years."" In addition, this trend still represents a relatively small percentage (14%) of the total domestic population.Whether users spend time watching Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), or live television isn't the point. The point is they need a device that gives them the most options, at a reasonable price, and that's exactly what Roku offers. Roku also is pushing hard to build its technology into multiple brands of television sets. In the last quarter, the company reported a 43% year-over-year increase in active accounts. Roku also said that out of the total increase, more than half came from licensed sources, primarily from TV.With all the competition coming to the streaming space, Roku stands to benefit as users get more choices. At some point later this year, Disney+ (NYSE:DIS) is expected to include its Disney, Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars properties into one service. Though Disney's service doesn't have a price point yet, the company has maintained it will be priced lower than Netflix.Warner Media also expects to launch its own streaming service in late 2019. The AT&T (NYSE:T) controlled business plans to bring together its Harry Potter, LEGO, Lord of the Rings, and other properties into a single service as well. While these are arguably the biggest streaming launches of 2019, NBC also expects to offer stand-alone streaming as well.What Roku gains from these new services is additional channels for its streaming devices and televisions. More users who chose to cut the cord means additional buyers for streaming devices. There are two key differences between Roku's offerings and its competition. First, Roku is an independent company with no interest in promoting other sales or services. Second, Roku stated that it provides television manufacturers a lower-cost basis to add its technology to televisions versus other options. The result is Roku should continue to grow its user base well into the future.There are millions upon millions of televisions already being used that don't have Roku built in. For users who don't want to, or don't need to replace their set, do Roku devices offer a good value proposition?There are a few key areas that customers will look for if they are shopping for a streaming device. First, they want to know they can access all their favorite streaming channels. Second, they want to know if the device will stream in high-definition or 4K. Third, if they are looking at a 4K option, they want the fastest Wi-Fi option available. Aside from these key factors, one argument for a Roku device is the nascent Roku Channel.The company's namesake channel offers free content that is ad supported. Roku said 90% of respondents in a recent survey said ""the availability of free content was somewhat or very important to them."" Among new users, ""43% of respondents said the Roku Channel influenced or strongly influenced their decision to buy a Roku device. Beyond this caveat, here are how some of the current devices on the market stack up.Non-4K devices:As we can see, when it comes to non-4K devices, consumers have multiple choices from less than $40 to as much as $150. There are a multitude of other devices, but this gives you an idea of what Roku is up against. In the non-4K field, the two most aggressive competitors seem to be Amazon and Google (aka Alphabet). During the past holiday season, it wasn't unusual to see the Fire TV Stick on sale for $19.99. Amazon also has offered discounted bundles with the Fire TV Stick and one of its Echo devices. When it comes to Chromecast, Google has discounted the Chromecast periodically with pricing of $25 not being out of the ordinary.The difference between Roku and these competitors is Roku isn't looking to rope you into an ecosystem. The company isn't trying to win the battle for the home, or attempting to sell you millions of retail products. This puts Roku at a disadvantage as Amazon can essentially lose money on the actual device to gain other revenue in the future. Google has the same opportunity to gain users, which means more information; more information means more ability to advertise.It's true that Roku is building out its advertising business as well. However, to be blunt, if Amazon and Google wanted to, they could offer devices below cost for an extended time, and it would be a blip in their financial results. Roku would be at a significant disadvantage if that did occur.4K devices:On the 4K side of things, Roku would seem to have an advantage as the Roku Premier is priced the cheapest of the bunch. However, customers who are thinking about a 4K streaming device are going to pay close attention to the Wi-Fi connection. The Premier keeps its cheaper price point by sacrificing the faster 802.11ac Wi-Fi option. Since 4K is so data intensive, it's a good bet this difference will be noticed, which puts Amazon in the best price position.(Source: Roku Streaming Stick+)While it's true that Roku is heavily focused on integrating directly into new television sets for the millions of homes who are happy with their existing set, Amazon seems to be better positioned from a perceived value standpoint. It should come as no surprise that Roku's player revenue increased by a modest 9% annually in the last quarter.Some investors blindly follow the buy what you know mantra in investing. Roku is already being used by millions, so the stock should be an automatic buy, right? In a word, no.Roku seems to be a case of investor enthusiasm trumping cold hard facts. First, the average analyst expects Roku to report net losses for 2019. The most optimistic analyst expects net income of just $0.20 for the year. It's true that the company has been beating estimates handily over the last four quarters. On average, Roku beat estimates by an average of 90% during this time frame.If we give Roku the benefit of the doubt and assume that the company will continue beating estimates by double, at best Roku would generate $0.40 of net income for 2019. At the stock's current share price, even doubling the most optimistic earnings projection means the stock trades at a forward P/E of over 105. Common investing theory says that a stock should sell for a P/E that is equal to its expected growth rate. For those keeping score at home, the average analyst only expects Roku to grow EPS by 20% annually over the next five years.Just for kicks, let's continue this insanely positive line of assumptions and go with the idea that Roku can not only beat estimates, but also continually outperform over the next several years. We've already given Roku the benefit of beyond reasonable EPS performance for 2019. If we assume earnings will double again in 2020, the company would report annual EPS of $0.80. Since we've come this far, we'll also assume that for 2021 Roku is able to outperform once again. Going with this plan and crazy 50% EPS growth, Roku would post EPS for 2021 of $1.20.Assuming investors believe the fiction we've spun so far, we'll also assume that the company is able to outperform once again in 2021 with 30% EPS growth to $1.56 per share. Keep in mind, this would represent four straight years of performance that essentially no analyst is predicting. In addition, Roku's share count would have to stay the same during this four-year time frame. If Roku's share price didn't increase at all, by 2022 the stock would still carry a P/E of about 27. Given that analysts are expecting 20% annual growth over the next five years today, even after these crazy assumptions, the stock would still be technically overvalued.Roku is a great company and management seems to be making the right moves. Unfortunately, the stock's value seems to reflect optimism that is beyond analysis or reason. The shares trade nearly 50% below their 52-week high, and on fundamental analysis they seem significantly overvalued today. Investors should avoid the shares and wait for a further correction before considering the stock as a long-term play."
4231904,71685,2019-01-07T15:56:52-05:00,Roku's latest data has a number of red flags which suggest a slowing trend.Options are implying extreme levels of volatility.It sets up a scenario for the company to disappoint.,"Roku's (ROKU) stock is rocketing higher on January 7 after the company reported active accounts of 27 million and streaming hours of 7.3 billion in the fourth quarter. But active account growth is slowing and the increase in streaming hours does not correlate to strong average revenue per user. This could suggest that the market is setting itself up for disappointment when the company reports fourth-quarter results.What is most glaring about today's news release is that it shows just how dramatically Roku's growth is slowing so early in this ""growth"" stock's story.Investors are likely getting overly excited about the stock and shouldn't be. Today's data does not suggest that Roku is about to beat fourth-quarter revenue or earnings estimates. According to Ycharts, analysts are looking for revenue to grow 39% to $261.32 million in the fourth quarter, while earnings are expected to rise to $0.03 per share from a loss of $0.09 per share last year. Investors may be wise to wait until more information becomes available.Streaming hours have been rocketing higher, reaching 7.3 billion hours, an increase of almost 70% versus the fourth quarter of 2017.(Mott Capital, Data From Roku)Active accounts have steadily increased to roughly 27 million through the end of the fourth quarter, an increase of 40% versus last year. There is bad news here; that is Roku's slowest year-over-year growth yet and a continuation of a steady decline. (Mott Capital, Data From Roku)Even worse is that active account growth was Roku's slowest fourth-quarter sequential growth ever. This was down from 19% in the fourth quarter of 2016, 16% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 13% in the fourth quarter of 2018. (Mott Capital, Data From Roku)Even more dreadful for Roku is that there is no direct correlation between streaming hours growth y/y and average revenue per user. ARPU growth has been slowing dramatically throughout 2018 since peaking at 50% in the first quarter of 2018 on a year-over-year basis.(Mott Capital, Data From Roku)Even when looking at Roku's active accounts versus ARPU on a sequential basis, there is no correlation with ARPU growth. ARPU growth is not only slowing on a year-over-year basis but also, as the chart below shows, on a sequential basis.(Mott Capital, Data From Roku)There is also no correlation between streaming hours growth sequentially and platform revenue growth, which is the most critical portion of Roku's overall growth.(Mott Capital, Data From Roku)In all, it would suggest that today's news of streaming hours and active accounts tells virtually nothing about the health of the business. Investors should be concerned that growth is already beginning to slow so dramatically so early in Roku's growth story.Despite the warnings from the data above, momentum is clearly now going into Roku's stock. However, there is a strong level of technical resistance at $43. But if the stock is able to keep its upward momentum and break out, rising above $43, the stock may continue to increase to as high as $48.Additionally, the stock has broken out of a long-term downtrend which has been in place since October. Also, the relative strength index (RSI) has broken out of its long-term downtrend as well and that suggests that bullish momentum is coming back into the stock.It is possible this bullish type of momentum may continue over the short term while investors eagerly await Roku's fourth-quarter results.The stock is likely to see extremely high levels of volatility over the next few weeks. The long-straddle options strategy suggests that the stock can rise or fall by roughly 22% from the $41 strike by options expiration on February 15. It places the stock in a vast trading range between $31.85 and $50.15.Roku's stock is likely to continue to see massive amounts of volatility over the coming weeks. Investors may be better off waiting it out to see how the results actually turn out before jumping into what could be a bumpy ride, with the potential for disappointment when results are released.Disclaimer: Mott Capital Management, LLC is a registered investment adviser.

4230531,102107,2019-01-02T06:30:00-05:00,"If there's one silver lining - or obvious positive - to recent market volatility, it's that stocks are getting cheaper. Time for value investing, right?The first half of our Marketplace year-end roundtable on value talks about how the game has changed, and whether 2018 will be a turning point back towards the value style.A resounding theme is that value investing means never being complacent about the market's behavior.","2018 seems to be ending on the wrong note in the markets. December is setting the wrong kind of records, and Q4 has been a bumpy one in general. This is what happens in the stock market sometimes, but it's been easy to forget over the decade-long bull market.We're using the end of the year as a chance to lift our heads, survey the market, and see what might be coming ahead. To do so, we're inviting our Marketplace authors to do a series of roundtables. 2018 was another steady growth year for the platform, and we have a lot of great voices on the Marketplace, so we wanted to share their perspective with you.Our Year-End Marketplace Roundtable series will run through the first full market week in January. We'll feature ten different roundtable discussions, with expert panels chiming in on Tech, Energy, Dividends, Other Income strategies, Gold, Value Investing, Small-Caps, Alternative investing strategies, Biotech, and the Macro outlook.This roundtable looks at value investing. Does the market volatility mean value is coming back into fashion? Has value investing changed? We asked our panel to sort through the investing approach and how it fits today's market. We have 18 panelists, which is too much to read in one sitting, so we are breaking this into two groups of nine, to publish today and tomorrow. Here's today's nine authors:Ranjit Thomas: The climate continues to be difficult. To be a successful value investor, you need to buy a company's stock at a reasonable valuation, but then the company needs to be managed well, with the executives making the right decisions. Typically, one has no control over this.Robert Honeywill: Determining value is a pre-requisite to finding value. Using a DCF calculation to arrive at a present intrinsic value share price is a wrong-headed approach. It has no relevance if the discount rate and other assumptions are not disclosed. Also, a calculated share price different to the current share price is not actionable. Having expressed my views on that, there are always instances of mismatches arising between share price and share value. With a return of volatility, the opportunity for value investing might even improve.General Expert: I believe that high-flyers don't impact value investing at all since they were never in the investable universe to begin with (although specifically Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)/Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)/Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have become disconnected from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)/Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in my opinion). I believe that overall market valuation remains high, thus it is still very difficult to pick out value stocks in bulk.Value Digger: Actually, it's not only the FAANG stocks that have pulled back over the last months. Many technology stocks, home builders, Chinese, bitcoin and marijuana stocks have also pulled back over the last months. Hopefully, investors will learn the lesson and will return to value investing in 2019.Paulo Santos: I think the current climate presents the largest number of deep value opportunities in the last half decade or so. These opportunities, though, tend to be based outside of the U.S. (though often with U.S. quotations).Chris Lau: Nearly all sectors are falling along with the market, with FAANG leading the tech sector sharply lower. Tech investors need to decide if the 3x or 5x P/E in stocks like Micron (NASDAQ:MU) sufficiently discount the chip cycle downturn. Investors must weight that against many big firms forecast a 2H 2019 recovery.J Mintzmyer: Not sure I agree with that summary as pretty much the entire market has collapsed and cheap stuff (""value"") has only continued to get cheaper. Top performing stocks have continued to outshine many of the industrials, energy firms, MLPs, shipping stocks, etc. The current climate for value investing has been pretty terrible in terms of stock price returns, but I'm optimistic on forward potential. The more the market shakes out, the better the opportunities can get as long as we avoid fundamentally flawed firms and/or bad management.David Trainer: There have been and still are many stocks with valuations that that cannot be justified by their cash flows. We grouped many of these stocks into micro-bubbles and discussed them in ""Bursting the Micro-Bubble"" and ""Bursting Another Tech Micro-Bubble"". We think that at least part of the reason the valuations of these stocks get so disconnected from their cash flows is the lack of high fidelity research. With changes in accounting rules, the tax law distorting earnings, and the explosion in the length and complexity of corporate disclosures, investors need modern tools and technology to practice value investing with integrity. Only by performing real diligence (which requires reading the footnotes & MD&A of company filings) to determine the real cash flows of a business can one perform true ""value investing."" Value investing is by no means dead, there's just a whole lot more noise to cut through to find value.Grant Gigliotti: The market is changing from a long bull market to a situation where stocks are declining to come closer to their real value. The US stock market is still significantly overpriced. The ratio of total market cap over GDP is currently around 130%, down from upwards of 150%, which supports that the market is adjusting. There is still room for the market and individual stocks to fall in price. As this happens and people start to panic and sell, it is the patient and confident value investor that will move in to buy up these good companies at bargain prices.Ranjit Thomas: Yes, many of the businesses trading at low valuations are in secular decline. I'm adjusting to it by making sure the company's earnings aren't declining however cheap the stock is.Robert Honeywill: There exists a dichotomy between share price of a company and the value of a company's underlying business. This is best evidenced by Amazon, which has an amazing and steadily growing business, but which has huge up and down movements in share price, despite no identifiable change in the fundamentals of the underlying business. For a value investor, the way to avoid value traps is to make an intelligent assessment of what you might be able to sell the shares for in 1, 2, or more years, and any dividends you can reasonably count on receiving in the period you hold the shares.General Expert: I believe that there is very little ""pure"" value left in the sense that there are no more companies with nothing wrong and are still trading at low multiples on an absolute basis. There are certainly lots of ""relative"" value left, but when you are debating whether to invest in a mature stock at 20x or another at 25x, I don't think that's true value investing. I am adjusting by looking at more growth-oriented stocks, although that is merely a byproduct of the process. If there is a stock trading at 5x earnings with no problems, I will jump on it.Value Digger: We look for value plays with catalysts in order to avoid the value traps. Therefore, we don't look only for bullish ideas (undervalued stocks) with positive catalysts, but we also provide our subscribers with bearish ideas (overvalued stocks) with negative catalysts from a variety of sectors. For instance, we recently made a handful of bearish calls on grossly overvalued stocks with negative catalysts such as Quorum Health (NYSE:QHC), Capital Senior Living (NYSE:CSU), Michaels Companies (NASDAQ:MIK) and Genesis Healthcare (NYSE:GEN). We had 100% success, so our subscribers had the opportunity to make from 60% to 135% while holding these stocks just one or two months.Paulo Santos: I believe that phrase applies well to many U.S. value stocks. However, it doesn't apply to deep value outside of the U.S., because there are high quality companies available at extreme discounts. The way we've adjusted, was in taking more ex-U.S. opportunities as of late.Chris Lau: The risks of value trap are higher today than when the markets were rising. When the tide runs out, only the firms, characterised by manageable debt, and able to navigate through the slowdown, will survive. We must act more nimble and be more willing to close out a losing position before losses widen. Accept our mistake, move on from them, while continuing to hold the winners. Is the oil market a value trap? What about consumer discretionary or drug stocks? These are questions we keep asking Do-It-Yourself members.J Mintzmyer: Until recently it was indeed difficult to find moderate and high-yield investments that weren't ""traps."" The recent pullback has brought otherwise solid firms into the value territory or the 'high-yield' zone for income investors. There are sort of two ways of looking at a 'value trap.' One is a bad trade that just keeps getting cheaper while people get angry with you. I can live with those. The worst part is when the company is really just junk and we made a bad call. I allow myself to look past the short-term pricing, but I try my best to avoid broken firms as those will simply never recover.David Trainer: Absolutely agree! Value traps abound because traditional valuation metrics are flawed. In a recent series, we analyze the problems with P/E ratios, return on equity, debt-to-equity and price-to-book. Each of these ratios is based upon reported earnings, which fail to measure the true profitability of a firm. If your search for value begins with flawed metrics, your ""value picks"" will be equally as flawed. Instead, we focus on finding stocks that earn high returns on invested capital (ROIC) and are undervalued based on price-to-economic book value (PEBV), We know improving ROIC is correlated with increasing shareholder value, and we've invested many years and millions of $ in technology to get ROIC right.Grant Gigliotti: I don't buy into the idea that it's hard to find traditional value, so investors are forced into value traps. If I do diligent quantitative analysis to find companies showing value, then I must also do qualitative analysis to figure out if it's really a good company to buy at this time. There are plenty of stocks out there that offer traditional value. You just need a good system of quickly narrowing down a large number of stocks with the fundamentals that you're interested in. Once you find this handful of stocks, then read the annual reports to find out if the company's business model will be successful in the future and if they maintain some type of competitive advantage. If you do proper quantitative and qualitative analysis, then you will find plenty of stocks currently offering real value.Ranjit Thomas: I would say quality and compounding are a part of value investing. It's great if you can buy a business that is compounding earnings at a reasonable valuation. However, one needs to make sure you are looking at GAAP earnings, and not the pro-forma kind or worse something like EBITDA.Robert Honeywill: I challenge anyone to tell me they know what their rate of return will be on an investment in shares based purely on review of qualitative factors. It is a sub-optimal approach. Analysts' Corner approach quantifies estimated rates of return based on the same underlying data used to develop qualitative factors and indices.General Expert: I think ""quality"" companies and ""compounders"" are different, and the former is quite subjective. I think most people agree that both AMZN and McDonald's (MCD) are ""quality"" companies, but they are pretty much at opposite ends of the spectrum. As for ""compounder,"" I think good investors have always tried to find compounders, metrics that measure ""compounders"" such as ROE and ROIC are not new. Perhaps traditional value investors are more willing to pay up for growth today, which echoes my belief that the definition ""value"" and ""growth"" is blurring, though that is more of a semantics issue.Value Digger: We do tilt towards ""compounders"" when it comes to value investing. We focus on undervalued companies with positive catalysts and overvalued companies with negative catalysts from a variety of sectors.Paulo Santos: In my view, quality is always necessary when pursuing a value strategy. It does one no good to buy something that looks cheap, only to see fundamentals deteriorate massively. ""Compounders""/growth is a very desirable quality as well, though it often means the stock might be too expensive. Where possible, we also desire substantial growth, if available at reasonable valuations.Chris Lau: Do not give up your style of investing and change to the trendy investing style of the day. Fads end. Value investing requires enduring pain and holding onto losses for a long time before the investment thesis plays out. Be honest and critical with your holdings: if it is not quality or dividends are not getting hiked, consider stocks that offer those characteristics.J Mintzmyer: I believe quality is an essential part of value investing. If the quality isn't there then the discount better be somewhere between 'huge' and 'enormous' to compensate for the risk of picking a weaker company or a sub-par management team. Hearing the phrase ""many value investors have given up..."" is pretty terrifying. I certainly haven't. In the long-run, the market will once again be a weighing machine and will value companies on cash flows.David Trainer: We would agree that there needs to be a re-thinking of value investing. Benjamin Graham and David Dodd's version of value investing does not work in today's markets. Back then, investors could trust reported earnings and balance sheets. Today, they cannot. With so much required to analyze 250+ page annual reports and do proper diligence on earnings, most investors gave up on value investing long ago. Moving forward, value investors need to leverage technology to analyze the voluminous corporate disclosures. That's exactly what we offer in Value Investing 2.0.Grant Gigliotti: I try my best to view stocks in a balanced way. The company should provide good long-term fundamentals for 5-10 years, it should be selling at a bargain price, and it should be a quality business that I'm confident in holding for the long-term if need be. If a stock is selling at a great bargain, but it's a poor company, or I'm not confident in it, then I'm not touching it. For me, it needs to have that harmonious balance between fundamentals, value, and confidence.Ranjit Thomas: Once you make decisions, you soon find out whether you were right or wrong.Robert Honeywill: What I enjoy is educating share investors the only way they can achieve a return on shares is through receipt of dividends and a gain on sales of the shares. The only way. The important things to assess in making a share investment are the likely dividend stream and the potential share price at exit. It is a purely forward-looking approach, influenced of course by past performance.General Expert: I think when there is a high probability of positive developments in the future that is not being priced in today, then you feel vindicated if you are eventually right, or you make a quick buck if future developments become fairly priced today. Furthermore, if done correctly, you do have a margin of safety in that even if there are adverse developments, you are unlikely to totally lose your shirt in the long-term.Value Digger: Everybody loves bargains, which is the case when you invest in undervalued stocks. We also love the triple-digit returns that we have been making from all our bearish calls on grossly overvalued stocks to-date.Paulo Santos: This approach is arguably what investing is all about. Buying good businesses at prices such that, even if there was no market for the assets, over time they'd still provide a substantial return. Of course, the market recognizing the value and rewarding us earlier through price appreciation is always very desirable as well.Chris Lau: Value investing is requires plenty of patience. I enjoy making few trades and waiting for the stock to get to a price I am willing to pay.J Mintzmyer: There's occasionally a lot of short-term pain, for example the past 3 months have been the worst in my life after a stellar 2016 and 2017; however, if value investing is done correctly, the blow-ups will be very few.David Trainer: The fun in Value Investing 2.0 is leveraging the latest in technology to scale expert analysis of corporate disclosures and make value investing with integrity possible for all investors. We believe all investors deserve access to the sophisticated fundamental research that Wall Street insiders use.Grant Gigliotti: When I first got into stock investing, I thought it was just like gambling. Then after learning about the value investing strategies of Ben Graham and Warren Buffett, I realized that there was a real proven system to making gains based on facts and quality. Buffett said to buy a stock like you're buying the whole company, and this was when my eyes opened and my mind changed about stock investing. From that day onward, I enjoy buying a stock like I'm buying a living, breathing, and ever-changing business. Investing this way, makes me want to put my money in something that I believe in, and that makes value investing worthwhile.Ranjit Thomas: It's something that has worked for me and my investors over time. I will continue to buy and hold quality companies that are shareholder friendly and trading at reasonable valuations.Robert Honeywill: Analysts' Corner has the processes and the tools to facilitate the assessment of potential dividends and share prices at various exit dates. An indicative rate of return is generated at the current share price, or a targeted share price at entry. Everyone's return expectations will not be the same, and the 1View∞Scenarios Modeling tool allows for this.General Expert: Since I believe that all of the stocks in my portfolio are all meaningfully undervalued, I will continue to evaluate new developments in their industries. The process remains the same: have a high bar for investments and allocate capital to the best ideas.Paulo Santos: The same as always, by looking for high quality businesses at substantially discounted valuations. In our approach, we sum this up as ""cheap with same or better fundamentals down the road"".Chris Lau: Value investing is all that I know to practice. Things changed but things are the same: 2019 will start with better valuations. Keep going for stock picks that are under-valued and whose growth potential in the year is not priced in the stock.J Mintzmyer: I invest to buy a percentage of a company as a part-owner. I focus on cash flows and try to achieve the best balance between accepted risk and potential reward. That's how I choose to allocate capital and I will continue to do so going forward.David Trainer: As featured by Harvard Business School, our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to bring high-integrity value investing to our clients. We believe that as more investors have access to our unconflicted and comprehensive research, more investors are empowered to make more informed decisions. We use our tools and technology to produce all the reports for Value Investing 2.0, and we are proud to offer clients the tools they need to invest smarter and with better risk management. We will practice Value Investing 2.0 because we believe high-integrity fundamental research should be a part of every investment decision. We are not saying fundamentals should be 100% of investment decisions, but we believe they should not be 0%.Grant Gigliotti: Certainly. I will keep doing what I've been doing. When I go grocery shopping, I try to buy quality products when they're on sale. It's the same thing with stocks. This method doesn't get old. It's common sense and will always be profitable. I will continue to find good companies that I understand. Each business must be able to consistently grow over the long term. It must be able to keep the money it's made and make more money on the money that it invests. Value investing is my method for 2019 and it will continue to be my method onward.Ranjit Thomas: A lot of stocks that look cheap (e.g. 10x EPS) can get a lot cheaper (e.g. 7x EPS) as worries about the economy grow. Money flow into or out of stocks have a big impact on valuations.Robert Honeywill: I know and understand fundamentals. But, in a stock market where share prices fluctuate independently of the fundamentals, I acknowledge a role for technical analysis. I have developed a huge respect for Taylor Dart, who embraces both fundamental and technical analysis, and displays a wisdom beyond his years. His is a refreshing approach compared to the zealots arguing either fundamental or technical analysis is the only way.General Expert: One of my core holdings plunged over 30% on earnings, and I think that is the biggest one-day downward movement that I've ever experienced on a core position. This is a good reminder why it's important to size your positions appropriately and leave enough capital to scoop up cheap(er) shares when it makes sense.Value Digger: A series of unpredictable negative events can happen even if it's statistically almost impossible.Paulo Santos: Cheap can always get cheaper. But we knew that already. What I always focus on is on whether fundamentals have taken a turn to the worse or not. If we bought cheap and business fundamentals held well, there isn't much to worry about if the stocks temporarily drop even more. After all, they could never get cheap if they couldn't get cheaper. The big story is thus mostly that in late 2018, the market sold off everything, cheap or expensive. As always, risk management was and is essential.Chris Lau: When things head south, they sell-off more quickly than ever. Valuations don't justify a stock rebound alone. See Micron's 3x-5x P/E. The business cycle drives profit changes which in turn sets the stock's directional trend.J Mintzmyer: Bottom line: cheap can always get cheaper. Not perhaps a new lesson for someone who deals with volatile sectors like shipping, but it's important to stress this especially to other investors who might not really be taking a company ownership perspective on things.David Trainer: Fundamentals still matter. Comprehensive and unconflicted fundamental analysis need not be 100% of every investment decision, but it should not be 0%. Over the last 25 years, it has been difficult to execute a true value investing strategy simply because the market has, too often, not cared about fundamentals. Stocks traded with little relation to the actual performance of their businesses. This trend is ending before our eyes as high flyers, like Amazon, Netflix, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) traded lower and lower. Despite recent positive reported results for these stocks, the market sends them lower as more and more investors have the tools to understand that true cash flows matter again.Grant Gigliotti: While I do enjoy investing in large and consistent companies, I have learned that I need to be more selective about which companies I invest in. Money is not everything. Sometimes I find a great investment, but I struggle with investing in it because the company does something that is against my beliefs. At some point, we all have to decide between money and ethics. Some examples of moments that an investor may question themselves are the following:Ranjit Thomas: I like a long position in LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB). The company is well-run, pays a good dividend, buys back stock, and trades at 7x EPS. I see 40% upside in the stock if they can continue executing and generating the current level of operating earnings.Robert Honeywill: General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares traded above $14 as recently as July. A turn around in Power could see a return to those levels, representing around 100% upside from current share price levels. I believe a large part of the problems, for both conventional and renewables power segments, stems from politicization of the war on CO2. This is a matter of continuing discussion in Analysts' Corner's think tank, ""Saving General Electric"". And yes, it is a play on ""Saving Private Ryan"", and it is a matter of great importance to the US and the rest of the world. A turnaround in Power is not assured, but it is worth keeping a close watching brief, given the potential upside.General Expert: Last year I talked about Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), and the stock has had an extremely volatile year. The story remains very much the same as before. Streaming is being rapidly adopted in the US and around the world. The latter half of 2018 saw increased competition from Amazon as the company aggressively marketed its Fire TV platform, which may have spooked investors. However, we also saw Facebook folding its OTT ad platform and Google Chromecast falling by the wayside. I believe that currently it's currently a two-way race between Roku and Amazon. As I've mentioned in my previous articles on Roku, the bull case for Roku does not depend on it totally taking over the US, much less the world. If Roku can just maintain its current market share of ~37% in ten years in the US alone, I believe that the stock should be worth well over $100 today.Value Digger: One of my best value ideas for 2019 is OurPet's Company (OTCQX:OPCO). OPCO is overlooked due to its OTC listing, but it's a consistently profitable company from the pet industry with high insider ownership. The U.S. pet industry reached $86 billion in 2017 and continues to have a growth trajectory, according to a comprehensive new report by Packaged Facts titled U.S. Pet Market Outlook, 2018-2019. So far in 2018, pet companies have announced more than 30 mergers and acquisitions. The pet industry is a very dynamic segment of the retail sector, so we believe that amid vibrant M&A activity in the pet sector, OPCO could be the next takeover target.Paulo Santos: There are so many. For instance, Gazprom (OTCPK:OGZPY) goes into 2019 extremely cheap, yet it will be concluding several large investment projects during 2019 which will provide added growth from 2020. RusHydro (OTCQX:RSHYY, HYDR.LSE) goes into 2019 extremely cheap, yet the current improvement could lead to a surprise increase in its dividend.Chris Lau: Last year I picked Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), which did peak, only to give up much of its gains. In 2019, I will revisit boring 2018 picks that turned out well. Those include Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) and Dominion Energy (NYSE:D).J Mintzmyer: I really like both of the Golar firms - Golar LNG (NASDAQ:GLNG) and Golar LNG Partners (NASDAQ:GMLP). The first one offers significant growth potential via the exposure to the surging global LNG markets, especially via floating LNG development projects and potential power import facilities. As I'm writing this, $GLNG is in the $23s, but I believe she is worth at least $35/sh. The LP was forced to cut their distribution, but still yields over 14% ($11.25) and has coverage. I expect that GMLP will trade closer to a 10% yield once market sanity returns ($15+).As a 'bonus' for those who wish to speculate a bit more, I recently opened a position in Tellurian (NASDAQ:TELL) in the $6s. They are behind the Driftwood LNG export project, which tentatively could receive a FID in 1H-19. If it does, I believe the stock is worth about $20 by next summer and could trade as high as $60-$80 by the mid-2020s as the project comes online.David Trainer: Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI). This company benefits from an unprecedented surge in freight demand, an economic story that has received relatively little attention due to the focus on the tax cuts, and tariffs headlines that dominated 2018. Understated reported earnings and a recent change to executive compensation plans also make this company a better value than most investors realize. CMI's accounting earnings don't reflect the improving economics of the business. Reported earnings per share are down 21% year over year for the trailing twelve-month (TTM) period. In contrast, after-tax operating profit (NOPAT), which removes accounting distortions, has grown 34% TTM. Best of all, the expectations baked into CMI's stock price remain overly pessimistic. At its current price, CMI has a PEBV of 0.9. This ratio means the market expects CMI's NOPAT to permanently decline by 10%. This expectation seems too low given that CMI has grown NOPAT by 8% compounded annually over the past decade and 10% compounded annually since 1998. Such pessimistic expectations create large upside potential. If CMI can grow NOPAT by just 5% compounded annually over the next decade, the stock is worth $186/share today - a 28% upside from the current price.***Thanks to our guests for sharing their value approach.

4222140,101850,2018-11-14T12:33:26-05:00,"Revenues and earnings beat consensus.4Q18 earnings guidance came up short, causing the shares to tumble.User growth continues apace – larger scale should afford more bargaining power to secure better advertising-supported content.Valuation still reasonably full, meaning risk of further volatility if shares undershoot lofty expectations.","Streaming company Roku (ROKU) reported revenues of $173m, up almost 40% Y-o-Y. It also reported a net loss of 9 cents per share, beating consensus. Meanwhile, player revenues beat estimates, though revenues from the more important platform business fell short. In many ways, Roku is a victim of its own success. Since going public, the company has continuously beaten top and bottom line estimates, and expectations were understandably high going into these results. Consequently, despite the progress demonstrated by Roku, investors anticipated a bigger beat and raise of guidance. They were also disappointed by management forecasts of wider than expected losses in 4Q18. As a result, the shares tumbled following the results and are now down almost 50% from their recent highs. As discussed below, we believe that the current valuation is now fair.There can be little doubt that Roku’s user growth continues to be impressive. Active accounts have more than doubled in the last two years to 24M, with 1.8M added in the third quarter alone. Such growth looks set to continue as the company is well placed to benefit from the secular trend of consumers ditching the traditional TV services offered by cable and satellite companies, in favour of internet video providers such as Roku. As Roku’s audience expands, the company should gain bargaining power, allowing it to secure higher-quality advertising-supported content, which in turn should drive further growth. Indeed, there have already been reports that Roku is looking to bring some content providers into its own app, rather than having users access them separately, which would be a clear sign that it is using its scale to good effect. Importantly, Roku’s platform offering generates higher margins than other parts of the business. Thus, as user growth continues and platform revenues become a higher proportion of the company’s total, Roku’s margin should rise.At the start of October, Roku traded at $77, a level that suggested investors were expecting it to execute perfectly. While it has since fallen significantly to $42, it still trades on 4.6x next year’s sales, which suggests expectations remain reasonably high. Yet there is still limited visibility on how Roku can monetize its user base and ultimately generate earnings. The recent sharp pullback demonstrates the impact of even a minor disappointment, and there are certainly many reasons why the company could disappoint again in the future. These include:Despite Roku’s growth opportunity and its exposure to strong secular trends, we believe that the current valuation is fair, given the significant potential competition that the company faces. More generally, we believe that as global growth slows and bond yields rise, investors are less likely to ascribe high multiples to companies with strong growth potential but limited or negative current earnings. That said, if Roku’s multiple does come under pressure, downside risk is likely to be limited, given the substantial sell-off that has already taken place."
4230077,21815,2018-12-25T01:08:43-05:00,"After an epic rally came an equally epic crash. We think this is overdone in both directions, with the shares now attractively priced.While it's hardly news that the company faces risk from competition, we think its ad platform is already something of a self-propelling force.We also think the risks have already been priced in.","The epic share crash of Roku (ROKU) in just a couple of months is overdone, in our view. While there are risks of a slowdown in the growth of active members, its ad platform is largely self-propelling and will grow for some time to come.With some amazement, we have watched the shares of Roku (ROKU), the ad-based streaming solution company we hold in the SHU portfolio, dive:The shares were one of our best performers only a couple of months ago, but in this market, things can go fast, very fast. Arguably, the shares were quite overvalued at $75, but this is less than three months ago.Have the company's fortunes changed so dramatically as to warrant a sell-off that is approaching 70% in such a short period of time? Here is how management summarized the state of Roku's business on the Q3CC:That doesn't strike us as a major slowdown, which is what the stock price is telling, and indeed, management raised the FY2018 once again. From the Q3CC:Rarely have we seen such a stock price collapse right after management increased guidance. So, if there is any major slowdown, it is further ahead in the future. We have to say that reading the Q3CC again, it seems to come from another universe, and so do the figures. From the Q3 shareholder letter:The company is still in the land grab phase, in which operational results are not really important. But since revenues from the platform keep on growing disproportionally, gross margins are rising:ROKU Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsGross profit was up 58% for the year in Q3 to a record $79 million, with gross margin rising 560 basis points versus last year, although they are likely to fall a bit sequentially in Q4, as it's the season for promoting the Roku players, whose margins might drop to the low to mid-single digits.The additional gross profit is invested back into the company to spur growth, with the operational target to be roughly adjusted EBITDA breakeven. Roku is exceeding even that target, as it expects an adjusted EBITDA positive result for the year between $21 million and $28 million (up from previous guidance of $11-23 million).Roku has a number of advantages:We have discussed most of these in greater detail in earlier articles (here and here), so we will be brief here. The company's operating system (which is in one out of four US TVs sold this year) and players are very easy to use, cheap and get awards (like CNET Editor's Choice).Streaming (or over the top, OTT) is gaining through cord-cutting, and Roku's free, ad-based model is a main beneficiary of this:We think 5G will deliver a big boost to OTT, although that also comes with risks for Roku (see below).Platform has three income streams:Platform revenues were up 74% y/y in Q3 (now 58% of revenue), slightly below expectations because revenues from licenses and content distribution can be a bit lumpy, and this is what caused the small disappointment in the quarter. From the Q3CC:The ad business is experiencing fast growth on an ongoing basis and represents over two-thirds of platform revenue. This isn't surprising considering:But the shift in the $800 billion a year ad market for TV, while ongoing, is slow, as old habits are difficult to shed. Management constantly shows clients how the company's ads have much higher ROI. From the Q3CC:And they are successful, but advertisers and agencies tend to start very small, but quickly expand if they see ROI. From the Q3CC:And here is Smarter Analyst:Roku was also included in the annual upfront planning discussions with brands and agencies for the first time, generating two benefits:So we think the ad platform is still in the flywheel phase and its expansion will continue for quite some time.The Roku Channel is basically the company's own skinny bundle (or, if you like, virtual MVPD), and it is Roku's fastest-growing channel and already in the top five of channels, and is now a meaningful part of its ad growth strategy.The benefit is that it can move beyond Roku's operating system and can be accessed on PCs and Samsung TVs (without Roku's operating system), so adoption of its operating system isn't a limiting factor (as part of the ""Roku Everywhere"" strategy).International expansion is a largely unexplored opportunity (Roku TVs are in the US, Mexico and Canada and that's it), and we think the company could do especially well in developing countries given its free, ad-based model. The Roku Channel especially has hardly moved beyond the US (it has just recently been introduced in Canada).Why the sell-off if everything seems to be fine? Well, the company was always facing a number of risks:The competition from the likes of Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG) and Apple (AAPL) has never been a secret. Amazon is probably the most important one of these, and it signed a deal with Best Buy (BBY) - it is now in its Insignia brand. However (from the Q3CC):One can also wonder whether the Amazon deal with Insignia is actually wise, as this is Best Buy's own brand and not the most advanced TVs (these are rebranded older TVs from third parties).5G is a risk but also an opportunity. It is an opportunity as it dramatically improves the opportunity for OTT to win against the cable companies. However, since it introduces new players (the telcos), it can also pose a bit of a risk.For instance, one of the first movers in 5G, Verizon (VZ), is giving away Apple TV players to take on the cable companies. However, Roku is competitive here as it was in the cable space, where it had a deal with Time Warner (T) for one of its IP-based platforms.Virtual MVPDs (multichannel video programming distributors not owning infrastructure, like Sling, YouTube TV, Hulu Live, also called ""skinny bundles"") can be expected to proliferate, and here is what management had to say about that (from the Q3CC):One might also keep in mind that Roku sticks are cheap and its operating system is highly regarded, that is, the company does have a competitive product.TCL is a Chinese brand of TVs which is important for Roku, as it is one of the biggest licensees of its operating system and the TVs have really taken off in the US. But there are two threats here:Quantifying these risks (from Benzinga):TCL exiting the consumer TV market could be a considerable setback, as it's the world's third-largest TV maker. The jury really is still out on this one (and we would argue that it's more than priced in by now if it is a setback). But Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris argued:TCL is a hugely successful TV brand, and while the company will be concentrating on panels and semiconductors, it is selling stakes in its other businesses (varying from 36% to 75%), not divesting totally.Given the success of the TCL consumer brand (not only in the US but also in places like India), it's difficult to imagine any new owners will want to embark on too much change, while we think any bad news has been priced in by now.ROKU Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe rapid hiring is also increasing stock-based compensation and dilution:ROKU Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsThe company has no debt and $179 million in cash and short-term investment on its books.ROKU EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsAnalysts expect mild losses (11 cents this year and 20 cents next year), but as explained above, management is targeting growth whilst being roughly adjusted EBITDA breakeven.We think the share sell-off has overshot, just as the rally was exaggerated. The company benefits from the shift from OTT, and the ad money shift is lagging that shift, despite generating much higher ROIs in OTT due to the much more precise targeting opportunities.Obviously, there is no guarantee that Roku will ""win"" the OTT market, but it really doesn't have to, as the company has a very capital-light business model and its ad platform is set to continue to grow for some time, even in the case that its active user base growth would slow down."
4221072,103262,2018-11-11T13:21:28-05:00,"Earnings beat revenue, EPS, account growth, and revenue guidance estimates but fell short on EPS guidance, platform revenue, and ARPU.Active Accounts grew to 23.8 million, up 43% year-over-year, versus estimates of 23.1 million.The CEO sees huge upside to account growth and remains bullish.Roku accounted for 40% of steaming viewing hours, while Amazon fast growing still only made up 18%.","Written by Ophir Gottlieb and Tiernan Ray Spotlight Top Pick Roku beat earnings estimates for revenue, EPS, active accounts, gross margins, and raised estimates for revenue and gross margin, but guided down for EPS and missed average revenue per user, slightly. That meant a slight miss in platform revenue. The market's reaction has been violently bad. We spoke with the CEO, and he is as bullish as ever. So are we.Revenue: Total net revenue was up 39% YoY to $173.4 million versus estimates of $170.44 million.Hardware revenue: beat Wall Street estimates at $73.3 million versus $67 million.Platform revenue: $100.1 million (up 74% year-over-year) versus analyst estimates of $103.2 million. That was the miss. It did represent 58% of total revenue vs. 46% a year ago with over two-thirds coming from advertising services.100% video ad sales growth in the quarter: Platform revenue is, correctly, where Wall Street should be focusing. Roku is now a full-blown ecosystem play, not a hardware play.EPS: -$0.09 vs estimates of -$0.12.Active Accounts: 23.8 million, up 43% year-over-year, versus estimates of 23.1 million, with more than half of new accounts coming from licensed sources, primarily Roku TVs. Average revenue per users (ARPU): $17.34 (up 37% year over year) versus analyst estimates of $17.44.User engagement: Engagement increased this quarter with users streaming 6.2 billion hours, up 63% year-over-year.Guidance: Roku raised full-year revenue guidance to a range of $722 million to $732 million, which is above the fiscal year forecast by analysts of $722.84 million.Gross Margin Guidance: The company raised full-year gross profit outlook growth to 63% year-over-year, up from 61% previously and from 43% year-over-year when the company provided its outlook at the beginning of 2018. Those were all facts.Tiernan got on the phone with CEO Anthony Wood for us, and here is that conversation, along with some statements he made during the earnings conference call itself. On the conference call Wood noted the company's continued double-digit growth in subscribers, he remarked, ""There is huge upside there."" And regarding the company's monetization of those users, via fees and ads and sponsorships, he added """"we still have a ways to go there till we tap that out."" Mr. Wood went on to say (our emphasis is added):Wood also boasted of the company's software continuing to be the ""number one licensed TV OS in U.S.,"" shipping one in four smart televisions sold in the U.S. He noted that video ad sales, the single biggest component of Roku's platform revenue, had more than doubled, and that:Roku counts as clients two thirds of Ad Age's top advertisers, he noted. With respect to active accounts Wood was quite pleased, remarking that ""active accounts growth has been in mid-40s for a while now,"" adding with respect to the 23.8 million number, ""I think that's great."" Another important metric, average revenue per user, or ARPU, rose by 37%. That is attributable both to growth in active accounts, and also the ways Roku is able to monetize the accounts. On both scores, Wood emphasized what he sees as substantial upside.The Roku Channel, a free, advertising-supported collection of programming, introduced a year ago. His comments surrounding that were:Asked about the Web-based version of the Roku Channel, which went live a quarter ago, Wood said it is ""going well,"" but that it was ""still too early to tell"" what kind of contribution it is making, or will make, ultimately.Wood commented on the rising activity in linear television advertising initiatives. For example, a venture-backed startup called EDO that analyzes millions of TV spots to try and correlate them with consumer behavior. He seemed unfazed by the competition.The bullish thesis for Roku appears to be stronger, not weaker, after this earnings report. Every advertisement on ROKU to its users is custom for that individual user. Further, according to Nielsen, 10% of 18 to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are only reachable on the Roku platform in the living room. That reminds me of two other companies that did this to create two of the six largest companies in the world: Google and Facebook. And the evidence that this is working, again from the CEO (our emphasis added):So, yes, we can see, from a third-party verification, that the idea of personalized TV ads, which a few years ago seemed like an absurd proposition, are working.We learned in the first week of November that: Over the past 12 months, streaming TV services have seen a 292% increase in plays and a 212% increase in viewing hours, while publisher apps have seen declines of 16% and 19%, respectively, across those fronts. And right when people thought mobile was everything and streaming TV in the living room was in trouble -- no. Connected TVs - such as those connected to Roku players, Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, etc. - now account for as many streaming TV plays (38% on TVs) as mobile devices (39%). They also account for more than twice the viewing hours, with a 56 percent share to mobile's 25% share. Research firm Conviva noted that Roku accounted for 40% of viewing hours, while Amazon fast growing still only made up 18%. Here is a chart of the average weekly time spent with over-the-top TV in the United States (in hours):That's a 30% increase in hours viewed from 2018-2020, alone. Another way to see this thematic is through the pay TV penetration rate in the United States.There are so many ways to show it -- that streaming OTT devices are the future and that traditional pay TV cable is not. Remember, now this is critical, not only are consumers pushing away from cable TV, but advertisers actually prefer the streaming model. When consumers move in a direction that pleases the money (the advertisers), it happens faster. Roku is the undisputed leader, is growing faster than its own forecasts, and has yet to even scrape the tip of the iceberg for this massive thematic shift.We are looking well beyond the next few years with Roku - toward a tectonic shift away from linear TV, where streaming is everything. A world where content is so rich, that Netflix, Amazon, Google, Disney, Apple and many others will compete for eyeballs, while Roku simply gives them access to the eyeballs. It's no certainty that Roku will win, but we try to find companies that are ahead of the curve, that play a vital role in the guts of technological themes, and for now, we see Roku as one of those small companies with the potential to grow substantially. We're not sure Wall Street understands the company, but when we look under the hood, we see a robust hardware, advertising, and platform business. We see a company that happily gives up gross margin on hardware, because the real gold mine is simply getting people to stream video -- because, in the company's view, there is a very good chance they will be streaming with Roku powering the platform.Additional Disclaimer:The information contained on this site is provided for general informational purposes, as a convenience to the readers.

4219850,24849,2018-11-08T11:03:24-05:00,Management raised 2018 guidance yet again.Active accounts more than doubled in two years.Long term valuation continues to be quite reasonable.,"After the bell on Wednesday, streaming media company Roku (ROKU) announced its third quarter results. The company beat on the top and bottom lines and again raised its yearly guidance, yet the stock sold off on the news. As this business continues to grow and repeatedly impress, the pullback makes the name quite attractive again.The company reported revenues of $173.4 million, up nearly 40% over the prior year period and beating estimates by more than $4 million. On the bottom line, a 9 cent per share loss beat by three cents. While player revenues handily beat estimates, platform revenues fell about $3 million short of expectations, and this is the more important part of the business moving forward. This also lead to ARPU (average revenue per user) coming up shy. While Roku has beaten top and bottom line estimates every time it has reported since going public, this was the smallest beat as seen below.(Source: Seeking Alpha Roku Earnings page, seen here)Overall, Roku continues to make progress. The chart below shows how active accounts have soared, up 7.1 million in the past 12 months. At the Q3 2017 report, the year over year gain was 5.4 million. This was the first quarter where platform revenues topped $100 million, and this is the higher margin side of the business. As platform revenues become more of the company's total, overall gross margins rise even though platform margins are down, so the total gross margin jump was 560 basis points year over year.(In millions. Source: Q3 2018 shareholder letter and S-1 filing from 2017)The company's overall loss did increase a bit thanks to higher operating spending to support the growing business, but Adjusted EBITDA swung from a negative in last year's period to a positive in Q3 2018. Roku also finished the quarter with about $180 million in cash and investments against no debt, meaning the balance sheet is quite strong. I do not see a need to raise additional funds unless the company wants to make a big acquisition or some major capital expenditure.One of the things I like the most about Roku is that management continues to raise guidance. As you can see in the table below, every guidance item for the full year 2018 is well above where the original forecast was. Should the company's progress continue in the near term, we could see more than $1 billion in revenues next year, and perhaps a profit too depending on spending.(Source: Roku quarterly reports, seen here)Thursday actually marks one year to the day when I first covered Roku, at which point shares were less than half of where they stand now. I was a big fan of the company's growth, and results have only improved since. Shares that were in the teens skyrocketed to the high $70s, but they've lost a third of their value since then. My last article on the name came with shares in the low $30s, so those who bought on that pullback have done very well.Since everyone likes to look at streaming giant Netflix (NFLX), I mentioned last year how Roku only needed to get 1/10th of Netflix's valuation to get to an $8 billion valuation. After the recent pullback, Roku is worth about $5.5 billion, but 10% of Netflix would be over $14 billion now, despite Netflix shares nearly $100 off their all-time high. With the revenue picture and account base growing quite strongly, I now think a $10 billion valuation for Roku is eventually possible. That probably equals a price in the mid to high $80s if you assume some dilution, mostly from stock based compensation, over the next couple of years.In the end, Roku announced another strong quarter, but the street didn't totally like the results. The top and bottom line headline beats weren't as large as previous quarters, and platform revenues were a little short of estimates. However, the company continues to grow its active accounts base very nicely, and Roku should only be about a year or so away from hitting a billion in annual revenues. As streaming media becomes an even larger part of our lives moving forward, the recent pullback provides another good opportunity for investors to buy.Author’s additional disclosure: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper due diligence on any name directly or indirectly mentioned in this article.

4219309,104412,2018-11-07T11:57:05-05:00,"Roku will be the next tech darling because the product combines the high engagement of traditional television with the audience targeting capabilities of mobile.With 97% completion rates and 100% viewability, OTT ads are the answer big brand budgets have been searching for in response to the attrition to Pay TV subscribers.From an investment standpoint, the implications of attracting more advertising dollars than mobile is enormous. This is a very nascent industry trend with significant upside potential.Charter Communications has a $65B market cap and only 16M users. Comcast is $171B market cap with 22M users. Roku’s market cap is at $6B market cap with 22M users.","Roku’s earnings report for Q3 is scheduled on a potentially volatile trading day depending on how the broader markets react to the mid-term elections. The uncertainty around this outcome, along with rising rates, geopolitical trade uncertainty, and a host of companies tempering their Q4 outlook has caused a style rotation, which has pummeled tech stocks. Regardless, Roku is a mid-cap tech stock that will continually prove itself against headwinds as the company is poised to become one of the most opportunistic growth stories in the market by 2023.The reason for this is simple: connected TV advertising combines the high engagement of traditional television with the audience targeting capabilities of mobile. These two previously competing forces will combine to create the next advertising phenom, and Roku will emerge as the tech darling of this ever-important shift in ad dollars.Pay TV has had better decades. The peak for Pay TV user growth in the United States occurred in 2011 when it began an inevitable erosion due to bloated, costly monthly packages, a lack of flexibility for on-demand, and advertising-stuffed programming choices. The following year, pay TV subscribers fell by 8,000 in 2012, which accelerated to 164,000 subscriber losses in 2014. Three years later, those losses grew 20x to a staggering 3 million subscribers (source: Leichtman). And by 2023, live-linear OTT video subscriptions will surpass traditional broadcast TV.Cord-cutters have driven a formidable marketplace. In fact, the global OTT devices and services market will reach $165 billion in 2025 compared to $29 billion in 2015.Roku offers the most synonymous OTT business model with cable and satellite TV providers and can capitalize long-term on this massive subscriber loss by leveraging its advertising, audience development and content distribution services, which make up 89% of gross margins from the platform. As of Q2 2018, if Roku were a traditional cable TV company, the 22 million active subscriber base would rival Comcast as second largest distributor of content in the United States. Only AT&T has more with 47 million DirecTV subscribers. Compare this to Charter Communications, which has a $65 billion market cap and only 16 million users or Comcast with a $171 billion market cap with the aforementioned 22 million subscribers. Roku’s market cap is at $6 billion with shares priced at $56 with the same number of users as Comcast.While I expect Roku to experience some volatility on its path to becoming a large cap stock, specific industry trends are supporting Roku. Previously on Seeking Alpha, I've covered how Roku is vendor agnostic, the company's global potential, and player vs. platform revenue. Connected TV advertising, however, is the most important piece for Roku's trajectory.Bear with me here as I talk about some of the problems and technicalities in the advertising industry, and why Roku is well positioned.As Digiday puts it, “Two of the big trends in digital media aren’t compatible: The drive to enforce viewability standards and the shift to mobile, particularly apps.”Viewability issues are a serious issue for big brands who are averse to mobile in-app advertising because it’s too challenging to track. In addition, many big brands do not need immediate purchases which is called “purchase intent” – and is mobile’s main value over television.For instance, Coca-Cola doesn’t expect you to buy a soda immediately after seeing an ad. Audi doesn’t expect you to buy a car immediately either. So, a lot of the benefits of mobile aren’t worth the downside of obscured metrics to these big brands. Advertising budgets shifted to mobile because they had to find audiences, not because it’s a superior method to advertise.Here’s how the two compare:Connected TV advertising, which is Roku's specialty, combines the best of both television and mobile. It offers 100% viewability and completion rates with the audience data and dynamic ad insertion found on mobile. Forbes covered this in a recent article which stated Ad Supported OTT is the future reporting OTT ads have a 97% completion rate and 100% viewability.In a recent study by FreeWheel, 200 billion video starts found OTT ads had ballooned from 2% to 32% in a four-year period due to heavier investments from advertisers.In the Q2 2018 Video Advertising benchmark study released by Extreme Reach, a tech platform for video ad campaigns, connected TV impressions overtook mobile, accounting for 38 percent of all video ad impressions down from 33 percent in Q1.Here’s a quote from Extreme Reach:- Mary Vestewig, Senior Director, Video Account Management at Extreme Reach.AppNexus, the world’s leading independent advertising technology company, announced in July of 2018 that advertiser spend in its connected TV marketplace grew 748% year-over-year versus the second quarter of 2017 and 68% quarter-over-quarter. AppNexus currently sees 20 billion monthly connected TV impressions per month.From an investment standpoint, the implications of attracting more big brand advertising dollars than mobile is enormous. Big brand budgets have been looking for a solution to traditional television that isn’t confined to the attention span and limited screen size of mobile viewers. With Roku, that option is finally here.Subscription video-on-demand (SVOD) comprises 40 percent of the OTT market with the majority of the revenue coming from the United States. By 2022, SVOD penetration will be 132% of US TV households with many homes having more than one SVOD platform.Total SVOD is expected to reach 171 million by 2022 – up from 59 million in 2016 reflecting a 53% increase.Previously, viewing data and ratings on SVOD (subscription video on demand) such as Netflix (NFLX), Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime and other OTT content was not disclosed even by Nielsen (NLSN). However, in a recent interview, Nielsen COO Steve Hasker revealed four previously undisclosed statistics about SVOD such as 89.5% of SVOD content is primarily viewed on the television glass whereas 11.5% is viewed on smartphones and tablets.Of this time, 80% is spent on catalog programming whereas 20% is spent on original content. For definition purposes, Netflix is original content and something Roku or Amazon Prime offers is considered catalog programming.Meanwhile, as competition increases, the costs for original programming are escalating with Netflix spending $8 billion in 2018 in order to remain competitive for a small piece of the pie (20% of how time is spent).Roku has held firm on not creating original programming and the statistics support this. The costs for original programming are likely to escalate as HBO, Showtime, Apple, and now Disney developing its own channel for 2019, will continue to compete for this space.In addition, subscribers pay for quite a few premium $8+ subscription channels, which will eventually lead to subscription fatigue, not to mention mitigate the reason cord-cutters leave pay TV services, which is to lower costs.For a subscriber with YouTube TV ($40) and three premium channels ($24-26), they are paying $65+ per month. This pricing will meet resistance by cord cutters and ad-supported OTT will continue to be a solid choice for viewers.Roku is executing on a market trend that will defy typical growth trajectories. Brand budgets are migrating towards Connected TV as a superior method of advertising over mobile. The Roku Channel launched in October 2017 and is already a top 5 channel by active account research. Investors should keep a close eye on platform revenue, which was up 96% YoY to $90.3 million in Q2. The trailing 12-month ARPU in Q2 increased 48% YoY to $16.60 and was ""driven by strong growth in video advertising as we continue to capture more share of TV ad budgets,"" as the company stated in their shareholder letter. Due to connected TV advertising trajectories, I am long on Roku for the next 3-5 years.All analysis contained herein should be appropriately credited to Beth Kindig."
4209226,71685,2018-10-01T17:09:54-04:00,Roku's stock has surged by more than 40% in 2018.The company trades at a nose-bleed valuation.The share grossly overvalued.,"Roku’s (ROKU) stock has surged by over 41% in 2018 on strong revenue helping to narrow the company's losses. But investors may have become too exuberant with the stock and its valuation. The shares may be overvalued by as much as 40%.Roku makes streaming device providing users the ability to connect their TV’s to the internet to gain access to video content apps such as Netflix (NFLX) and YouTube. It also pre-installs software on smart TVs while generating additional revenue through advertising fees on its platform.Roku is forecast to have a loss in 2018 and 2019. Currently, analysts estimates suggest that Roku will loss $0.16 per share and loss about $0.03 per share in 2019. The company is expected to earn a profit of just $0.44 per share in 2020 and that valuation shares trade at 173 times earnings.Roku's revenue is growing steadily in its platform advertising segment with second-quarter revenue up by 96%. But player revenue has basically topped out and has steadily been around $65 million per quarter since the third-quarter of 2017 when it was $67.8 million. The one exception came in the fourth-quarter 2017 which saw player revenue surge to $102.8 million.But surprisingly, fourth-quarter revenue for 2017 actually declined by 7% versus 2016 a warning sign that perhaps player growth has peaked from the period a year ago.If player revenue is peaking that means growth in ads will need to accelerate at an even faster pace to support analysts revenue forecast of $1.29 billion by the year 2020. In fact, based on current estimates revenue is forecast to grow by a compounded annual growth of 36%.Roku Is Not CheapSince Roku does not yet earn a profit, a price to sales multiple is the best way to assess its current valuation. The stock trades at 8 times 2019 sales estimates of $971.6 million. Netflix trades at a slightly higher premium of 8.3 times 2019 sales estimates. But Netflix creates content and generate its revenue through subscription-based service. Roku creates no content, and its platform makes money through advertising or selling its streaming device player. The two stocks are not worthy of trading at the same sales multiple and Roku should trade a much lower valuation.ROKU PS Ratio (Forward 1y)data by YChartsOther advertising platforms such as Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) trade at much lower sales multiple. Facebook (FB) trades at 6.8 times 2019 sales estimates, while Alphabet trades at 5.2 times 2019 sales estimates. At, a valuation more similar to that of these advertising platforms Roku's valuation would be much lower and perhaps represent something closer to 6 times 2019 sales estimates. That would reduce Roku’s valuation to $5.8 billion which is nearly 25% less than its current market cap of $7.7 billion.ROKU PS Ratio (Forward 1y)data by YChartsHardware ModelThe advertising valuation may even be too high considering half of Roku’s revenue stream comes from the hardware component of its media devices. A company like Apple (AAPL) generates most of its sales through the iPhone. Apple which is valued as a hardware company trades at just 3.9 times 2019 sales estimates.AAPL PS Ratio (Forward 1y)data by YChartsConclusionPerhaps a more appropriate valuation for Roku should be somewhere in the middle of Apple’s and the advertising platforms around 5 times 2019 sales estimates. At that valuation, Roku would trade at just $4.9 billion 38% below the current stock valuation.No matter how one goes about slicing and dicing Roku’s business, at its core it generates revenue via hardware sales and advertising. In either case, the stock seems overvalued."

The materials are not a substitute for obtaining professional advice from a qualified person, firm or corporation. ROKU has only had four earnings releases since going public, but in that short-time, a pattern has emerged that has never been broken. We will examine a back-test of getting long a two-week, out of the money (30 delta) call option in Roku Inc 5 trading days before earnings and selling the call before the earnings announcement. Here's the set-up in great clarity; note that the trade closes before earnings, so this trade does not make a bet on the earnings result because ROKU releases earnings after the market closes. Here are the results over the last one-year in Roku Inc: Tap Here to See the Back-testThe mechanics of the TradeMachine® are that it uses end of day prices for every back-test entry and exit (every trigger). ROKU isn't due to have it's next earnings release until early November, but you can set an alert for 5-trading days before the event, below: We see a 169% return, testing this over the last 4 earnings dates in Roku Inc. That's a total of just 24 days (6-days for each earnings date, over 4 earnings dates). While this strategy had an overall return of 169%, the trade details keep us in bounds with expectations: ➡ The average percent return per trade was 68.4%. It's a fair question to ask if these returns are simply a reflection of a bull market rather than a successful strategy. It turns out that this phenomenon of pre-earnings optimism also worked very well during 2007-2008, when the S&P 500 collapsed into the ""Great Recession."" The average return for this strategy, by stock, using the Nasdaq 100 and Dow 30 as the study group, saw a 45.3% return over those 2-years.

4197077,103262,2018-08-09T13:17:37-04:00,"If we measured ROKU as a cable provider, as of right now, it would be virtually tied with Comcast as the second largest in the U.S.By my estimation, ROKU will be larger than Comcast with respect to users before the current quarter comes to an end.The number of accounts for ROKU rose 46% while Comcast and AT&T are essentially flat or shrinking.Every advertisement on ROKU to its users is custom for that individual user, just like Facebook.With 2.8 hours of viewing per day per user, Facebook and YouTube combined have about half the total daily viewership hours per user as ROKU.","Written by Ophir GottliebSpotlight Top Pick Roku (ROKU) beat earnings, turned a surprise profit, beat guidance, and rose sharply after hours.But the company's direction is becoming clear - it wants to be the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) of TV, and it's working.ROKU is building a business based on users and if we measured them as a cable provider, as of right now, they would be the third largest cable provider in the country behind just Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and AT&T (NYSE:T) - that's how many people and how much content they serve, already.And, ROKU's third place of 22 million users is only barely topped by AT&T and its 25.4 million subscribers and Comcast's 22.3 million subscribers.By my estimation, ROKU will be larger than Comcast with respect to users before the current quarter comes to an end.Further, the number of accounts for ROKU rose 46% while Comcast and AT&T are essentially flat or shrinking. All of this is driven by the large secular shift by consumers to streaming video and away from linear TV.Check out this video consumption pattern forecast:And then straight to Streaming Video on Demand (SVOD) revenue forecasts.The penetration rate of streaming video is growing in the United States, but is still below 25%:The various SVOD content providers are in a war - to buy content, to buy users, to keep users, to differentiate. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu are at war with each other, as they are with other over the top (OTT) video services like those coming from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (YouTube) (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Disney (NYSE:DIS), and many others.That battle doesn't interest us - what we are after is the operating system, the guts, that will house all of it. And this is where Roku exists. Each of these over the top content providers is available with Roku hardware or software.The idea behind the business is to grow scale - to grow active accounts, and to become the operating system of streaming TV. Yes, their goal, their future, is to be what Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was to PCs and what Apple is to smartphones - the platform, the operating system, for the booming industry that is SVOD.While ROKU isn't a social network, neither is Facebook - which is to say, Facebook is an advertisement selling machine that happens to be a social network.The value proposition to advertisers from Facebook is clear and has been clear - they know so much about each user that the digital ads presented to people are personalized. Only people that want to buy exactly a Ford truck, and exactly in the next month, are presented exactly an advertisement for that Ford truck on exactly the days that it is relevant in exactly the zip code that is relevant.The personalization goes even further, and I have spoken ad nauseam about it on TV with the incomparable Peter Armstrong. Here is one recent conversation - and if you like contentious subjects, this is a worthy 12-minute view:TV ads, on the other hand, are terribly inaccurate. We've all watched a show, the Super Bowl, whatever, and see ads that have nothing to do with us as consumers. Perhaps it's a truck commercial for people who don't want a truck, or as bad, who just bought a truck and are out of the market for 5 years.But ROKU has changed all of that.With the number of hours of TV getting turned into streaming, and with the digital footprint that ROKU takes up with its 22 million active users (growing at nearly 50% year-over-year), this company has turned TV ads into Facebook ads.But, unlike Facebook, the amount of time people spend with their TVs is measured in hours, not minutes. In fact, the company saw 5.5 billion hours of streaming, up 57%.And, that 57% growth in streaming hours, is ahead of the 46% growth in user growth.All of that means 2.8 streaming hours per active account per day during the quarter. Facebook averages about 50 minutes per day with its users. YouTube averages 40 minutes.Yes - Facebook and YouTube combined have about half the total daily viewership per user as ROKU.Of course, the hours spent on ROKU aren't exactly the same as hours spent on Facebook, or YouTube, but this company is saying out loud, with actual data, it is becoming a behemoth.With every minute that goes by, every selection of a video to watch, every app that gets activated, every YouTube ad we skip (or watch), every Amazon Prime show we purchase, every extra app we add to our front screen - ROKU is watching and learning.While it isn't the same as Facebook's unthinkable depth of data on each user, the bar for ROKU is not Facebook - it's linear TV. In that context, there is nothing close to as rich with respect to user behavior as ROKU has to offer.And, just so the company could tie it up in a neat little bow…While we're covering the entire ecosystem, ROKU also announced with earnings that it's launching a web version (and mobile) of its own free, ad-supported movie channel.This will be available on PCs and mobile to anyone with a ROKU account. That's more data, which means better ads.And, finally, let us not forget that ROKU launched wireless speaker package with voice remote in July.Facebook's great advantage is that there may be no alternative to reaching people other than to use that platform.ROKU said that nearly half of its roughly 22 million active users have cut the cord or have never had a traditional pay TV subscription.That means any kind of marketing that is supposed to come through TV ads simply cannot be reached through linear TV - it must go through ROKU.The CEO went further to say that ""according to Nielsen, 10% of 18 to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are only reachable on the Roku platform in the living room.""And there's more. A television advertisement, as we all have seen, is broad and can be wildly unfocused. For example, perhaps we watch TV and see an ad for a new Ford truck - what percentage of the viewing population has an interest in a truck?The answer is, we don't know. The ad companies use Nielson ratings and demographic data and then the stations try to sell their ads to the right ""type"" of advertiser.Now try this one sentence, which is true, that is, it is a fact, but it's also mind blowing:Every advertisement on ROKU to its users is custom for that individual user.That's right. Not only are tens of millions of people totally unreachable by traditional TV, even the ones that are, if they are on ROKU, they get personalized ads. That reminds me of two other companies that did this to create two of the six largest companies in the world: Google and Facebook.And the evidence that this is working, again from the CEO (our emphasis added):But the narrative gets even stronger. Based on data from 2017 we get this:Even further, ROKU has its own channel - where it controls everything (as opposed to streaming hours on Netflix on ROKU). And then the company released this:* The Roku Channel is now a Top 5 channel by active account reach.Cord cutting is happening, and while the mega mergers were designed to alleviate the pain of cable cancellations by turning the content into standalone apps - there are only so many apps consumers are going to buy - and right now it looks like Netflix, YouTube, and Amazon Prime are about as much as people want.We wouldn't count Disney out, which is, in fact, Disney, ESPN, Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and more, but eventually, after all the unbundling occurs, consumers will likely go back to… a bundle.And then there's ROKU - where every app (YouTube included) is available. Even a standard linear cable subscription is available for streaming. And since the giants are going to want a marketplace, and they will likely not participate in each others', that leaves Roku - the agnostic, fast-growing disruptor.The ad buyers are going to want a simple solution, and they are going to want a place where users are growing, viewership per day is highest, and every content provider will be available.That is called Roku. That is the bullish narrative and that is what ROKU announced with Audience Marketplace in June of this year.* Revenue: $156.8M (up 57% YoY) vs. $141.5M estimates.* Adjusted EPS: $0.00 vs. -$0.15 (loss) estimates.* Revenue Guidance: $164M - $172M vs. estimates of $166M.The CEO noted that ROKU was going to now run as a break even business, forgoing profits for growth, but also forgoing losses for business savvy.Here are some stats, and we put the quarter prior to the one just reported in parenthesis of ease of comparison (the prior quarter, not the prior year).* Active accounts rose 46% (47%) year over year to 22 million (20.8 million) at quarter end.* The company saw 2.8 hours of streaming hours per active account during the quarter.* Streaming Hours: Roku streamed 5.5 (5.1 billion) billion hours of content in the quarter, up 57% (56%) from the prior year.* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) rose 48% (50%) year over year to $16.60 ($15.07).All of this led to platform revenue busting out:* Platform revenue rose 106% year over year to $75.1 million.Since platform and advertising revenue are much higher margin businesses than selling hardware, we then saw this:* Gross profit rose 107% (625) year over year to $77.8 million (63.1 million). We note it was actually up 83% excluding an $8.9M benefit to Player COGS from releasing accruals related to potential IP licensing liabilities that have not materialized.* Platform gross profit increased 96% (106%) year over year to $90.3 million (75.1 million).We re-iterate our Spotlight Top Pick status on ROKU. It will be interesting to watch a small company trying to become the powerhouse. There are massive risks. But in general, we like this bullish narrative, and we really like what ROKU is trying to do.Thanks for reading, friends."

That growth is likely to continue with the proliferation of streaming services (including new services from Disney and AT&T) and continued cord-cutting trends.The OTT market used to be a market made up of set-top boxes such as the Apple TV (AAPL) and Roku's player products. Increasingly, the market is moving away from those boxes and moving towards integrating streaming television software into smart televisions. Hardware players continue to be made and sold, but Roku's value stems primarily from their software rather than their hardware. Roku and Google (GOOG; GOOGL) are the two largest competitors in the smart TV streaming software market. Amazon (AMZN) is also in the market but is a smaller player (at least for now).Roku's value to investors is based on their growth and margins in their software (their ""platform"" segment) rather than in their hardware (their ""player"" segment). Roku makes money through their software through advertisements (such as in the Roku Channel through Direct Publishers) and when people sign up for subscription services using their Roku device.Roku's platform revenue is booming right now, with platform revenue showing triple-digit growth in the last quarter. This growth is thanks to a 46% y/y increase in active accounts and 42% y/y growth in revenue per active account. And this revenue is high-margin: Roku's gross margins in the platform category were between 71% and 77% in the last four quarter.In short, Roku is a small-but-strong competitor in a market that has substantial tailwinds. Because of this, Roku's most important segment more-than-doubled in size last year and will see continued growth moving forward. Roku will be aided by the continued momentum of its segment, may be the target of a takeover, and its primary risks relate to the size and strength of their competitors like Google.Source: Statista.Streaming TV content over the internet is booming, with consumption more than doubling in the past year. The boom in streaming TV is fueled by advancing technology (enabling high-quality video streaming), cord-cutters (increasing demand for content), and the launch of new streaming services (increasing demand for compatible services/devices).Years of advances in video streaming technologies and the proliferation of fast broadband connections has enabled videos to be streamed over the internet at video qualities that rival or beat those offered by satellite, cable, or broadcast television.Meanwhile, the cord-cutting trend has picked up stream. According to the Video Advertising Bureau, the number of cord-cutters has tripled in the last five year. There are now 14.1 million households who only receive content via over-the-top streaming services, or 11% of TV-watching households. These absolute numbers are still small, but they are growing. According to one study, cord-cutters save an average of $85/month by dropping cable TV, even after the amount spent on internet service and streaming video providers. These cord-cutters each represent potential customers for Roku and their competitors.The launch of new online streaming services will also be a major catalyst for Roku and its peers moving forward. These new services will attract new subscribers who will seek a way to watch that content, including using an OTT streaming media player or purchasing a compatible smart TV.The most notable streaming service launch this year has been the launch of ESPN+ by Disney (DIS) in April 2018. The service is offered for $4.99/month, and Disney is aggressively marketing the service and acquiring new content. Disney streamed the most recent Manny Pacquiao fight live on ESPN+ last month and signed a $750 million deal with the UFC to offer live UFC events on the ESPN+ platform beginning in January 2019. Disney is throwing their weight behind this offering, which will also stream live games from MLB, the NHL, MLS, and college sports. AT&T (T), via Time Warner's Turner Sports, has also launched a competing live sports streaming service, with the spring launch of B/R Live in March 2018.Disney is also planning a high-profile launch of its own direct competitor to Netflix in 2019. That service will include content from Disney's varied properties including Disney, Marvel, and Star Wars. Disney is also paying a staggering $71B to purchase Fox's (FOX; FOXA) entertainment assets, driven in part by Disney's desire to add more content to their forthcoming streaming service. Disney's streaming service is likely to attract tens of millions of subscribers (potentially into 9 digits over time, if well-executed).Each new subscriber to ESPN+, B/R Live, Disney's streaming service, or other services is a potential customer for Roku and its peers. To watch this content on their TVs, users will need either a smart TV or a compatible device such as a streaming media player or a gaming console.Source: Digiday.As a direct result of this boom, OTT revenues (such as streaming revenues) are expected to double between 2016 and 2022, from $37B up to $83.4B.In short, Roku operates in a rapidly-expanding market. That expansion is likely to help every firm in that market, including Roku.Roku's Netflix Player, circa 2008 (a ""little treasure chest"" according to Wired)Roku has a market cap of ~$4.7B. Despite that modest size, Roku's life story is more connected to the ""FAANG"" stocks than any peers its own size. Roku was originally born of a FAANG, having been spun out of Netflix (NFLX) when Netflix decided not to launch their ""Netflix Player"" as the last minute in December 2007:Today, Roku competes with three of the largest companies in the world: Apple, Google, and Amazon. This competition originated in the hardware box market: The Apple TV was the first product on the market, with the first version launched in January 2007. Google entered the market with the Google Chromecast in 2013, while Amazon launched the Fire TV in April 2014.Each of these products offers the ability to stream TV content from the internet to your television. This allows users to watch content from Netflix, Amazon Prime, MLB.tv, or others on their television, even if that television is not a ""Smart TV.""ROKU Market Cap data by YChartsThis is a minnow fighting giants - each of Amazon, Google, and Apple have market caps more than 180x as high as Roku. Despite fighting three massive companies for over four years (and for Roku's entire history, in the case of Apple), Roku continues to more than hold their own:Source: Cord Cutters News, May 2018.Roku remains the streaming media player with the largest market share, even after years of fighting against giants.The battle for streaming media player share continues, and Roku continues to hold their own. In my view, however, a more important battle is the battle for smart TV market share. Smart TVs include streaming software on them, meaning that their owners are unlikely to ever purchase a streaming media player from Roku or from others. Instead, they will use the software built into their TV to stream content from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and others.In the past, smart TV software would often be proprietary. Today, however, more and more smart TVs are moving to platforms developed by the streaming media player companies, primarily Google and Roku.Using software from Google or Roku relieves the TV manufacturer from having to write their own software and provides users with the security of knowing that their smart TV platform will continue to be well-supported into the future. For example, as new streaming services launch from Disney (DIS) or AT&T (T), older proprietary smart TVs may not be able to use those services due to a lack of app (or even the ability to add apps). Smart TVs running the Google or Roku software will be able to support those services with the installation of an app.Thus, smart TVs running Roku or Google software are better for the user than older smart TVs running proprietary software. Were I shopping for a television today, I would strongly prefer a TV powered by Roku or Google over one that ran proprietary software, due to both broader current support for streaming services (huge app stores) and guarantees of support for future streaming services that don't even exist yet.Today, the Roku platform can be found on televisions from companies including Insignia, Sanyo, RCA, Sharp, and Hisense. Roku's competitors have also been active: Google's Android TV is offered on televisions from brands including Sharp, Philips, and Sony, while Amazon has partnered with Best Buy (BBY) to sell Fire TV-enabled televisions from Insignia and Toshiba.Despite competition from Google and Amazon, Roku is doing well in the smart TV operating system market:The primary competitor in this arena will continue to be Google going forward. During the Q1/18 CC, one analyst even posited that Amazon's partnership with Best Buy was a win for Roku:As of this writing, Apple does not offer their Apple TV software in a smart TV. That may change in the future, although Apple's normal mode of operation would suggest that their software would only be put onto a television made by Apple: Neither iOS nor MacOS are offered to other manufacturers for use on their smartphones and computers.Roku has shown a lot of strength in the US smart TV marketplace, as Wood describes. IHS Markit, in July 2018, expects Roku TV to gain share globally:Similarly, according to Conviva, ""Among connected TV platforms, Roku continues to emerge as a leader with 22% of all viewing hours and 8% of all plays."" Conviva further notes that, ""PC use for streaming TV is declining in favor of mobile devices, especially for short-form content, while connected TV platforms, led by Roku, are favored for long-form content."" Consumer preference for mobile for short-form content explains why Roku's proportion of viewing hours is so much higher than their proportion of plays.Roku is competing with giants, but they are more than holding their own.Roku divides their business into two segments, player and platform.Player revenue includes revenue from selling Roku devices, while platform revenue includes advertising and subscription revenue generated on the Roku OS on Roku devices and Roku TVs.Source: Author based on company filings.Over the past three years, player revenue has been relatively stable, growing from $270M in 2015 to $285M in the past four quarters - a growth rate of 2.5%. If Roku was a player company only, this would be a low-growth, stable company with little reason to trade at high multiples.However, Roku is not only a player company.Over the past three years, platform revenue has exploded. In 2015, platform revenue was $50M or ~16% of company revenue. Over the past four quarters, platform revenue is $264M or ~48% of company revenue. Trailing annual platform revenue is 430% higher than it was in 2015, growing at an average of 110%/year. Similarly, trailing annual growth (L4Q over the 4Q before that) is ~117% and the most recent quarter saw growth of ~106% over the same quarter last year (Q1/18 over Q1/17).Roku's platform revenue can be broken down into two components, both of which have grown rapidly in the past three years. Platform revenue can be calculated based on the number of active users multiplied by the average revenue per user (""ARPU""). Both the user base and the ARPU have been growing rapidly.Source: Author based on company filings.Growth in both users (active accounts) and ARPU has been both consistent and phenomenal. In each of the past four years, Roku has grown their active accounts by 42% to 55%. Similarly, in each of the past four years, Roku has increased their ARPU by 33% to 50%.The growth in both of these metrics has fueled Roku's triple-digit platform revenue growth. It is inevitable that this growth will eventually come back to Earth, but as of yet, growth in both ARPU and active accounts remains as strong as ever.This growth is especially valuable to Roku because of the high margins offered by their platform segment:Source: Author based on company filings.Roku's fast-growing platform revenue also boasts Roku's best margins.Player gross margins over the past couple years have been between 6% and 17%. These low margins make sense, given that players are a ""loss leader"" to add more users to the Roku platform ecosystem. When customers are selecting an OTT device, few people would be willing to pay a premium to purchase a Roku device over a comparable device from Apple, Amazon, or Google. Accordingly, Roku players are priced-to-move, often with single-digit gross margins. Given operating costs, these devices are never intended to help Roku achieve profitability directly, but rather just to grow the platform.Platform gross, meanwhile, has been between 69% and 73% since the start of 2016. Over the last twelve months, gross margins on Roku's platform segment has averaged ~74%.Roku's platform revenue is growing by triple digits each year and offering gross margins of ~74%. That is the reason why Roku trades at the lofty multiples it does (with a price/sales of ~8.5x - nearly as high as Netflix at ~10.8x). Roku players are nearly irrelevant to Roku's value: Players serve only to grow Roku's platform further, enabling the company to grow its user base and therefore to expand its high-margin platform revenue.Source: Author based on company filings.Roku has not yet attained profitability, although their losses are narrowing thanks to the high-margin growth in platform revenue.In Q1/18, Roku posted operating losses of $6.9M on revenue of $136.6M with net losses of $6.6M. Operating losses and net losses were both down y/y, from $7.8M and $8.7M.Roku prefers to report their results using adjusted EBITDA, which excludes share-based compensation. Adjusted EBITDA loss in Q1/18 was $0.8M, down from a $4.4M loss one year ago. Over the past twelve months, Roku posted an operating loss of $18.6M and but a positive adjusted EBITDA of $0.3M. As illustrated above, this was Roku's first positive trailing adjusted EBITDA on record and continued a seven-quarter positive trend in trailing adjusted EBITDA.Roku expects to post a net loss of $25M-$40M in 2018 and post an adjusted EBITDA between ($10M) and +$5M.Roku will report their Q2/18 earnings on August 8, 2018. Roku's guidance for these earnings, and for the year are:Source: Roku Q1/18 Letter, May 9, 2018.Roku only has three quarters of shareholder letters since going public, so they only have two prior quarters to compare their outlook to their actual results. In both available quarters, Roku beat the midpoint of their guidance on all four metrics:Source: Author based on company filings. All guidance at midpoint.From this past, it may be reasonable to expect Roku to beat the midpoint of their guidance. According to Yahoo Finance, analysts expect Roku to posts an EPS loss of $0.15/share (a loss of ~$7.3M) on revenue of $141.48M, beating the midpoint of guidance on both of those metrics.In my view, the most important metrics for Roku going forward are going to be their active accounts and their ARPU. My rationale here is straight-forward. Player revenues are largely irrelevant for Roku, since those revenues are so low-margin. Further, operating expenses have been a relatively consistent percent of Roku's revenues for the past several years: Source: Author based on company filings.While operating costs have trended up somewhat, this trend is relatively minor and is more than compensated for by the gains in gross margins due to increasing platform revenue. Thus, in my view, the two biggest drivers of Roku's value are going to be the factors that drive platform revenue: active accounts and ARPU.During the Q1/18 CC, Roku's Steve Louden, CFO, gave a lot of further guidance on Roku's outlook for the quarter and for the year. Based on his statements about future margins and revenue growth, I currently model the following active account and ARPU figures:Source: Company filings (Q1/18) and author's estimates (Q2/18 to Q4/18).These estimates would result in Roku performance for the year that is approximately in line with Roku's guidance in my model - annual revenue of $695M with gross profit of $305M - at the midpoint and high end of guidance, respectively. Based on Roku's history of beating guidance, I would not be surprised to see Roku beat these figures.In my view, having 22.5 million active accounts and having ARPU of ~$15.80 should be seen as ""par"" for Roku on their August 8th earnings. If Roku can substantially beat these figures, I expect Roku shares to rise, and if Roku fails to meet these figures, I expect Roku shares to fall.We will find out on Wednesday.Roku operates in a segment - streaming TV content - that is growing rapidly and looks poised to continue to grow rapidly. Companies like Netflix, Amazon, Disney, and AT&T are pouring money into online streaming content. This gives Roku strong secular tailwinds that are likely to continue for years to come.Roku is competing against much larger competitors. The ~$5B Roku actively competes with three different >$850B companies in Apple, Amazon, and Google. Despite over four years of competition with these giants, Roku has maintained the highest market share in the streaming media player segment.Streaming media players themselves look likely to decline as smart TV proliferation continues. Roku and Google are the two primary players licensing smart TV OS software to TV manufacturers, although Amazon also offers their Fire TV software through Toshiba and Insignia. Roku has a solid foothold in this market, with their ~20% unit share in the U.S. increasing to ~25%.These factors will help Roku to continue to grow their revenue in their important platform segment. Roku's player revenue is stable and low-margin, but platform revenue is high-margin (~74% gross margins TTM) and high-growth. Over the past few years, Roku's platform revenue has experienced triple-digit annual growth, driven by increases in both active accounts (~46% TTM) and increases in average revenue per user (~50% TTM).Roku will report Q2/18 results on Wednesday, August 8. Based on Roku's guidance, analysts expect revenue of $141.5M and a loss of $0.15/share (~$7.3M). I will be more interested in Roku's active account figures and ARPU. I would like to see Roku report at least 22.5 million active accounts and an ARPU of at least $15.80.Roku has beaten guidance (at midpoint) in each of the last two quarters.Let's see if they can make it three.Did you like this article?

Roku's ad-supported business model fights highly fragmented subscription fatigue.Global is where Roku will become a large-cap phenom in the future. The low cost platform combined with over 5,000 channels today serves global markets like no competitor can.","Roku's (ROKU) stock is getting a lot of attention after it reported stellar second-quarter results due to 57% year-over-year revenue growth to $156.8 million beating the analyst forecast of $141 million. Compare this to 37% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. However, as I stated in my Q1 article, the platform revenue is where Roku will continue to see a majority of the gains. The video streaming platform revenue was up 96% during the period to $90.3 million with player revenue up 24% to $66.5 million.Some of the analysis below is taken from an article I wrote last quarter on Seeking Alpha. The information has not changed, but the stock price is beginning to adjust to Roku's product-market fit. I do expect some correction from today's stock pop, but these fundamentals are why I've been long on Roku from the beginning (and beating out Amazon Fire Stick isn't one of them). I do expect Roku to experience some volatility on its path to becoming a large cap stock, however, specific industry trends are supporting Roku, and ultimately, these trends will win out.Roku offers the most synonymous business model with cable and satellite TV providers and can capitalize long-term on this massive subscriber loss by leveraging its advertising, audience development, and content distribution services, which make up 89% of gross margins from the platform. In fact, if Roku was a traditional cable company, this quarter's 22 million active subscriber base would rival Comcast (CMCSA) for the place of second largest distributor of content in the United States. Only AT&T (NYSE:T) has more with 47 million DirecTV subscribers.The peak for pay TV in the United States occurred in 2010/2011 when it began a predictable erosion. The number of pay TV subscribers fell by 8,000 in 2012 and accelerated to 164,000 subscriber losses in 2014. Last year, the erosion neared deterioration with the top 10 pay TV operators losing a staggering 3 million linear subscribers in 2017 according to Leichtman Research.Roku critics cite too much competition for this mid-cap stock to carry the growth needed for long-term gains, especially from Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) who all have a play in the hardware market for OTT video streaming services. However, this weakness is actually Roku's strength. The Roku operating system, Roku OS 8, is a robust, reliable option for OTT streaming and has attracted partnerships with 1 in 5 smart TVs in the United States.Meanwhile, operating systems like Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) Tizen continue to be plagued with bugs. But by being vendor-agnostic, Roku has still been able to secure a partnership for their free ad-supported channel with competing OSs like Samsung/Tizen. In addition, by remaining agnostic, Roku has maintained a full menu of original programming while corporate spats between Google (YouTube) and Amazon Prime restrict content choices.Roku has also built a formidable catalog of 5,000 channels that even Google has not even come close to rival. This is where the discussion as to Roku being a hardware company should curtail as the ""player"" revenue has been eclipsed by the platform revenue (platform revenue stood at 45% in Q4 2017 compared to 57% in Q2 2018). It's the latter where the company is making its largest investments including OTT advertising measurement tools, launching the free Roku channel, growing licensing fees, and partnering for live TV. The launch of live news in mid-May and the World Cup in June also contributed to platform performance in Q2.Previously, viewing data and ratings on SVOD (subscription video on demand) such as Netflix (NFLX), Hulu Plus, and Amazon Prime and other OTT content was not disclosed even by Nielsen (NLSN). However, in a recent interview, Nielsen COO Steve Hasker revealed four previously undisclosed statistics about SVOD such as 89.5% of SVOD content is primarily viewed on the television glass whereas 11.5% is viewed on smartphones and tablets.Of this time, 80% is spent on catalog programming whereas 20% is spent on original content. Meanwhile, as competition increases, the costs for original programming are escalating with Netflix spending $8 billion in 2018 in order to remain competitive for a small piece of the pie (20% of how time is spent). Meanwhile, Roku has held firm on not creating original programming and the statistics support this. The costs for original programming are likely to escalate as HBO, Showtime, and now Apple will continue to compete for this space.In addition, subscribers pay for quite a few premium $8+ subscription channels, which will eventually lead to subscription fatigue - not to mention mitigate the reason cord-cutters leave pay TV services - which is to lower costs. For a subscriber with YouTube TV ($40) and three premium channels ($24-26), they are paying $65+ per month. This pricing will meet resistance by cord cutters and ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) will be the answer.Most importantly, original programming will consolidate or bundle (like it has on cable) and Roku is the perfect middleman to do this.This point ties into the previous two points where agnosticism in hardware and operating system along with building out a free, ad-supported channel will help Roku crush global expansion - especially in the emerging markets. The low price point for both the hardware and free content is desirable for global adoption, plus the 5,000 channels that Roku offers caters to differences in cultural viewing preferences. Most recently, Roku has announced offering the Roku Channel on the web in the United States which will serve people who do not have a set top box or television. Don't be surprised if their next move is to take this web channel global. For instance, while India has roughly 180 million television sets, the country has nearly 300 million smartphones which a global Roku Channel could potentially reach.Bottom line is that Roku has shown competitive vigor by maintaining the lead as the top streaming media player in the United States claiming 37% of devices with nearly 40 million U.S. customers use Roku once per month. It's only a matter of time until they take this success to the billions of people overseas who can't afford pay TV or want to reduce pay TV costs.In reference to the first point, there is an opportunity to capitalize due to massive pay TV subscriber losses such as last month when Charter (CHTR) lost 12% of market cap after reporting 112,000 subscriber losses and Comcast reported a loss of 98,000 in video users compared to a gain of 41,000 one year ago in Q1 2017.This bloodbath from attrition will continue to accelerate through 2025 when even TV networks are expected to experience a 41% revenue loss. Roku is a very desirable purely OTT mid-cap choice with 22 million users and a $5.75 billion market cap that narrows in on this staggering market trend. Compare this to Charter Communications, which has a $69 billion market cap and only 16 million users.In the next 2-5 years, Roku will outpace competitors globally as it continues to be the cheapest, agnostic option with the most channels. Its executive team is experienced in OTT media and advertising, and the platform revenue will redefine how investors see this razor/razor blade opportunity (device player that locks in licensing fees and advertising). The free channel especially is attractive setting it apart from the overabundance of paid, subscription channels. In addition, live TV will be an attractive space for Roku with the company already recently partnered with ABC News, People TV, and Cheddar."
4188057,103389,2018-07-18T12:40:34-04:00,"Strong growth continues within active accounts, streaming hours and Average Revenue Per User or ARPU.The shift from hardware revenue to platform revenue continues to accelerate as Roku earns more from advertising on the platform and their Roku channel.Well-funded competition from the likes of Apple and Amazon do not provide the same breadth of content Roku does.","In what has quickly become a commoditized product category, Roku (ROKU) has established itself as a clear winner within the battle for Smart Television operating systems. As the cost of Smart TVs continue to come down, cord cutting accelerates and Roku shifts into advertising and channel distribution, I believe Roku is positioned for several years of continued growth.As you can see from the chart below, Roku continues to grow active accounts greater than 40% to over 20 million, streaming hours greater than 50%, and Average Revenue Per User or ARPU grew greater than 50% in the latest quarterly results year over year.This growth will likely continue as Roku continues to own the operating systems of the top 10 best selling Smart TVs on key selling channels such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and Bestbuy.com (BBY). In Q1 2018, roughly 1 in 4 TVs sold were Roku powered. On key selling Amazon Prime Day, Roku powered 5 of the top 10 selling TVs on Amazon.Roku's management realizes that to build a moat, the company must own the operating platform on TVs as opposed relying only on hardware sales like Roku sticks. As that shift takes place, Roku stands to earn a better profit margin. In Q1 2018, the platform accounted for 45% of revenue compared to 36% in Q1 2017 and 25% in Q1 2016. Platform gross margin ranged from 71-77% in recent quarters versus a hardware gross margin of 6-17%.Additionally, Roku is focused on extending their ad supported Roku channel onto other Smart TVs. The first deal came in March 2018 for Samsung Smart TVs. As these audiences grow well above 20 million customers, advertisers will seek more reliable and targeted audiences outside of traditional linear television. Roku's platform provides that confidence to advertisers with audience guarantees as traditional and paid TV subscribers decline.To put it bluntly, the competition is strong and well capitalized ranging from tech stalwarts like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to legacy OEMs such as Sony (NYSE:SNE) running their own software. The two largest competitors with the most viable solution in terms of price and selection are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.Apple will likely release an update to Apple TV this coming Fall, driving their captive ecosystem of customers to upgrade or join. With that said, Apple's walled garden excludes key streaming offerings like that of Amazon Prime.Amazon is also a major competitor with a captive customer set and ability to market their offerings to a highly attractive Prime audience. Amazon has similar offerings like the low entry point Prime Stick but also truly limits their selection when compared to the broad offering Roku has.Roku is focused on cementing their platform through low entry Roku sticks, partnerships with OEMs like TCL, and extension of their ad supported channel within OEM Smart TVs they don't operate the OS of. These three components are all growing greater than 40-50%, establishing Roku as the platform of Smart TVs."
4198155,21815,2018-08-12T04:37:26-04:00,"The company had another fantastic quarter driven in equal measure by platform active user growth and ARPU growth.The tailwinds of shifting towards OTT will be blowing for years to come.We think the shares will continue to rocket as long as the competition doesn't make any serious inroads into their platform growth, especially their gains on smart TVs.The Roku Channel constitutes a platform in itself, brings multiple advantages and could function a little like a hedge should competition eat into their TV platform lead in the future.","On June 1 this year, we bought 100 shares of Roku (ROKU) for the SHU portfolio at $37.77. We also explained why in an article. Needless to say, this has gone rather well in a very short time.Here is a little update on the SHU portfolio to start off with (Friday, August 10 after market close in chronological order of buying starting on September 29, 2017):Do we need to revise our original Roku investment thesis? No, not really, apart from the fact that things are going even better than we expected. Here are a number of takeaways from the quarter.There are three main avenues to achieve platform user growth:The quarter experienced a surprising resurgence in the players with a 24% rise in Q2 revenue (y/y), but this isn't the future, which is that all TVs become smart TVs with an operating system.The company licenses it as an operating system for TVs, for instance to TCL. One in four TVs sold in the US had Roku inside, driving the smart part of the TV. Here is what management said (Q2CC):If Roku indeed becomes the dominant operating system for TVs (something we pondered about in our previous article comparing it to OpenTV, a previous generation's effort to do something similar), we have a very long growth path in front of us. Management is very optimistic (Q2CC):Management argues that their biggest competitor is actually OEM's own operating systems, which bodes pretty well for the foreseeable future.So the start is very promising, but this is far from a decided course. There are formidable competitors like Amazon (AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (Android TV); we're not mentioning Apple (AAPL) as the latter isn't likely to license its software.The problem is that switching costs are low, so the early Roku lead isn't as significant as in other technology races, so it isn't time to get comfortable, but neither time to panic. Their lead is real.Meanwhile, the platform keeps on growing:These are the two main metrics and together these produce a platform revenue growth of 96% y/y. This points to a rather bright future if the company can maintain this growth.We would normally argue that the law of large numbers will slow this down, but the numbers aren't actually all that large still and the company is very early in its monetization efforts, so hype growth could actually continue for some time as monetization of OTT through ads is a fairly greenfield endeavor still.What surprised us is not only the apparent growth but also the creative way in which management is moving it forward. Growth looks to be impressive:Why is TRC (the Roku Channel) such a good idea? Basically, it allows the company to broaden its footprint. This directly widens its audience for ads, directly improving monetization.But there is an indirect benefit in the form that TRC becomes more attractive for content owners to be part off. And this could create something of a virtuous cycle; better/more content - bigger audience - more monetization - better/more content. Here is management providing an example of this (Q2CC):And management is rapidly broadening the TRC base:The latter might look like a mundane step, but we think it's very significant as it has the potential to significantly broaden Roku's reach. The only thing viewers have to do is to sign up to the Roku platform, and you're good to go to watch a whole host of free content. That's a pretty low threshold.Putting TRC in the browser potentially also produces a much richer user information gathering process which can be used to much better target advertisers, increasing the value proposition to advertisers (and potentially reducing the irritation factor of ads to viewers).And while the company does license some content for money, this is small fry as there are plenty of opportunities, which will only increase with their size (Q2CC):And of course, another advantage of TRC is that they have total control over the ads (Q2CC):Better targeting is one of the goals of management (Q2CC):So they came up with the Roku Audience Marketplace, here is how that works, from Mediapost:This is a programmatic audience market place (a marketplace where software buys digital ads, a keen reader might have spotted The Trade Desk in our SHU portfolio at the start of the article) and data driven programmatic ads is a logical step forward to accommodate partners targeting audiences more precise and in a more automatic way. From the Q2 shareholder letter:But they still do it the traditional way as well, as that's what the TV business is used to.The Q2 figures were stellar and above expectation with a surprising resurgence in growth of the player boosting its gross margin to an unprecedented 22%, but that's not likely to last.Indeed, player revenue is guided flat in Q3 and the Q2 player margins were boosted by a one-time factor (the release of $8.9M of accruals related to potential IP licensing liabilities that have not materialized).From the Q2 shareholder letter:The company also generated very strong content distribution revenue growth in Q2. Although this isn't specified in the accounts, they argued during the CC that advertisement is two-thirds of platform revenues so this would likely be most of the rest. That's helpful, because content distribution generates very high margins.OpEx grew slower (+53%) than revenues (+57%) providing a modicum of operational leverage, but management argues that it will continue to invest in growth (R&D, S&M) and keep the company roughly break-even.From the Q2 shareholder letter:The full-year 2018 outlook has been improved for a second time (Q2CC):Revenue growth in Q3 is a bit slower due to tough comp in platform growth (Q3 2017 was +137%) and flat player growth.ROKU Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsCash flow is negative, but not at a worrying level, dilution is running a little hot though:ROKU Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsThe company had $174M in cash and no debt at the end of Q2.As we argued in our previous article, the low switching cost for users, low first-mover advantages, combined with the size of its competitors remains a considerable risk. But so far, so good, as it doesn't seem to dampen Roku's growth, so this is a latent risk that hasn't yet materialized.And we think that TRC constitutes a bit of a risk hedging instrument as well should the likes of Amazon and/or Google cut into its platform growth. The more the company has time to build out TRC, the easier shareholders can breathe.ROKU EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsWhile the shares are certainly not cheap, we're not all that worried about valuation, given the company's growth rate and the fact that it doesn't make large losses or bleed large amounts of cash.TV viewing is shifting slowly to OTT (streaming) and advertisers are following viewers. This is a land grab phase where different business models compete. Roku was leading the player market and it is now leading the TV license market; if it can build that out then the shares will have many years of growth to come.That isn't a given, as switching costs are low, there are few first mover advantages and the company is up against the likes of Google and Amazon for the licensing market. But so far things are going very well for the company.They're also building TRC as a separate platform, and that is also going very well and here the company does potentially benefit from increasing returns, as larger audiences attract more advertisers and more content, increasing audiences.For investors, we think this is a fairly simple proposition. As long as there are no signs that competitors are seriously denting its lead in the licensing market, we think the growth will continue (albeit perhaps not quite at the current pace).So until the competition mounts a serious fight-back, we think investors can still buy the shares, even if they have gotten a little expensive, perhaps."

Netflix does not dictate the industry.Roku earns almost nothing from Netflix, so there will be no financial impact in the immediate future.There isn't a strong relationship between Netflix subscriber growth and Roku's active accounts growth.","No matter how you think Netflix (NFLX) will fare in the future, the fact is that it missed its own subscriber growth estimates by a mile in Q2. U.S. net adds came in almost 50% lower than the 1.2 million forecast, making up a significant portion of the total subscriber shortfall of 1.2 million.Except for international licensees, most of Roku's (ROKU) active accounts are based in the U.S., so Netflix's slowdown in subscriber growth could be seen as a bad sign for Roku.I'm not particularly concerned, however. I believe that Netflix's slowdown will not significantly impact Roku's future.The value of Roku depends on 1) active accounts growth and 2) monetization of those active accounts. Roku earns virtually nothing from Netflix, so whether Netflix slows down or speeds up isn't going to impact monetization efforts in the immediate future.Having a robust streaming ecosystem is important to Roku, and Netflix is a big part of that ecosystem. However, everyday Netflix's influence wanes. More and more content is becoming ""streamable,"" not through Netflix, but through Roku and its competitors. Disney (DIS) is the most obvious example as the company plans its big direct-to-consumer launch. Even if Netflix's sluggish subscriber growth is permanent, it wouldn't be a big hit to the streaming ecosystem as many other content producers are just getting started.The following illustration shows you just a handful of the thousands of content offerings that consumers can find through streaming devices such as Roku.Source: tech-vise.comStreaming is here to stay, and its future isn't dependent on whether Netflix can produce better content to attract more subscribers. If it does, that's great, but if it doesn't, someone else will.If you are monitoring Roku's stock every day, you may be worried that the low Netflix subscriber growth doesn't bode well for Roku's active account acquisition efforts. Let's see if that's a valid concern.The following chart compares Roku's growth in active accounts against Netflix's U.S. net adds excluding Q2.Source: data from company filings, author's own calculationWe can see that while there is some relationship, the explanatory power is quite low as demonstrated by the low R2 value.Drilling down to the specifics, we can see that there were quarters where Roku significantly outperformed Netflix. Of course, there were quarters where Roku significantly underperformed Netflix as well.Source: data from company filingsConsidering the evidence at hand, I don't think Netflix's poor subscriber growth is enough information to imply a poor quarter for Roku as well.If we focus on Roku's active accounts growth by itself, the trend is more evident.Source: data from company filingsIf we eyeball this graph, Q2 probably won't come below 750k at the very worst, which would bring active accounts up 43% year over year to 21.55 million.While I am not concerned about Netflix's subscriber growth in the slightest, I am worried about a significant decrease in content spend by Netflix. Such a move would relax the competitive pressure on other content creators to better the streaming experience, which will, in turn, harm the streaming environment. Roku won't be bothered if a few content producers become less competitive, but if they all do it at the same time, then monetization efforts could be harmed as consumers may become less engaged with Roku.Considering that even Walmart (WMT) is trying to carve out a spot for itself in the streaming industry, I'm not worried about the decline of streaming just yet.The streaming ecosystem is much more than Netflix, and Roku is positioned to capitalize on the growth of the entire industry regardless of any one player's success or failure. Currently, Roku earns little revenue from Netflix, so I do not believe that there will be any financial impact. Active accounts growth is unlikely to be a complete disaster given the lack of strong relationship between Netflix's U.S. net adds and Roku's active accounts growth."

The company has taken market share and experienced strong growth since its IPO as it is strategically positioned to benefit from consumer migration from traditional TV to streaming services.Its share price shot higher in the first few months of trading, leading to a number of bearish calls on the stock by Wall Street analysts. After the recent selloff in its share price however, many analysts are now bullish due to the company’s continued operational success. I am buying stock in this name as it looks to be a generational company in the early innings of its growth trajectory.Roku has experienced impressive operational growth in recent years, but valuation has always been seen as a concern. Its share price nearly halved in the first few months of 2018, leading many top analysts to emerge touting the company as an attractive buying opportunity. Due to its continued growth and positive sentiment around the investing community, Roku could see its share price trade higher in coming quarters.The most recent catalyst to Roku shares trading higher has been a change of heart from short seller Citron Research, which says it's now covered its short and gone long on the streaming stock, according to Seeking Alpha. Last November, Citron tweeted that the stock had become a joke and would trade back to $28 after running up to $50 following its IPO. Citron recently said however:AndAnother previously bearish analyst came out recently to upgrade the company. Analyst Benjamin Swinburne, from Morgan Stanley (MS) continues to have concerns over the lack of visibility into long-term ad monetization, particularly thanks to boosted TV OS competition from Amazon (AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) however, with the stock down more than 25% this year, the current valuation isn't as elevated as it once was, according to Seeking Alpha.Roku looks to be growing into its valuation, and with more operational success, its valuation multiple should continue to come down. Market share capture and earnings growth should ultimately justify investor enthusiasm for the company.The company has put together a string of impressive growth quarters. Active accounts were up 47% and gross profit was up 62% as the transformation of TV from legacy TV to streaming pace has gained traction. Consumers are moving from traditional pay TV services to Internet delivery services, leading Roku to build a large audience for content providers and advertisers, while aggregating streaming services for consumers, according to its earnings call. Roku currently has a leading TV screening platform in the U.S. with nearly 21 million active customers.Its current strategy is to build scale of its installed base by selling streaming players and licensing its TV operating system, which aims to aid in Roku’s smart TV U.S. market share. Roku’s OS is the number one licensed TV OS and Roku TVs are in aggregate the number two best-selling smart TVs in the United States, according to management.With virtually all TVs sold being licensed in OS just like most smartphones run in licensed OS, Roku has purposely built OS for TV. They are also deepening its relationship with advertisers and content publishers. Its platform business continues to perform well, up 106% in the quarter. The $70 billion spent each year on TV advertising in the U.S. continues to shift to streaming as advertisers follow viewers, according to management.Moreover, according to Nielsen, 10% of 18 to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are only reachable on the Roku platform in the living room, giving a boost to the company’s advertising efforts. Streaming ads have shown to be more efficient, with a recent study by IPG and MAGNA concluding that ads on the Roku platform are 67% more effective per exposure at driving purchase intent compared to traditional linear TV ads, according to its earnings call.Below is a chart of the company’s revenue and earnings per share. Over the last year, the company’s revenue has risen by over $100 million, while its EPS has risen into positive territory. This signals that not only is Roku seeing strong demand for its product, but management is similarly operating efficiently, growing its bottom line. As the consumer further migrates to streaming TV, Roku stands to gain market share due to its strategic positioning.Below is a chart of the company’s share price. After doubling in the months following its IPO, a wave of negative analyst comments nearly cut its share price in half from the start of 2018 through April. General market volatility also weighed on sentiment around the company.Ultimately, its operations continue to grow at an impressive pace and it is taking market share. The selloff looks to have overshot to the downside, leading to a reversal higher now of its share price. The stock’s breakout above $40 was significant as the level had acted as strong resistance in recent months. Its upward momentum should continue as operational expansion drives investor sentiment higher.Roku is gaining upward momentum as its fundamental operations continue to expand, leading a number of bearish analysts to turn bullish.

The Company connects users to streaming content, enables content publishers to build and monetize audiences and provides advertisers with capabilities to engage consumers. For the quarterly earnings reported on 5-9-2018, the company beat earnings estimates, but the earnings results were the smaller story. ROKU is on the verge of becoming the operating system to streaming video — and that is a massive opportunity.Before we dig in, here are the Q1 2018 highlights that the company provided:• Total net revenue up 36% YoY to $136.6 million• Platform revenue up 106% YoY to $75.1 million• Gross profit up 62% YoY to $63.1 million• Active accounts up 47% YoY to 20.8 million at quarter end• Streaming Hours up 56% YoY to 5.1 billion hours• Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) up 50% YoY to $15.07 (trailing 12-month basis)• One in four smart TVs sold in the U.S. were Roku TVs.ROKU is a Spotlight Top Pick. It is building a business based on users and if we measured them as a cable provider, as of right now, they would be the third largest cable provider in the country behind just Comcast and AT&T — that’s how many people and how much content they serve, already.Further, the number of accounts for ROKU rose 47% while Comcast and AT&T are essentially flat. All of this is driven by the large secular shift by consumers to streaming video and away from linear TV.Check out this video consumption pattern forecast from Adweek:And then straight to SVOD revenue forecasts.The penetration rate of streaming video is growing in the United States, but is still below 25%:The various SVOD content providers are in a war — to buy content, to buy users, to keep users, to differentiate. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Hulu are at war with each other, as they are with other over the top (OTT) video services like those coming from Apple, Google (YouTube), Disney, and many others.That battle doesn’t interest us — what we are after is the operating system, the guts, that will house all of it. And this is where Roku exists. Each of these over the top (OTT) content providers are available with Roku hardware or software.The idea behind the business is to grow scale — to grow active accounts, and to become the operating system of streaming TV. Yes, their goal, their future, is to be what Microsoft was to PCs and what Apple is to smartphones — the platform, the operating system, for the booming industry that is Streaming Video on Demand (SVOD).Now, let’s turn to the earnings results, and the information we gathered form the call that goes well beyond the numbers.* Revenue: $136.6 million (up 36% in the year-ago period) vs. estimates of $127.5 million.* EPS: -$0.07 vs estimates of -$0.16.The real story, though, goes well beyond these headline numbers. Remember, the company is purposefully lowering prices on its hardware to grow its user base and platform reach.In fact, in the last quarter, player (hardware) revenue declined 3% as the company focused on positive unit growth. As for that “unit growth,” try these facts:* Roku TV is the #1 licensed TV operating system in the U.S.* One in four smart TVs sold in the U.S. were Roku TVs up from one in five in 2017.Even further, the company is getting entrenched in the future of TV:So, the business model then is based on platform revenue from accounts, of which about two-thirds is ad revenue. The only way for that to work is if (1) the user base balloons and (2) the user base is more engaged. Both are happening at staggering rates.ROKU noted:This is the story and below we share the pieces of data that really moved us — that is, the data that is our circumstantial evidence that ROKU can in fact accomplish its lofty goals:* Active accounts rose 47% year over year to 20.8 million at quarter end.* The company saw 2.8 hours of streaming hours per active account during the quarter.* Streaming Hours: Roku streamed 5.1 billion hours of content in the quarter, up 56% from the prior year.* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) rose 50% year over year to $15.07.All of this led to platform revenue busting out:* Platform revenue rose 106% year over year to $75.1 million.Since platform and advertising revenue are much higher margin businesses than selling hardware, we then saw this:* Gross profit rose 62% year over year to $63.1 million.* Platform gross profit increased 90% year over year.But there is even more going on — and it’s gigantic.A BIGGER STORYThe company said that nearly half of its roughly 21 million active users have cut the cord or have never had a traditional pay TV subscription.Stop for a moment and think about that. That means any kind of marketing that is supposed to come through TV ads simply cannot be reached through linear TV — it must go through ROKU.The CEO went further to say that “according to Nielsen, 10% of 18 to 34-year-olds in the U.S. are only reachable on the Roku platform in the living room.”And there’s more. A television advertisement, as we all have seen, is broad and can be wildly unfocused. For example, perhaps we watch TV and see an ad for a new Ford truck — what percentage of the viewing population has an interest in a truck?The answer is, we don’t know. The ad companies use Nielson ratings and demographic data and then the stations try to sell their ads to the right “type” of advertiser.Now try this one sentence, which is true, that is, it is a fact, but it’s also mind blowing:Every advertisement on ROKU to its users is custom for that individual user.That’s right. Not only are tens of millions of people totally unreachable by traditional TV, even the ones that are, if they are on ROKU, they get personalized ads. That reminds me of two other companies that did this to create two of the six largest companies in the world: Google and Facebook.And the evidence that this is working, again from the CEO (our emphasis added):But the narrative gets even stronger. Based on data from 2017 we get this:* Facebook users spend 35 minutes on average on the platform, although the United States is higher, perhaps closer to 50 minutes.* YouTube users spend upwards of 40 minutes a day on the platform.And here is a simple copy and paste from above, that ROKU management shared:* ROKU saw 2.8 hours of streaming hours per active account during the quarter.Yes — Facebook and YouTube combined have about half the total daily viewership per user as ROKU.And just to make sure that math really holds up, we did some back of the envelope calculations.– ROKU streamed 5,100,000,000 hours of content.– ROKU ended the quarter with 21,000,000 active users.That comes out to 243 hours per active user per quarter.– Now take that and divide it into 90 days per quarter and we get… 2.7 hours per day per user. The company reported 2.8 hours, but we have come close enough to verifying that the numbers play out.Of course, the hours spent on ROKU aren’t exactly the same as hours spent on Facebook, or YouTube, but my goodness, this company is saying out loud, with actual data, it is becoming a behemoth.Even further, ROKU has its own channel — where it controls everything (as opposed to streaming hours on Netflix on ROKU). And how is that plan for native content going? Here’s an update from management:The Roku Channel is now a top 15 channel on Roku devices based on hours streamed – and the #3 free ad-supported channel on the Roku platform.In Q1, we expanded the content syndicated from channel partners and added more movies and TV shows from Lionsgate, MGM, Sony Pictures Entertainment, Warner Bros. and other studios. Recently, we announced the addition of live news from ABC News, Cheddar, People TV and others.Owning a stock for the sole purpose of a takeover possibility is, in our opinion, a terrible idea.Ownership in an asset that is “supposed” to appreciate must be based on a bullish narrative that stands on its own.But, we are also starting to see a narrative where this firm may become a takeover candidate. For example — Netflix has no ecosystem at all — in one fell swoop it could have one, with an advertising business.Facebook, which has no hedge against its own platform, could suddenly challenge YouTube with a powerful content and ad business and jump into living rooms, after being relegated to just the smartphone.There are other examples — but if ROKU keeps growing at this pace, and the other metrics continue to support this idea of ROKU fulfilling its promise to become the leading operating system for streaming TVs (like Apple has become for smartphones, like Microsoft became for PCs), then it’s quite possible it becomes a takeover target.We re-iterate our Spotlight Top Pick status on ROKU. It will be interesting to watch a small company try to become the power house. There are massive risks. But in general, we like this bullish narrative, and we really like what ROKU is trying to do.Thanks for reading, friends."
4178994,21815,2018-06-02T11:56:28-04:00,"Multiple tailwinds are blowing in favor of Roku, like cord cutting, advertisers following viewers to OTT and TV brands giving up on their own platforms.Its asset light platform business is the market leader and well positioned, but there is little stickiness and future success isn't guaranteed.Its platform revenues grow at triple digits, producing considerable gross margin expansion with profitability in mid-term sight.We'll likely take an initial position for the SHU portfolio.","Roku (ROKU) is a OTT (""over the top"" that is, streaming) media solution that is mostly known for selling hardware (streaming devices you plug into your TV). However, its business is mostly a platform business and we know that these kinds of businesses offer many opportunities to generate revenues.That platform more than doubled in Q1 y/y and now comprises of 55% of the business, but it's responsible for most of its gross profits as it generates substantially higher margins.That doesn't mean the hardware business is not useful, but it's mainly useful as a way of getting more people onto its platform, rather than as a standalone business.What matters for a platform is generating different revenue streams and adding users.Which are the most important? Well, here is management during the Q1CC:Roku is the top streaming media player in the US. From Advanced Television:However, this underscores its real penetration. One smart move which puts Roku ahead of the competition, like Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Alphabet (GOOG), is to decouple its operating system from its hardware. The Roku platform is the only purpose built OS for TVs and the company is benefiting from TV brands giving up on their own platforms (not all, like Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) still has Tizen).Roku sold on one out of four smart-TVs in the US in Q1, giving the platform considerable clout against its much bigger rivals. Half of its additional active accounts (+47% y/y) come from licensing its platform to TV manufacturers.It actually gets licensing income from these TV brands as Roku provides a solid and stable solution. This is another income stream. It even sells access to (arguably a limited number of) buttons on the Roku remote.Roku also gets income from applications that want to be on its platform, and the bigger its platform gets, the more clout it has in extracting rents here.But the most promising revenue stream is advertisement.The US spends nearly $70B on TV advertisement each year, but this is a stagnating business.It's stagnating simply because people are cutting cords:So there are trends that create a large tailwind for Roku here:From Forbes:Hulu is actually considerably bigger, but Roku is growing ad sales much faster.Ads are also more effective on Roku for a couple of reasons:There is proof for its increased effectiveness. From the Q1CC:The free channels on the Roku platform are ad supported and share some revenue with Roku. We have no info on how much, or whether there are exceptions here. But given the growth in ad income, we're not all that worried about that.And Roku reaches an audience that traditional TV can't reach, nearly half of its active users have no longer any cable subscription or never had one in the first place, and then this from the Q1CC:Ad income is likely to increase at a hefty pace in the coming quarters (Q1CC):Here is another way to generate ad income, and this channel (containing a host of free movies and shows) is already one of the 15 most popular channels on Roku.What's more, it can be separated from the platform, and this is what Roku has done as it is included in the Samsung platform, separating it from its own platform and not only creating an additional revenue stream, but one that's potentially independent from its own platform, at least in part. It's off to a flying start (Q1CC):One can see Roku in several lights. One can see it as a cable company, and indeed, it would be the third biggest in the US with its 21M active users, behind Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and AT&T (NYSE:T).However, in contrast to the cable companies, Roku is growing (47% in active users y/y) and it doesn't have any of the asset burden and maintenance and upgrade cost of a traditional cable company.It can also be seen as a streaming solution, but unlike others like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon, it isn't burdened with producing its own content nor does it have to maintain a subscriber base.We think it can actually best be seen with a blast from the past that is OpenTV (OPTV) which was a company that proposed to have the dominating operating system for set-top boxes and nearly pulled that off nearly two decades ago.The difference is that Roku's ad-based business model is superior to OpenTV's license based model, although Roku has much less of a captive market.Well, it still has its hardware business as another plank to get its operating system on TVs and that isn't such an asset light business model and it's basically a loss leader.It's necessary, but it will constitute a rapidly declining part of its revenues, it's a much better idea to get the operating system directly in TVs anyway, and given the fact that new TVs are overwhelmingly smart TVs, this is the future.As SA contributor MagicDiligence has explained, there are plenty of streaming solutions, quite a few by much bigger, more capitalized competitors and switching cost are very low, basically non-existent. That indeed is a considerable risk.However, the company does have a market lead in streaming devices and its operating system is installed in one in four (up from one in five) smart TVs. The company must be doing something right because it is even getting paid for the latter.In a way, it's extraordinary that TV makers pay the company to license its operating system for the 'smart' part of their TVs, but the reason this happens is because of the quality of the Roku system.It also has some advantages over the competition. It's 500+ channels are a good match for any of them, and it doesn't suffer from the mutual exclusion of the big beasts, Apple, Amazon and Google, which don't tolerate each other's offerings on their own platform.So while we clearly see MagicDiligence's objection, we don't agree entirely. The installed base is growing, and if they can keep it up, it can become the de-facto dominant operating system of streaming TV. We would only get worried if this progress stalls.However, even if it manages to maintain or increase its lead as the smart TV operating system of choice, they can't sit on their laurels. It's not difficult for TV manufacturers to switch again, should they have a more compelling solution.Although Google is actually losing market share in streaming devices, competition seems to come mostly from the Android TV operating system.There is already an Android TV stick, but it's for developers, at least for now. What's the difference with the Chromecast, you might wonder? Well, according to The Verge:Android TV is already on several branded TVs like some Sony's Bravia and TVs from Sharp and LeEco. It's also present on the Nvidia Streaming box (which actually has access to Amazon instant video).Android TV has access to Google smarts like its voice assistant and search which are difficult to match for Roku, as well as apps and games from Google's app store, so it's a pretty formidable competitor (see here for a review, and here for a head-to-head).But that might also be a bit of a problem for Google, as it could be that TV brands don't want to become too dependent upon a behemoth like Google. On the other hand, it could just as well be an advantage if TV manufacturers think Android is the future.What investors should realize though that this is a fluid situation. So far, Roku's progress is impressive and very encouraging, but future success isn't guaranteed.If Roku investors are getting nervous, they could revert to this recent shootout conclusion from The Wirecutter:Although this is a review of streaming boxes like Apple TV, several Rokus and Nvidia Shield (with Android TV), what animates these is really their operating system.Then there is the gray area of Android TV boxes. From CBC:While also streaming legal content with apps like Netflix, these boxes access content on file sharing sites, although we're pretty sure that if this should catch on in earnest there would be a massive legal defense mounted by content and cable companies.We have mentioned the Roku channel above and the company is rapidly adding content (like ABC news). However, the separation from the Roku platform via the inclusion in Samsung's TV platform offers the possibility of a hedge should its own operating system expansion stagnate. That's actually pretty clever.We take a quote from Citron Research, a former short gone long:We're not entirely convinced the comparison holds, given the differences in business models (subscription versus ads, original content versus operating system, etc.), but the difference is notable nevertheless. There is actually more in Citron's first comparison:ROKU EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsThe company is off the highs of its valuation metric, but it's still making losses, even if that could turn fairly shortly (late this year, early next year). Analysts still expect a negative EPS of -$0.28, but turning slightly positive to $0.04 in 2019.You might keep in mind that their platform income is growing at triple digits (106% in Q1) and the company still has a pile of cash from the IPO ($160.7M).Roku has a lot of tailwinds:However, it's a platform business without much of the stickiness that we so often see in other platform businesses.Roku's business model is asset light and very attractive, although this is predicated to a large extent on the ability of the company to maintain, preferably increase, its lead as the smart TV operating system of choice.While the company is well positioned at present and is the market leader, this is not a given by any means, all one can say is so far, so good. Its cost free model with fairly limited ad intrusion and wide content is attractive for expanding overseas.With a growing active user base, a growing market share in smart TVs and only in the first innings of exploring ways to monetize, it looks like they have an attractive proposition for ads, especially video ads.We would be especially bullish if the company can maintain its expansion in the smart TV market as the operating system of choice, most benefits flow from there, although we don't discard other opportunities to expand its user base and ARPU per user.With the rapid shift of revenues towards platform income, the company is also all but guaranteed to enjoy considerable gross margin expansion."

4176768,67855,2018-05-24T04:40:18-04:00,"DA Davidson's DCF model's terminal cash flow value seems to be off.
        The model implies that Roku's terminal cash flows are worth just 1.74x 2027 free cash flow.
        Unless the analyst expects 2027 to be peak earnings with dramatic declines thereafter, the $30 price target doesn't make sense.
        A decimal was likely misplaced.
        I arrive at a price target of $191 if I use a more probable terminal multiple.","I recently stumbled on a snippet of DA Davidson’s research on Roku (ROKU). The research analyst had a price target of $30 before bumping it to $32 after Q1 earnings. The bearish price target is in line with many other bears (i.e. Morgan Stanely, Citi, etc.); however, the method through which the analyst arrived at the $30 price target looks very wrong.Instead of using simple near-term multiples to justify a low price target (as is the case with the Morgan Stanley analyst), the analyst used a discounted cash flow model. It is the right approach as a DCF model allows an investor to appreciate a company’s long-term potential. However, I can’t seem to reconcile his assumptions with a probable outcome in the real world.Source: benzinga.comWe don’t know the fine details of his model (e.g. ARPU, active accounts, etc.), but we do have enough to construct a rough model. Basically the analyst assumes that the company will continuously reinvest until 2027, when the company will produce some amount of cash flow that when discounted, equates to $1.246 billion of present value. The terminal cash flow is then estimated, and when discounted, produces a present value of $2.167 billion. Cash on hand at the end of Q4 was $177 million. The sum of these three figures equates to a present value of $3.589 billion. Divide that amount by 121 million shares yields his price target of $30.What’s wrong with this model? The math checks out, but one key assumption doesn’t make any sense: the present value of the terminal cash flow.Using the above assumptions I’ve reconstructed the skeleton of the DCF. Source: author’s calculationsWe don’t know the specific estimates that the analyst used to arrive at these estimates, but we don’t really need the details to see what’s wrong with this model.Interestingly, the analyst’s 2027 implied cash flow estimate is much more aggressive than my estimate. In my previous article (read$74 Target on Roku) I revealed that my estimate was $1.15 billion of earnings in 2027 at a tax rate of 25%. If I used the analyst’s assumption of 21%, the new earnings estimate would’ve been $1.211 billion, still much lower than the analyst’s implied projection of $3.358 billion. Note that earnings and free cash flow is used interchangeably here as Roku is not capex heavy and it is my assumption that earnings will approximate free cash flow.The analyst is much more bullish than I am based on 2027 numbers; but according to the model, despite the fact that Roku will be producing $3.358 billion of free cash flow in 2027, the total value of terminal cash flows in 2027 dollars is only $5.840 billion. This implies that investors would be valuing Roku at an astounding 1.74x trailing cash flow at the end of 2027.Again, we don’t know what inputs the analysts used, but there is no probable scenario in which Roku would produce $3.358 billion of free cash flow in 2027 yet the market would value future cash flows at just 1.74x trailing cash flows. The only scenario I can think of is if the analyst is projecting a long-term decline after 2027, which still doesn’t make much sense to me.Note that typically the terminal cash flow value is determined using either the multiple method or the Gordon growth method. If we can’t understand the multiple method, we can reverse engineer the Gordon growth method, which states that the present value of a stream of future cash flows is equal to next year’s cash flow divided by the difference between the discount rate and the long-term growth rate. Assuming 2028’s cash flow is the same as 2027 (i.e. $3.358 billion), then the implied long-term growth rate is -46.5%. That’s right, supposedly after 2028, Roku’s cash flow will half every year!I believe that the analyst literally misplaced a decimal place, assigning a multiple of 1.74x cash flow instead of 17.4x, which makes much more sense. Contrary to popular opinion, analysts do make mistakes, even when they are being paid millions of dollars for hot IPOs. For example, back in 2017 Morgan Stanley made a model error on their Snapchat (SNAP) initiation that caused them to overstate cash flows by 71%. As such, I don’t think my hypothesis of an erroneous decimal is out of the realm of possibility.If we adjust analyst’s model and value terminal cash flows at 17.4x 2027 estimated cash flows, then we get a price target of $191 instead. While aggressive, makes much more sense to me.Source: author’s calculationI don’t know what is included in every analyst’s models, but it would appear that Roku’s audio efforts are not even on analysts’ radar with exactly zero related questions asked on the last conference call. I for one am eager to see how Roku’s soundbar will perform. Based on the recent FCC filing, it would appear that the company is on track to release it later this year.I don’t know if it will be successful, but considering that no one cares about the audio initiative today, there is only upside if it is a smashing success.I believe that DA Davidson’s analyst made an error in his DCF model. If we use a more realistic present value for terminal cash flows, we arrive at a much higher price target of $191. While that does seem aggressive to me, it makes much more sense than assuming that investors will be valuing Roku at 1.74x cash flow or that Roku’s cash flow will decrease by 47% per year to perpetuity after 2028."
4172120,103709,2018-05-10T07:02:02-04:00,"Roku had a great quarter, beating its quarterly guidance and raising the full-year guidance.The company is rapidly expanding its user base (+47% y/y) while also making more platform revenue for each user (+50% y/y).Platform revenue is highly profitable, with gross margins over 70%.Roku remains unprofitable, but could turn the corner to profitability in the second half of 2018.","ROKU data by YChartsOn May 9th, Roku (ROKU) released results from 1Q18. Those results were impressive, with Roku showing continued growth in all major metrics from active accounts to revenue. Roku beat its earlier outlook for the first quarter in revenue, gross profit, net income, and adjusted EBITDA, and raised the full-year guidance for each category.Back in February, Roku forecast net revenue of $120 million to $130 million. Seeking Alpha news suggests the Street expected revenue of ~$127 million. Instead, Roku delivered revenue of $136.6 million, easily beating the Street's expectation and the high end of Roku's guidance.Similarly, Roku improved its full-year 2018 guidance in all four categories as well, showing improved strength in the business.Source: Roku company filingsRoku also made more money through platform revenue than player revenue for the first time in its history. This perhaps marks a turning point in Roku's story, as the company shifts from being a company that manufactures over-the-top streaming devices to instead a streaming platform. Platform revenue includes:Roku's filings decline to state the split in platform revenue between revenue received for advertisements and revenue received from subscriptions made using the Roku platform.This shift towards platform revenue is valuable to shareholders. As shown above, player margins are extremely slim. After operating costs, players are a money-losing endeavor, at least with Roku's current pricing strategy. Instead, Roku is merely using players as a way to expand its platform while making minimal gross profits from players themselves.Further, as Roku's software continues to be packaged on more and more smart TVs, the importance of Roku players will diminish. Back in February, the company noted that ""Having grown from zero in 2014, Roku TVs represented approximately one in five smart TV sales in the U.S. in 2017."" However, Roku's earnings release today updated that figure, noting that ""One in four smart TVs sold in the U.S. were Roku TVs."" More and more smart TVs are being sold with Roku software on board, which will grow the possible market for its platform without requiring the company to manufacture, market, and sell low-margin Roku players.Platform gross margins in 1Q18 were lower than those in any of the previous three quarters, but higher than those one year ago. Conversely, Roku's player gross margins in 1Q18 were higher than those in any of the previous three quarters, but lower than those one year ago. The reason for these opposing seasonal results are unclear, but one might expect higher platform gross margins next quarter and lower player gross margins.Roku is currently valued at ~$3.3 billion market cap. With TTM revenue of $549 million, and TTM net operating losses of $20 million, growth and margin expansion is built into its current valuation. Thus, it is vital for the company to continue to show growth to validate (and grow) its current valuation.Source: Roku company filingsIn my view, the two most important metrics for Roku's valuation will be the number of active accounts and the average revenue per user (ARPU). Roku showed strong performance on both metrics.As shown above, in the past quarter, Roku grew to 20.8 million active users. The company grew its user count by 8% in the past quarter, and by 47% in the past year. As illustrated above, user growth is seasonal, with growth highest around the holidays. Thus, slow first-quarter growth is to be expected, although growth in this quarter was higher than the 6% user growth one year ago.Roku's ARPU also increased substantially over the past year, rising to $15.07 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $10.04 one year ago, and $13.78 last quarter (ARPU only includes platform revenue and does not include player revenue). As with Roku's other metrics, quarterly platform revenue per user has shown to be seasonal, declining from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 with the passing of the holiday season.Results for the first quarter appear very strong. The q/q user growth in the first quarter was stronger than a year ago, and the ARPU growth y/y was higher than in the previous two quarters. However, the quarterly platform revenue per active user declined more between 4Q17 and 1Q18 than it had a year ago - dropping 18% this quarter compared to 8% one year ago.Next quarter, Roku has forecast $140 million in revenue compared to $136.6 million in the first quarter.Reading between the lines a little, I expect that this forecast anticipates growth in platform revenue and a decline in player revenue. In both 1Q18 and 4Q17, player revenue has fallen about 6% year over year. Modeling similar declines in the coming quarter would lead to an expectation of ~$50 million in player revenue - requiring $90 million in platform revenue to hit the midpoint of Roku's projection. That would represent a ~95% y/y increase in platform revenue, slightly lower than the y/y increases of the past three quarters.In this quarter, Roku posted gross margins of 71% on platform revenue and 16% on player revenue. Repeating those margins with a $50MM/$90MM revenue split would produce a gross profit of ~$72MM, well outside Roku's forecast gross profit. Thus, the company may be projecting declining gross margins. Alternatively, perhaps Roku is simply being conservative in its forecast - in the last two quarters, gross margin guidance (at midpoint) was 3-6% lower than the actual gross margins. Don't be surprised if Roku again exceeds its guidance in the next quarter.Roku had a great quarter. The company continued to grow its active users, adding 1.5 million more active users and growing 47% over the past year. User engagement is also increasing, with streaming hours up 56% in the past year. Further, while growing users, Roku has also increased its revenue per user, up to $15.07 from $10.04 one year ago.Roku is in the process of transitioning from a low-margin hardware manufacturer into a high-margin platform company. This was the first quarter in which platform revenue exceeded player revenue, as platform revenue continues to grow rapidly (up 106% y/y) while player revenue declines slowly (down 6% y/y). As this process continues, I expect that Roku will become profitable by the second half of 2018 and will post a profit in 2019.The management has also been able to put Roku's software onto one of four smart TVs sold in the United States, despite competition from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). To succeed, Roku will need to continue to fight off Google in the smart TV platform space, as well as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the declining over-the-top box business. Roku is by far the smallest company competing in this market but continues to put up very strong results with growth in active users, revenue per user, and user engagement."

Going global will cement this position.","Roku (ROKU) stock prices have fluctuated wildly from being one of the hottest stocks in 2017 with a 400% return from the IPO price of $14 to a high in December of $56. From there, the streaming device maker saw shares drop 42% where it’s been range-bound at $31-$34 per share. That is, except when Amazon (AMZN) announced a fairly irrelevant partnership with a dying brick-and-mortar Best Buy (BBY) resulting in an 11.8% drop.Or, the announcement of Roku offering access to ESPN+, which bumped the shares up 12%. While some are still confused on Roku’s value proposition, one thing is for certain, Roku's stock is volatile and will continue to test investors’ technological depth on how exactly a hardware company plans to stay profitable ... except, Roku is not a hardware company. Wall Street just (mistakenly) thinks it is.Ahead of earnings this week, KeyBanc placed a $42 price target on the stock at about 27% above current levels of the shares. Notably, many short sellers lost the gamble when the lock-up expired six months after the IPO date in March with false expectations the market would be flooded with shares. The stock has seen about an 11% decline since March from the price of $39 - not the crash short investors were hoping for. Meanwhile, Roku’s short interest has dropped 38% since its peak from 10 million shares shorted at the end of March to 6.2 million shares shorted by mid-April.Roku's stock will continue to be volatile as the company expects to continue losing money in 2018 aiming to operate “at, or near, break-even on an operating cash flow basis.” Yet bulls continue to focus on the huge upside potential as the number one streaming device in the United States with $90 million in revenue coming from the ad-supported platform.Looking beyond the knee-jerk volatility, here are the top reasons Roku will be a large cap stock in OTT (over-the-top) within 2-5 years.The peak for pay TV in the United States occurred in 2010/2011 when it began a predictable erosion. The number of pay-tv subscribers fell by 8,000 in 2012 and accelerated to 164,000 subscriber losses in 2014. Last year, the erosion neared deterioration with the top 10 pay TV operators losing a staggering 3 million linear subscribers in 2017 according to Leichtman Research.Roku is the most synonymous business model with cable and satellite TV providers and can capitalize long-term on this massive subscriber loss by leveraging its advertising, audience development and content distribution services, which make up 89% of gross margins from the platform. In fact, if Roku was a traditional cable company, it would be the third largest distributor of content in the United States behind Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T) with 19 million active subscribers.Roku critics cite too much competition for this mid-cap stock to carry the growth needed for long-term gains, especially from Apple (AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) and Amazon who all have a play in the hardware market for OTT video streaming services. However, this weakness is actually Roku’s strength. The Roku operating system, Roku OS 8, is a robust, reliable option for OTT streaming and has attracted partnerships with 1 in 5 smart TVs in the United States.Meanwhile, operating systems like Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) Tizen continue to be plagued with bugs. But by being vendor-agnostic, Roku has still been able to secure a partnership for their free ad-supported channel with competing OSs like Samsung/Tizen. In addition, by remaining agnostic, Roku has maintained a full menu of original programming while corporate spats between Google (YouTube) and Amazon Prime restrict content choices.Roku has also built a formidable catalog of 5,000 channels that even Google has not even come close to rival. This is where the discussion as to Roku being a hardware company should curtail as the “player” revenue will soon be eclipsed by the platform revenue (platform revenue stood at 45% in Q4 2017). It’s the latter where the company is making its largest investments including OTT advertising measurement tools, launching the free Roku channel, growing licensing fees and partnering for live TV.Previously, viewing data and ratings on SVOD (subscription video on demand) such as Netflix (NFLX), Hulu Plus and Amazon Prime and other OTT content was not disclosed even by Nielsen (NLSN). However, in a recent interview, Nielsen COO Steve Hasker revealed four previously undisclosed statistics about SVOD such as 89.5% of SVOD content is primarily viewed on the television glass whereas 11.5% is viewed on smartphones and tablets.Of this time, 80% is spent on catalog programming whereas 20% is spent on original content. Meanwhile, as competition increases, the costs for original programming are escalating with Netflix spending $8 billion in 2018 in order to remain competitive for a small piece of the pie (20% of how time is spent). Meanwhile, Roku has held firm on not creating original programming and the statistics support this. The costs for original programming are likely to escalate as HBO, Showtime, and now Apple will continue to compete for this space.In addition, subscribers pay for quite a few premium $8+ subscription channels, which will eventually lead to subscription fatigue – not to mention mitigate the reason cord-cutters leave pay TV services – which is to lower costs. For a subscriber with YouTube TV ($40) and three premium channels ($24-26), they are paying $65+ per month. This pricing will meet resistance by cord cutters and ad-supported video on demand (AVOD) will be the answer.Most importantly, original programming will consolidate or bundle (like it has on cable) and Roku is the perfect middleman to do this.This point ties into the previous two points where agnosticism in hardware and operating system along with building out a free, ad-supported channel will help Roku crush global expansion – especially in the emerging markets. The low price point for both the hardware and free content is desirable for global adoption, plus the 5,000 channels that Roku offers caters to differences in cultural viewing preferences.Roku has shown competitive vigor by maintaining the lead as the top streaming media player in the United States claiming 37% of devices with nearly 40 million U.S. customers use Roku once per month. It’s only a matter of time until they take this success to the billions of people overseas who can’t afford pay TV or want to reduce pay TV costs.In reference to the first point, there is an opportunity to capitalize due to massive pay TV subscriber losses such as last month when Charter (CHTR) lost 12% of market cap after reporting 112,000 subscriber losses and Comcast reported a loss of 98,000 in video users compared to a gain of 41,000 one year ago in Q1 2017.This bloodbath from attrition will continue to accelerate through 2025 when even TV networks are expected to experience a 41% revenue loss. Roku is a very desirable purely OTT mid-cap choice with 19 million users and a $3.29 billion market cap that narrows in on this staggering market trend. Compare this to Charter Communications, which has a $65 billion market cap and only 16 million users.In the next 2-5 years, Roku will outpace competitors globally as it continues to be the cheapest, agnostic option with the most channels. Its executive team is experienced in OTT media and advertising, and the platform revenue will redefine how investors see this razor/razor blade opportunity (device player that locks in licensing fees and advertising). The free channel especially is attractive setting it apart from the over-abundance of paid, subscription channels. In addition, live TV will be an attractive space for Roku with the company already recently partnered with ABC News, People TV and Cheddar."
4164341,67855,2018-04-20T10:49:02-04:00,"TV is a commoditized business, it's not surprising to me that Insignia wants to differentiate. TCL is currently the dominant Roku TV brand.Two earlier Fire TVs have flopped, creating a void for Insignia to potentially become the popular Fire TV.Jeff Bezos' massive publicity effort demonstrates Roku's invaluable role in the content ecosystem.My confidence in Roku's long-term potential has been strengthened by Amazon's aggressive push for Fire TV.","Amazon (AMZN) and Best Buy (BBY) announced a partnership this week whereby Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) will sell Insignia-branded TVs operating Amazon’s Fire OS. The market reaction was negative towards Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) as evidenced by the stock’s 12% decline. However, I believe that this announcement does not impact Roku’s long-term value. In fact, I believe that if we look a bit harder, we will find that this partnership underscores the importance of Roku in the content ecosystem.Investors should understand that just as many brands choose Roku, some will leave in an attempt to differentiate themselves. Television is a highly commoditized product, and having a different operating system is one of the ways to differentiate yourself. While Insignia Roku TVs are getting good reviews, TCL Roku TVs really steal the spotlight.In September 2017, TCL TVs became the second best-selling brand in the U.S. just behind Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). Given TCL’s overwhelming lead among Roku TVs, Insignia’s growth potential would have been limited. From Best Buy’s perspective, an easy way to fix that problem would be to differentiate Insignia by adopting a different operating system.While Amazon had attempted Fire TVs before with Element and Westinghouse, neither brands took off. Since there is no popular Fire TV at the moment, Insignia could capitalize on this opportunity.Source: amazon.comInsignia may be leaving Roku, but does this support the narrative that Amazon will crush Roku and take away all of its customers? From history, we know that Roku has always been competing with Amazon and other tech giants like Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Despite such intense competition, Roku was still able to take the number one spot as the leading streaming media device. Outside of Samsung and LG, I also believe that Roku has an overwhelming lead in Smart TVs in the U.S. thanks to the aforementioned popularity of TCL Roku TVs.This may sound crazy, but I believe that Amazon and Best Buy’s partnership proves that Roku occupies an extremely valuable position in the content ecosystem by being a major distribution channel.To understand what I’m talking about, we have to look at how Jeff Bezos handled this announcement. Why did he put so much effort into promoting this seemingly mundane partnership with Best Buy, one that was maybe just significant enough to justify a press release? Instead of releasing a business wire that will fly under the radar, the man took every opportunity to drum up hype. He dressed sharply for photo ops and created a giant fanfare.Source: Twitter.comIn contrast, there wasn’t a peep from Bezos regarding Amazon’s $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods apart from two sentences in this short press release:Source: Company press releaseAlso, instead of making a deal with a more reputable brand like Sony (NYSE:SNE), why did Bezos choose Insignia, a brand that is not exactly known for its quality or popularity?The answer is simple. Jeff Bezos wanted as many Fire TVs in American homes as possible. The media effort worked wonderfully, with every media outlet talking about #FireTVEdition and the “historic partnership.” Partnering with Best Buy will also guarantee the widest distribution as fast as possible.While my read of the situation will have no effect on Roku’s long-term value, the fact that Bezos is putting so much effort into promoting the new Fire TV does confirm my belief that operating a streaming media platform is a very attractive business.In my previous article, I noted that even when I used fairly conservative assumptions, I was able to come up with a price target of $74. Even though Insignia is dropping out, I see no reason to trim my already conservative assumptions. Furthermore, it is not yet clear to me if Insignia Fire TVs will be specifically taking share from Roku TVs. Samsung, LG (OTC:LGEAF), Sony, Vizio, and even Insignia itself could all end up being the ultimate loser.I believe that the market is overreacting to Amazon and Best Buy’s partnership. Due to TCL’s overwhelming success with Roku, I can see why Insignia wanted to jump ship in order to differentiate itself with Fire OS. Perhaps it will be a success, but it could also be a total flop like Amazon’s two earlier attempts.Overall, I believe that Roku’s long-term outlook remains intact. Jeff Bezos’ obvious effort to generate awareness for the new Fire TVs further strengthened my confidence in Roku’s long-term potential."
4160354,21523,2018-04-01T12:24:19-04:00,Roku is more than just a commodity streaming device maker.Its digital ad platform is addressing an enormous transitioning market worth over $150 billion just in the U.S.The key question is whether the company can fight off intense competition from numerous tech and media giants.,"Few consumer trends of the past decade have been as pronounced as the shift away from the broadcast, ""live"" model of programming to the video-on-demand (VOD), or streaming, model.Since launching its streaming service just 10 years ago, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) now boasts almost 120 million subscribers worldwide, streaming one billion hours of content every week. Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Prime Video service (launched in 2011) is estimated to have about 40 million subscribers, and Hulu (est. 2007) has close to 20 million.And this is just the subscription video services. The streaming model also applies to the ""a-la-carte"" channel services (Sling, PlayStation Vue, DirecTV NOW, etc.), ""freemium"" channel-specific apps (from the individual broadcast and cable networks), and of course, ad-supported streaming video such as YouTube and its 1.3 billion users and 5 billion video views a day.That's a lot of video. To access these, consumers use applications for each of the different services. Applications - or ""apps"" - are installed on top of an operating system (OS) which the user interacts with.Ok, so you probably knew all this right? When you want to stream Netflix, you open the Netflix app on your phone, or press a button on your TV or set-top box remote to launch the app.But have you thought about the OS which runs the app itself? If you run Netflix on your iPhone, you are using iOS. If you run it on your Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) TV, you are using tvOS. On your Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) TV? Probably an OS called Tizen. On a Chromecast? You are using Android. And so forth.I bring this concept up because understanding where the OS fits in is key to understanding the business model of today's highlight stock, Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), a recent IPO. You may think that Roku just sells those set-top boxes you see in Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), but that's not the case - not at all. Let's take a look at the business and see if we have an interesting investment candidate here.If you are like me, when you saw Roku was going public, your initial reaction was probably ""Meh, a commodity hardware maker? No thanks.""It is true that Roku gets over half (56%) of its revenue from selling its ""Streaming Stick"", ""Roku Express"", and ""Roku Ultra"" hardware streaming devices. It's also true that these are cutthroat commodities, with Roku earning under 10% in gross margin on them. Many competitors like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon likely sell competing hardware at a loss. Certainly, there is no money to be made on this side of the business.But the OS - or ""platform"" as the company calls it - is a different story.Whenever you fire your Roku box up, you land in the OS launcher screen. That area on the right there? What do you know, a nice big space to sell ads against.That's far from the only ad inventory Roku has access to. The Roku Channel offers free-to-watch popular movies, which Roku sells ad time against. Many of Roku's ""free"" channels are ad supported, with Roku having access to all or some of the ad time on many of those channels (not all of them).While selling ads is the biggest piece of the company's Platform business, there are some auxiliary sales as well. See those Netflix, Amazon, Pandora (NYSE:P), YouTube, etc. buttons on your Roku remote? The company was paid to put them there. Additionally, some TV brands have licensed the right to include Roku OS right into their television set, another source of revenue.All told, Platform revenue is 44% of total sales, and growing rapidly. In fact, it more than doubled in 2017, and has increased more than three-fold over the past two years. Even better, Platform revenue carries a gross margin near 75%, meaning that already it makes up 85% of Roku's gross profitability. Completing the trifecta of good news, Platform sales are far more recurring and reliable in nature than hardware sales, giving the company a firmer footing from which to expand its business.Bottom line here? Roku is not really a commodity hardware maker. It is more of a consumer digital video advertising platform.So, Roku's business model isn't as bad as might be feared. That's the good news.But I wouldn't call this a slam-dunk ""green dot"" business model. Not by a long shot.The main problem? Competition. The second problem? No meaningful economic moat to protect against that competition.We've touched on this a bit already. Roku is far from the only option to access streaming content. If you like the Apple ecosystem, you can either stick to streaming from your iPhone or iPad, or you can purchase an Apple TV and stream through there. If you like Google, well, you can stream on your Android device or buy a Chromecast. Amazon? Fire TV stick. Gamer? You can access all these streaming platforms through Xbox or PlayStation devices. Smart TV owner? A lot of these have streaming apps built right in. Cable subscriber? Xfinity and other cable platforms are increasingly offering streaming services as add-on applications.Simply put, there is no shortage of ways to get streaming content. And all of them are fighting tooth and nail for users. Google and Amazon practically give away their devices to get users into their ecosystem. Many of the other ways to access are simply add-on functionality for devices many consumers already own for other reasons.It is against this phalanx of tech giants that Roku competes for new customers, and has to guard against existing customer attrition. Against that lineup, it really has very few competitive advantages. There is no meaningful lock-in to the platform. It is really quite simple and painless for a consumer to switch from a Roku to a competing offering. Getting new customers is even more of a dog fight. What can Roku offer that its competitors cannot? The answer is: not much. A better user experience, perhaps, but that is hardly a sustainable competitive advantage.Another strike against the company is that its most popular channels do not benefit Roku very much. For example, Netflix makes up over 30% of streaming hours through Roku's platform, but the channel provides essentially no revenue back. Same for Amazon, Hulu, and the most popular ad-supported video network in the world, YouTube. Roku relies on monetizing Roku Channel and other, less prominent content channels. However, there is nothing stopping those other channels from switching to a different ad provider, or (if they are large enough) building out their own.Roku isn't entirely what it seems at first glance. Its real business is selling ads - a far more attractive model than just selling commodity hardware boxes. Growth has been excellent, with 30% year-over-year revenue growth rates and subscribers expanding even faster than that (+45% last year). The opportunity in video advertising is just immense. In the U.S. alone, advertisers spent over $150 billion in digital and TV commercial ads last year. That is a big, BIG market to grab a slice of.However, the competitive landscape is just too cutthroat to really consider Roku as a highly attractive company for investment. See below for our Business Model Diligence on the firm.Roku is a streaming video device and platform company. 56% of revenue (but only 15% of gross profit) comes from its sale of streaming video devices like its ""Streaming Stick"", ""Roku Express"", and ""Roku Ultra"" set-top boxes. These allow consumers Internet-based access to various streaming platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Now, YouTube, and so forth. 44% of revenue and 85% of gross profit come from Roku's platform sales. These primarily consist of advertising sold on its own channels or on channels the company has access to ad inventory on. Platform sales also include commissions on subscription sales through its platform, and from offering branded buttons on its remote controls. The company has over 19 million active accounts.SOMEWHAT. Revenues are rapidly growing at about 30% year-over-year rates, as customers increasingly migrate to video-on-demand for their entertainment needs. Subscribers are growing at an even faster rate, +45% in 2017. This is the early stages of a mega-trend, and the addressable video ad market is enormous (over $150 billion in the U.S. alone). As for recurring revenue, obviously player revenue is not recurring. Platform revenue on the other hand is basically an advertising platform model that should be reliably recurring for Roku. As this is where the bulk of operating profits and cash flows originate from, we feel this gives the company a reasonably attractive revenue model.NO. Both Roku's devices and platform face substantial direct competition from tech heavyweights including Apple (Apple TV and tvOS), Google (Chromecast), Amazon (Fire TV), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (Xbox), Sony (NYSE:SNE) (PlayStation), major cable operators (Xfinity and Cablevision), and even TV manufacturers (Samsung, VIZIO (VZIO), LG). All of these offer the same basic functionalities, and there is little preventing consumers from migrating to a competing streaming platform. Additionally, Roku relies on accessing ad inventory from its channel providers, and this inventory could decline or be withdrawn.We feel that Roku's business model deserves a ""weak"" YELLOW (somewhat attractive) rating. The attractive parts are the growth potential and reasonably recurring advertising revenue model, particularly given that it plays into the massive secular trend of on-demand video. The unattractive parts are intense and strong competition, no real durable moat characteristics, and reliance on partners to build ad inventory. It's a fragile business model, but one that could prove lucrative if the firm can navigate the minefield of risks."
4158771,67855,2018-03-26T09:42:31-04:00,"Roku's lock-up period expires on March 27th, 2018.Shares have fallen since Q4 earnings.Short interest has continued to climb along with the cost to borrow.If there is insufficient insiders selling, shorts will scramble to cover given the high cost to borrow.I believe that stock's plentiful volume is an illusion for short sellers.","Roku (ROKU) has continued its downward trajectory since its Q4 earnings. While I have no problem with the company’s long-term prospects, it is nevertheless a fun exercise to speculate on the stock’s short-term movement; especially when the stock is heavily shorted going into the lock-up next week on Tuesday March 27th, 2018.It would appear that the “crowd wisdom” is that Roku will fall as insiders will be tempted to sell. As the saying goes, there is no free lunch, the crowd’s expectation for shares to fall has driven the borrowing rate to triple digits before pulling back to 75%.Source: Interactive BrokersDespite the high cost of borrowing, short sellers are still piling on, as evidenced by the increase in shorted shares from 7,147,395 on February 15th to 9,946,474 on February 28th.While the stock looks all but doomed according to short sellers, I think it’s worthwhile to examine the premise of a successful lock-up short. Such an opportunity can only be profitable if 1) the insiders doindeed sell and 2)there is less buying pressure from covering and other longs waiting for this obstacle to pass.Is it a given that insiders will sell? I don’t think so. In 2012, it was reported that none of the three VCs sold or distributed shares of Yelp (YELP) after the lock-up expired. Shares subsequently rose 23% on the day of the lock-up expiry and eventually delivered a total return of 41% in fives days.What I find more interesting is that it is virtually certain that shorted shares also represent buying pressure based on current borrowing rates. Obviously paying 75% interest on anything is not sustainable, so after the event passes, short sellers would have no choice but to cover, lest they are happy with paying the 75% interest rate.So how would the stock be impacted if short sellers run for the exits? Illiquidity combined with forced buying will drive the stock sharply higher. Is Roku illiquid? The 30-day average daily volume is around 4.7 million, so based on the 10 million shares shorted at the end of February, the days-to-cover isn’t terrible at a little over 2 days. However, it’s important where the volume is coming from.For the purpose of this discussion, we need to divide the investor base into two groups, long-term and short-term. Long-term investors typically buy and hold whereas short-term investors will trade in and out of positions rapidly. This means that typically long-term investors provide volume twice, when they accumulate and when they sell, whereas volume from short-term investors are constant. So where is Roku’s volume coming from? We will never know for sure, however, I think we can get a pretty good idea by looking at the stock’s float and the current ownership base.I estimate that the existing float of the stock is 18 million, consisting of 9 million shares sold by the company during the IPO, 6.668 million shares sold by selling stockholders, and 2.35 million of additional shares that the underwriters likely obtained and sold after exercising their greenshoe option, as is the case in most IPOs. Using the most recent 13G filings, we know that several institutions have accumulated shares that would be a part of the float.Source: SEC filingsI would categorize Lord, Abbett & Co., Fidelity, and Vanguard as long-term investors, meaning that the true float is something closer to 13 million. Of course, this number is purely an estimate as any of these companies could have sold or bought additional shares after their filings. Still, I think we can use this information as an acceptable proxy.Of this 13 million float, 10 million were shorted as of February 28, 2018. Based on the sharp increase of borrowing rates since then, I wager that more than 10 million shares are currently short. As such, I believe that least 80% of the adjusted float is being shorted, meaning that if there is no significant selling pressure from insiders, short sellers will find very little liquidity, thus the forced covering will drive the stock sharply higher.Source: benzinga.comYou may wonder, if there is such a limited float, how can the average volume of Roku be 4.7 million? The answer is that the same share can be traded multiple times a day. The high turnover does not necessarily indicate liquidity, especially when short-term investors are responsible for the volume in anticipation of some event, which in this case is the lock-up. For example, an existing short seller wishing to cover can act as the provider of liquidity for a new short seller by posting a bid, and this can occur multiple times in the same day, contributing to a higher volume. To be clear, I am not insinuating that only short-sellers are active in the stock, as bullish short-term investors can also cause the same phenomenon to occur through the same mechanism (e.g. posting a bid in the hope of the stock going higher, gets filled, but sells lower at a lower bid as the stock falls). However, considering the rising short interest and the general consensus that it’s a bad idea to buy ahead of a lock-up (meaning there are less buyers), I believe that it is more likely that the former happens more often than the latter.If the recent negative price action is mostly driven by short sellers and we don’t see enough insiders sell, the illusion of liquidity for short sellers will evaporate. To borrow the words of Howard Marks:More plainly, I do not believe that the stock’s “plentiful” trading volume will be sufficient to prevent a short-squeeze.Another PossibilityStocks can go up, down, or sideways. It is possible that the borrowing rate falls as more shares are lent out, which would imply muted share price movement as both longs and shorts would keep their positions. While possible, I find the likelihood to be low as insiders will be unlikely to lend out their shares if they know that restricting the availability of the lending pool will almost certainly trigger a short squeeze.ConclusionMany investors see the upcoming lock-up as a tremendous headwind for the stock. However, I believe that shorting the stock ahead of the lockup is far from a sure thing. Even GoPro (GPRO), which many bearish investors believe are similar to Roku, rose 6% on the day of the lock-up expiry, and another 8% on the following day. This just shows you that even if a company’s fundamentals are rotten, the stock may still go up on technical buying pressure.While I find this exercise interesting, I want to stress again that I believe that Roku’s long-term value will not be influenced no matter the outcome."
4161535,24849,2018-04-06T16:51:45-04:00,Stock past key lockup expiration.Valuation much better at these levels.Short squeeze potential remains.,"One month ago, I detailed how the biggest hurdle for Roku (ROKU) was coming in just a few weeks. The last week of March was when the 180-day IPO lockup expiration date was coming, and this could potentially lead to a large number of insider sales. Now that we've past that time period and shares have taken another leg down, it seems like a good time for investors to get back into the name.While we have seen some insider sales after the lockup expired, there haven't been any so far from the CEO and founder Anthony Wood, which is a positive in my opinion. We have seen some distributions from funds to their partners, but that happens quite often. We also have not heard any big news from major holders that they are giving up on the name. There will be dilution coming, but this is a risk that's been on the table all along.The second reason why I'm more positive now is valuation. In my original article on the name, I argued why Roku could eventually be worth between $4.25 billion and $8.5 billion. That was based on Roku being valued at 5-10% of Netflix (NFLX) at $85 billion, and now the streaming giant is worth more than $127 billion. While Roku shot up dramatically after its first earnings report, it has lost nearly half of its value since the peak. With a market cap under $3.1 billion on Friday afternoon, my valuation for the name, even if I don't adjust for Netflix's surge, again represents considerable upside.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)The growth story is still intact, as evidenced by the latest earnings report. Platform revenues are surging, which helps gross margins increase as they become a larger part of the overall total. The company actually reported a GAAP profit in Q4, although, I expect more losses to come this year as gross profits are reinvested to grow the business. Active accounts jumped by nearly 6 million in 2017, growth of 44% while streaming hours and average revenues per user continue to climb quarter after quarter.As you can see below, short interest has steadily climbed over time in this name, reaching almost 50% of the float and outstanding share count that was reported most recently. With the stock down about $20 since the Q4 report, a good report in the coming weeks likely could lead to a short squeeze, helping the name to recover some of its losses.(Source: NASDAQ Roku short interest page)In the end, I think it is time for investors to look at Roku again. While I thought the surge to nearly $60 was a bit too far, too fast, shares have lost almost half of their value since. For a company that continues to grow its user base at a strong clip, I think the name is extremely undervalued for the long term while trading for less than 2.5% of what Netflix is valued at. As the overall market settles down a bit and Roku announces more strong results, I think the name will rebound quite a bit."

The Dow is now off 3067 points from its recent high of 26,600. This translates into a loss of 11.53%. This is now the third test of the 10% correction level in recent weeks. Because it pierced that 10% level this time, we may see further weakness next week. As investors brew over the geopolitical storm clouds gathering, and lick their wounds from this week's losses, we may see a further downdraft to the 22,610 level.This is how most of them felt the entire weekNot a pretty sight.I've reported quite a few dividend payments and dividend increases in the last several weeks to our subscribers and readers.Because we're not focused, hour by hour, on the daily price changes in our shares and what panicked investors are valuing our shares for, this is what we saw:sourceI know I've said it often enough, but at times like these, it bears repeating. If you've decided to build your retirement strategy around building an ever-growing income stream from dividend stocks, now's a good time to remind yourself why you invest the way you do.It's also a good time to get your dry powder ready to take advantage of lower prices and the higher yields that comes with them.sourceAs Roku, Inc. (ROKU) sold off 12.5% from our initial purchase price and 45% below its recent 52 week high reached in large measure due to a quarterly report of sales revenue increasing by 125%, we stepped up and increased our position. By layering in slowly with small positions, we've limited our risk and averaged down our price to $35.01. Lower prices, if they should occur, will only give us a better vantage point to accumulate further in this very promising entertainment platform. Roku is the dominant force in this space with penetration currently at 19.5 million homes.Adoption of the Roku is beginning to pick up steam, with over 19.3 million households using this technology. Sales have been rising strongly and so have profits. The business model includes generating revenue through the sale of devices and TVs while also collecting revenue through sharing of advertising revenue carried on various channels.Why am I bullish? Because, unlike too many other IPO flops this year and last year, Roku actually has a marketable product seeing increased demand.Well, ROKU stock is up 129% since its IPO pricing at $14 per share in September, with most of that gain taking shape in response to the company's first-ever quarterly report as a publicly traded outfit. That report came out in mid-November.True, the company's stock price is down 45% from its 52-week high of $58.80, but that is what makes it all the more intriguing. Initial enthusiasm quadrupled the price, and now, the company is trading more on fundamentals and prospects for growth going forward.As discussed earlier, Roku makes TV boxes and ""sticks"" that connect your TV to the Internet, giving you access to all sorts of over-the-top television services.Its competitors include Apple TV from Apple Inc. (AAPL), Chromecast, from Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and the Fire Stick from Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). However, Roku differs from its rivals in three very important ways.The chart of ROKU stock is encouraging to those few who believed in the company enough to take a chance at the time of its IPO. In spite of the wobbly start, its November 8th earnings report rocketed shares upward in a way that few imagined at the time.It is still possible we'll see another drawdown in price before the decks are cleared for a long-term uptrend.The bullish volume that did so much work pumping up the stock price in mid-November has since petered out. But this is characteristic of a new IPO that was anticipated for some time. Once the demand is filled investors move on to greener pastures.Other newly minted companies like Facebook, Inc. (FB) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) took similar paths.Today, Facebook is a must-have stock for many investors. However, you may recall it tanked hard in its first three months following its May 2012 public offering. Alibaba shares were trading at $58 a year after going public at a much higher $68 in 2014, but ultimately fell nearly 50% from its post IPO high.Both stocks were vindicated in the end, but it took a long while for the market to fully digest these and other new company stocks like them. They both suffered in the meantime. Roku stock will probably not be an exception to that norm However, its loss of 36% already from its 52-week high gives us some built-in downside protection.The lock-up period for the IPO will expire this week, on March 27th. It is always possible, with shares still up 129% for issuance that insiders may wish to take some of their profits off the table. Should they put a large number of shares on the market for sale, it may create pressure on the share price.Should this happen, it may create yet another good entry price to add additional shares to the portfolio.For new investors, it could be a good buying opportunity at this point. Layering in with small amounts every so often will allow an average price that shouldn't bite too badly in the end.Source: RDI ResearchSource: nasdaq.comTotal revenue, from 2015 to 2017, has grown from $320 million to $513 million, or 60%.

On Thursday, when the president announced some $60 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods, sparking increased concern about a snowballing trade war, the Dow fell an additional 724 points. On Friday, not to break the momentum, the market reacted to the continuing chaos in the White House as the president fired his National Security advisor and hired on his third in 14 months. John Bolton is viewed by many to be quite hawkish in his view towards the world; Iran, North Korea and China, in particular. In this, he is a kindred spirit with the president.This, along with the resignation of the president's lead lawyer, John Dowd, kicked chaos into another higher gear, still. The CNN interview on Thursday night of Karen McDougal about her extra-marital affair with the president didn't help matters, either.source: YoutubeGeopolitical risks had been increasing this past week, and so market momentum toward higher treasury prices caused by investors seeking safety, and lower prices on stocks, continued on Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down another 425 points, or 1.77%.The broader S&P 500 index closed down even more, down 2.1% and the Nasdaq composite, not to be left out of the party, sold off 2.43%.By comparison, our RODAT Subscriber Portfolio closed down only 1.75% and the FTG Portfolio closed off only 1.49%. A portfolio of dividend stocks, over the long term, usually outperforms a portfolio solely built of growth stocks. It is times like these when the nostrum seems to prove itself. Nervous investors, afraid of losing more capital, will move to safer shores, including U.S. treasury bonds as well as dividend stocks that continue to provide a steady stream of income.A 1.49% loss of portfolio market value may seem like a lot, but not when compared to the broader market loss of 2.1%. This loss was only 71% of the loss of the S&P 500 index. Losing less is a win and outperformance, no matter how you look at it.Remember, a loss is never really a loss unless you sell shares for less than what you paid for them. Otherwise, it is simply a loss on paper. If you paid $100 for a stock paying you $6.00 per year in dividends, even if the stock price falls to $80 or $75, you're still collecting that $6.00 dividend. That cash dividend is never driven by the stock's price. Only the yield is affected by the change in stock price. If you're an income investor, your income has not changed one iota and you have no reason for concern.photo sourceAnd when our stocks give us a raise in the dividend (as many of ours have) that is the icing on our cake.

A strong first earnings report sent shares soaring as seen in the chart below, and the company's growth prospects remain quite strong. In the near term, the stock's biggest hurdle is coming soon, when insiders can start cashing out after the IPO lockup expiration date hits.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Like most newer tech firms, Roku has two classes of shares, which primarily allows founders and early investors to have substantial voting control. There are the Class A shares, which trade publicly, and contain one voting right per share. Also, there are Class B shares, which do not trade, but contain 10 voting rights per share.As you can see in the chart below, shares outstanding for Class A, originally proposed to be about 15.7 million, are already getting close to 20 million. That number will rise naturally thanks to stock-based compensation, but also if Class B shareholders decide to convert. According to Nasdaq, the 180-day lockup period expiration is March 27th.(Source: Roku 10-K filing and amended S-1 filing; *Was based on underwriters not exercising option to purchase more shares.)The reason why this situation is so interesting is because the 10-K filing showed just under 80 million Class B shares. That means a ton of potential dilution for Class A investors, even if only a small percentage of those shares are converted in the near term. Some insiders might want to lock in a profit, while others might just sell for personal liquidity or other reasons. When you have an IPO at $14 and a stock now at $40, I wouldn't blame executives, other insiders, or early holders for selling.Interestingly enough, there are obviously a bunch of investors or traders that either are betting on the lockup expiration being a major event, or perhaps they just don't believe in Roku's story/valuation. As you can see in the table below, short interest has remained very high for a company with less than 20 million shares outstanding, and a float that's even less according to Yahoo.(Source: Nasdaq Roku short interest page)We are just about three weeks away from Roku facing its biggest hurdle to date as a public company. Once the 180-day IPO lockup expires, tens of millions of shares become available to be sold, which could cause insiders to convert and take profits on their gains. Of course, they don't want to flood the market and crash the stock, but with an IPO that's done extremely well, investors should be aware that a good amount of dilution is likely coming."

(Source: Renaissance Capital) Shares of Roku have seen some impressive price changes in the first six months rising to a high of $56.58 on December 19, and then declining back down to the current range of $32 to $34.Business Overview: Provider of TV Streaming PlatformRoku, Incorporated sells a TV streaming platform that gives users the capability to access and watch a wide variety of TV episodes and movies. Customers can also watch an array of news, music, live sports, and other types of media. The company sells streaming media players and other components under its Roku brand in addition to offering branded channels. Roku manufactures and markets TVs, and its product portfolio includes advertising products such as brand sponsorships, video ads, and promotions.(Source: S-1/A)(Source: S-1/A)Through the first six months of 2017, the company boasted 15.1 million active consumers ,who streamed 6.7 billion hours over the Roku platform. This represents a 62% increase compared to the same period for 2016.The company believes its product offers a significant increase in consumer choice versus their competition. Its platform offers personalization that allows the customer to select services that fit into individual budgets. Roku offers several ad supported channels, which are increasingly accepted by consumers. These channels include Vice, The CW, Crackle, and CBS News. In addition, the company offers subscription channels such as Netflix, Hulu, Sling TV, DirectTV Now, Google Play, Amazon Video, and Vudu. Through June 30, 2017, hours viewed on advertising supported channels grew 76% compared to the same period in 2016.The company markets through retailers and distributors in the United States, France, Ireland, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Roku is headquartered in Los Gatos, California and was founded in 2002.(Source: S-1/A)Financial HighlightsIn February, Roku reported that its full year revenues for 2017 reached $513 million, which was an impressive increase of 29%. Its platform revenue grew 115% to reach $225 million, and Roku generated its first positive full-year operating cash flow. Growth in new accounts is increasingly derived from the Roku TV licensing program, with over 50% of new accounts coming from that source.For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, Roku reported the following highlights:(Source for Financial Data is Roku Shareholder Letter dated 2/21/18)Management TeamChairman and CEO Anthony Wood founded Roku in 2002.

Roku also faces competition from makers of smart TVs such as VIZIO, Samsung, and LG. In addition, Roku sees its primary competition as service providers Cablevision (CVC) and Comcast (CMCSA).Early Market PerformanceRoku’s IPO priced at $14 per share, at the high end of its expected price range of $12 to $14. The stock closed its first day at $23.82 for an increase of nearly 70%. The stock quickly reached a high of $56.58 on December 19. The share price went into a decline after reaching that high and currently trades in the $32 to $34 range. Conclusion: Short Shares of ROKU before March 27, 2018When ROKU's IPO lockup period expires on March 27, 2018, numerous individuals and corporate entities will be allowed to sell large blocks of currently-restricted stock for the first time.We believe that they are very eager to take some of their money off the table - ROKU has a return from IPO of more than 130%. If just some of these pre-IPO shareholders and company insiders cash in their shares, the secondary market would be flooded and ROKU's share price would experience a sharp, short-term slide.Risk-tolerant investors should consider shorting shares of ROKU ahead of the March 27th lockup expiration. Interested investors should cover their short positions during the trading sessions on March 28th and March 29th."
4164023,99506,2018-04-19T11:53:06-04:00,"The event itself was predictable, the timing of the event more difficult. It was just a matter of time before significant competition from major companies began to increase for Roku.At the time of the 3/22/18 Trader's Idea Flow Update, our Roku short was up almost 10%. With today's 11% decline in Roku's share price, this short's gains have improved.We believe Roku has much more downside ahead. Today's news regarding the Amazon-Best Buy partnership is likely to be one of several major competitive threats now emerging for Roku.","Today's negative news for Roku (ROKU) is actually a double whammy of badness for the September 2017 IPO. The obvious headline is that 10 different models of Amazon's (AMZN) Fire TV will begin taking up floor space at Best Buy (BBY) stores in the U.S. this summer. But the relationship between Best Buy and Amazon runs deeper, and this is where the problems begin to multiply for Roku. Please take note of the third bullet regarding the Insignia brand in the CNBC article summary below:Insignia is Best Buy's own brand, and Amazon has won this key relationship by taking it away from Roku. Best Buy previously partnered with Roku via the Insignia brand. No more. Clearly, Best Buy is now financially motivated to promote Amazon products at the expense of Roku products. So, it is not just that 10 new models of Amazon's Fire TV will be taking away floor space from products with Roku's platform installed inside. It is actually much worse for Roku. Best Buy is now a partner of Amazon that's in direct competition with products that incorporate the Roku platform. Not good for Roku.The next logical concern for Roku is that manufacturers who hope to peddle their electronics through the huge Best Buy distribution channel may now begin to reconsider if Roku is a desirable partner. Since Best Buy is now a competitor of Roku, these electronics manufacturers that used to include the Roku platform in their TVs may now have to consider a choice between having unfettered access to the Best Buy retail channel or doing business with Roku. Perhaps Amazon will be taking any number of other relationships away from Roku as manufacturers find it more advantageous to also partner with Amazon instead of Roku.And then, this domino chain of bad news for Roku falls upon the advertising ecosystem where Roku competes directly with Amazon and others. Today's news of Roku being targeted by the category killer Amazon is certainly already registering with ad buyers. These executives now have to consider if their ad budget is better allocated to Amazon's expanding Fire TV platform or on Roku's diminishing platform. While it would seem that the answer would include advertisers purchasing ads on both platforms in the near term, inevitably ad budget allocation would likely skew toward the ascendant Amazon Fire platform.Furthermore, we should be on the watch for the next shoe to drop as other Roku competitors make announcements to keep pace with Amazon's expansion efforts. Roku's future prospects for maintaining its market position just received a significant setback today. But we believe that today's Amazon partnership with Best Buy will be followed by further news from other competitors. These anticipated future news announcements are likely to increase competitive pressures on Roku further. Accordingly, we believe that the direction of Roku shares is lower in both the near term and long term.ROKU data by YChartsWe would like to note that two of the three shorts discussed in the 3/22/18 update shown in the graphic below have been successful with Snap (SNAP) and Eastman Kodak (KODK) posting significant profits. Our Roku short also is up double-digit percentage gains currently. But we believe that today's negative Roku news will be a catalyst for further gains to be earned on the short side of the Roku trade.We posted on the covering of our Snap short recently. We would like to see the upcoming 5/1/18 Q118 earnings report and conference call send shares of Snap higher again as happened on the Q417 earnings date. If the stock spikes higher again on earnings in the next two weeks, then we will seek to re-enter our short position on Snap. We are long-term bearish on Snap shares.SNAP data by YChartsKODK data by YChartsIt also may be noteworthy that the Ulta (ULTA) long idea has moved up from about $211 on 3/22/18 to about $232 currently. Also, the Dropbox (DBX) IPO proved to be volatile to the upside as hoped although most of the gains were realized prior to this hot IPO's first trade after being priced high and then opening much higher. Candidly, this trend of private money taking so much of the gains at the expense of the public investor on tech IPOs remains a growing concern. We believe that this IPO's early enthusiasm will fade along with a declining stock price for shares of Dropbox.ULTA data by YChartsDBX data by YChartsFinally, we continue to look for an entry point in GE (GE) for a trade to the long side. The chart indicates that GE may be putting in a bottom. However, weighing heavy on this stock is the concern that the dividend will be cut. Upcoming asset sales may balance any dividend cut if a cut occurs. In an ideal trading world, we would receive news of any possible dividend cut first, thereby allowing us the entry point that we have been seeking as the stock trades lower. We would then like to see the anticipated positive news of asset sales and restructuring that could boost GE's stock price. We will have to wait and see what happens. But a dividend cut may be in the cards at GE. At the risk of missing this GE trade to the long side, we are more comfortable waiting on the sidelines to see if this dividend cut actually takes place. We would become buyers at some point after any news of a dividend cut at GE if such an event occurs.GE data by YCharts"
4150562,67855,2018-02-26T05:28:02-05:00,"Analysts fail to access Roku's long-term potential.Roku is as much a hardware company as your cable provider.All signs point to explosive growth, both on content distribution and advertising.Consumers are already voting with their wallet, I don't see how Roku will become irrelevant.I believe that my estimates are much too low; however, my base case target is $74/share.","Big Wall Street brokers universally panned Roku (ROKU) as “overvalued.” Despite the post-earnings drop, the stock is still almost a triple from its IPO price of $14/share.At a glance, their bearishness isn’t unreasonable. Currently, Roku is trading at 9.6x price to sales and has no earnings. Many investors have even compared the company to Fitbit (FIT) and GoPro (GPRO) (which I was very bearish on), as they all sell hardware. However, I believe that this simplistic view completely misses company’s business model. Furthermore, I believe that Wall Street analysts have zero incentive to issue overly optimistic ratings (a la TSLA, NFLX, etc.) because unless there is a strategic acquisition, the company will not need a single penny from Wall Street, again, in sharp contrast with other Wall Street darlings.My investment philosophy has always been value-oriented. How can a stock like Roku be a value stock? To fully appreciate a company’s fair value today, we must try to understand how the company will fare over the long term; not how much the company will earn next quarter, but how much the company will earn in 10 years time. To get that far we must understand existing industry dynamics and how they will change in the future.Cord-cutting is a very real trend. It is a problem that is plaguing cable companies. But those people are not going anywhere from a content perspective. People are still consuming content, just not as much on traditional linear television.Why? Because almost all the content that is available through cable or satellite can now be streamed. Currently, there is a cost advantage as many content producers/content consolidators are pricing their OTT offering at very competitive rates to grab share in this fast growing area of content distribution. Pricing aside, streaming also provides a much better TV watching experience by making it more interactive and convenient as opposed to static channels. Streaming is also highly appealing to advertisers as highly targeted and engaging ads are now possible.Evidently, streaming is appealing to the two parties that pay to support the ecosystem (advertisers and consumers), and in my opinion is also better for content producers as they can better customize the viewing experience. Everybody is happy, and as such, I think it is fair to say that streaming will be the standard way of consuming content in the future.Where does Roku fit in all of this? Roku is essentially a distributor of content, not unlike cable incumbents. Just because Roku sells an affordable hardware through which one can consume content does not make it a “hardware company” as so many have claimed. Roku is as much a hardware company as your cable company who rents you a set-top box (i.e. hardware) to receive content.As a distributor, Roku acts as the middleman between three parties (consumers, content producers, and advertisers). Whenever money flows through Roku’s platform, Roku gets a cut. It is that simple, and this model isn’t even new (see existing cable industry). The hardware is an enabler of money flowing through Roku’s platform, it is not a product on which Roku earns a significant profit. In my view, it is a negative cost more than anything. Roku is able to earn a positive gross margin on its hardware (9.5% in Q4), meaning that it is basically getting paid to acquire customers.How profitable is this “platform” business? Platform gross margin was 75% in Q4, so it is a lucrative business. Platform business encompasses any revenue that is not hardware. As the management revealed on the Q3 earnings call, ads account for 2/3 of the pie, with the other 1/3 mostly being content distribution, and the remainder being the licensing business.Just as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) opened the floodgates for digital ads, the same revolution is happening to TV ads. By making the content consumption process digital, Roku enables advertisers to target users much more efficiently. This alone should increase Roku’s appeal to advertisers. Furthermore, TV ads can now be interactive instead of a plain video. This increase in engagement also makes advertising on Roku highly appealing.To get a sense how much Connected TV (e.g. Roku) advertising is growing, we can look to the most recent report from Trade Desk (TTD), a programmatic player in the advertising space. According to Q4 results, Connected TV spend rose by 535% year over year. Furthermore, spend rose 1,000% year over year in the month of December. Of course, these numbers don’t translate one for one to Roku, who “only” grew platform revenue by 159%, as Trade Desk is likely starting off from a small base. Nevertheless, I think this speaks volume about the adoption of streaming ads in the advertising industry.A good business needs a good ROI. What is Roku’s cash needs outside of operating expenses? It’s basically zero. In 2017, the company just spent $9.2 million on capex. Growth on both sides of the business does not require cash outflow that isn’t reflected on the income statement already. Hardware manufacturing is outsourced, so volume growth doesn’t require capital investment to expand any factories. The platform business is purely a software business, so any growth there is similarly void of any capex.While the management is guiding for cash flow breakeven, this is only the case because they are consciously allocating cash inflows to R&D or marketing to drive incremental growth. For example, R&D was up 61% year over year in Q4 from $19.5 million to $31.3 million.As such, Roku is unlikely to need Wall Street’s help to maintain growth.I think it is pointless to look at near-term numbers. Analysts rarely look beyond two years, and if they are too lazy to understand the business’s long-term profitability, which is what ultimately matters, they slap on a sales multiple and call it a day. For example, Morgan Stanley’s analyst arrived at his $32 target by applying a 1.5x sales multiple on Roku’s 2019 hardware revenue and 6x sales multiple on the platform revenue. Only if investing was this easy.Such short-term analysis completely ignores the company’s margin profile; furthermore, it fails to account for the company’s long-term potential. While any forecast today will most certainly be wrong, it is worthwhile to at least try and see if the current valuation makes sense.In my base case, I am assigning $0 value to the hardware business. As I mentioned earlier, hardware is just a means to acquire users, so its profitability will be negligible. The platform business is the crux of my investment thesis. By year 2027, I am forecasting $4.8 billion of platform revenue.Does this make sense? Adjusted for 3% inflation, this translates to $3.6 billion in today dollars. From Q3’s earnings call, we know that roughly 2/3 of the platform business are ads, the other 1/3 mostly being content distribution, the remaining portion being Roku's licensing fees. Assuming the mix doesn’t change, advertising revenue would be $2.4 billion. The company already reports advertising revenue on a gross basis. However, for the sake of conservatism, we can gross up this amount by using the 30% inventory cut that Roku gets if the content producers decide to monetize via a third party, which would imply $8 billion gross spend, or about 11% of the $70 billion domestic TV advertising market at present.I assumed that by year 2027 Roku would amass 67.3 million active accounts. Because it is possible to have multiple accounts per household, I don’t believe that this is comparable to the number used by traditional cable companies. Adjusting this by the average household size of 2.54 gives us an adjusted active accounts number of 26.54 million. Given that 79% of current US households have pay TV subscriptions, this means that the domestic addressable market today is 99.7 million households based on 126.22 million total households. Growing at 1.5% a year means that by year 2027 the number of addressable households will increase to 115.7 million, meaning that my estimate implies a 23% market share, which implies a contraction from Roku’s current share of streaming platforms of 37%.Using the adjusted active accounts of 26.54 million, the remaining $1.2 billion of content distribution revenue implies an ARPU of just $45. This compares to Charter’s (CHTR) ARPU of $365, or Altice USA’s (ATUS) ARPU of $355. Cable companies’ ARPUs are calculated by subtracting programming costs from the gross video revenue, divided by end of quarter users. This conforms to Roku’s revenue recognition which is on a net basis for content distribution. Evidently, if streaming were to takeover, Roku is currently earning just a fraction of its potential ARPU. The content distribution ARPU will increase as more content becomes available on the Roku platform and after the initial wave of land grab ends. Understand that the nature of content distribution has not changed at all, which is why I am comparing Roku to cable incumbents.One advantage that Roku does have over cable is that its addressable market is global. The cable industry does not enjoy this advantage. Currently, much of its international growth is driven by Roku-Powered, through which local content distributor incumbents can quickly initiate a streaming offering. Currently, the licensing business is not material to the bottom line. However, this means that there can only be upside.Given the above, I believe that my estimates are highly conservative.Assuming an operating margin of 32% and tax rate of 25%, we arrive at earnings of $1.15 billion in 2027. Applying a 20x multiple yields $30 billion of market cap, discount that at 10% yields present value of $8.87 billion, or $74/share.If Roku is able to bring its platform ARPU to the ARPU of existing cable providers, say $320, and we apply our earlier arithmetic, the result would be $2.04 billion in earnings in 2027, $15.72 billion of present value, or $132/share.While I believe that my base case projection is highly conservative, it does hinge on Roku’s longevity.None of my projections will materialize if Roku fails to become a major player. Currently, the company faces competition from Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Google, LG, and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). Despite this seemingly impossible competitive landscape, Roku is still the market leader with a 37% market share.How does Roku win? As the CEO explains it, Roku is purpose built for TV entertainment whereas other streaming devices are porting phone operating systems. This allows Roku to optimize its device from both a performance perspective and a cost perspective. While I have not verified this claim, the CEO claims that competitors regularly subsidize their devices (i.e. running device sales at a loss, which one could make a case for illegal predatory pricing). I suspect that cost advantage is why many TV manufacturers have chosen to use Roku as their TV’s operating system.For a company to be successful in a nascent industry, the quality of the management is of paramount importance. Considering that the CEO, Anthony Wood, introduced DVR way back and created BrightScript (programming language specific to Roku) from scratch, I believe that he has in-depth knowledge of the media landscape and the competitive dynamic.Based on the current competitive landscape, I fail to see how Roku will get crushed by the tech giants. Consumers are voting with their wallets (as evidenced by Roku’s market share), so unless something changes dramatically from a technology perspective overnight, I believe that Roku will continue to be a major player.While profits will not materialize in the short term, I believe that the company has an incredible runway ahead. As streaming proliferates, I believe that Roku will hold its spot as one of the key content distributors.I believe that my 10-year estimate is highly conservative, as such, I believe that today’s share price dramatically undervalues Roku’s stock and ignores any further upside that I did not account for such as licensing and audio.The Core Value Portfolio, which seeks to compound at 20% annually over the long term, initiated a sizable position in the stock at $19. Despite having more the doubled, the portfolio significantly increased its allocation as Q4 results have solidified my long-term view on the company."

All of these investment classes are geared toward generating income for the retiree when he/she's either too old, too sick, or just plain tired of the rat race to work a regular job.So, some might find it unusual to find a pure growth stock, one that does not pay a dividend currently, included in such a portfolio. It should be noted, however, that many of my subscribers and readers have messaged me over the years, in article comments, emails, and direct messages, that they occasionally add a growth stock to their portfolios to participate in what they anticipate will be a capital-enhancing exercise. Most retirees and near retirees (including me) devote the bulk of our attention toward those investment classes concerned with generating current income to fund retirement expenses.And the Fill-The-Gap Portfolio, which I have written about for over three years here on Seeking Alpha, has adhered to that regimen, containing ONLY dividend growth stocks. Till now.Once in a while, a pure growth stock comes along that appears to present the opportunity and potential for very good growth in market value alone.Picture sourcePeter Lynch used to preach, ""Invest in what you know.""Peter Lynch wants you to know that his ideas are being misquoted widely.Lynch's saying, some 25 years after his retirement from running Magellan Fund, is still front-page news.Following the market still at age 71, he explains his philosophy this way: Use your specialized knowledge to home in on stocks you can analyze, study them and then decide if they're worth owning. The best way to invest is to look at companies competing in the field where you work. Someone with deep restaurant-industry experience would have predicted the success of Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). He says:Source: MarketwatchLynch came to be regarded as a legendary investor. He managed the Magellan Fund at Fidelity Investments between 1977 and 1990. Over that time period, he averaged a 29.2% return for fund holders, consistently more than doubling the S&P 500 market index and making it the best performing mutual fund in the world. During his tenure, assets under management grew from $18 million to $14 billion.The better he performed, the longer he performed, word spread of his uncanny success. Growth of AUM was exponential.He also co-authored a number of books and papers on investing and coined a number of well-known mantras of modern individual investing strategies, such as Invest in what you know and ten bagger.As a card-carrying dividend growth investor, it is uncommon for me to consider buying any company that does not carry a dividend. And that dividend, for the most part, must have a history of growing consistently over time, with a decent CAGR and one that pays comfortably more than the inflation rate.And so it is was, until now, the Fill-The-Gap Portfolio that I often write about, and the subscriber portfolio I manage for subscribers, carried no stocks that did not pay a dividend. Every stock in our portfolios was to carry its weight by contributing to overall portfolio income.Being conversant in some of Peter Lynch's precepts, especially, ""invest in what you know,"" this particular concept has always been front of mind. And so it came to pass that my sons bought me a Keurig Coffee maker some years back for a birthday present.SourceKeurig had been taken over by Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, a purveyor of the coffee pods that were used by the Keurig coffee maker to brew coffee in under a minute.My experience with the Keurig was excellent. The design was attractive, it fit easily on the kitchen counter and offered the convenience of quick, flavorful, hot, full-bodied brewed coffee in less than a minute. And there was no cleanup associated with other commonly used coffee brewing methods of the past. Brew a cup, throw out the used coffee pod, and you're done.I noticed that Green Mountain was introducing new flavors almost weekly. I also noticed that Green Mountain was buying out its competition and integrating many brands into its stable. Before you knew it, it virtually controlled the market for these pods.Whenever I traveled, it became obvious that hotels and motels were all adopting the Keurig machines and installing them either in guest rooms or the lobby or other convenient areas for guests to make themselves a cup. And they provided complimentary coffee pods as well.At the auto dealer, where I was having an oil change or other service done, there was a Keurig and pods for customers to enjoy a cup while waiting for their cars to be serviced or repaired.Friends and relatives all adopted the machines and were always available to guests whenever we got together for a holiday dinner.It was apparent that Keurig and Green Mountain had started a revolution in how coffee was brewed and used, at home, at work and at businesses that we all patronized.Research indicated sales were rising at a rapid rate and profits were gaining. I bought shares in order to share in this growth. This was a rare investment for me to make, in a company that paid no dividend at the time.My purchase price was $18 a share. We watched the shares rise over the next year to over $110 per share. At this point, David Einhorn, head of Greenlight Capital, took an opposite position on the company. In a widely disseminated investor presentation, he presented slides to make his case for shorting the company. He contended that Green Mountain was not accounting correctly for the sale of pods.The shares began a descent because he was well known and respected in the investor community. I decided to sell my shares when they got down to $75 per share. After all, I had quadrupled my investment, even at that retreat from the highs. No one ever went broke taking a profit.Picture sourceRoku (ROKU) makes a device that opens up the world of video entertainment, thanks to the ubiquitous availability of the internet.SourceSourceA Roku box or Roku streaming stick plugs into the inputs of your TV. It then syncs with your Internet connection. Before you know it, you're able to view videos, movies, and TV from hundreds of available channels, some of which are live streams.Picture SourceYes, and no. Smart TVs, which also connect to your Internet connection, offer some apps for you to connect with entertainment. But they are quite limited in number, and most are for paid TV, like HBO and Showtime.Roku, on the other hand, offers a wide array of channels to enjoy. Aside from the popular paid channels like Amazon Video (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), hundreds of others are completely free and the number of channels grows daily. They are easy to download from Roku's website and other websites specializing in specialized entertainment venues. This technology is clearly disruptive to the cable companies' business model. It makes it easy for millennials and others to decide to cut the cable cord and use devices like this to obtain the entertainment they want, and pay only for the channels they wish to use.Think of it as a la carte ordering as opposed to the stuff-your-face model that the cable companies operate on, charging you a monthly subscription price for a bundle of channels they decide you need yet you may not want.If it seems repetitive hearing this phrase over and over, it is because it continues to resonate with me. A couple years back, we bought a Roku box for a large screen TV in our den to explore the possibilities. Besides being able to watch the paid subscription services we subscribed to, like HBO and Showtime, the world of video really exploded. We were wowed by the experience.Very recently, we broke a cardinal rule in our household. We never dispose of electronics till they break down and are un-repairable. We had a perfectly fine JVC, 27"" stereo TV with a fine picture, working as good as when we first bought it, some 30-odd years ago. We decided to treat ourselves to an anniversary present. We bought a brand new, 4K, Samsung, 40"" Smart TV for our bedroom. It is an understatement to say that picture quality has evolved quite a bit over the last 30 years.Hooking up our second Roku box, this time with an HDMI cable connection, we were astounded by the amazing clarity, contrast and overall picture quality of anything coming out of this TV, including all channels on the Roku box that we had downloaded.Well, this is shaping up to be another possible Keurig-Green Mountain growth stock investment without a dividend attached.Adoption of the Roku is beginning to pick up steam, with over 19.3 million households using this technology. Sales have been rising strongly and so have profits. The business model includes generating revenue through the sale of devices and TVs while also collecting revenue through sharing of advertising revenue carried on various channels.Why am I bullish? Because, unlike too many other IPO flops this year and last year, Roku actually has a marketable product seeing increased demand.Well, ROKU stock is up 146% since going public in September, with most of that gain taking shape in response to the company's first-ever quarterly report as a publicly traded outfit. That report came out in mid-November.True, the company's stock price is down 36% from its 52-week high of $58.80, but that is what makes it all the more intriguing. Initial enthusiasm quadrupled the price, and now, the company is trading more on fundamentals and prospects for growth going forward.As discussed earlier, Roku makes TV boxes and ""sticks"" that connect your TV to the Internet, giving you access to all sorts of over-the-top television services.Its competitors include Apple TV from Apple Inc. (AAPL), Chromecast, from Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and the Fire Stick from Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN). However, Roku differs from its rivals in three very important ways.The chart of ROKU stock is encouraging to those few who believed in the company enough to take a chance at the time of its IPO. In spite of the wobbly start, its November 8th earnings report rocketed shares upward in a way that few imagined at the time.It is still possible we'll see another drawdown in price before the decks are cleared for a long-term uptrend.The bullish volume that did so much work pumping up the stock price in mid-November has since petered out. But this is characteristic of a new IPO that was anticipated for some time. Once the demand is filled investors move on to greener pastures.Other newly minted companies like Facebook, Inc. (FB) and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA) took similar paths.Today, Facebook is a must-have stock for many investors. However, you may recall it tanked hard in its first three months following its May 2012 public offering. Alibaba shares were trading at $58 a year after going public at a much higher $68 in 2014, but ultimately fell nearly 50% from its post IPO high.Both stocks were vindicated in the end, but it took a long while for the market to fully digest these and other new company stocks like them. They both suffered in the meantime. Roku stock will probably not be an exception to that norm However, its loss of 36% already from its 52-week high gives us some built-in downside protection.It could be a good buying opportunity at this point. Layering in with small amounts every so often will allow an average price that shouldn't bite too badly in the end.Source: RDI ResearchSource: nasdaq.comTotal revenue, from 2015 to 2017, has grown from $320 million to $513 million, or 60%. The cost of that revenue has only grown 36%. And gross profit has more than doubled, to $200 million during this two-year time period.The company has plowed a lot into research and development, more than doubling to $108 million. For a high-tech growth company constantly looking to improve the quality of its product, this is to be expected. Roku is always upping its game by rolling out new products and making sure it offers devices to appeal to all pocket books with a wide array of price points.By offering some devices on sale for just $24.95, up to $100.00 and more, the company is making its various offerings available to every income segment of the population. The higher the price point, the more features, faster operation and higher quality signal and performance can be bought.Cash and cash equivalents more than doubled in this period to $177 million, net receivables also more than doubled, current assets almost tripled, and total assets have also more than doubled. This presents a picture of a growth company that's well funded and cushioned to fund its product and brand expansion.Roku has $0 short-term debt and $0 long-term debt. Its total liabilities has shrunk from $336 million to just $219 million even as it pursues expansion.Capital surplus has surged from just $17 million to $436 million at the end of 2017.Mostly due to the sale of new stock in 2017, net cash flow has almost tripled in the two-year period.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, a household consists of all the people who occupy a housing unit. The company has achieved penetration of 19.3 million homes to date in the U.S., which amounts to only 15.3% market penetration at this time. Because they are the current leader in this space, I expect Roku has a good chance to further extend its leadership. With some 85% of the market still up for grabs, there's a good chance that Roku will be able to grab additional decent market share as it continues on its growth path.Keurig and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters had a similar glide path of market acceptance.

4155579,27281,2018-03-12T12:13:39-04:00,"I believe that the bearish arguments concerning Roku's competitive positioning and the commodity nature of its devices fail to appreciate the many differentiating advantages of the company's products.Furthermore, I believe that concerns regarding the ability of the company to monetize its user base are not consistent with the company's financial trends or market dynamics.The upcoming IPO lock-up expiry could result in temporary technical pressure; however, I also do not believe that this is a material concern for long-term investors.While I do discount these bearish arguments (and am very bullish on Roku's prospects), valuation is a legitimate concern, and I am only modestly bullish on the company's shares.","It's been a volatile ride for Roku (ROKU) shareholders over the past year, with the stock shooting up 320% from its IPO price (following better-than-expected Q3 results) only to later fall 34% from its 52-week highs (following disappointing guidance that came with Q4 results). Not surprisingly for a stock with this kind of volatility, there is no shortage of opinions with regard to the attractiveness (or lack thereof) of the company's shares.Image 1Personally, I'm ""very bullish"" on Roku's prospects, but only ""modestly bullish"" on the company's shares, because of valuation concerns and the fact that so much growth is already incorporated into the share price. Roku's current financial trends are very impressive, but it needs to maintain this strong growth for some time just to justify its current share price.This is of some concern because Roku is currently highly dependent on the domestic streaming market and the penetration rate for this market could become quite saturated within the next several years. As such, Roku's share price may eventually become more dependent on continued ARPU (""average-revenue-per-user"") and/or strong international growth and those are two areas where long-term visibility is still very unclear.All that said, I do find many of the bearish arguments concerning Roku's business to be unfounded and so I will address what I see as some of the flaws in these common bearish arguments. I will then look at the company's valuation on an absolute basis and compare it to that of similarly fast growing technology companies.One of the primary bearish arguments against Roku is that it is selling a commodity product which is competing against the products of much larger and better capitalized competitors (e.g. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)). It is commonly believed that these larger competitors should eventually be able to win this hardware battle, given their greater size and resources.At first glance, this does seem to be the case. Streaming devices are offered by all of these corporate giants and Smart TVs can also provide consumers with access to the most popular streaming channels (Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, Prime Video, etc.).If you dig deeper into the situation, however, I think you will find that the situation is not that straightforward. While Roku does face some very strong competition, the reality is that it has had these competitors for a long time and has still been able to maintain a leading domestic market share.Looking back at history, this situation (a newcomer taking a leading market share in the operating system for a new technology) is actually not that unusual. In fact, it's common for a new entrant to gain a dominant share in the operating systems of new technologies. As Roku CEO Andrew Woods pointed out in its third-quarter conference call:The reality is that Roku has been able to strongly establish itself in the streaming market by offering a high-quality, simple-to-use device that is low cost, custom built for streaming services, and has the most channel offerings. Its ability to attract content partners is also helped by the fact that the company is not conflicted by being a meaningful competitor to its content providers.As such, it doesn't get excluded from certain popular channels, as has actually been the case with other major device makers (e.g. Amazon keeping its Prime Video from Apple and Google devices and Google keeping YouTube from Amazon's devices). Why would a consumer want to potentially fall victim to these sorts of competitive conflicts (see link below) if they can get a Roku device and avoid the potential drama and channel exclusions?How the Amazon-Google Feud Is Hurting CustomersDon't be fooled by the fact that other platforms offer most of and/or the most popular channels. The argument that Roku is a commodity product is only as true as saying that smart phones are commodity products and the Apple OS was no better than that of BlackBerry (NYSE:BB). After all, BlackBerry also had thousands of app in its ecosystem (as well as the most popular apps; Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), etc.).For BlackBerry, having most of the popular apps wasn't enough. Having the most comprehensive app offering and being the must-use operating system for app developers (as Apple and Android were in mobile versus BlackBerry and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)) proved to be a considerable competitive advantage.As discussed before, the fact that Roku is considered to be competitively neutral is also a big advantage - as users don't have to worry about being excluded from certain apps for competitive reasons. Furthermore, as the largest platform for OTT services with the most channels, Roku is a must-have distribution channel for content partners and it can also reasonably be expected to have new channels developed on its platform first.Anecdotally, I can say that we have a Roku for our Smart TV (which already came with many of the most popular streaming channels). The reason I felt it was necessary to add a Roku device to the TV was because the channel availability for it was actually very limited.While it had many of the most popular channels (e.g. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc.), it didn't have many of the other channels that Roku offers and that I have used. These channels are very valuable for many users, like myself, because they typically have a more extensive library of content that is not otherwise accessible on-demand.For example, if you want to binge watch popular shows like Game of Thrones, Homeland, or Downton Abbey, you may need the HBO, Showtime, and PBS channels, respectively. If your four-year-old is sick with the flu and wants to watch old episodes of SpongeBob or Dinosaur Train, you may need the Nick or PBS Kids channels.As I mentioned, my Smart TV does have Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime (amongst many other channels), but it doesn't have any of those other channels that I just mentioned. While other devices may offer thousands of channels (just as BlackBerry offered thousands of apps), it only takes one missing favorite to drive someone away from it.Yes, I'm sure that there are still many users that only use their streaming device for one or two major channels like Netflix and don't care about these other channel offerings. In fact, I think that's probably the case for a number of the Roku bears who have extrapolated their behavior out to the rest of the market and concluded that Roku is a commodity product.Many others (including myself) do care, however, and as the OTT market continues to grow and consumers use it more (and for more channels), I believe that the greater channel offerings of Roku will become even more important in differentiating it from its competition.Furthermore, because Roku's operating system is purpose built for digital streaming (and not based on mobile phone operating systems - as is the case with Apple and Google), Roku's management maintains that it can also build its devices on lower cost hardware. So, if streaming devices are a commodity and cost is the only real differentiator, Roku could still come out on top of the competitive heap.In fact, while Roku has many other advantages, I would argue that price has probably been the greatest contributor so far to its leading market share. Not only it is able to produce its devices on low cost hardware, but it is willing to sell them at razor-thin margins (since it is looking to profit from usage and not the actual sale of the devices).Overall, if you consider cost, channel availability, ease-of-use, and reliability, I think you will find that Roku is hard to beat. Given these advantages, I believe that Roku users are unlikely to switch platforms and are also likely to recommend the platform to others. All things considered, I think Roku will maintain a leading position in the domestic streaming market and I actually think it is more likely to gain market share than lose it, going forward.Another one of the bearish arguments for Roku is the belief that the company has a business model that is hard to monetize. The example that is often provided to support this argument is the fact that Roku gets no meaningful revenue from Netflix (its largest content provider).I believe that this argument ignores the fact that Roku actually is rapidly monetizing its business in many different ways (albeit, from a small base). In fact, what has greatly impressed me with Roku is the fact that it is rapidly growing both users and ARPU (see image 2 below; ""ARPU""). Not only did it increase its user base by 44% over the past year, but it is also getting 48% more in revenues for each user.Image 2Roku has actually been able to monetize its business in many ways:1.) Over a third of the interface screen for Roku is used for advertising. It has been able to secure much more prime ""screen real estate"" than have other advertisers like Facebook and Twitter without the ad space really being overbearing or taking away from the user experience.Furthermore, Roku has valuable information regarding searches and watching habits that enables advertisers to target advertise through its platform. Roku continues to innovate in this area with its ""automated content recognition"" for Roku-driven smart TVs. This program recognizes programs watched outside of the streaming service (i.e. programs watched through cable, satellite, and antenna TV) and offers suggestions based on this viewing.2.) Roku shares in the revenue generated for certain third-party channels that operate on its platform. Furthermore, Roku is able to put its own ad-supported channel (""the Roku Channel"") in a premium location on the interface screen (although users can remove/customize it) and benefit from the advertising revenue that is generated from that channel.The Roku channel includes content aggregated from its channel partners and offers a way for these partners to get more exposure. This has been a successful venture and the Roku Channel is now one of the top 3 advertising-supported channels on the Roku platform.3.) Roku makes transaction revenues for subscriptions that are signed up for certain channels through Roku. All Roku users must have an active credit card and other information on file. As such, adding a new channel for something is very easy - as you don't have to re-enter all of your payment and other details as you would have to do if you signed up directly on Showtime's website.This allows for more impulsive purchases and makes adding these channels easier for subscribers. As such, Roku gets paid transaction fees when subscribers sign up for certain channels through its devices. This is a win-win relationship as the channels get more subscribers while Roku gets paid for facilitating the transactions.4.) Roku gets paid for branded buttons on its remote. You can find these buttons for channels like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Sling TV, DirecTV, etc. Having a branded button helps drive traffic, which can be of great value to channel providers.5.) Roku has licensing arrangement with TV manufacturers. Current manufacturers that use the Roku OS include Sharp, Insignia, TCL, Philips, RCA, Hitachi, Hisense, Element, and Magnavox (coming in the spring of this year). One in five smart TVs in the US now come with Roku, and the announcement of additional licensing deals could provide more tailwind for the stock. The primary benefit of these relationships however is not the direct revenue from the licensing but from the indirect platform revenue that results from the acquisition of new accounts.But let's ignore these factors and just look at the actual results. It's hard to argue that a company isn't able to effectively monetize their user base when they grew annual ARPU by 48% and platform revenue by 138% over the past year. Furthermore, the company is guiding for an even higher growth rate (for total revenues) in 2018 (from 29% in 2017 to 32% growth at the midpoint of guidance).Another one of the bearish arguments against Roku is the fact that the IPO lockup for a large number of shares will expire in March of this year. I believe that this concern is overblown for a number of reasons.First of all, I believe that the market is reasonably efficient and marginal buyers will step in whenever technical factors bring down the share price to levels below the market's view of the intrinsic value of the company. Value investors specifically look for opportunities to buy a company whose shares have sold off for purely technical (and temporary) reasons.In value investor terms, if Roku's legacy shareholders are willing to sell dollars for 90 cents (because of technical selling pressure from the lockup expiry), I believe that buyers will step in. There may be a temporary impact from this selling, but I don't believe it will last long. This is particularly true when considering that Roku's shares are quite liquid (averaging trade volume of 5.6 million shares a day) such that the market should be able to absorb the impact of any lockup driven selling pressure over a reasonably short period of time.By way of one recent anecdotal example to illustrate my point, there was also a lot of apprehension over Snap's (SNAP) lockup expiry at the end of July last year, when 400 million shares became available to trade. After some early volatility (with shares down around 5%) on the day of the expiry, the shares ended the day down only 1% and were trading at levels over 8% higher within the next month.I believe that Roku's valuation is where the bears raise valid concerns and this is obviously the most important consideration for an investor. As is always the case, overvaluation can trump all of the business and financial strengths of a company.Roku currently trades at an enterprise value (EV)/2019E forward revenue multiple of about 4.1x. This is quite high in the context of the broader market, but that is expected for a company that is guiding for 32% revenue growth next year.Compared to the similarly fast-growing companies (see image 3, below) which are also ad-supported (i.e. Facebook, Netflix, Google, and Twitter), Roku's valuation arguably seems cheap.Because many of these companies are investing their gross profits back into their rapidly growing businesses (including Roku), we will focus on gross profit and analyst consensus revenues for 2019. While you should take these estimates with a grain of salt (and always do your own estimates), I think that this is a good starting point for relative value comparisons.Image 3Netflix has a slightly lower two-year analyst revenue growth estimate, a much higher cash burn (and weaker balance sheet/liquidity), lower gross margins, and trades at an 7.6x EV/2019E revenue multiple (an 84% premium to Roku's 4.1x forward revenue multiple for the same period). While both companies are temporarily sacrificing cash flow for growth, the cash burn differential between the two companies is also noteworthy.Netflix's cash burn for 2017 amounted to about 17% of its revenues versus about 2% for Roku (both before changes in working capital). While Netflix has less than a year of cash available (at last year's burn rate), Roku is burning very little cash (relative to its sizeable cash balance) and should have ample liquidity for the foreseeable future. For 2018, the company plans to continue operate at or near operating cash flow break-even as it reinvests its growth profits back into strategic growth areas of its business.At year-end December 31, 2018, Roku had over $175 million in cash, no debt, and used only $12 million in cash (before working capital inflows) for the year. After working capital inflows, the company actually generated $26 million in free cash flow for the year. Roku also has a much higher gross profit margin (despite the considerable percentage of sales that is still coming from the low-margin hardware business) which is growing much faster than that of Netflix (see image 4 below).As many have correctly pointed out, Roku's business model is very different from that of Netflix and it's fair to say that Roku will never have anything remotely near the revenue base of Netflix (whose business model should always command much higher ARPU levels and has a much better international growth runway). Conversely, however, I believe that Roku's longer-term margin prospects are vastly superior to those of (expensive) content dependent Netflix.I believe that the reason that Netflix trades at such a substantial forward revenue multiple premium - despite lower margins and similar two-year revenue growth expectations - is because the tail end of revenue growth expectations currently looks to be better for Netflix. Its product is still cheap, with lots of capacity for further price increases, while it will likely also find continued growth from the nascent international markets where it has been expanding for quite some time.While current trends are very strong, the longer-term ability for Roku to increase ARPU is much more uncertain and its international business is so small that it doesn't even break out its numbers. More importantly, while Roku has already entered many international markets, I have seen no indication of any viable plans for making international a substantial part of its future growth.This is potentially problematic considering that Roku's valuation multiples may depend on international growth - particularly considering that the penetration rate for the U.S. streaming market is likely to become quite saturated within the next few years. If Roku's growth sputters after only a few more years, then its current valuation might seem quite excessive.All things considered, however, I think that these factors are more than adequately reflected in the 84% two-year forward revenue multiple premium for Netflix. This is particularly true when considering Netflix's weaker gross margins and cash flow dynamics.While I also remain bullish on the prospects of Netflix as a company, I recently sold out of its shares on valuation concerns. Roku also gives me exposure to the growing OTT market, but at (what I believe to be) a more attractive valuation.Image 4Facebook also has a lower two-year analyst growth estimate yet trades at a 7.1x EV/2019E revenue multiple (a 72% multiple premium to Roku's 4.1x multiple for the same period). While Facebook has much higher margins and a stronger competitive moat, this multiple discrepancy also seems too high to me.Google has a much lower current and forecasted two-year revenue growth rate estimates, yet trades at a 4.5 EV/2019E revenue multiple (a 10% premium to Roku's 4.1x forward revenue multiple for the same period). As with Facebook, Google currently has much better margins and a stronger competitive moat, but I believe that this is more than offset by its considerably lower expected revenue growth.Finally, Twitter has a dramatically lower current and forecasted two-year revenue growth rate estimates, yet trades at a 8.0 EV/2019E revenue multiple (a 93% premium to Roku's 4.1x forward revenue multiple for the same period). While Twitter also (currently) has better gross margins, its substantially higher valuation multiple (relative to that of Roku) seems very difficult to justify.In addition to the above-mentioned relative valuation considerations, I also believe that Roku has upside M&A takeover potential that these other companies don't have (given their high absolute valuations). As the leading operator in a rapidly growing market and a reasonably affordable absolute takeover price (for many large companies), I believe that Roku is an attractive takeover target.For a more specific example of M&A takeover potential, I think that Roku seems like a great fit for Microsoft. It isn't meaningfully present in this (rapidly growing) space and the absolute cost of Roku for it is quite low (relative to Microsoft's size).Microsoft has already shown a willingness to get into hardware and Roku would instantly give it the leading OS in the domestic OTT space. Furthermore, I believe that there could be considerable synergies and Microsoft's international experience could help Roku establish itself better in foreign markets.Also, Microsoft shouldn't really impact Roku's ""Switzerland status"", as it doesn't produce video content. Finally, it should be noted that Microsoft has been an acquisitive company and this would be a relatively small amount of cash for it.Such an event, of course, would be dependent on the willingness of existing shareholders to sell. Since this is less than certain, M&A upside isn't something that I would rely upon for my primary investment thesis. Nonetheless, it remains a positive consideration for investing in Roku's stock.All things considered, I believe that Roku's relative value looks attractive compared to this peer group. While this is a positive consideration for Roku, it is also mitigated by the fact that the peer group (overall) does seem richly valued.So, let's do a reality check and look at one hypothetical example of what kind of revenue growth Roku needs to achieve before the business matures and trades at a revenue multiple more consistent with a more mature company. In this example, we will use a 3.0x revenue multiple for the (hypothetically more mature) company and assume five more years past 2018 until Roku's business reaches this stage. The analysis conservatively assumes that the company will reinvest all of its discretionary cash flow back into the business during the entirety of its high-growth business stage.Note: These are simple rounded numbers to use for a straight-forward hypothetical example (and NOT my projections/expectations), so don't read too much into them.Under this hypothetical scenario, Roku would need to grow revenues to about $1.22bn (from $675mn in revenues guided for this year). This would entail a five-year revenue CAGR of 12.5% for the years 2019 through 2023 (following 32% growth this year).If we use discount rate of 10% (to incorporate execution risks and the time value of money), the required revenue CAGR for that same period would be 25.6% (or the business would need to mature beyond 2023).With the discounted required rate, remember that this is not your break-even rate, but rather the threshold for generating 10% annualized returns (74% cumulative for the period). It could fall well short of this rate, and investors could still make money in both nominal and real terms. Again, using the assumptions laid out, the nominal break-even revenue growth rate for the period would be 12.5%.Given Roku's current trends (guiding for 32% revenue growth this year, up from 29% in 2016 and 25% in 2015), superior competitive positioning, as well as the strong, longer-term growth prospects of the OTT industry, these growth assumptions (and/or a longer, high-growth period for the company) seem achievable and beatable to me. That said, it doesn't give me cause for extreme bullishness, as a lot of expected growth is clearly already incorporated into Roku's share price.Whatever you believe about Roku's future growth prospects, the fact is that that there is a lot of uncertainty regarding the company's longer-term growth trajectory. Whether or not (and the extent to which) these expectations prove to be under or overstated remains to be seen. That said, I believe that some of the most common bearish arguments - that Roku sells commodity products for a service that's difficult to monetize - fail to recognize the market dynamics and positive financial/operational trends that show otherwise.Overall, I believe that Roku's shares still offer reasonable value - providing exposure to the expected continued growth in OTT television, trading at an attractive multiple relative to other high-tech advertising-based peers, and offering upside M&A potential (given its leading position in an attractive high-growth market).While execution risks are substantial, on balance, I believe that the overall risk/reward dynamics for Roku's shares are modestly favorable. Investor should keep in mind, however, that the shares have been and will likely continue to be quite volatile and Roku is a very speculative investment (that should be sized appropriately)."
4152051,95916,2018-02-28T20:25:25-05:00,"Roku is increasingly seen by bulls as a potential power in the revolution of TV advertising, generating revenues in its Platform segment.Roku has potential, but this enthusiasm is premature. The platform does not currently gather as much data as other platforms or monetize it well.The company's claim of unique access to an underserved population left behind by pay-TV is also somewhat questionable, since YouTube almost certainly serves that exact same segment with superior targeting capabilities.","Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) stock has fallen following the release of the company's third-quarter earnings, and several Seeking Alpha contributors have already written articles offering some excellent analysis of whether this dip represents a buying opportunity or the beginning of a longer decline.This article will not be nearly as comprehensive, rather I want to narrow in on one specific aspect of the company’s performance: advertising. Many of the bullish arguments around Roku center, in substantial part, on its potential to become a major TV advertising power.The purpose of this article will be to highlight some of the components that are currently missing from the company’s strategy if it wishes to achieve this, and the prospects of plugging those holes.Roku is in the middle of transitioning its business to a platform-based model, away from hardware, which actually saw a 2% decline in revenue the first half of 2017. Meanwhile, platform revenue is growing strongly, and is seen as key to the business going forward.Contributor General Expert has already written a strong and well-researched piece on the potential upside for Roku. The whole article is definitely worth a read, but in a nutshell, they see strong potential for the company owing to its platform business, with any profit on hardware sales as pure gravy. They emphasize that Roku is a low-fixed cost business, since it outsources hardware construction and earns positive margins on hardware sales. They see ad sales and subscription revenue sharing as the principal components of the platform revenue, with advertising taking about two of every three of those dollars.So Platform is the key to Roku, and advertising is the key to Platform.Several companies, including powerhouses like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), as well as smaller outfits like Pandora (NYSE:P), have been in the targeted advertising business for well over a decade now, and while the details of how they succeed are closely guarded, one thing is clear: it is all about data. The more of it you have, the better you can target.Therefore, in order to put confidence in Roku as a future advertising platform, an investor must have confidence that the company can both obtain large quantities of data on its users and mine that data for insights useful to advertisers.To test whether this is currently true of the company, I opened a private browser on my computer and began the process of creating a whole new account for Roku, separate from the one I already have. I was directed to a three-step process:Step 1: Input name and contact information/emailStep 2: Input PIN settingsStep 3: Input credit card information for potential future paymentsAt no time was I asked for my gender, age, or zip code, which are the three most basic targeting criteria. In Pandora, which is sort of to audio what Roku is to video - an upstart, independent ad-supported outfit attempting to compete with large-scale competitors - entry of that data is the first thing you do, before listening to a single song. Facebook also gathers this information immediately upon engagement with the customer.In addition to standard personal attributes, another key to advertising will be using customers' viewing history to better target ads. Someone who watches Discovery Channel astronomy shows a lot is probably much more likely to respond to an ad for telescopes or star charts than someone who absolutely has to see Orange Is The New Black the moment it comes out.But despite being on the market for several years now, Roku does not have Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) backlog of viewing history to fall back on. Netflix and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) probably have logs of literally everything a customer has ever watched, going back to 1997, digital or analog. But Roku did not begin tracking viewing behavior until much later, in just the past few years.And even today, tracking is somewhat limited compared to other platforms. Roku does now track what content is being viewed, but CEO Anthony Wood confirmed that content tracking is opt-in, not opt-out, which could conceivably mean that a great many customers are not using it.Roku does have search history for all its customers, but those mostly pertain to channels, not particular programs. Knowing someone searched for and downloaded Hulu or even HGTV doesn’t really tell someone much about their specific program tastes beyond the basic generalities.Roku bulls would be right to point out that there are other, indirect ways of obtaining that information, for those companies that don’t actively solicit it directly from their user base. The company has been using third-party systems for some time to track user characteristics, and last year began offering advertisers audience guarantees with regard to age and gender, measured by Nielsen’s audience platform.Meanwhile, zip code may be less crucial, since it can be inferred with some accuracy by the credit card I enter and the IP address my Roku device logs in from.The company has also, in the past, not been averse to sharing the audience data itself with select partners, beginning with Viacom (VIA, VIAB). This may reduce Roku’s need to develop user characteristics and effective data mining processes for advertising, if it is simply going to turn the data over to others. However, that would probably also substantially reduce the return it could expect to command.In short, Roku is not currently in a position to obtain large-scale data sets on its customers that would allow the kind of TV advertising breakthrough that seems to be at the heart of many of the bullish arguments for the stock. It may be able to achieve similar results by partnering with third-parties, but presumably some of the upside would also have to be shared with those partners.The company itself may well have other cards to play in marketing itself to marketers. Roku’s own pitch to potential advertisers currently centers on access, not targeting. It believes that with many consumers already cutting the cord and with tens of millions of cord-nevers out there, there are a great many people that advertisers can’t reach at all except by going through Roku. Netflix and Amazon Prime, the other two major streaming powers, do not offer third-party ads.That may well be true, and if so, Roku’s limits on targeting may not prove as crucial as I believe. However, Google’s YouTube is also a staple product for many cord-nevers, and they do offer major advertising opportunities. While YouTube also does not require disclosure of age or gender to start accounts, it is linked with Google+, which does. As well as a variety of other Google products which can also either determine or infer age with a high degree of accuracy. Unlike Roku, which is a single-product company.I would be hesitant to conclude that, as currently constructed, Roku has created an ad platform that either reaches people YouTube does not or offers targeting capabilities as strong as YouTube.Roku is far from doomed in its advertising efforts, and to be clear, I am not recommending a short position in the stock at this time. The company may well re-tool its onboarding process going forward, and as it integrates more and more services into its content-tracking system, more and more consumers may opt in to the program. It also has a variety of fallback options with third-party partners if it needs them, including sharing its own data. And the company retains certain unique strengths, including being the “Switzerland” of streaming that all major providers cooperate with.But none of this changes the fact that, while bullishness on advertising may not be proven wrong in the end, it is currently premature. Roku is commonly perceived by bulls as having a platform akin to Netflix or YouTube, where user activity generates large amounts of data that can be immediately mined for new customer initiatives.But in fact, Roku doesn’t gather as much data as those companies and can’t mine it nearly as effectively. Its claims of unique access to underserved populations must also be discounted somewhat in light of YouTube’s unparalleled scope.I recommend investors continue to monitor Roku’s efforts, but avoid taking a position until the company adequately addresses shortfalls in its advertising monetization effort."
4150518,103480,2018-02-26T00:03:33-05:00,"Roku crashed more than 20% after reporting Q4 earnings that were fine, but included a weak outlook that investors didn't like.Shares are still up nearly 3x from their IPO price of $14.Roku's growth is decelerating quickly, and despite the company's insistence that it is a platform that doesn't depend on hardware revenues, it has a very limited ecosystem outside of it.The competition against Roku is enormous.Shortages of NAND chips caused logistics headaches that ate into the company's margins this quarter.","Don't kid yourself: Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU), the recent IPO that shot up >200%, has had this correction long coming. It's a classic tale of hype over fundamentals - investors greedily bought into Roku's story of cord-cutting and streaming without really thinking about the valuation implications of sending the stock up over $50. Even at $40, where Roku fell after reporting its fourth quarter and downbeat guidance, the stock is still vulnerable to further corrections.ROKU data by YChartsAs I wrote in a prior article, investors are too quick to draw comparisons between Roku and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), and according to them both have the same benefit of the doubt when it comes to cord-cutting trends - when in reality, it's Netflix that has emerged as the big winner. Over the past quarter, the chasm of quality between Roku and Netflix has only gotten wider. Roku has shamelessly made every effort to encourage the Netflix comparison, publishing a ""shareholder letter"" with every quarterly earnings instead of a press release, a signature of Netflix's Reed Hastings. But while it's easy to see Netflix still around and growing in five years, it's hard to make the same case for Roku.The primary reason for this is Netflix's huge library of proprietary content, which makes users flock to its service and form its unique competitive moat. For 2018 alone, Netflix has earmarked an $8 billion war chest for acquiring and producing content, and has spent a lot of that money on flashy deals, acquiring award-winning showrunners from Ryan Murphy (Glee, American Horror Story) and Shonda Rhimes (Grey's Anatomy, Scandal), spending hundreds of millions on multi-year production deals with both of these Hollywood luminaries and prying them away from their incumbent networks.Roku, on the other hand, is merely a distribution platform. The media industry has seen all the companies involved purely in distribution scramble as they fight for users and keep competing on price as content costs increase. And despite the fact that some of these traditional cable subscribers might choose to move to a service like Roku, Roku has plenty of competition for a very undifferentiated service - products like Google Chromecast (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon Fire Stick (NASDAQ: AMZN) can be had for essentially the same price with all of the same features.Roku's recent price cuts and the introduction of the $30 Roku Express - as well as Amazon itself undercutting Roku and offering deep discounts on Roku players on Amazon.com - is a signal that the company is scrambling to compete by offering a more attractive price, which is seldom a winning strategy for any business that has a true moat. Once the initial wave of euphoria for cord-cutting dies down, Roku will repeat the story of cable companies' price wars again in its own form.Roku's management and its Wall Street cheerleaders speak in breathless terms about the company's transition to becoming a platform company. Yes, even bearish investors have to concede that point - Roku is growing platform revenues at an impressive rate, and given that platform revenues are much higher margin, its strategy to focus on higher-value platform monetization is spot on.The piece that bulls are missing, however, is the fact that Roku's primary channel for user acquisition is its hardware. Google and Amazon, on the other hand, have massive ecosystems outside of digital TV. Amazon, of course, has its giant online ""everything store"" as well as an array of smart home devices and e-readers. Google has its ubiquitous search engine, email, and a variety of hardware across smartphones, speakers and other miscellaneous products.While its competitors have an endless array of customer acquisition channels, Roku is crutched to its single product. For this reason, declining hardware revenues are a concern - not for the revenues themselves, as player sales actually provide very little margin, but for the new users they bring in. Lower hardware revenues can't be ignored because they represent a slowdown in new user growth, which is the backbone that fuels Roku's >100% expansion of platform revenues. Roku's future can't be entirely divorced of hardware - where would its users come from? It certainly doesn't have the capital or expertise to build out adjacent features in a wider ecosystem the way that Google or Amazon can.As reported by MarketWatch, another factor eating into Roku's muted results was the global, widespread shortage of NAND flash memory chips, an expensive raw input into Roku players.NAND shortages aren't anything new - the whole hardware industry has been affected by demand exceeding supply for the ubiquitous memory chips. Even the PC giant HP Inc. (NYSE: HPQ) has seen its margins sliced by higher NAND memory pricing.Unfortunately for Roku, it doesn't seem that its memory struggles will abate anytime soon. Micron (NASDAQ: MU), one of the dominant global suppliers of raw NAND, recently issued its FY18 outlook that stated it expected NAND pricing trends to remain favorable (that is, higher) for longer than it originally assumed, causing the stock to rally after a recent correction.And for Roku, the trouble isn't just in NAND pricing alone - it's the fact that, this quarter (according to Roku's CEO), the severe memory constraints forced the company to air ship NAND chips to produce Roku players on time, cutting severely into the company's already-thin hardware gross margins.As usual, Roku did a good job of managing expectations and eked out a small beat to Wall Street consensus, but a deeper examination of the quarter still uncovers some glaring issues. It all depends on the lens you choose to view the company from: bullish investors will only see the 129% y/y growth in platform revenues, but a more holistic view of the results reveals some tertiary problems that can have a real impact on the platform business:Figure 1. Roku Q4 resultsSource: Roku investor relationsThe key problem which we've already discussed, of course, is the decline in hardware revenues. Sales of Roku players slumped 7% y/y, in part driven by the company's price cuts.Instead of being dismissive of the hardware business, however, investors have to realize that the decline in player sales has a bona fide impact on the platform business. Yes, the 44% y/y growth in active accounts to 19.3 million is still a robust growth rate - but it has decelerated from 48% growth in Q3. Ditto for streaming hours - 55% y/y growth in streaming hours is solid, but still marks a deceleration from 58% y/y growth in Q3.Roku doesn't seem to have a way of climbing out of the hole when it comes to hardware revenues, which still represent more than half of its total revenue base. The dropoff in user and streaming hour counts are laggard casualties of the hardware decline - that is, the effects of the slowdown in player sales will have a more visible impact on Roku's user base multiple quarters, maybe years down the road. But with Roku's foundation and primary channel for user acquisition faltering, its future is very much uncertain.Note also the huge compressions in Roku's margin. Hardware gross margins tumbled the hardest from 14.3% in 4Q16 to merely 9.5% in 4Q17, in part driven by the NAND air shipments previously discussed. At this point, Roku is essentially giving out these players at cost - and if it's counting on price cuts to drive unit sales growth and the related acquisition of customers, it doesn't have much further to cut in order to spur sales.Also surprising is the fact that platform gross margins have sunk as well to 74.6%, down almost a full three points from 77.5% in the year-ago quarter. Note also that platform revenue growth itself has decelerated from 137% y/y in Q3 to 129% this quarter. With growth rates that high, deceleration is still fairly meaningless - but watch out for even more dramatic deceleration in the future as Roku's user growth slows down along with hardware sales.None of these observations are particularly complex, but it seems that Roku bulls are blind to the basic issues that will give the company trouble down the road, preferring only to look at growth on the platform side of the business without thinking about the drivers of that growth. As such, bulls were also in for a rude awakening when Roku's Q1 guidance heavily missed consensus - its revenue guidance of $120-130 million is short of consensus of $131.7 million.Even after Roku's fall from grace, the company still carries a huge market cap of $4.1 billion. Valued against the company's FY18 revenue guidance of $660-690 million, that represents a forward P/S multiple of 6.1x. There are software and internet companies with pure high-margin subscription revenues trading for a 6x multiple. Roku's revenue base, however, still carries about half its weight in hardware revenues, which at a sub-10% gross margin is practically without value. It doesn't make sense to be paying 6x revenues for such a company.Being negative on Roku is an unpopular position. The company has accrued a raving fan base in the investment community, and even despite its scary >20% tumble there are many investors pumping money into the stock and buying the dip.Don't follow their lead. Roku has done so well since its IPO because of its novelty and the fact that it was an exciting, high-profile IPO in the back half of 2017 that saw very few high profile deals. The IPO calendar for 2018, however, has a lot of unicorn heavyweights on it from Spotify (MUSIC) to Dropbox (DROPB) (NASDAQ: DBX) - and tech investors are notoriously fickle for moving on from one exciting thing to the next. Roku stock will soon lose its gusto, and the drop to $40 is just the beginning."
4150453,25120,2018-02-25T04:16:16-05:00,"Roku ended 2017 on a strong note and guides for solid growth in 2018.Disappointing is the significant pressure seen on margins, even if you exclude the impact of changed accounting rules.I find it very hard to justify today's valuation after a great run, as Roku remains a dangerous short amidst strong momentum, small float and potential strategic M&A interest.","Roku (ROKU) has been a name which has been on my watchlist after it had gone public last year. The buzz surrounding the name and diverging opinions have created high volatility in the stock, and I have held a short position briefly in the mid-fifties.While I did not maintain the short position into the fourth-quarter earnings release, it never hurts to re-evaluate the investment thesis following the release of the results and the accompanied outlook for 2018.Around the time of the IPO, shares jumped to levels in the mid-twenties as I believed that shares looked expensive at the time, but at the same time recognised that shares would be a dangerous short given the limited float and potential for momentum. That conclusion was right as very strong third-quarter results triggered a huge run in the shares. After shares doubled again to levels in the $50s, I felt much more comfortable to temporarily hold a short position.Consumers can use Roku to stream content on a single platform, allowing them to watch content from multiple content providers in an integrated manner on their TV. While many consumers rely on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) for their daily hour/hours of entertainment, many consumers use combined options from other content providers to watch movies, sports, entertainment and listen to music. Having to access multiple platforms can be very inconvenient.Roku solves this problem as the content from providers is sent into the library of Roku, thereby providing one platform for consumers to access, while content providers with a narrow library (and therefore inferior offering) benefit from being on Roku's platform as well. With trends like cord-cutting and pay-on-demand being on the increase, Roku can play the role of a middleman, provided that it reads the social trends well and remains relevant in a rapidly changing industry.Roku went public as recent as September of last year, as the preliminary offering price range only stood at $12-$14 per share. Shares have seen strong pricing action, first-day returns, and gains ever since.The finances of Roku are complicated as revenues include both hardware revenues and software revenues at the same time. Total revenues were up 25% to nearly $400 million in 2016 on which Roku lost $43 million on an operating basis. Key is that low margin hardware revenues were up just 9% to $294 million, as lucrative and recurring platform revenues more than doubled to $105 million.The trends in 2017 were very encouraging. While revenue growth slowed down a bit to 23% in the first half of the year, growth was driven by platform revenues which nearly doubled to $82 million as lower-margin hardware sales were down a bit. Operating losses narrowed significantly to $21 million.In the third quarter, Roku gained 1.6 million accounts to 16.7 million accounts, as ARPU rose by 37% to $12.68 (per annum). Revenue growth came in at nearly double the rate as the first half of the year, with revenues being up 40% to $125 million. Platform revenues were up 137% to $57 million, as hardware revenues returned to growth as well, driven by strong subscriber growth numbers. This operating momentum caused operating losses to narrow further to $8 million.Fourth-quarter results were very strong as the company gained 2.6 million accounts, ending the year with 19.3 million accounts. Revenue growth slowed down to 28% on an annual basis and amounted to $188.3 million, thereby coming in at the higher end of the provided guidance of $175-$190 million. This was driven by a 129% increase in platform revenues to $85 million, while hardware revenues fell again and were down by 7% to $103 million.Growth and shift in the mix allowed the company to report an operating profit of little over $9 million in this seasonally strong quarter, nearly triple the +$3 million number posted last year. The reported adjusted EBITDA number of little over $14 million was much stronger than the anticipated range of flat to $6 million, as outlined by the company itself.Given the trends of continued growth into the higher margin platform business, the outlook for the current year looks disappointing.Sales are seen at $660 to $690 million which implies that sales will grow between 29 and 34% on an annual basis from the $513 million revenue number reported for 2017. This strong growth and continued shift into higher software/platform revenues should be beneficial for margins, but this is not the case.After posting an adjusted EBITDA number of nearly $8 million in 2017, adjusted EBITDA is projected between minus $10 million and minus $25 million in 2018. This is rather disappointing as losses were coming down during 2017, even as the losses were impacted by a change in accounting standards. Executives notice that adjusted EBITDA would have come in around the break-even level if you exclude for the change in accounting methodology, yet it remains a deterioration from the 2017 results.On the bottom line, losses are seen between $40 and $55 million, killing all illusions for near-term profitability, as this has been the driver behind the negative share price reaction. Fortunately, the company operates with a net cash position of $177 million, providing sufficient financial flexibility to fund these losses. With 97 million regular shares outstanding, or 119 million shares outstanding on a diluted basis, the valuation of equity has risen to $5.0 billion at $42 per share (assuming the diluted share count) valuing the entire business at $4.8 billion.Part of the negative operating leverage is expected as user growth is believed to be more important than (hardware) margins at this point in time. In that light, it is reassuring that Roku projects revenue growth acceleration/sustained growth in the coming year, although some investors might have hoped for positive margins.In past articles, I have come up with a few scenario analyses for the future. One of them encompasses having 100 million accounts in a year of 5 from now, which combined with ARPU of $15-20 could yield revenues of $1.5-$2.0 billion. Even with 50% operating margins, earnings could hit $600-$800 million which combined with a 20 times multiple could warrant a $12-$16 billion valuation.That looks highly appealing, but based on a $5 billion current valuation, such a valuation yields upside potential of 19-26% per annum. This is very compelling, but relies on very rosy growth numbers, requiring the company to add 4 million subscribers each quarter (assuming linear growth), or 16 million a year. While a 2.6 million increase in user accounts in the recent quarter is solid, the 5.9 million annual growth number is much more moderate.A perhaps more realistic 50 million customer count reduces the valuation potential with the same assumptions to $6-$8 billion, translating into returns of just 4-10% per annum. That still requires growth of 6 million users a year, meaning that current user growth has to be maintained for five years to come. Given the risks on delivering on this growth, as well as assuming 50% operating margins by 2023, these low potential returns do not compensate for the execution and growth risks in my opinion.Roku offers a very compelling solution for cord-cutters who are tired of their expensive packages. Of course, Netflix is the undisputed leader, but as other players are setting up services as well (such as Disney (NYSE:DIS), Hulu and others), consumers like to consolidate their services in a single platform/app.The good thing is that Roku has scale and leadership in its current position, but other players (pretty much all the major tech players) have an interest in the segment as well. Of course, they could develop their own service (which they are doing in some form or another). If they find the market very important, they might simply buy the leading brand and market position with a current $5 billion valuation, which is change for these businesses.Given this competitive environment, Roku is probably making the right decision to prioritize growth over margins at this point, and grow the user base. The problem is that this industry is still in early stages of development, and unlike major content providers, Roku is just a middle man with no content of its own. This means that competitors which would want to compete more effectively with Roku have a few more levers to pull, if they want to.For now shares trade in my neutral zone at $40-50. While I believe that levels in the $30 look expensive on a discounted cash flow basis, I am very well aware of the speculative nature of the stock, including M&A, which would make me a bit more upbeat at those levels. On the other hand, I would be inclined to short again (small size) in the $50-60 region, hoping to take advantage of some excessive (intra-day) volatility."

4150323,73185,2018-02-23T17:48:22-05:00,"Wall Street's honeymoon with Roku hit a road bump with a bad first quarter guide.Near-term noise aside, Roku could more than double in value over the next several years.Roku also could be eaten alive by competitors over the next several years.Which thesis holds more weight?","Wall Street's honeymoon with Roku (ROKU) hit a road bump when the hyper-growth streaming player provider reported strong quarterly results alongside a weak guide. When you're a richly valued, newly public, hyper-growth company like ROKU, you need clean beat-and-raise quarters in order for the stock to head higher. So it's no wonder a low guide sent shares spiraling. Many bulls think this is a buying opportunity, while many bears think this is the beginning of a secular decline and that ROKU will follow in the footsteps of one trick ponies before it like GoPro (GPRO) and Fitbit (FIT). We understand both of these arguments. In an everything-goes-right scenario, ROKU could more than double over the next several years. In an everything-goes-wrong scenario, ROKU could be eaten alive by far larger, far more resourceful competitors. Consequently, we are neutral on the name, with a slightly bearish skew. At this point in time, buying ROKU stock feels more like a speculation than an investment. First, let's look at the bull thesis. ROKU makes and sells OTT streaming players that do for the streaming world what cable boxes do for the traditional TV world. That is, they allow you to actually watch the content. In this sense, ROKU is a pure-play on the OTT streaming transition. As more and more consumers cut the chord and go OTT, the more and more players ROKU will sell.But that hardware business is quickly becoming a side show. ROKU is creating an ecosystem on top of its streaming players, and that's the exciting part of ROKU's business model. ROKU already has built out the software side of its business that GoPro and Fitbit have tried so desperately to do. ROKU's platform revenues, largely driven by a burgeoning advertising business, accounted for nearly half of all revenue last quarter and nearly doubled year-over-year. Moreover, those revenues have really high margins (roughly 75%) vs. 10% margins on the hardware business. Consequently, the more the software business ramps, the more the company's overall profitability rises. With all that said, here's how ROKU stock more than doubles from its current levels. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has nearly 120 million global members. It's unlikely that ROKU can ever get to that number of accounts considering consumers often have multiple streaming services (it is not abnormal for one household to have a Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon (AMZN) Video account), but they often don't need multiple streaming players (it is abnormal for a household to have a Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chromecast, a Roku Stick, and an Amazon Fire TV Stick). Nonetheless, that 120 million number feels like a good proxy for a TAM for ROKU. From that perspective, and considering that YoY account growth has accelerated from 4 million at the beginning of 2017 to 6 million by the end, we think the bullish assumption that ROKU can add 7 million new users per year over the next five years seems reasonable. That would put total active accounts in five years at 55 million. Meanwhile, ARPU is right around $14, and it's surging higher thanks to the company's advertising efforts. The ramp in the ad business should continue. After all, its currently only a $220 million business. A reasonable bull assumption is that ARPU heads toward $25 over the next five years. That's right around Facebook's (FB) current annualized ARPU, so this assumption is built on the fact that ROKU's global advertising value in five years will be equivalent to what Facebook's global advertising value is today. That seems like a stretch, but also reasonable in a best-case scenario. A $25 ARPU on 55 million active accounts gets you to Platform revenue in five years of $1.375 billion. Gross profit margins in that segment could trend to 80% (from 75% last quarter), so you're looking at Platform gross profits of $1.1 billion. Even the biggest bull doesn't expect much from the Player business, so an aggressive assumption is for this business to look the same in five years as it does today (it is currently declining). That implies another $300 million in revenues and $30 million in gross profits, so total revenue in five years could be $1.675 billion and total gross profits could be $1.13 billion. Right now, ROKU is generating roughly $500 million in revenue on $220 million in operating expenses, implying an opex rate just north of 40%. Revenue growth should drive some opex leverage over the next several years. It's reasonable to think that this opex rate can come down to 35%, but further compression during the hyper-growth phase seems unrealistic. On $1.675 billion in total revenues, that would lead to operating expenses of roughly $600 million in five years. Take out that $600 million from $1.13 billion gross profits, and you wind up with $530 million in operating profits. Taking out 21% for taxes, you get to roughly $420 million in net profits in five years. A rather conservative 20x multiple on those profits implies a market value in five years of $8.4 billion, more than double the current market cap. Although the math checks out for this stock to more than double over the next several years, the assumptions made to get to that valuation seem aggressive. A ramp to 55 million members seems tough considering the company is directly competing with some of the biggest and most resourceful names in tech, including Apple (AAPL), Amazon and Google. Because Roku's hardware isn't that distinguishable from the stuff made by Apple, Amazon and Google, this OTT streaming device fight may come down to who has the best marketing campaign. Considering Apple, Amazon and Google each have more than $10 billion in cash on their balance sheets, if this competition does boil down to marketing and advertising, ROKU could end up being eaten alive by competitors who simply outspend ROKU. In this sense, ROKU isn't the next Netflix. Netflix was running in open fields in the streaming video world for a long time before legitimate competitors showed up. That isn't the case with ROKU. Big competitors already are here.Something that is often ignored is that Roku also is competing with Facebook (FB), Google, Snap (SNAP), Twitter (TWTR) and others for ad dollars. Granted, there's a massive shift in ad dollars away from traditional TV, and that massive shift should create a rising tide that lifts all boats. But all the major social media players are building out video functionality in their platforms and are rolling out or have already rolled out video ad capability. Consequently, ROKU is competing for the same digital video ad dollars as Facebook, Google, Snap and Twitter. In this sense, its equally tough to see ROKU's ARPU trending up $25 over the next five years. Just like it is on the accounts front, competition is stiff on the advertising front. In totality, we understand the bull thesis on ROKU stock. We do see a potential pathway for this company to ride secular OTT media consumption and digital advertising tailwinds and more than double its value over the next several years. But that pathway is clouded with competitive risks, and we believe a plausible outcome for ROKU is that it gets eaten alive by competitors like GPRO or FIT. All in all, we remain on the sidelines with this name. There's simply too much risk and not enough clarity regarding a long-term outlook. Owning ROKU alongside owning AAPL, AMZN, GOOG and FB is not a bad move (the two groups can hedge one another), but owning it alone seems an unnecessarily risky at this point in time."
4149409,103709,2018-02-22T11:33:20-05:00,"Roku took a nasty tumble on earnings - down 21% after hours.Their results aren't bad - users are up 44% y/y and ARPU is up 48% y/y.The market took issue with the 2018 outlook, but that outlook is in line with my past projections.I am taking this drop as a chance to buy back into Roku with a target price of ~ $50/share.","On Wednesday, Roku (ROKU) announced their fourth quarter 2017 results. The street was very unhappy with those results - shares dropped from $51 at close to $40, losing ~ 21%.I purchased Roku back in November for ~ $41, after publishing an article on Seeking Alpha. I sold those shares in December when they hit $54, reaching my target price. Based on today's large drop, I have again purchased shares in Roku, at a price of $40.40 each. I value shares of Roku at ~ $50/share and believe that the company offers strong long-term prospects in the growing streaming industry.Roku is well-positioned in a growing segment. Television viewing is increasingly moving to streaming rather than using traditional cable or satellite providers. Netflix (NFLX) is the current leader in this market, but Disney's (DIS) upcoming streaming entities (including ESPN) will also grow the streaming market.As more viewers become cord-cutters, more television viewing will be done through an OTT box, such as Roku, Google Chromecast (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon Fire TV (AMZN), and Apple TV (AAPL). I expect these OTT boxes to be of less and less importance as time passes - more users will have Smart TVs that offer their own streaming support and will no longer require these boxes. The leaders in television platforms are Google and Roku - neither Amazon nor Apple offer their software to television manufacturers.Roku will benefit from these secular tailwinds, if they can continue to compete effectively with Google. Google is currently positioned as the operating system of choice for higher-end televisions (e.g., Sony, Visio, Toshiba), while Roku is the operating system of choice for lower-end televisions (e.g., Sharp, TCL, Hisense, and Insignia).Roku's quarterly results were pretty good, in my view. Player revenue dropped 7% y/y. That drop is not particularly concerning: Roku's future earnings will depend on their platform (advertising) revenue rather than on their player revenue. Players are sold approximately at-cost to grow the Roku platform.As Roku continues to grow its platform, the most important metrics - in my view - will be active users and average revenue per user (""ARPU""). The former will show that Roku is able to grow its user base in the face of stiff competition from Google, Amazon, and Apple. The latter will show that Roku is able to effectively monetize that user base. Platform revenue is the more important form of revenue, as it is the combination of active users and ARPU. And it is showing great growth. Active accounts grew to 19.3 million, up 26% q/q and 44% y/y. Platform revenue grew to $85 million for the quarter, up 129% y/y, and up 49% q/q (but with seasonality - the fourth quarter is the best quarter of the year). Annual ARPU increased to $13.78/user, up 9% q/q and up 48% y/y. Streaming hours increased even faster than the user count at Roku - up 55% y/y. Rather than Roku users slowly moving away from the platform, users are embracing the platform and per-user streaming is increasing.Importantly, Roku noted that more than half of new accounts in the quarter came from licensed sources, with the largest portion and fastest-growing portion coming from purchasers of Roku TVs. I expect this trend to continue - set-top boxes will diminish in importance as more and more smart TVs are shipped.Active users and ARPU are both similar to my projections from back in November - active users are a bit lower than I expected, while ARPU is a bit higher than I expected. But the overall story is the same: Roku is a growth company in a growing market. Its user base is growing, and it is making more and more money from each of those users, as video advertisers switch from traditional television to streaming content.Roku 2018 projections. Source.Roku's drop can be attributed to its forecasts, especially those for Q1 2018. Roku projected $125 million revenue (midpoint), while Yahoo Finance lists analyst expectation of $132 million (average). Roku's FY 2018 outlook for $675 million earnings compares favorably to that of analysts, who expected $662 million on average. Personally, I am not particularly troubled by these expectations - my article in November projected FY 2018 earnings of $655 million. Roku also beat my Q4 2017 revenue projections: I projected $183 million while Roku generated $188.3 million in revenue.The largest risk for Roku is their competition with Google. Neither Apple nor Amazon currently compete directly with Roku TV, which I see as the future of the company. This will be a David and Goliath fight - a $5 billion Roku will continue to compete with the $750 billion Alphabet.But that is the fight that Roku has been waging since they first launched a device in 2008. Roku was not first to the market - Apple TV had already launched over a year earlier. From the very beginning, Roku has been battling companies much larger than itself. Despite that, it has carved out the largest market share in the OTT market - beating out its three enormous competitors.Source: Parks Associates.Roku will need to continue to fight these companies in order to succeed. But from their past growth and their current strong market position, there is little reason to suspect that Roku will fail to compete with their larger peers.Another risk to Roku is that the streaming market will become more concentrated. Roku makes platform revenue from advertising, including a home screen advertisement, and video advertisements in certain apps (see the Roku Direct Publisher Monetization Guide). Notably, Roku does not make significant revenue from some of the largest streaming apps, including Netflix and Youtube. I do not expect Roku to make much money from users streaming Disney's streaming offerings, either. None of these apps include Roku-served advertisements, which means Roku makes very little from them.Thus, if streaming becomes more centralized - and a higher proportion of user time is spent on these large streamers - Roku's ARPU could fall. Roku doesn't break out its advertising earnings, but the bulk of those earnings come from video advertisements that are played in certain channels. Other advertisements - such as the advertising background images on the Roku start page - are a much smaller contributor to the bottom line. However, the status quo is already baked into Roku's current ARPU. The annual ARPU of $13.78 already includes the current level of user Netflix and Youtube streaming. Unless those levels increase - as a percentage of user streaming time - Roku can continue to increase its revenue per user. I expect that as streaming becomes more and more prevalent, the streaming landscape will become more fractured, with the larger players commanding less market share. This is comparable to the rise of cable television and declining network TV ratings - as viewers had more and more options, the percentage of viewers watching network television declined significantly.Thus, I expect that Roku will be able to overcome both of these risks. Roku has always competed with Google, and there's no reason to suspect they'll be unable to compete effectively with Google in the future. And as the streaming market grows - a secular tailwind for the company - I expect it to become more and more fractured. The growth of smaller streamers - more likely to offer advertising-supported content and therefore add to Roku's revenue - will also be a tailwind for the company.The market hated Roku's fourth quarter earnings and its projections for 2018. I am less concerned with those figures than the market. The streaming video market has secular tailwinds that will last for years - the switch from cable/satellite to internet-based video is unlikely to reverse itself. Roku is well-positioned to take advantage of that market, with their strong software suite and their integration with numerous television manufacturers.I value shares of Roku at ~ $50/share, based on my DCF model. Roku will need to compete with Google - and potentially other behemoths - in order to survive and compete, but its past success shows that Roku is capable of doing just that.I will gladly take this opportunity to buy back into Roku for ~ $40/share, after having previously sold for $54.Thanks for reading!** Author's note: If you enjoyed this article, please hit ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of the page.

4137948,62863,2018-01-17T05:52:37-05:00,"Yesterday, I watched Mike Kramer's Idea of the Month on Cheddar TV. I agree with his bearish thesis.
        Incidentally, on Market Adventures, I highlighted ROKU, on January 10th, as a possible short. Shares were trading at $45 then.
        Post the 180 day IPO lockup, there are 84 million Series B shares owned by insiders and private equity with a weighted average cost of $2.55.","Yesterday, I watched fellow Marketplace Author (Mott Capital), Mike Kramer's Idea of the Month, to sell (short) Roku Inc. (ROKU). I agree with Mike's bearish read on the fundamentals and its stretched valuation. Incidentally, on January 10th, on Market Adventures, I highlighted ROKU as a possible short, as well as another company (which I will not share on the free site).Let's start with valuation. ROKU is trading at 6.5X sales. Consensus estimates are only calling for 30% revenue growth and despite this growth, ROKU is projected to have negative net income in FY 2018. Source: Yahoo FinanceThe company has only had one public earnings release and the company had a loss from operations of $29.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. On a year over year basis, for the nine month period, ROKU grew revenue 29.1%, or by $73 million, yet its loss from operations only improved by $17.6 million. So at what revenue number does this business profitably scale? From valuation standpoint, it is really hard to consider a market capitalization of $4.3 billion for a company projected to lose money in FY 2018. Is this stock trading based on FY 2020 estimates?So we covered that Roku (ROKU) is overvalued. However, let's look at the upcoming dilution, as this is much more interesting. According to the company's S-1/A, and this is downright offensive, the cost bases for ROKU's Series B shares are incredibly low. The company has 84.3 million Series B shares outstanding with a cost basis of $2.55. Keep in mind ROKU's stock closed yesterday at $39. Source: ROKU S-1/A (pg. 54) Here is greater detail on the cost basis for private equity and insiders. So 47.6 million shares have a cost basis under $1. Hmm, I wonder if these people are counting the days to post 180 day lock up expiration. Source: ROKU's Q3 2017 10-Q (pg. 12)To add insult to injury, as you can see in the fine print, there about 27 million options and warrants with super low cost bases. Look at ROKU's latest 10-Q. So its fully diluted share count is north 110 million shares. Source: ROKU 10-Q (pg. 17)22.3 million shares worth of options have a weighted average size price of $3.66 and the rest under $8 per share. Who is going to absorb the major increase in ROKU share supply, when the Series B shares start getting sold? So 110 million shares x $39 per share is a nearly $4.3 billion market capitalization. The company went pubic on September 29, 2017, so the 180 day IPO lock up isn't until March 30, 2018. Short Interest - Per the WSJ, as of 12/29/2017, there were 6.558 million shares sold short. Per the company's 10-Q:So the company's glossy press releases combined with high short interest and a small float (6.558 million shares sold short vs. 18.1 million shares outstanding (until the Series B are eligible for sale)) is a major reason why ROKU's stock has done so well. If you are long shares of ROKU do you feel good about the fact that insiders and private equity own more than 84 million Series B shares with a cost basis of $2.55? This is clearly spelled out in the S-1, and ROKU's Q3 2017 10-Q. Moreover, I would argue, these folks are pigs at the proverbial trough and granted themselves millions of more options with a cost basis (mostly) under $8. No question ROKU is a great short, the only question is how do you size it as I'm sure management will have some tricks up their sleeves just ahead of the 180 day IPO lock up. Moreover, the current limited float of 18 million combined with 6.5 million shares sold short will continue to point to lots of volatility. So putting it all together, we are look at a highly valued business, with question barriers to entry and that has super low cost basis Series B shares and options waiting in the wings to, eventually, be sold. Readers may recall that I was super bearish on Fitbit (FIT) and on November 3, 2015 wrote: Hedge Funds Will Make Billions Shorting Fitbit. Shares of Fitbit were then trading at $38. Roku is similar to Fitbit in that the valuation was stretched and there were millions of super low cost shares eagerly waiting to be cashed out by insiders and private equity sponsors."
4136230,103262,2018-01-09T12:04:26-05:00,"An underpriced IPO created both a stock spike and now huge short interest.ROKU is a platform company, not a hardware company, and that business is looking very good.Valuation calls are pouring in as price targets are hiked - there is a bullish thesis, but the stock rose quickly.","By Ophir GottliebRoku Inc. (ROKU) is a Spotlight Top Pick, one of the riskiest we have in the portfolio, and a wave of downgrades has pushed the stock lower. Let's review the downgrades, the bullish thesis, and what may be coming for the stock.ROKU was added as Spotlight Top Pick on 11-28-2017 for $47, and as of this writing, it is trading at $46.28 after rising to over $58. The company, already, has a bizarre history as a public company, even though it just IPO'd on 28 Sept. 2017.The IPO price was set far too low - this is a trick the large banks do to enrich their wealthiest clients and steal money from unwitting founders.The company [read ""the banks""] priced its 18 million share offering at $14 per share, and on the very first day, it rose 67%. That means the founder shares that were sold in that IPO were set too low, while the bank's clients that bought in for $14 made a killing.As of today, we're looking at a $46 price - yet more evidence of a wildly underpriced offering.Now, it's of no real consequence to us as investors except for one stark reality - when a stock is underpriced so wildly at IPO, a wave of buying comes in, which inevitably leads to a wave of short selling and that's exactly what we see with ROKU right now.ROKU's short interest started at 4.1 million shares on 10-13-2017 and rose all the way up to 7.7 million shares by 11-30-2017. Here is a little table from NASDAQ.com:Now, we do see a slight dip as of 12-15-2017, but still, with float of just 17.44 million shares, we now see a short float as a percentage of total float of over 40%. That is a ""wow.""For a little bit of perspective, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a 2.82% short percentage of float, and even Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), with that huge bearish call from Citron Research has a 1.21% short percentage of float.So, yes, 40%+ is enormous.While Wall Street was actually fairly bullish this name for $14, with price targets coming out in the $25-35 range, with the stock at $46, the banks are chirping.On January 4th, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Ben Swinburne cut his rating on Roku from equal weight to underweight, and, now read this carefully, while increasing his price target from $25 to $30.On January 5th, Citi (NYSE:C) joined Morgan Stanley with a downgrade of Roku's stock from Neutral to Sell, with a price target raised from $27 to $28.So, we see two price target increases, while still seeing necessary downgrades given that the targets are well below the current price.Morgan Stanley had this to say about its downgrade while increasing the price target (our emphasis is added):So, again, it's not a matter of growth potential or even growth expectations, but it is very much a case of the stock, in their opinion, having risen too far too fast.Citi's coverage was similar, in that it simply noted the valuation, while also noting that ROKU is ""one of the most well-known"" brands in the over-the-top video streaming space and its ad revenue growth rate could grow by 82 percent in 2018.We also note that the company itself said out loud, ""Further, we receive no revenue from YouTube, the most viewed ad-supported channel by hours streamed on our platform for fiscal 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2017.""The bullish thesis behind ROKU is well laid out in our Top Pick dossier, The Tech Gem Looking to Dominate Streaming Video.We follow themes, and one of the most powerful we research is that of streaming video on demand or SVOD. This theme has also given rise to the cord-cutting phenomenon.The SVOD theme really became possible with the advent of the DVR - the ability to pause and record live TV and save it for later. The inventor of the DVR is none other than Anthony Wood, who is also the founder and CEO of Roku.Here is a look at the SVOD theme:Worldwide revenue from just this segment will grow from $12.4 billion in 2015 to nearly $27 billion within five years.The reality is that the penetration rate - that is actual users - is still low and has room for tremendous growth. This is again from Statista.We are below 25% in the United States, with the trend growing:Just to show how crowded the field is, here is a chart that shows the share of viewers who use selected video streaming and download services in the United States in 2017.Keep in mind, this is before Disney (NYSE:DIS) releases its massive competitor product which will include Marvel, Star Wars, Disney, Pixar, and much more content from ABC, ESPN, etc.The various SVOD content providers are in a war - to buy content, to buy users, to keep users, to differentiate. Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon Prime Video (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Hulu are at war with each other, as they are with other over the top (OTT) video services like those coming from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (YouTube), Disney, and many others.That battle doesn't interest us - what we are after is the operating system, the guts, that will house all of it. And this is where Roku exists. Each of these over the top content providers are available with Roku hardware or software.Many of us know Roku as a piece of hardware, but that is barely scratching the surface of what this company is doing. In fact, if we look at a chart of revenue by source (from Recode), we can see where the company is going - this is hardware revenue: As of Sep. 2, 2017Now that looks bad until we look at platform revenue and gross profit (from the same source): As of Sep. 2, 2017And then we can turn to the number of accounts that have streamed content in the last 30 days:As of Sep. 2, 2017ROKU is generating an average of $11.22 in service revenue for each one of them, up from $4.65 per user three years ago.The CEO noted that TV and TV advertising is in a massive shift to streaming and billions of dollars are moving to new platforms and services. When the Internet disrupts large existing businesses, the opportunity emerges to create a new large-scale platform. That is what Roku is, the leading platform for streaming TV in the U.S.In fact, Roku's primary driver of gross profit is its advertising, audience development, and content distribution services it reports in its Platform segment. In the letter to shareholders, the company noted that 89% of gross margins come from this segment.The last earnings call also gave us some updated data. The CEO described the company on its latest earnings call, intertwined with usage metrics. We start with one startling comment (our emphasis added):And then this broad statement that touches exactly on the Roku bullish narrative (our emphasis is added):And then this:* Almost 90% of our gross profit comes from our advertising, audience development, and content distribution services in our platform segment. This segment is driving our strong gross profit and revenue growth.* The platform segment grew 137% this quarter, and our ad business, which contributed two-thirds of our platform revenue, grew even faster.* Our value proposition to content publishers and advertisers is clear. Roku is a large-scale platform that monetizes the hard-to-reach and valuable TV streaming audience. Many streamers started their OTT experience with ad-free services like Netflix, but ad-supported content is the fastest growing segment on the Roku platform and free is one of our most popular searched terms.There is a lot more to this company than hardware sales. It is in the fast lane themes of ad sales and platform revenue. Hardware is good, but it is not the growth engine, and will not be.Wall Street is worried. With the stock up so much so fast, it should be - at least for the short-term. And friends, I am comfortable with a prognostication, this is going to get bumpy for the stock. And oh my, the headlines will read bloody murder.Downgrades will come - they tend to do this in bunches, so Morgan Stanley and Citi may be the beginning, not the end. It's perfectly reasonable to reconsider the timing of a new stock position. If ROKU is keeping you up at night, or if it goes down to $30 and that would keep you up at night, maybe it's not right for your portfolio at the current time. There is no shame in that.But, we are looking well beyond the next few years with Roku - toward a tectonic shift away from linear TV, where streaming is everything. A world where content is so rich, that Netflix, Amazon, Google, Disney, Apple, and many others will compete for eyeballs, while Roku simply gives them access to the eyeballs.It's no certainty that Roku will win, but we try to find companies that are ahead of the curve that play a vital role in the guts of technological themes, and for now, we see Roku as one of those small companies with the potential to grow substantially.We're not sure Wall Street understands the company, but when we look under the hood, we see a robust hardware, advertising, and platform business. We see a company that happily gives up gross margin on hardware, because the real gold mine is simply getting people to stream video - because, in the company's view, there is a very good chance they will be streaming with Roku powering the platform.Thanks for reading, friends.Legal The information contained on this site is provided for general informational purposes, as a convenience to the readers.

4135002,67473,2018-01-03T07:03:17-05:00,,"By VW Staff Barac Capital Management letter to investors for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.Dear All,This is the Fund’s twentieth regular quarterly report to provide updates on the Partnership’s performance. The Partnership’s Fund administrator, Fund Associates, LLC, is also generating monthly investment reports for each Partner, by directly and independently accessing the Fund’s electronic brokerage data.For the three months ending December 31, 2017, the Barac Value Fund L.P. (the “Fund” or “Partnership”) delivered net returns of 6.9% (after the deduction of management fees) versus a return of 4.1% for the benchmark1.Since the Partnership’s inception (on July 14, 2011), the Fund has returned 86.2% (after deducting management fees) versus a return of 80.7% for the benchmark, resulting in relative outperformance of 556 basis points.Gross and net annualized returns for the Fund since inception amounted to 11.3% and 10.1%, respectively, versus a return of 9.6% for the benchmark.For the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2017, returns for the Fund amounted to 7.3% on a gross basis and 6.9% on a net basis (after management fees), compared to 4.2% for the benchmark. The Fund's quarterly performance also outperformed both the benchmark’s equity2 (up 6.6% quarter-to-date) and fixed-income3 (up 0.4%) subcomponents.As always, it is important to re-state that the Fund’s returns were generated without leverage (either direct or effective leverage through options), without taking highly concentrated positions, and while conservatively holding substantial cash and/or Treasury bond positions. I also continue to “put my money where my mouth is” and most of my liquid net worth also remains invested in the Fund along with the other Partners.It should also be noted that going forward (as of January 1, 2018) the Partnership’s management fee was reduced from 1.50% to 0.95%/annum4. This brings the Fund’s fees in line with Barac Capital’s new separately-managed-account offering (launched in April of 2017), which is important in the interest of fairness and consistency. I believe that high fee levels continue to be one of the most value destructive components of the investment management industry (particularly for hedge funds) and I intend to keep ours below industry norms.The Fund’s outperformance for the quarter was driven by individual security selections. Top individual contributors for the period included Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) (+88.0% from entry price to quarter-end), Under Armour (NYSE:UA) (+25.0% from entry price to quarter end), Home Depot (NYSE:HD) (+16.5%), and Target (NYSE:TGT) (+11.7%). The only two negative return performers for the quarter were Adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY) (-11.8%) and AMC Networks (NASDAQ:AMCX) (-7.5%).The contribution of Roku was particularly strong. The Fund purchased shares of Roku in October, following an earnings report which gave me more optimism in the company’s growth prospects. More specifically, it gave me more confidence in Roku’s ability to monetize their leading operating system for “over-the-top“ television (viewing which doesn’t require a cable/satellite subscription: e.g. Netflix, Hulu, etc.). Subsequent to this purchase, investor sentiment for the company improved substantially and the share price increased by about 88% (as measured at the end of the quarter).While I remained optimistic on Roku’s prospects and believed the company’s shares continued to offer good value, I also believed that the recent price runup had somewhat reduced the attractiveness of the share’s risk/reward dynamics (as more speculative growth was priced into the stock). For this reason, and in order to re-adjust position sizing, the number of shares held by the Fund was subsequently reduced by about 50% (at price levels 65% above the Fund’s entry price).While Roku was the largest contributor to quarterly performance, the Fund’s other positions also performed well during the quarter and the Fund would have comfortably outperformed its benchmark without any contribution from Roku. As of the end of the quarter, Roku accounted for approximately 2.2% of the Partnership’s Assets-Under-Management (“A.U.M”).As of the end of December, the Partnership remained underweight equities (at 58% of A.U.M. versus 60% for the benchmark) and fixed-income (at 36% of A.U.M. versus 40% for the benchmark) and held a cash balance of 6% of A.U.M. In order to mitigate against credit and interest rate risks, all of the Fund’s fixed-income positions remain in U.S. Treasuries with a maturity of less than 5 years.I do remain generally cautious with regard to “risk assets” (stocks and corporate bonds). This is more a result of market risk factors rather than concerns with respect to current equity valuation multiples. At the end of the quarter, I believe that the equity risk premium remains reasonable - with a forward earnings’ yield on the S&P 500 index of 5.0% versus a 2.4% yield for 10-year Treasuries.What does concern me, however, is the earnings part of the price/earnings equation and the increasing risk that some of the contributors to current (high) profit margins could come under pressure. Earnings’ levels now reflect low interest rates (and low credit spreads), low wage growth, and the positive wealth effect of 8 years of rising stock prices and home values.As we approach full employment and some of the government’s pro-growth policies come into effect, there is a heightened risk of wage pressure and increased interest rates with increased inflation. Furthermore, current valuations appear to incorporate little with respect to geo-political risks at a time when there is much political change and uncertainty. It also warrants bearing in mind that if/when the business cycle does turn (and assets prices fall), a resulting “reverse wealth effect” could exacerbate the impact of a cyclical downturn.For all of these reasons, the Partnership remains more defensively positioned than its benchmark (which, itself, reflects a conservative asset allocation). This is reflected in the fact that 42% of the Fund’s A.U.M. are either in cash or U.S. Treasuries with maturities of less than 5 years5. While a defensive positioning has somewhat constrained performance returns over the past year, I am willing to sacrifice some upside potential as capital preservation remains paramount to the Fund’s investment strategy.To be clear, the Partnership’s defensive positioning is in place in order to mitigate against market risks and not based on the expectation for an imminent fall in equity prices. In fact, I believe that the current uptrend in the equity market could continue for a while. Furthermore, I believe that the Fund’s equity holdings include idiosyncratic value opportunities (for specific stocks) that are superior to those of the equity markets as a whole.Thank you to everyone for your interest and support and please let me know if there are any questions you may have that I haven’t answered. The next quarterly report will be for the quarter ending March 31st, 2018, and the next subscription period for the Fund will be on January 31st.Sincerely,Ted BaracManaging Member of Barac Capital Management, LLC.See the full PDF below.Disclosure: None."
4137103,26861,2018-01-12T02:35:57-05:00,"I added Roku to the LLGP in early December, and it has been a wild ride over the past month.While analysts have come out overly bearish in 2018, the stock is poised for further growth as the company scales.I find the clearest mistake out of recent commentary in comparing Roku to Netflix.","I purchased Roku (ROKU) on December 5th of last year at $41.39 per share. The decision to take an initial position was based upon a discounted free cash flow analysis where under the EBITDA method the stock was fairly valued at $43 per share. However, there was a disconnect as the perpetuity method yielded fair value closer to $33 per share.Despite the variance, I executed a small position to start with; in the event Roku displays weakness approaching the $35 or lower level, and I will average the position. This brings me to tonight's update topics.Roku appears to be misunderstood as many analysts and investors have different perspectives on the company's future. In a bull market that is gaining momentum, it is getting easier to champion companies with lofty valuations and questionable possibilities for success.As multiple large investment firms have downgraded Roku, the stock has dropped from $56 to below $44 per share. I am not concerned regarding this drop, nor do I feel that it is completely unjustified. The statement that has gotten under my skin though was the comment regarding Roku's valuation being lofty and the company not being as profitable as larger peers like Netflix (NFLX).I find this comment to be foolish as there are varying levels of profitability. While Netflix has been a success story, and it is the leading streaming platform today, the company has an unproven streaming business model. It is unproven by the fact that over the past trailing twelve-month period as of the September 2017 quarter, Netflix generated -$1.9 billion in operating cash flow.That's right, the company burned almost $2 billion just to operate its business. Now Netflix has seen strong net income and adjusted EBITDA growth of late, but it is typical for a company with growing profits to see improving cash flow. In Netflix's case, improving profit on an accrual basis has not translated to an improvement on cash operations.This has required Netflix to borrow more aggressively as debt-to-capital has increased from 27 to 60 percent since 2013. This increase is directly correlated to Netflix's substantial growth in both licensed and internally-developed streaming content.Netflix has amassed a substantial number of subscribers, at nearly 110 million globally. For the U.S., the company has penetrated almost 53 million households. Roku recently reported that at year-end 2017, the company had achieved 19 million active accounts in the U.S. This reflected an increase of 42 percent from last year.I like this number because it was higher than my discounted cash flow analysis estimate, at 18.4 million. Despite analysts stating otherwise, Roku's business model is poised to become a cash generating stalwart in a much sooner time frame than Netflix. Over the past three quarters, Roku generated over $31 million in operating cash flow, with an approximately $25 million free cash flow mark. This was compared to the previous year's -$13 and -$20 million cash burns. Similarly, the company is on track to consistent positive EBITDA, possibly by 2018.The clear correlation driving improvements for both adjusted EBITDA and cash flows have been Roku's platform revenue, up over 100 percent this year alone. Some claim that Roku's hardware is easily competed against by larger companies, smart TVs being an example. However, I contend that Roku is the only platform offering access to any streaming channel whether free or premium through paid subscription.This approach as a universal platform for users to access all streaming content on the Internet is genius and a first-mover concept that has grown from zero to 19 million active accounts. I am projecting Roku to hit 33 million active accounts by 2022. I am also projecting the company to be generating nearly $1.5 billion in revenue, $200 million-plus in unlevered free cash flow and adjusted EBITDA approaching $250 million.Judging from Roku's recently announced active account growth, my numbers may be conservative, which is just how I would prefer it be.While these numbers seem small compared with Netflix's billions in revenue, Roku is poised to outperform Netflix on an EBITDA margin level, and to substantially outperform the company from a cash flow perspective over the near term.We must also remember that Netflix is aggressively developing its own content because the company knows that competition from multiple streaming services will only grow further as time goes by. Conversely, this will only add to Roku's platform and scale, especially as other content aggregators will continue to develop streaming hardware products, selectively partnering with streaming subscription services, and not including the universe of all streaming content.Dare I say history is repeating itself where distribution of content is being revisited through streaming; only this time, instead of cable and satellite aggregating all the content, it is Roku. Maybe one day, Roku itself will begin to acquire and/or develop its own content. That will likely be triggered once a true competitor enters the space, as cable companies took this approach years ago. Interestingly, now cellular companies like AT&T (T) are acquiring content developers.The stock is going to continue to be volatile over the short term. As analysts attempt to push the stock price down, positive announcements will likely propel it higher. I am not a buyer in the low $40s as I initiated at this level. In fact, I would not be surprised to see the stock gyrate from the low $40s to $50s. However, if the stock were to weaken from further downgrades towards the $35 price, it would become highly attractive. It is tough to see this happening in today's market, so $40 or so may be as low as it gets."
4149960,103262,2018-02-23T09:18:35-05:00,"As of now, by user count, ROKU would be the third largest cable provider in the country behind just Comcast and AT&T.The number of accounts for ROKU rose 44% while Comcast and AT&T are essentially flat.Advertising business is booming, accounting for 75% of platform revenue versus 66% in the previous quarter.U.S advertisers spend $70 billion a year on TV - and streaming video is the new black.Every ad on ROKU is a one-on-one ad targeted to that specific customer. Now, compare that to cable TV.","By Ophir GottliebRoku Inc. (ROKU) released earnings after the close of the market on 2-21-2018, and while the market has pushed the stock down, the results, in our option, were breathtakingly good.ROKU is building a business based on users, and if we measured it as a cable provider, as of right now, it would be the third largest cable provider in the country behind just Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and AT&T (NYSE:T) - that's how many people and how much content they serve, already.Further, the number of accounts for ROKU rose 44% while Comcast and AT&T are essentially flat. All of this is driven by the large secular shift by consumers to streaming video and away from linear TV.Check out this video consumption pattern forecast:And then straight to SVOD revenue forecasts.The penetration rate of streaming video is growing in the United States, but is still below 25%:The various SVOD content providers are in a war - to buy content, to buy users, to keep users, to differentiate. Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hulu are at war with each other, as they are with other over-the-top (OTT) video services like those coming from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (YouTube), Disney (NYSE:DIS), and many others.That battle doesn't interest us - what we are after is the operating system, the guts that will house all of it. And this is where Roku exists. Each of these over-the-top (OTT) content providers are available with Roku hardware or software.The idea behind the business is to grow scale - to grow active accounts and to become the operating system of streaming TV. Yes, its goal, its future, is to be what Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was to PCs and what Apple is to smartphones - the platform, the operating system, for the booming industry that is Streaming Video on Demand (SVOD).Or, as the CEO said in the earnings call:And the company has done so in spades. Not only did ROKU report a stunning 44% growth in account accounts in Q4 but also an average revenue per user (ARPU) growth of 48%. These are gigantic numbers.The CEO said, on the earnings call (our emphasis added):While the company's hardware revenue was down, and that has Wall Street spooked, that was very much on purpose. As the CEO said out loud on CNBC, the company lowered prices on its players to increase volume. It's still a gross margin positive business, but hardware is simply one conduit to more users.Executives cut the price for one of Roku's top-end models to $100 from $130, for example, and released a budget $30 version called the Roku Express. Again, this was done on purpose. Hardware is a customer-acquisition strategy, not a profit center in and of itself.Even further, the company noted that for the first time, platform revenue will make up the majority of the company's overall revenue throughout 2018. In fact, platform gross profit grew 120% year-over-year to $63.7 million and represented 87% of total gross profit in Q4, up from 65% last year.The company gets new users by selling players, licensing players, and licensing the operating system. As for other financial metrics, the company's guidance, at its mid-point, is a gross profit rise of fully 56% year-over-year.Roku's license sources delivered more than half of the company's new user growth in the fourth quarter.ROKU has access to treasure trove of data and as a distributor of content and an advertiser, data is a key part of that business in the modern world. While ad revenue and content redistribution revenue are the focus, the data behind it is extremely powerful and is a moat that a linear TV cable provider simply does not have.Think about this, and this is straight from the CEO: ""Every ad on ROKU is a one-on-one ad targeted to that specific customer."" Now, compare that to cable TV. It's almost an unfair advantage that streaming has over linear television, but there it is.And the results: advertising remains the largest component of platform revenue, accounting for 75% of that segment, versus 66% in the previous quarter. As for scale, try this on for size:U.S advertisers spend $70 billion a year on TV, according to ROKU CEO Anthony Wood.Or how about this: four-years ago, ROKU had 0% of the market, and as of last year, 1 out of every 5 televisions used the ROKU operating system for streaming. This is much more of a software company than a hardware company, irrespective of where revenue sits today.Now, let's turn to the earnings results and the earnings call:* Revenue: $188.3 million from $147.3 million in the year-ago period, beating analysts' average expectations of $182.5 million.* EPS: $0.06 profit versus analyst expectations of a -$0.10 per share loss.* Guidance: Full-year revenue of $660 million to $690 million versus estimates of $661.5 million.Full-year losses of $40 million to $55 million versus analyst expectations of $35.9 million.Here are the highlights we focused on:* The shift to streaming is creating huge opportunities for Roku.* Active accounts grew 44% for the year.* ARPU increased 48% year-over-year to $13.78 on a trailing 12-month basis with more than two-thirds of ARPU coming from advertising.* The largest driver of ARPU growth is video advertising.* We are also seeing very rapid growth from our audience development ads which are endemic display ads.* Our Roku TV program had exceptional performance, one in five smart TV sold in the U.S in 2017 was Roku TV.* Our investment and being the leading TV OS is paying off.* We're increasingly tapping into the $70 billion U.S advertisers spend on TV as the TV ad ecosystem moves to streaming.* More than half of the Ad Age's top 200 advertise on the Roku platform.* Q4 gross profit increased 64% year-over-year to $73.5 million.* Platform gross profit grew 120% year-over-year to $63.7 million and represented 87% of total gross profit in Q4, up from 65% last year.We loved the quarter ROKU had, see quite clearly that its actual hardware, which still turns a profit, is not the focus other than as a conduit to get its operating system out there and its account numbers up.Combine that hardware effort with licensing, and ROKU's growth is something to behold in a cable industry that is flat, at best, and shrinking at worst. Yes, ROKU saw 44% account growth as the cable providers are seeing cord cutting hurt their business.Advertising is a fantastic business - just ask Google (the largest advertising platform in the world and the second largest company in the world by market cap) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (the second largest ad platform in the world and the sixth largest company by market cap in the world).We maintain our Spotlight status on ROKU and our long-term bullish thesis was confirmed, for now, with the latest earnings release.Thanks for reading, friends.LegalThe information contained on this site is provided for general informational purposes, as a convenience to the readers.

4131784,22675,2017-12-14T06:51:31-05:00,"Roku's valuation is impossible to justify given its growth prospects. The company relies on sales of players and online platform sales which are mainly advertising.Given the level of competition, Roku will likely need to sell players at a loss in an effort to increase its market share.Competing in the online/video ad space market will translate into much slower growth and lower margins than the market has currently priced in.","Roku (ROKU) is one of those companies that looks terrific on the surface because it has a very strong presence in the fast-growing move away from cable. Dig a little bit deeper though, and you find a company that will face massive competition in its main segments. This makes it impossible to justify its current valuation.Roku's two main sources of revenues are its sales of players and its online platform. On the player side, as you know, Roku held a big first mover advantage compared to many of its competitors, but that edge is quickly disappearing as Google (Chromecast), Amazon (FireTV), Apple (AppleTV) storm ahead. Not only does that put pressure on sales, but as those ecosystem players have shown time and time again, they are not focused on short-term profits and are more than happy to lose money on sales of those devices in order to continue building a stronger relationship with their customers. Amazon and Google are extremely aggressive in their and that is showing up in the numbers, even in the US:December 2016:credit: Comscorecredit: QuartzI'd argue that Roku is probably selling more devices as the market continues to grow, but is losing market share and seeing lower margins. The market growth will slow down in the near future and when that happens revenues and profits out of the player segment will dry up quickly. Roku knows as much as CEO Anthony Wood mentioned in the most recent earnings call: ""One way to think -- one way I think about it is that both of those sources of new accounts are in essence negative customer acquisition cost""It's All About The PlatformRoku was smart to focus on its platform as a new way to generate revenues and that has been a massive success as platform revenues increased 137% y/y in Q3 to $57,528M, 46% of its overall revenues. That growth is likely to remain strong for the next few quarters as its Roku channel continues to gain ground. While I do think it will generate growth, I can't exactly match Roku's CEO vision- ""Microsoft Windows became the OS for PCs mainframe operating systems, Android and iOS became the operating system for phones, not Windows, we believe Roku is very well-positioned to maintain its lead as the OS for TV streaming"". Roku is losing ground in terms of market share for its player, has no exposure for its channel on other platforms which is unlikely to change. Why? Because despite recent comparisons to Netflix, ROKU is nothing close to a competitor. It does not produce original content (while Netflix is quickly approaching a $10 billion annual spend) and is merely a platform where users can see free content in exchange for seeing ads. Being free is a huge part of Roku Channel's appeal: ""Free is one of the top search terms on our website. Consumers are looking -- when they move -- when consumers move to streaming, they -- obviously they want a better experience, but they're also looking for better value. And so that -- so free is important and The Roku Channel really addresses that"" - CEO Anthony Wood.So, Roku basically does not have a presence on competing platforms such as Apple TV, Chromecast, FireTV and on its own platform. It competes with paid services such as Netflix, Hulu and the upcoming Disney offering, but also free services such as Amazon Prime (free for Prime members), Youtube and Facebook Watch. That will translate into a big challenge in gaining market share, but also increase its advertising revenues. I don't see a MOAT for Roku that would justify getting a bigger share per view than players such as Youtube or Facebook watch that currently capture the overwhelming part of the online advertising market's growth.ROKU Lacks A Global ReachIf Roku intends on expanding its reach to offer a broader advertising reach, or to eventually be able to offer its own original content, it will be at a severe disadvantage compared with the 3 others that are competing not only in Europe, Asia and other developed economies, but also emerging markets which will offer great opportunities further down the road. ROKU does not currently have the reach or ability to compete on a global basis. This will hurt its future growth perspectives. According to Google trends, the only country outside the US where Roku has a dominant position is Poland. Apple and Google dominate the rest of the world with Amazon being a newer, but very aggressive player.Roku's Valuation In ContextAs I am writing this, Roku does not have a clear path to profitability in the next few months. This puts Roku in a tough position when competing with players that have extremely large pockets and are playing a 5-10 year game. I cannot justify ROKU's current valuation given its challenges in turning a profit and the fact that it's in an extremely competitive, low-margin business. ROKU's player revenues increased by 4% Y/Y, and while the platform revenues did grow by 137%, it is off of a much smaller base, and I am very skeptical advertising growth can remain high over the medium term. I do understand why management is focusing on that segment in its calls as the player's revenue seems even more doomed, but I'm not buying the long-term value.That is especially true when taking a look at the streaming hours which seem to have hit a plateau:credit:Jackdaw ResearchBy this time next year, ROKU's y/y revenue growth will likely be closer to 20. Roku will still be losing money consistently which will sound the alarms and send a lot of shareholders to the exit."

In short, I am a 34 year old semi-retired lawyer, currently working on building up a diversified portfolio of stocks that I believe in. I'm focused on long-term investments in companies which I believe are undervalued. For a bit more background on me and my investing style, I recommend you read Jonathan Cooper Portfolio Update: Estimating The Beta Of Airlines.In this article, I will give a brief overview of my non-ETF positions, and go into a bit more depth on my Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) holding, in light of the almost universally-negative opinions of Seeking Alpha contributors on Roku at its current valuation. I also entertain the idea of having a leveraged portfolio and my plans of being able to enter short positions in the new year after I switch brokerage accounts.This is my current portfolio, as of the end of trading on Nov. 30, 2017. In this chart, adjusted cost basis refers to the price I initially paid for my shares including commission, divided by the total number of shares I currently own. All my shares are on dividend reinvestment plans, so my cost basis for dividend-paying shares will change over time and won't track actual initial cost/share, but will track overall gains on the purchase.As shown, I achieved overall (weighted) results of 2.2% returns in stocks and 1.1% returns in ETFs. My ETF returns from EWC, VSS, and VWO were all weighed down by a strong US dollar this month. Thus, my holdings under-performed the US market as a whole, as measured by VTI and VB, which returned 3.1% and 3.0%, although they out-performed my actual ETF holdings, which are more global.As before, my Vanguard ETFs are tied down this year due to capital gains restrictions. I may or may not continue to own them in the future when those are lifted. I also won't go into too much detail on any of the ETF holdings, since they're fairly uninteresting: I treat STIP as a cash balance that pays a tiny dividend, and EWC is because I live in Canada and want some of my portfolio to be in Canadian dollars to reduce currency risk.Note that EWC is leaving the TD Ameritrade free ETF list in January, so I will sell my shares prior to that.I purchased shares in four companies this month. Two of these stocks were based on analysis that I read on Seeking Alpha, while two of them were based on my analysis, which I also posted on Seeking Alpha.ROKU Total Return Price data by YChartsRecro Pharma (REPH; Nov.: +11.7%, Since my purchase: +8.3%): I purchased Recro Pharma on the basis of Alpha Apache's excellent article, Recro Pharmaceuticals: Prescriptions For Pain Are A Prescription For Gain. In his article, he lays out his well-reasoned rationale for why Recro Pharma is undervalued. I enjoyed his article a lot and bought a small position in the company based on his research. I recommend reading his article.GGP, Inc. (GGP; Nov.: +20.8%, Since my purchase: -2.0%): I purchased GGP based on Vince Martin's $23 Isn't Going To Get It Done For GGP. This investment has yet to pay dividends (figuratively and literally, since it's a REIT with 3.8% yield), but I remain hopeful that Vince's thesis can prove correct. I also enjoyed Vince's article, as shown by my purchase of a small position in GGP, as my only REIT holding.Roku (ROKU; Nov.: +115%, Since my purchase: +7.3%): Earlier this month, I posted my article, Roku: Potential Acquisition Target With 33% Upside. My valuation of $54 is based on the idea that Roku's platform is valuable, although their actual hardware sales are not valuable. This valuation is primarily driven by the idea that there are only two competitors for Smart TV Operating Systems: Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Roku. While Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) both make streaming sticks, neither company has entered into the Smart TV OS market, and I expect that market to be much larger in the future than the streaming stick market.In short, streaming sticks are simply going to be built into televisions. People will not need a Smart TV when their television is already capable of streaming on its own. And Roku and Google are the only two players in that space, which will allow Roku to achieve a 30% market share and strong operating margins. This business is largely an advertising platform business, with smaller streaming apps [a majority of apps outside Netflix (NFLX), Amazon, YouTube and the like] using the Roku advertising platform to sell advertisements, so Roku gets a 30-40% cut of the revenue.Source: Roku Developer BlogMy valuation of Roku has proven quite controversial. Indeed, every Roku article since aside from mine since November 13 has been bearish on the company:I stand by my view of the company and the value of its streaming platform. I believe that streaming sticks will be a thing of the past as Smart TVs get more integrated. Further, Roku's efforts to monetize its users have been successful to date, with user numbers and revenue per user continuing to grow.Source: Company filingsRoku is not without risk. Five independent authors would not suggest that Roku is overpriced if the shares didn't have risk. To my eyes, the primary risk is that Roku will be out-competed by Google for the Smart TV OS market. This is a very real possibility: Google makes strong products and has beaten competitors before to get to where they are. Google also has extremely deep pockets and can spend almost unlimited money developing a top-quality TV operating system.Source: ComScoreDespite that, Roku has successfully defended its market share in the streaming stick business to date. Roku has also been able to be integrated onto approximately one in five new Smart TVs. I expect that Roku will continue to be able to succeed, and that Google and Roku will, together, become the dominant Smart TV operating systems. Time will tell if I am correct, or way off. Opinions are plainly very divided.To date, my Roku holding is up slightly, although shares are highly volatile, and I could easily lose all of those gains and more.GME data by YChartsGameStop (GME; Nov.: +0.2%, Since my purchase: +4.1%): I purchased GameStop based on research I conducted for my article, GameStop: Why I Bought This Dying Company. My basic thesis here is that GameStop isn't really dying as quickly as the market apparently believes that it is, and its cash flows (using a DCF model) exceed share prices. I value GameStop at $22/share.This opinion is not without its detractors, but Seeking Alpha commentators and contributors are considerably more split on GameStop than they are on Roku. During the latter half of this month, other GameStop coverage has been posted from both a bullish and a bearish point of view:While opinions are divided, I remain comfortable with my 1.2% position in GameStop, which is up slightly and will pay a healthy $0.38 dividend in December. We will see if the rumors of a strong holiday season are correct.ALK data by YChartsAlaska Airlines (ALK; Nov.: +4.8%, Since my purchase: -6.3%): Alaska had a strong month (as have most airlines), buoyed by news of decent traffic and a busy holiday season. I still believe everything I wrote most recently on the company, in Alaska Airlines: Tailwinds From Pilot Wage Arbitration Win and Alaska Air Had A Rough Q3, But Better Times Are Ahead.Southwest Airlines (LUV; Nov.: +12.6%, Since my purchase: +9.2%): Southwest also had a very strong month, and I continue to believe that the company will have a great 2018: Fuel Hedging Tailwinds Will Propel Southwest Airlines To A Great 2018. Southwest already has great margins, and their losing fuel hedges will burn off soon, enabling them to price more competitively for traffic or to increase margins, or both. Southwest is also paying a small dividend in Dec./Jan., which I will reinvest using a DRIP.Adobe (ADBE; Nov.: +3.6%, Since my purchase: +21.3%): Adobe had a reasonable month, although it gave back some gains late in November. This was perhaps in part due to the terrible performance of another subscription software company...Autodesk (ADSK; Nov.: -12.2%, Since my purchase: -8.3%): I am still evaluating the impact of Autodesk's quarterly results, but the market made its decision: Sell. The company is laying off 13% of its workers, or 1,150 people, in a restructuring plan. That is not inspiring, but the $150 million cost of the layoffs is significantly smaller than the $3 billion drop in market cap. I am still researching Autodesk and what impact these results have on my valuation of the company.KSU Total Return Price data by YChartsKansas City Southern (KSU; Nov.: 7.6%, Since my purchase: +9.0%): My only railroad stock had a strong month, although based on very little news. The railroad will pay a $0.36 dividend (1.4% yield) in January.Enerplus (ERF; Nov.: -0.7%, Since my purchase: +2.4%): Enerplus ended the month slightly down on very little news, likely due to movements in commodity prices. I recommend Kevin Hess's article, Enerplus Has Turned Completely Around from last month for more on the company (Seeking Alpha Pro required, I believe).Facebook (FB; Nov.: -1.6%, Since my purchase: -0.1%): Facebook was essentially flat this month. I purchased shares after doing research for my article Facebook: A Discounted Cash Flow Valuation. Facebook is, however, one of the shares I'm most likely to sell in the future, based on my continuing to update my model for the company. I may write more about this company in the future after I do more research.Edison International (EIX; Nov.: 1.7%, Since my purchase: +2.3%) and PG&E Corp. (PCG; Nov.: -6.1%, Since my purchase: -5.0%): I have some misgivings about these holdings, given my research into utilities for my article Buyer Beware: Utility Sector May Be Overpriced. I believe utilities as a whole are overpriced, and that may include both of these companies. I will research both companies further in the future, as well as other utilities for value. I like the sector as a safe, dividend-producing sector, but I want to ensure that I'm not purchasing assets that are overpriced relative to their cash flows and dividends. PG&E specifically warns of hundreds of millions in losses from wildfires, related lawsuits as well, which has hurt its price over the past month or two.At present, my portfolio is completely un-leveraged, and I hold no short positions, no options, and no positions on margins. However, I may revisit those choices in the future.Specifically, I continue to follow Dividend Sensei's series of articles on his portfolio, the most recent being Dividend Sensei's Portfolio Update 11: Riskapalooza. While I don't necessarily want a REIT-focused portfolio, or even a dividend-focused portfolio, I find his use of leverage intriguing and have been working on several models in Excel to back-test the returns of particular leveraged portfolios against the returns offered by unleveraged portfolios.On the short side, I am also intrigued by a few companies that I would like to short or purchase long-term puts on. A prime candidate here is Square (SQ), as I wrote about recently in Square: Time To Sell This Overvalued Company. However, to date, I do not have a margin- or option-capable account with sufficient funding, so I have made no actions on that front. Come the new year, however, I am considered the merits of maintaining a leveraged portfolio, but have not yet decided on it. I also anticipate that when I access a better brokerage with more world options, I will take another look at Wizz Air (OTCPK:WZZAF), which I wrote about in Wizz Air: DCF Shows 40% Upside On Eastern European Airline. When I have access to shares on the London Stock Exchange, I expect to open a position in Wizz Air, provided that prices are still favorable."
4129962,79445,2017-12-06T06:21:15-05:00,Discussion of Roku's recent news and events.A look at Roku in comparison to GoPro.A strategy for investing in Roku during volatile environments.,"My regular readers would surely know that as much as I LOVE my Roku devices, I strongly believed, and still do, that Roku (ROKU) as a company and as a stock are deeply overvalued. I initially went short Roku in the $25.50 range and closed most of my short positions for a profit in the $18 to $20 range over a very short period of time. I did maintain a small position, short stock going into ""earnings."" Unfortunately, for myself and the very many short sellers, logic did not take hold and ""less bad"" losses somehow doubled the stock from under $20 to over $40 per share. I got Roku'ed!If you need any more signs that newly issued tech IPOs are manipulated by greed or other motives, all you need to do is look at how quick the stock went from $39 to $50 per share on a report from an underwriter assigning a $50 price target to the stock.Of course, that did not last long and the stock has now delivered 25% losses in just a few days to anyone who bought in in the $50 range.Source: TradingView - Roku ChartIn either case, the company is now worth over $4 billion and has yet to turn a profit. As the days progress, I am ever more constantly reminded of the similarities between Roku and GoPro (GPRO). Source: TradingView - GoPro (GPRO)I was fortunate enough to be given a small allocation to the IPO which I loved picking up at the $24 IPO price. Immediately after the IPO launch we saw GoPro skyrocket to over $40 in initial trading. I did the ""right"" thing and sold my IPO shares at over $48 per share, more than doubling my initial investment, however only saw the stock go up to over $90 per share over the next two months in a world where GoPro could seemingly do no wrong.Remember the justifications? GoPro cameras were the most popular and everyone was going to have them, but more than that... ""GoPRO is a MEDIA company and not a hardware company.""There was the GoPro channel which was supposed to replace Google's YouTube (GOOG)(GOOGL) and we were all going to start watching other people's videos there.Then there was of course the drone phase too and we were all supposed to get a GoPro drone to go along with the GoPro camera and upload the content to the GoPro videos.Unfortunately, even though GoPro's revenues grew in the short term, it did not lead to sustainable profits. GoPro's stock fell over 90% from its peak to the current $8 or so per share, or about 30% of the IPO price. Even though revenue did grow, the valuations were sky high. More than that, the price per share started collapsing a full year before revenues peaked.Does this all sound a bit too familiar?Here with Roku we have a 15 year old hardware manufacturer which has yet to be profitable, but apparently after 15 years, everyone is now going to go out and buy a Roku device. More than that, underwriters and bullish analysts would want us to believe that Roku should not be treated as a hardware company but as a media company and thus valued at those higher valuations.Is it a media company?Yes, we have to give Roku credit, they do generate revenue from beyond the sale of the Roku devices. Roku does currently generate about 50% of their revenue from ""Platform"" revenue which is a mix of all revenue sources that are not the device.We have discussed this before but these are still largely related to the devices themselves. For instance, Roku charges companies for placement on the remote control for the Roku device. Roku further charges companies for advertising on the main Roku home screen which of course is limited in real estate.The true source of revenue which would make a bullish investor out of me would be sustainable, ongoing and increasing advertising revenue from the monetization of streaming hours.Yes, it is increasing? But the challenge is of course, there is not an ounce of proof that this will be sustainable.As we have discussed over the last few articles, I still see massive challenges to making Roku both a ""Must Have"" type of a device and one which is constantly used.Roku is currently a ""hot stock"" and thus one that gets both media attention and in turn incremental sales, just like GoPro did when it went public, or companies such as Shake Shack (SHAK), Pandora (P) and FitBit (FIT).The question is, will 95% of the new Roku users still use the box in the future? Keep in mind, as we have discussed on numerous occasions, Roku does not provide any exclusive content and the vast majority of the things you watch on your Roku device, you can watch WITHOUT the device. Furthermore, even if you do watch Netflix (NFLX), YouTube, Amazon (AMZN) or Hulu, Roku does not monetize that watch time as the big four will not allow Roku to place advertising in their paid services. The day Roku tries to place a commercials into my Netflix or Amazon streaming will be the day that the Roku boxes will be removed and donated. Simply put, no one ""NEEDS"" a Roku device and it is certainly something that is both fairly easy to reproduce and or replace. Even though logically the stock and the company are seriously overvalued, greed and ""analysts"" will push the stock to astronomical valuations. As such, it is fairly risky to hold the stock ""short"" especially when you are paying 25% or more to borrow the stock.So what are you to do?As I have written in the past, I did close out my left over small short position at a loss and have instead opened up a short position by buying a long dated $40 Puts. Of course, why stop there?An income focused investor can also write puts against the long dated holding and monetize their risk via calendar spreads. With Roku's high volatility, you can often get $1 in premiums for near term weekly options and within a few weeks, you can have your longer term put paid off.Over the last few weeks this strategy has paid off about 25% of the price paid for the long dated put. When volatility is high, you sell premium and thus my planned strategy for Roku while I wait for it to reflect reality in the longer term. If you have not done so already, please take a look at my previous Roku articles,"
4126250,21798,2017-11-19T14:57:29-05:00,"Roku’s stock more than doubled over the past week.
        Roku’s recent surge has the stock at a lofty valuation at an overbought level.
        The stock price could be cut in half.","I do acknowledge that Roku (ROKU) reported excellent sales growth for Q3 2017. The company achieved a 40% increase in total net revenue and platform revenue growth of 137% over the same period last year. Roku is making strong achievements and the stock might be a good investment for the long-term if the company can sustain its strong growth. However, the stock is now priced at a lofty valuation after a significant run-up. I think multiple factors will cause the stock to fall significantly over the next few months.After more than doubling from under $19 to over $40, Roku’s stock is trading at a lofty valuation at an overbought level. The trailing price to sales ratio is 8.9 and the forward price to sales ratio is 5.9. This has Roku’s stock valued higher than Netflix (NFLX), which has trailing and forward P/S ratios of 7.8 and 5.7 respectively. This is significantly higher than the CATV Systems industry’s average P/S ratio of 2.5.Roku would have to consistently sustain strong growth to maintain such a high valuation level. Netflix stock has been an anomaly valuation-wise as a result of strong sustained subscriber growth. It is doubtful that Roku will be able to remain an anomaly with such a high valuation over time due to an abundance of competition. After such a strong run-up, investors are likely to take profits off the table. It is not often that investors can book a profit of over 100% in less than a month. So, I expect selling pressure from investors who will sell their positions to lock in their profit. There is also a high short interest on Roku’s stock. Over 30% of the float is short Roku’s stock. This is likely to put further downward pressure on the stock. The stock is at risk of a bear raid affect, where selling can lead to more selling as additional investors lose confidence in the stock and sell out of their positions. Roku’s actual business faces a lot of competition. TV streaming can be done on game consoles such as Microsoft’s (MSFT) Xbox One, Sony’s (SNE) PlayStation, and the Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) Wii. Other competition includes Amazon’s (AMZN) Fire TV, Apple (OTC:APPL) TV, the Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) Chromecast, and Smart TVs.Roku enthusiasts will argue that the Roku devices offer high quality streaming experiences. That is true for the higher priced models that allow you to stream in 4K HDR as compared to lower priced streaming devices. However, the latest Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, and the Google Chromecast Ultra also provide 4K HDR streaming. So, Roku doesn’t have a great differentiating advantage over the other competitors. Ultimately, a streaming device for the sake of streaming TV is a commodity product. These devices allow consumers to stream TV. There isn’t much to differentiate these products when comparing the same tier of picture resolution across brands. Therefore, as time goes on and more of these products become available to the market the price of the devices are likely to decline. This is likely to occur because of an increase in supply and price competition in the market. If the price of devices drops over time, it would have a negative effect on Roku's revenue. Roku’s lockup expiration occurs on 3/27/2018. This will allow insiders and large investors who hold large positions in the stock to sell shares. With such a large move in the stock since the IPO price of $14, insiders are likely to sell some shares to lock in their profits. This is likely to create selling pressure for the stock, driving the price down. We’ve witnessed the effect of lockup expiration with other high-profile companies. Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Snap (SNAP), LinkedIn (LNKD), and Tesla (TSLA) all experienced significant declines after their lockup periods ended. So, I think it is likely to happen to Roku, especially since the stock ran up to such a high valuation level. Savvy investors will probably be anticipating this event by shorting the stock to profit from the expected drop in price. This selling pressure will add to the selling from the other factors that I mentioned. The four factors that I mentioned are likely to cause the stock to experience selling pressure over the next 5 months. Investors have seen the IPO story many times before and I don’t think Roku will be any different. When you have a high-profile company that experiences a strong stock move after the IPO, the price tends to drift lower towards and after lockup expiration due to one or more of the factors that I discussed. I could be wrong in my assessment. It is possible that investors continue to give Roku a high valuation just like they have to Netflix and Amazon over the years. However, Roku would have to continue to post strong sales numbers and exceed estimates going forward to achieve that. With plenty of competition and no differentiation in streaming devices, I don’t think Roku will be able to avoid disappointing sales figures and the impending sell-off over the next few months. The selling pressure in these situations can be significant. We’ve seen stocks like Facebook, Snap, Twitter, and Blue Apron (APRN) drop to below their original IPO prices. I am not saying the price of Roku’s stock will drop below the IPO price. However, I think it would be reasonable for the stock to drop slightly above the industry’s average price to sales ratio of 2.5.I’m saying that the stock’s P/S ratio will remain above the industry’s average because the company is currently posting above average sales gains. So, I’m estimating Roku’s P/S ratio to fall to 4. This still allows for a premium in the price as compared to the industry. This would take the price of Roku down to $20 to $21 based on expected 2017 sales of $507 million and shares of 97.82 million. So, over the next 5 months, there is 50% downside potential for Roku’s stock."
4128242,103480,2017-11-28T20:51:59-05:00,"Roku stock has been on a wild tear, with comparisons to Netflix sending the stock up 2x in November.Unlike Netflix, Roku has no proprietary content assets in the age where media companies have declared content to be king.Netflix is also platform-agnostic; users can stream Netflix on their laptops and phones, while Roku is limited to its own players and a limited set of TV OEMs.Roku trades at an unsustainable valuation that far exceeds Netflix, despite being unprofitable.Roku's lockup expiration (coming in March) hasn't yet passed, and profit-taking will pressure the stock.","Shares of Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) have entered euphoric territory. Since posting a fantastic Q3 in early November, the company's first earnings release since going public in September at $14/share, Roku stock has doubled in November alone and is up more than 3x over its initial IPO price, easily crowning it as the best-performing IPO of the year. The overhyped price movements of Roku this month, in fact, almost call to mind similar price movements in Bitcoin and other digital currencies in November.ROKU data by YChartsWhile it's true that Roku surprised investors with excellent results that included a huge ~15% beat to the top line, as well as a much narrower loss than expected (-$0.10 pro forma EPS versus consensus of -$1.37), I believe the Roku rally is overdone.A large part of the reason Roku has notched such steady gains is that it's drawn inevitable comparisons to Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), with analysts praising both companies for capitalizing on the themes of cord-cutting and the shift to OTT (over-the-top) television. Needham & Company's analyst recently upgraded Roku to a $50 price target, the highest on the Street. The analyst justified her rating based on a view that ""Like NFLX, we view ROKU as a pure-play on over-the-top (OTT) TV-viewing growth, but ROKU has no content risk."" Shares rallied 18% to $46 on the news.The analyst should know better. Content, first of all, is one of Netflix's primary differentiators and the biggest source of its moat; the fact that Roku lacks original content puts it at greater risk of user attrition, not less so. Netflix is also profitable and generating massive EBITDA, whereas Roku is still struggling with its own path to profitability.While comparisons of Roku to Netflix are inevitable, they are a fallacy. Many hopeful investors look at Roku's $4.5 billion market cap in comparison to Netflix's $84 billion, and they reason that Roku should be able to close the gap.Investors in Snap (NYSE: SNAP) fell for the same fallacy, reasoning that Snap's growing user base among the highly valuable millennial generation would eventually allow its $20 billion market cap to catch up to Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB) $500 billion. Unsurprisingly, they were wrong, and Snap has lost ~25% from its Day 1 closing price of $17.It's tempting to look at tech giants like Netflix and Facebook - long the staples of the so-called FANG stocks, and the star performers in the stock market in 2017 - and root for somewhat-similar underdogs like Roku and Snap to become the next generation of FANG stocks. Yet the underlying fundamentals are vastly different; and Roku trades at valuation multiples far in excess of Netflix that even its growth premium doesn't justify.Let's take a look at how Roku fails to live up to Netflix and then dive into valuation.The media and entertainment industry has had a long-running debate over which was the most important key to success: superior content or superior distribution. Now, this debate has become moot, and an article by Recode succinctly sums up the widespread conclusion: content is king.Netflix realized this a long time ago, making its first foray into original content five years ago and proving the wisdom of its decision with the smashing success of House of Cards (aside from the Kevin Spacey-related drama that's brewing now). House of Cards drew a wide following, with per-episode viewership of 5-7 million higher than some of the most popular traditional TV shows. Without a show like House of Cards to sweeten the package, many of these subscribers might have defected from their Netflix subscriptions, especially after subscription prices went up. Ditto for other Netflix hits such as Stranger Things and Orange Is the New Black - sometimes, all it takes is the one show ""I can't live without"" to convince a subscriber to keep paying monthly fees.In 2017, according to Netflix CEO Reed Hastings' Q3 shareholder letter, Netflix spent one-quarter of its content budget on Netflix Originals. The company has also announced its intent to spend $7-8 billion on content in 2018 (~$2 billion on original content) and has $17 billion in total content commitments over the next few years. That's a difficult war chest to compete against. Not to mention the fact that Netflix-created shows have won multiple awards, including Emmys - a stamp of quality that indicates Netflix's content is just as good as that of traditional studios.Other large media companies have come to the same conclusion. AT&T's (NYSE: T) purchase of Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) (which owns HBO and thus, Game of Thrones), Meredith's (NYSE: MDP) purchase of Time Inc., and Disney's (NASDAQ: DIS) and Verizon's (NYSE: VZ) ongoing pursuit of 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ: FOXA) are all about the same thing: content. These large distributors are offering hefty premiums to acquire content libraries and access to loyal followers that it couldn't get elsewhere.What has Roku got in its arsenal to compete in the content wars? The closest it's gotten is its Q3 launch of Roku Channel, a ragtag collection of licensed content that is free for Roku users to watch. Roku Channel's subpar content (while free) likens it more to Amazon Video (free with an Amazon Prime membership): a limited library of third-party content with the rare blockbuster, but ultimately unable to hook users the way House of Cards can.Netflix's investment in original content is the anchor of its high valuation. It now not only has one of the best content libraries in the industry, but the best distribution across a variety of platforms as well (we'll dive into this next). Roku only has the latter. It will take years to build an original content platform to rival Netflix's, and without it, Roku's value proposition is rather weak.As you're likely aware, Netflix is platform-agnostic. You can watch Netflix from any device: your computer, your smartphone, your tablet, or your smart TV. In the modern world, virtually everyone has access to at least one of those devices, if not all of them.Roku, on the other hand, is largely only relevant in the smart TV space - which hugely limits its appeal and ability to scale (though the company's Roku Express offerings can connect standard TVs via an HDMI connection).Nor is Roku actually dominant in the smart TV space. As a refresher, users can stream Roku from one of two types of devices - a Roku Player, which is manufactured and sold directly by Roku; or a Roku TV, which is a third-party TV with Roku software.As I wrote in a prior article, Roku has seen declining Roku Player revenues for several quarters, something that should draw more alarm from investors. In Q3, Player revenues returned to flat (+4% y/y) growth - but it's fairly clear that Roku's hardware has stopped its growth spurt, and the best it can hope for going forward is to sustain existing revenues:Figure 2. Roku player revenuesSource: Roku Q3 earnings releaseThen there's the third-party smart TVs, which bulls like to emphasize when defending Roku's unimpressive Player sales. Year to date in 2017, according to Roku's Q3 shareholder letter, one in five smart TVs sold were Roku TVs.Roku's reach is already limited compared to Netflix - it can only target users with smart TVs, unlike Netflix, which can reach users across a wide variety of devices. Within Roku's smaller niche market, it only has one-fifth of the population. Yes, you might say that Roku is still growing and flexing its muscles in this space - but it's not exactly a hot new startup, either, having been founded in 2002.Netflix had 56.5 million paying subscribers at the end of Q3 - about 4x Roku's active user base (and consider also that Roku doesn't charge its active members a subscription fee). Given Roku's limited reach, it might never reach Netflix's scale; and given its business model, it most certainly will never reach Netflix's revenues.Somehow, despite Roku's obvious shortfalls, investors continue to value it at a premium to Netflix.Netflix currently has an $84.40 billion market cap, $1.75 billion in cash, and $4.89 billion in debt - or an enterprise value of $87.54 billion. If we assume Netflix grows its revenue by 25% in FY18 (and that's rather conservative given 32% growth in FY17), we estimate Netflix's revenues at $14.60 billion in FY18. This implies a current EV/FY revenue multiple of just 6.0x.Roku, on the other hand, currently trades at around a 6.2x multiple of its total revenues - whereas Roku's revenue should really be placed at a discount to Netflix, due to Roku's concentration in lower-margin hardware revenues.The best valuation framework for Roku involves a sum-of-the-parts valuation that places a different value on Roku's hardware and platform revenues, as done in the exercise below:Figure 3. Roku valuationSource: author-created chart; data from public filingsIn the above valuation framework, management guidance for Q4 ($175-$190 million) is taken at its midpoint, and split into player and platform revenues according to the existing year-to-date mix. From there, 5% growth in player revenues and 100% growth in platform revenues are assumed in FY18 to arrive at $740 million in total revenues.Applying an industry-standard multiple of 2x on hardware revenues and a premium multiple of 8x on platform revenues (note that Netflix's multiple is 6x), we arrive at a $4.1 billion enterprise valuation for Roku and a $42 price target. This also implies a 5.5x revenue multiple on total revenues.Note that this is already an optimistic valuation, one that assumes Roku can continue to double its platform revenues in FY18, and also assigning a high 8x multiple on those platform revenues.I believe $42 is the absolute ceiling for what Roku is worth - how Needham managed to arrive at a $50 target confounds me. At Roku's current $46 trading levels, its platform revenues are already being valued at 9x - a 50% premium over Netflix's streaming revenues. Yes, Roku's hypergrowth should be rewarded with a premium multiple, but the fact that 100% of these revenues come from third-party content should also be considered as a penalty against the company.Investors hoping for Roku to become the next Netflix are likely to experience a huge disappointment. Not only does Netflix's award-winning, billion-dollar original content library give it a huge advantage over Roku, but its wider platform-agnostic reach gives it the better distribution potential as well. While it's true that both Roku and Netflix both enjoy tailwinds associated with cord-cutting and OTT streaming, Roku's total addressable market is much more limited.Given Roku's upcoming lockup expiration and its 200% rise since its IPO, the stock is due for a pummeling in the near term. Hype can only drive the stock up so far."
4128603,103603,2017-11-29T17:45:54-05:00,"Roku's only real business is advertising.The stock has enormous downside, and its upside is mostly speculative.However, it will beat Q4 revenue guidance.","Roku's (NASDAQ:ROKU) main business is providing free content by licensing it and profiting from the advertising revenue it generates. Simply put, Roku wants to bring the traditional TV model to the internet, an interesting endeavor indeed.It is a great business, but very overpriced right now. Advertising is the only reliable source of revenue for Roku, the player is just how it got its foot in the door but is nothing for the long term.Roku's revenue comes from 2 sources: hardware and advertising. When evaluating the stock, the earnings from the hardware business should be tossed aside for the following reasons.Going against Google, Apple, and Amazon and surviving this far is quite an accomplishment. Roku has found the cracks in the sector and managed to make a niche for its devices. But tilting windmills is a dangerous endeavor, and rather than associating the success or failure of Roku as a company based on its hardware, I rather consider it as non-existent financially, as in the future, it might be too expensive for Roku to continue the fight or simply it might be more profitable to abandon this endeavor and instead put more time an effort partnering with more Smart TV producers to have its platform embedded in their TVs, as it recently did with Philips (PHIA).My valuation of Roku comes with some basic hypothesis:When analyzing Roku's financials, it is remarkable to see that many of the items have linear behaviors. Since Roku´s users come from the player and smart TV´s of small vendors, revenue is steadily growing, R&D and Sales and marketing are controlled as a percentage of revenue and cost of revenue should remain about the same percentage as it has been doing, giving about 75% gross profit margin.From the chart above it can be clearly seen that the least linear behavior is the platform gross profit. The best case scenario would be the linear behavior from Q3 of 2016 to the second best linear performance, to avoid taking into consideration seasonal patterns. The worst case scenario would be the linear behavior of Q3 2016 with Q1 of 2017.Considering that revenue divergence, with a profit margin of 75% and subtracting the linear behaviors of the R&D and S&A expenses we can have a basic linear model of the behavior range of Roku. The “mean” is my estimate of for Roku.In any of the cases, by 2020 the company will be profitable and its valuation quite simple with the Lynch ratio. Peter Lynch´s method for growth valuation uses the ratio between the expected earnings growth and the P/E of the stock to determine its fair value. A stock that has a 1:1 ratio is a fairly priced. Considering that each of the lines has its own growth ratio it would be the fair value if it had the same P/E.Roku has little debt and plenty of cash, some inventory but not worrisome amounts. Keeping all assets as recorded in the Q3 and divided between the more than 80 million shares, it comes around $2.62 per share....At its worst, the stock will tank to barely double digits, and best case scenario, the price will jump about 70% in the next 3 years, my projection is that the stock will have a similar price in 2020 as it has todayOn the revenue chart above, there is a little spike in platform revenue in Q4 of 2016. There is a clear seasonal factor for revenue since it is a quarter filled with holidays and kids on vacations, which increases the streaming needs of the family. For the long run, I don’t recommend counting the player business, but for guessing whether or not Roku will beat the Q4 forecast it is important to consider it.The linear behavior puts the advertising gross profits between $40 million and $50 million, while last year, the player Gross Profit was $10 million. Considering that the linear model does not include seasonality I believe the probability that Roku beats Q4 earnings is high.As I said in the beginning, going against Google, Amazon, and Apple is quite an accomplishment. I am impressed with Roku´s management, and I even like the business strategy; however, the company still faces many challenges and although there are many recent news to be cheerful about, the challenges in Roku´s horizon are considerable. As interesting as the business model is, and as much as I like the management, I rather wait to see how the story develops.Many valuations put Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Roku as competitors, but for similar reasons why I don't consider Amazon to be Netflix competitors, I believe Roku and Netflix are not overlapping much.As Warren Buffet Says ""When a management team with a reputation for brilliance tackles a business with a reputation for bad economics, it is the reputation of the business that remains intact"" Roku's business plan might not all be bad economics, but the price now is overly optimistic.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4125885,103709,2017-11-17T09:00:11-05:00,"Roku's stock has been on fire lately, doubling since November 8 on strong user growth and a new television manufacturer deal.I model Roku's future potential market as 200 million devices in 2022, with Roku grabbing a 60% share and earning 35% operating margins.Roku is an extremely promising acquisition target, especially for Microsoft, which may wish to enter the smart TV operating system market due to synergies with existing markets.Based on a discounted cash flow, I value Roku at $54 per share, representing approximately 33% upside potential.","ROKU data by YChartsRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) has seen a large surge in pricing since November 8, driven by strong quarterly results and a new agreement with Philips to put the Roku OS onto Philips (NYSE:PHG) televisions. These results have caused some contributors to turn bearish on Roku, although shares still trade below others' projected ranges.I model that Roku's value is $54/share, based on a DCF valuation. This is based on Roku gaining a 30% market share of a 200 million streaming device, including smart TVs and over-the-top (OTT) streaming devices, market in 2022. This is further based on an estimate that over the next 10 years, Roku will be able to increase its operating margins to 35%, between Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), the two largest digital advertising companies.I also believe that Roku would be a strong acquisition for any of its competitors. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may be especially well-served by purchasing the $4 billion company, given Microsoft's previous late entry into mobile OSes and subsequent failure in that market.My first exposure to Roku was through owning one of its OTT streaming devices, which I use regularly and enjoy. These Roku devices compete with Google's Chromecast, Apple's (OTC:APPL) AppleTV, and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Fire TV. They are used predominantly to watch Internet-based TV streaming services, such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, Amazon Video, and the various sports streaming services, including MLB.tv and WWE Network (WWE). But these devices are not how Roku makes its money. Instead, these devices are sold at close to break-even pricing to grow the Roku OS platform.Source: Roku SEC filingsRoku makes money by growing its platform operating system, Roku OS, and serving advertisements on that platform. Roku OS runs not only on Roku streaming devices but also comes as the operating system used in television brands, including Hisense, Insignia, Sharp, and RCA. Platform revenue and profit will be the driving factor in Roku's future success or failure due to the much high margins on platform revenue: Year to date, Roku's platform margins are 74%, while player margins are only 7%.Source: Roku SEC filingsRoku has been successful thus far in growing its platform and in monetizing its platform users. This revenue comes in the form of advertising revenue from streaming content on Roku's platform, as well as some signups originating from Roku's platform. Interestingly, Roku derives almost no revenue from Netflix and YouTube. Roku states that the biggest five broadcasters make up 70% of streaming on Roku, with Netflix taking about one-third of all streaming hours. However, the arrangement with Netflix and YouTube is sensible, in that Roku is attempting to build Roku OS into a strong streaming platform, and it cannot be a strong streaming platform without access to these dominant streaming services. Both services are so large that Roku cannot afford to take them off its platform, or else users would switch away from Roku OS and to a YouTube- and Netflix-friendly platform instead.Determining the possible size of Roku's market is a highly speculative task. However, it is crucial in order to determine what Roku might look like in five to ten years. As of October, Roku had 16.7 million active accounts (up 48% since a year ago) and earned $3.40 in quarterly platform revenue per active user (up 60% since a year ago). But what might Roku's user base look like in five or ten years?To tackle this question, I will first look at possible numbers of Netflix subscribers in five years. Then, I will look at the proportion of Netflix subscribers who watch primarily on their televisions. I will then approximate a total number of users streaming Internet content to their televisions from this figure, including both Netflix subscribers and non-subscribers. This is the market which Roku will compete for in the future.First, it is instructive to look at projections of Netflix subscribers in 2022. These projects vary significantly: Digital TV Research suggests Netflix will have 123 million subscribers in five years, while CNBC has posited that 250 million subscribers may be possible. One contributor to Seeking Alpha suggests a figure of 193 million subscribers. Taking these figures together, and being a bit conservative, let's suggest that Netflix might boast 150 million subscribers in 2022.According to Adweek, televisions represent only 21% of Netflix signups. However, after one month, televisions are the primary device for 48% of Netflix subscribers, and after six months, this figure rises to 62%. Thus, the longer a user is subscribed to Netflix, the more likely they are to have a television as their primary viewing device. Projecting this into the future, let's suggest that perhaps 80% of Netflix subscribers will watch at least some Netflix on their televisions in 2022. This is higher than 62%, but that figure includes only primary devices and not all devices and is after only six months. By 2022, many Netflix subscribers will have been subscribing for years, and smart TVs will be more prevalent than they are today. Thus, it is probable that a higher proportion of users will watch on their televisions in 2022 than do today. Accordingly, this would leave 120 million Netflix subscribers who stream to their televisions.This underestimates the market for television streaming, because not all users who stream to their television will subscribe to Netflix. For the sake of simplicity, let's suggest that there might be another 80 million people streaming to televisions that do not have Netflix. Last year, comScore reported that 1 out of 4 households with an OTT streaming device did not have Netflix, which would amount to a projected 40 million people. However, I choose to use a higher figure, because it is probable that in five years, the market for online streaming will be more competitive and fractured than it is today as companies like Disney (NYSE:DIS) form their own services. Further, Roku users who purchase an OTT streaming device are disproportionately likely to subscribe to Netflix compared to those who own a television with Roku OS, since the former group purchased a dedicated OTT streaming device, while the latter merely purchased a television. Using my 80 million estimate results in 200 million users streaming to their televisions in 2022.Next, we estimate Roku's share of the 200 million user market in 2022. Today, the three most common types of systems used for streaming to televisions are OTT streaming devices, built-in smart TV operating systems (including Roku OS), and gaming consoles.Source: ComScoreRoku is the market leader in OTT streaming devices with an estimated 49% share of the market.Source: ComScoreBy 2022, the streaming landscape is likely to be considerably different. Smart TV sales will continue to grow and will represent a much larger proportion of the audience for streaming content. Similarly, sales of OTT streaming devices are likely to fall, as more users will have smart TVs and fewer users will need an additional OTT streaming device.Similarly, gaming consoles may decline as a proportion of television streaming as a result of smart TV proliferation, since it will be more convenient to simply press a ""Netflix"" or ""Roku"" button on the remote than to load up an app within the console. Gaming console users are also disproportionately likely to have a modern smart TV, since gaming tends to adopt new technology more quickly than other entertainment.For this reason, Roku's deal with Philips is important for Roku. Roku should aim to become integrated onto as many smart TV brands as possible in order to thrive and grow its platform. While Roku does not receive direct benefits (e.g., licensing fees) from television manufacturers, the network effects of having more users are very important to the company's future.Operating systems (e.g., Windows and Android) gain from the network effect, and Roku OS is no different. As more people use Roku OS, more developers will develop for Roku OS. This, in turn, will make Roku OS more desirable to consumers due to the proliferation of apps and other content on the platform. This advantage is especially pronounced over proprietary software included on some current smart TVs. Such proprietary software is less likely to be updated and supported in the future and less likely to add support for emerging streaming services in the future. These network effects are likely to lead to a small number of players dominating the smart TV OS market.Adding additional users to the Roku OS platform will also increase Roku's bargaining position with its streaming partners, enabling the company to increase its revenue per user.Network effects are likely to cause significant consolidation in the streaming platform industry. Currently, there are four large players in the OTT streaming device market: Apple, Amazon, Google, and Roku. It is probable that network effects will limit the number of competitors in this market. This market will parallel the markets for desktop and mobile OSes. In both cases, early computers and smartphones offered a wide variety of proprietary OSes, but the market contracted over time to one dominant player (DOS/Windows and Android) and one proprietary OS (Mac OS and iOS).If this happens, what is likely to happen to Roku? Roku is, by far, the smallest competitor in the streaming platform industry, as the other companies involved are all worth over $500 billion, while Roku sits at approximate $4 billion. Due to its size and single-product nature, Roku is therefore the most likely to be acquired.Of the other names in the market, Apple seems the least likely to acquire Roku. Apple rarely acquires companies, and further, Apple rarely develops platforms for other manufacturers. Thus, it is unclear what a company like Roku, whose best asset is an existing base of television manufacturers bundling its software, might offer Apple. Instead, Apple's most likely course is to either to produce its own televisions or to exit the market.Source: Best BuyOf these companies, Roku and Google dominate the smart TV OS market. Google's technology is currently offered on more televisions than Roku, based on an unscientific look at Best Buy (NYSE:BBY). Google's Android TV is offered on Sony (NYSE:SNE) televisions, while Chromecast is offered on televisions from Vizio and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). Meanwhile, Roku is offered on televisions from Insignia, Sharp, TCL, and Hisense. Neither Amazon Fire nor Apple TV is integrated into any televisions at this time.Thus, Google may be Roku's primary competitor moving forward. To fight Google on even footing, Roku may seek a deep-pocketed ally or purchaser. The two most likely candidates could be Amazon, which has shown interest in the market, and Microsoft. Microsoft's entry into mobile was too late to cause a dent in the Google/Apple duopoly, and it may not wish to repeat that mistake in smart TV OSes. If Microsoft wishes to fight for control of the television operating system market, Roku would make an extremely wise strategic acquisition, especially while Roku is relatively inexpensive at about $4 billion market cap.Similarly, Microsoft has experience in dealing with many of the players in the smart TV market, who also make Windows-powered laptops and other devices. This experience may help Roku secure agreements with the likes of Sony, Toshiba, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), LG, and others who have offered Windows-powered devices in the past. The partnership with Roku would also benefit Microsoft. Smart TVs will have more and more computing power in the future, moving them closer to desktop computers and to tablets, which are markets Microsoft actively competes in.Acquiring Roku may also have app store synergies for Microsoft. Microsoft may be able to combine the Windows and Roku app stores in the future, which would increase the number of apps available on both platforms and thereby increase the desirability of each platform. (This would not be entirely painless, since Roku OS is primarily direction-pad-controlled, while tablet OSes are primarily touch-based, but this could be overcome.) Accordingly, it is my view that Roku is a compelling acquisition target for Microsoft, offering entry into new markets and offering synergies with existing markets.Roku has 16.7 million active users by their own count. Market share estimated vary. As above, comScore suggests Roku has a 49% market share. According to eMarketer, Roku has a 23.1% share of the connected TV market. BI Intelligence reports that Roku's market share is 37%.Network effects are likely to shrink the streaming platform market in the future. Particularly, I do not expect Apple to license out Apple TV to other manufacturers. Thus far, Amazon has also not actively pursued deals to put Amazon Fire TV onto smart TVs. Thus, Google is Roku's primary competitor in the smart TV market, while all four compete in OTT streaming devices.Which this situation could easily change in the future, one possible scenario is that Roku and Google will continue to strengthen their positions through having their OSes included on smart TVs. Meanwhile, Amazon and Apple's positions in the market will weaken. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that Roku might have a 30% share of the 200 million users streaming Internet-based content to their televisions by 2022. This market share is diluted from the above figures by the use of gaming consoles and other devices to stream to televisions as well.To hit 60 million users, with growth scaled linearly, Roku's current 48% year-over-year growth will decline to 12% by 2022. Past this, I project that Roku's user growth will further linearly slow to 3% per year by 2027, as the market reaches saturation.Roku has also effectively monetized its user base while continuing to grow that base. During the past year, Roku has increased its per-user quarterly platform revenue by 60%, from $2.10 to $3.40. Based on Roku's current growth, the company does not yet appear to have reached a ceiling in just how much it can monetize each user. As Roku OS gains popularity, the company will have a stronger bargaining position with various streaming services to use Roku-provided ads on those services. However, if smart TV users grow to make up a larger portion of Roku OS users (compared to OTT streaming device users), per-user engagement with Roku may decline (since purchasers of a smart TV are likely to spend less time watching streaming content than purchasers of an OTT streaming device).Based on this, I estimate that Roku's per-user platform revenue growth will decline from 25% in 2018 to 3% in 2022, with per-user growth slowing to levels approximating inflation as Roku fully-monetizes its streaming users. Putting the above together, I project that by 2022, Roku will have 60 million active users, rising to 82 million in 2027. Per user revenue will increase from $11 in 2017 to $21 in 2022 and up to $25 by 2027.Source: Roku filings and my estimatesAt the same time, I project that player revenues will decline 5% per year until 2027. This decline will be caused by the proliferation of smart TVs, as the industry moves away from OTT devices and into smart TVs. Note, however, that this projection is unimportant for Roku's profits: During the past two quarters, Roku's cost of revenue for players has been 93% of its player revenue. Thus, it is relatively immaterial how many players Roku sells (as distinct from the size of their platform), since Roku makes very little profit on players. Meanwhile, cost of revenue for Roku's platform over the past year has been only 26% - while Roku's player revenue does not contribute to increased profit, higher platform revenue significantly helps Roku's bottom line. These projections result in the following player revenue and platform revenues in the future.Source: Roku filings and my estimatesIn the past quarter, Roku's operating margins were -6%. However, this was a quarter in which player revenue was higher than platform revenue. Player revenue is largely profit-neutral to Roku, while platform revenue is highly profitable.In order to estimate Roku's future operating margins, I look at the two largest digital advertising networks: Facebook and Google. Like these companies, a successful Roku will derive the bulk of its revenue from advertising and will gain from network effects. These network effects provide Roku with a substantial moat, since other entrants will be unable to match Roku's breadth of apps and developer network. This will enable Roku to earn returns which are comparable to those of its peers.FB Operating Margin (TTM) data by YChartsDuring the past twelve months, Facebook has had operating margins of 48%, while Google has operating margins of 24%. A mature Roku is likely to be more like Facebook than Google, as Roku will not have significant server costs, unlike YouTube (Google). However, to be somewhat conservative, I have projected Roku's operating margins to rise linearly from a projected -1% in 2018 to 35% in 2027. This increase will be due to network effects and due to the fact that linear growth in platform size will not require linear growth in development costs.At the same time, Roku's reinvestment needs (working capital and net capital expenditures) will remain low. Roku's business is not a capital-intensive one, since costs to grow the business are primarily R&D costs, and the company does not require large capital expenditures or working capital (e.g., inventory) needs. In 2016, Roku's net reinvestment was $20 million, on revenues of about $400 million, or 5% of its revenue. Roku's future reinvestment needs are likely to be comparable.Source: Roku filings and my estimatesI have further estimated Roku's future tax costs at 20%, beginning in 2022, as the company burns off its accumulated losses and begins paying taxes. This estimate is comparable to Google's current tax rate, although it is lower than what is currently paid by Facebook and Netflix. Roku does not currently break its income down country by country, but if Roku's future income includes significant non-US income, the company may be able to pay less than 20% tax rates.FB Effective Tax Rate (TTM) data by YChartsTo find a discount rate, I estimate Roku's beta using a bottom-up beta approach. A regression beta is unsuitable for Roku due to a lack of stock price history to perform regressions against. Therefore, I've chosen to compare Roku to a basket of other companies within the space of Internet streaming, OTT devices, and digital advertising, including Facebook, TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO), Netflix, Pandora (NYSE:P), and others. Based on this comparison, I believe that the unlevered beta for Roku's business is 1.03. This beta, combined with Roku's lack of debt, current 0% tax rate, and small amount of cash, results in a levered beta of 1.01. (Roku listed a small amount of debt in its most recent 10-Q, but also noted this debt was repaid in October.)Source: My estimatesThis value, when combined with the current U.S. market equity risk premium, results in a cost of equity of 7.3%. Because Roku does not have any debt, this cost of equity is also Roku's cost of capital. Others may choose to use different discount rates for Roku, so I also provide valuations using other discount rates below.In my valuation, Roku's cost of capital will decline once the company has positive operating profits. This is because I model Roku to carry an optimal level of debt, based on Damodaran's default spreads and interest coverage ratios. Once Roku makes an operating profit, I model that Roku's will maintain an interest coverage ratio of 7.5, resulting in a credit rating of A2 and a cost of debt of 3.5%. Thus, by 2027, I model that Roku should carry approximately $2 billion in debt to maximize value to shareholders. This increased debt will reduce cost of capital to 7.2% by 2022, with the cost of capital decreases due to debt being partially offset by increased costs of equity as Roku becomes leveraged.Source: My estimatesBased on the above, I value Roku at $54 per share, using a 2.4% terminal growth rate. While the company's shares have rapidly gained value since its earnings release, Roku still offers significant upside to investors. This upside is, however, heavily affected by the cost of capital used, since Roku's significant profits will occur years into the future.Source: My estimatesRoku is a young growth company, especially with respect to platform revenue. To reach 30% market share in 2022, Roku will need to maintain its existing relationships with manufacturers of smart TVs and build new relationships with other manufacturers. Presently, Roku OS is primarily found on lower-end televisions, while Google's software tends to be found on higher-end televisions. Roku must work to build its reputation and become a platform which consumers prefer on their smart TVs. I appreciate that Roku is actively developing new streaming players and pricing them at attractive price points. While the players themselves do not meaningfully contribute to revenue, they will increase the size of Roku's platform, aiding network effects. Further, consumers with exposure to Roku's platform may also be more likely to later choose a smart TV that also uses Roku OS.Roku's fight for smart TV dominance will be difficult considering Google's size advantage. Google can out-spend Roku if it chooses to do so. Further, Apple or Amazon may also enter the smart TV market in the future, which could dilute Roku's market share. Thus far, Roku has performed well in the face of this competition in OTT streaming devices. There is little reason to doubt that Roku can perform just as well in the smart TV market in the future.The biggest catalysts for price increases in Roku will include signing deals with more major television manufacturers, increasing the size of Roku's user base and being better able to monetize each user. Further, I believe that Roku is a strong candidate for an acquisition by the likes of Amazon or Microsoft, if it wishes to compete with Google in the smart TV market. Microsoft may view Roku favorably, given Microsoft's late entry into (and subsequent failure in) mobile operating systems. Roku's approximate $4 billion market cap may also make Roku an attractive acquisition target for any of the major players in the market, as it represents a relatively small investment to enter a valuable market.Roku is an attractive young company that has shown strong leadership to fight the large competitors in the OTT streaming device market and to maintain the largest market share within that market. However, that market will shift away from OTT streaming devices and into smart TVs in the future. Only Google and Roku appear interested in this market, which should allow Roku to grow its market share to 30% or higher. Roku's business model will enable it to make strong operating margins, as advertising revenue will scale up linearly with users, while costs of development do not scale up in the same manner.Roku is also an attractive acquisition target for any of the players in its industry and also for Microsoft. An acquisition by a major player would benefit Roku significantly, since it would give Roku access to capital to improve its products and to compete with Google (unless it was purchased by Google).Based on my projections of 60 million users in 2022 and 35% operating margins by 2027, I value Roku at $54 per share, approximately a 33% premium over its current price. While Roku will face significant hurdles in competing with giants like Google, its performance to date has been very strong. Roku's continued user base growth and growth in revenue per user is promising for the future of the company, whether or not it becomes an acquisition target."

It is widely expected that Roku's losses will continue and this one should be a whopper, taking into account the typical ""last quarter, pre-IPO"" expense stuffing.As per Nasdaq and Zacks, the average estimated loss based on two forecasts is for a loss of $4.48 per share.Source: Nasdaq.comOf course, most Roku investors and bulls will quickly point out that this should be expected for a new emerging growth ""IPO."" In this case however it is a 15 year old company which is yet to be profitable.While I LOVE my Roku devices and wanted to find a reason to invest in Roku, I am not optimistic for the future of the company as an investment at what I believe are insane valuations as we have discussed over my ROKU articles since prior to the IPO.The more I researched and wrote about Roku, combined with the amazing community here on Seeking Alpha, I came to the conclusion that Roku was indeed priced to perfection and resembled the other failed tech IPOs, namely GoPro (GPRO) and Fitbit (FIT). At some point, around $25.50 per share I opened a short position in the stock.There are 5 key areas where I would like to see updated information and clarity on from Roku to make me change my mind.Roku is largely today, and has been historically, a hardware company. What we have learned from the IPO however is that for the first 6 months of 2017, hardware sales have decreased, hardware costs increased, and net profits decreased versus prior year.Those are NOT the signs you want to see in a ""growing tech company"" which is dependent upon putting more Roku devices in people's homes.Source: Roku S1Roku desperately needs to sell more devices without bankrupting themselves. Unfortunately, while doing channel checks at various stores I found many last gen devices on clearance, for up to 80% off.This of course comes with the continued pressure of lower device prices as Roku competes with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG)(GOOGL).One development that may either hurt or help Roku is Mexico, and the second area where I am looking for clarity.As we have discussed in ""Roku - The Kleenex And Postage Scale Problem,"" Roku devices ARE being used to illegally stream pirated content and Roku has been shutting down a number of private suspected channels.There is no doubt in my mind, many of the Roku users and devices purchased were purchased with illegally streaming content in mind. The question is how much?As we know from the Roku S1, Roku has Mexican problems.Source: Roku S1I am looking for more information on any potential resolutions to this, but more importantly to see how hardware sales will be impacted.We also know that Mexico is NOT the only problem and the United Kingdom has also started cracking down on pirated content streamed via Roku devices.The one bright spot for Roku however is the platform revenue.Source: Roku S1For the first 6 months of 2017, Roku has been able to nearly double their revenue derived from the platform versus 2016. This includes revenue sharing and advertising deals.There was not a lot of detail provided for the revenue sources, so we will have to see if Roku will provide that guidance. More importantly, we need that information to set realistic expectations for platform growth ONCE all of the low hanging fruit are picked.In what I feel was a very rushed move, Roku announced and pushed out their own channel/app.The channel gives users a place to watch movies and shows, curated by Roku, monetized by Roku's advertising platform.Roku desperately needed to do something as the vast majority of their streaming hours are derived from non-monetized sources, such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon Prime Video, Hulu and Google's YouTube.Roku cannot place their own advertising on the paid services on the platform. Can you imagine the outrage if Roku placed ads in the middle of your Netflix binge session? As far as YouTube, there are advertisements in the app, BUT... they are Google's ads.THAT is why we have the Roku Channel.For those that are not familiar with it, i.e. do not own a Roku device, I have written about the Roku Channel in the articles: ""ROKU: Analyst Upgrades? Or Chefs Claiming Their Food Is The Best?"" and ""Roku: Beyond The Box.""What I am looking to get more information on is the take up of the channel, in particular what it makes up as a percentage of the total streaming content's pie. This is critical as this app is one of the few potential drivers of revenue going forward.If Roku is to be taken more seriously as a ""media"" company and not as a hardware device manufacturer, they need to provide more data.For me to take Roku seriously as a media company we need to see,Obviously, many of those would be too much to give out, BUT I don't believe all of them are unrealistic.Until Roku earns actual profits, they need to be as transparent as possible with the shareholders who are supporting them.Myself, while I am a huge fan of my Roku devices, I don't see the yellow brick road to profits and that's why I maintain my short position until we hit my price target. For my valuation metrics and price targets, please read ""Love My Roku Devices, But Still Sold It Short."""
4122653,24849,2017-11-08T22:53:41-05:00,Q3 results smashed expectations.GAAP profitability only a matter of time.Valuation can lead to plenty of upside.,"After the bell on Wednesday, shares of streaming platform company Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) soared after smashing expectations with its first quarterly report as a publicly traded company. While a 28% gain might give investors pause about jumping in, the strong growth this company should see moving forward could easily propel Roku to its post-IPO highs and perhaps much higher.As we've seen with a lot of new tech IPOs in recent years, Street analysts have kept expectations fairly low so that these newly traded names can easily beat. Analysts were looking for 24% revenue growth in Q3, just a hair above what the company saw in the first half of 2017 as compared to the first half of 2016. However, the overall revenue growth rate was likely to be higher as platform revenues, which were up 91% in the first half of the year, became a larger portion of the overall total.As the link above shows, that was clearly the case for Q3 results. Roku reported revenues of over $124 million, more than 40% year-over-year growth, smashing estimates for about $110 million. This was on the back of platform revenues showing 137% growth, and helped to deliver a bottom line beat of nearly 20 cents per share on a non-GAAP basis. In the graphic below, you can see the company's key operating results.(Source: Company's Q3 shareholder letter)With platform revenues continuing to grow at extremely high rates, overall revenue growth will persist at a strong clip for quite some time. Management guided to Q4 revenues of $175-190 million, compared to estimates of $177.1 million, so guidance was pretty good. One might also assume that the company wanted to be slightly conservative with its first set of guidance, so it wouldn't surprise me to see Roku come in towards or above the high end when it reports Q4. The midpoint of guidance represents 24% growth over what was a really high base number in Q4 2016 if you look above.What investors should really focus on, however, is how the platform business impacts the company's margins. The gross margins of this segment are nearly double the overall average, meaning as this segment continues its rapid growth, the company will see significant gross margin improvement. Just going from 29% to 40% gross margins delivered a 92% increase in gross margin dollars, so imagine where Roku could be if it gets gross margins to 50%, 60%, or more. As long as operating expenses don't balloon at an out-of-control rate, it would not surprise me to see a swing to profitability coming soon.There are investors out there that want to know if this will be the next Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), but Roku doesn't really need to be. Netflix has more than 20 times as much projected 2017 revenue and several times as many active users. If Roku gets to a valuation that's even 1/10th that of Netflix, it would be valued at more than $8 billion, several times above the roughly $2.4 billion or so shares closed at in Wednesday's after-hours session. Even with the sharp rally seen in the chart below, shares are still 19% off their post-IPO highs.(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Roku is heavily involved in the future of streaming TV, and the growth reported in Q3 is just the beginning for this name. As platform revenues continue to soar, this high-margin segment of the business will help the company turn profitable. With a valuation not even at $2.5 billion even after soaring on this earnings news, there is plenty of room for this company to grow as the future of television evolves. The average Street target was $25 coming into this report, and the last after-hours trade was $24.15. We are going to see analysts hike those numbers quite considerably in the coming days and weeks. If Netflix can be worth $85 billion, imagine the gains shareholders could see if Roku could someday be valued at 5-10% of that."
4124424,24849,2017-11-13T16:16:32-05:00,"Shares have more than doubled since earnings.Valuation was cheap, but not anymore.Wait for a pullback before buying again.","Last week, I detailed how shares of streaming company Roku (ROKU) were ready for takeoff after the company's first earnings report as a publicly traded company. With the name handily beating estimates and a bright future ahead, I thought shares could eventually grow into a valuation in the mid single digit billions. While the name surging to that level in just a few days, investors now have to be very careful as it appears a bubble has formed.(Source: Yahoo Finance)My thought process was simple: as the company relied less on sales of low margin devices, the high margin and fast growing platform business would help move the name to GAAP profitability. After just under $399 million in revenues last year, current estimates call for more than $507 million this year, and the street has been scrambling to raise numbers after last week's beat. In fact, forecasts for next year now call for more than $653 million, up almost $30 million since the Q3 report. That would imply more than 60% revenue growth over two years, and the streaming business isn't going away anytime soon.I estimated that a few years down the road, if the story played out well, Roku could eventually have a valuation that was 5-10% that of Netflix (NFLX), implying between $4.25 billion and $8.5 billion. As of November 3rd, according to the company's 10-Q filing, there were almost 98 million outstanding shares of Roku's Class A and Class B shares. That put the total valuation at nearly $4.65 billion at Monday's high, and that excludes the possibility of any future dilution from acquisitions, stock based compensation, etc.Roku did what we've seen with many hyped tech IPOs in recent years. It soared initially to just under $30 a share, then fell to almost $18 prior to the earnings report. While I think Roku is in better shape than the likes of Snap (SNAP), Fitbit (FIT), or GoPro (GPRO) that have seen their stocks plunge from their post-IPO highs, it's hard to trust a name with only one public earnings report on its record after such a large run.Roku's competition has much deeper pockets than Netflix's peers do, so perhaps we should be eventually valuing Roku towards the lower end of my 5-10% range. Netflix has more than 100 million subscribers and is the clear leader in its space, while Roku does have stiffer competition from the likes of Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), to name a few. At current valuations, Netflix goes for 5.6 times projected 2018 sales, while Roku at Monday's high was at 7.1 times, so there is a premium baked into shares currently, especially when considering Netflix itself trades at what many consider a high valuation.In the end, Roku's rally has been tremendous, but investors have to be extremely careful at these levels that appear to be approaching bubble territory. Shares are at the level that I thought they could reach a few years down the road if everything went right, and they got there in just a couple of days. With a lot of this fueled by short covering, there is likely to be a bursting of the bubble, so it wouldn't surprise me to see shares eventually retrace 25-50% of this rally. If you believe in the company's future, you should likely wait for the stock to pull back a bit instead of trying to catch the last few points of potential upside."
4119193,103744,2017-11-01T15:30:26-04:00,"After its IPO at $14 per share on 9/28/17, ROKU experienced a buying frenzy that sent share price up to nearly $30.Since reaching its all time high on 9/29/17, ROKU has generally trended downward as investors realized the stock was overvalued.ROKU is currently unprofitable, and significant competition from industry giants such as AAPL, AMZN, and GOOG makes a path to eventual profitability all but impossible.","On September 28, ROKU (NASDAQ: ROKU) finally had its IPO. Aping the trend of many overvalued tech IPOs, the stock price rocketed up before gradually beginning a return to more realistic levels. However, ROKU has yet to report a profit, giving investors serious cause for concern. Unlike the ever-disruptive AMZN (NASDAQ: AMZN), which has sold investors on its ability to potentially dominate several markets in the long term, ROKU has no clear path to profitability. As such, it is very difficult to justify ROKU's current share price and market cap of $20.38 and $1.98 billion, respectively.Roku has two main sources of revenue: player revenue (sales of its hardware) and platform revenue (sales of advertising and other services). Player revenue has historically been ROKU's dominant revenue stream; however, given the very low margins earned by ROKU on its player revenue, the company has started an effort to shift the bulk of its revenue to platform revenue. Source: TechCrunchAs of ROKU's most recent SEC filing, platform revenue made up nearly 50% of total revenue. This shift away from hardware sales is in order to take advantage of the much higher margins which ROKU receives on its platform revenue; as the chart below shows, the difference in margins between two revenue streams is enormous. Source: TechCrunchPlatform revenue consists largely of advertising sales, along with commissions received from services (such as HBO Go) sold through ROKU's interface. The most exciting portion of ROKU's platform revenue comes from its licensing agreements with several TV manufacturers, which allow manufacturers to sell smart TVs with ROKU's interface incorporated into the TV itself. In 2016, Roku reported at a net loss for the year of $42.8 million; in Q2 2017, the company reported a loss of $15.5 million, a concerning increase from 2016's average quarterly loss of $10.7 million. Granted, ROKU has increased its average revenue per user (ARPU) each quarter, and his consistently gained new users year after year. Given that the company is moving away from low-margin player sales, it is likely that ROKU might be able to improve overall profit margins going forward; as such, if ROKU can continue to grow its user base and increase ARPU, the company could certainly become profitable within several years. However, ROKU faces major competition from AMZN, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG), and AAPL (NASDAQ: AAPL).The Apple TV, Amazon Fire Stick, and Google Chromecast are all major competitors to ROKU's hardware products. Each product has its own emphasis and special features - Chromecast, for instance, allows users to broadcast content from their devices directly to their TV. ROKU, however, does not provide much that its competitors do not, aside from slightly more expanded streaming options. Finally, and most importantly, ROKU's product is too dependent on products developed by other companies. ROKU does not produce its own original content, unlike some of its competitors, and its value proposition is based on streamlining the provision of its competitor's services. By developing their own hardware, I believe AAPL, GOOG, and AMZN will eventually be able to largely eliminate ROKU as an unnecessary middleman. As of Tuesday's close, ROKU's stock price was $20.38, giving the company a market cap of nearly $2 billion. Given that ROKU registered nearly $400 million in sales in 2016, this is a valuation of five times revenue - a lofty number considering the significant obstacles to ROKU's eventual profitability. I predict that ROKU's stock chart over the next few months will mirror Snap's (NASDAQ: SNAP) in its first few months of trading - wildly overhyped and overbought, resulting in initial gains followed by a long downwards trend to an appropriate level of valuation. I do think ROKU could become profitable in the long run; however, I think that a valuation of around $1 billion (and a stock price in the low $10 range) seems more appropriate as investors to see how ROKU can grow its revenue and fend off competitors in its market. SNAP's stock price since IPO.At its current share price and market cap, ROKU is highly overvalued. Though the company certainly has room for future growth, investors should be cautious going forward, given the intense competition the company faces. As they did on SNAP, I predict that most investors will realize the risks associated with ROKU and sell off over the next few months, driving the stock down to a reasonable valuation. If I didn't have my funds fully invested at the moment, I would short ROKU myself."
4117987,44501,2017-10-30T08:31:04-04:00,"Roku launched a 15.668M share IPO at $14 per share on September 28, 2017.Since the IPO, Roku shares quickly traded to $29, but recently have settled into the $19 range after 30 days of trading.This article provides a fundamental review of ROKU and assesses the prospect for share price upside given the fast growth of the streaming TV market.","The transition from legacy, linear TV programming to a world where content is going to be streamed anywhere, anytime, has reached an inflection point over the past 6-12 months. Investment activity is rampant. Netflix (NFLX), the Wall Street queen of subscription content streaming, is planning to spend over $7-$8B on content in 2018. Disney (DIS) recently announced plans to launch direct-to-consumer services for ESPN and its other brands. CBS' (CBS) All Access is expanding internationally. Apple (AAPL) is reportedly planning on spending $1 billion on original content. Facebook (FB) launched its Watch tab for original videos. And, Amazon (AMZN) is streaming NFL games while its Prime Video service has gone global.And, I believe most importantly, cable network owners have begun licensing their channels to virtual MVPDs (multi-channel video distributors) like Hulu, YouTube (GOOGL) (GOOG), Sling TV (DISH), and DirecTV Now (T), which essentially begins the process of unbundling the linear broadcast monopolies that have kept TV watchers tethered to a cable or satellite connection, rather than simply accessing content they want to watch, when they want to watch, over an internet connection. Hulu, which is a powerful consortium that includes NBC Universal, Disney, ABC, TBS and FOX, is the leader of the pack in my assessment. Hulu's movement from beta trial to live product in May of 2017 will likely mark a major inflection point for the Streaming TV industry.And, in this land of video content and distributor giants, Roku (ROKU) performed a 15.668M share IPO at $14 per share on September 28, 2017, giving the company $126M in fresh capital. (Note: 9M new shares were sold at IPO and 6.668M shares were sold by existing shareholders.) How is a small, emerging growth company like ROKU going to survive in this land of giants? The better question is how is ROKU going to do so with only $183M in cash post IPO? The answer to this question is what may make ROKU the streaming buy of the decade as the market is poised to explode over the next several years.The market for ROKU shares immediately following the IPO on 9/28/2017 was strong as the market closed at $23.50 after the $14 initial offering. From the opening day level, the shares traded as high as $29.80 on the second day of trading, before closing at $26.54. Trading volume on both days was very high, at 39M and 44M, respectively. Considering that the public float on the shares after the offering is only 15.24M shares, there was obviously a lot of flipping of the shares for a quick profit in the initial share launch.Currently, ROKU shares are trading in the $18.50 to $19.00 range, substantially lower than the market trade immediately following the IPO, but still well above the $14/share level the company obtained from the share offering. Is the steep sell-off 30 days after the IPO a troubling signal for ROKU's future? Or, are the shares just undergoing a consolidation phase post IPO as the flippers sell out and longer-term growth buyers slowly buy into the shares at a reasonable price. Given the high 4.13M short interest in the shares as of 10/13/2017, my opinion is that the current decline is trading driven and the shorts will very likely have to cover soon, driving the price back into the range of the first several days of trading.An in-depth analysis of ROKU's fundamentals and market position support this investment view.CEO/Founder Anthony Wood in the company IPO Prospectus states a very succinct mission for ROKU:The company vision is simple, be the ""TV streaming operating system"" which consumers repeatedly log into for access to a very broad range of content available in the video universe. ROKU solves a very unique problem which puts them at the nexus of how the streaming market place will evolve, and most likely thrive for years to come. That problem is that no individual content provider can provide every user all the content they want to watch, when they want to watch it. Additionally, the distributors of content, or the channel aggregators in the linear TV legacy past are stuck in a programming grid that more and more viewers are tuning out by cutting the cord. This is especially true now as the access to more and more content becomes easily accessible over the internet. ROKU is not in the business of competing with MVPDs like Hulu or SVODs like Netflix. ROKU is in the business of creating an ever larger streaming TV ecosystem, and in the process take a portion of the expanding revenue stream.The connection to streaming content, whether subscription or ad based, is where ROKU comes in. ROKU reported having 15.1M active accounts as of June 2017, the clear market leader for access to multi-channel Streaming TV. Having reviewed many Streaming TV client interfaces over the past several years, ROKU is winning in my assessment because it is elegantly simple to set-up and use, with a wide breadth of channel availability. And other than having to pay a small price ($30 to $50 for a very non-obtrusive device that plugs into an HDMI port on your TV), the price to have an account is $0. Many new TVs are coming equipped with ROKU built-in.Most consumers will be able to take ROKU out of the box, if the interface isn't already built into the TV, and with a couple of connections and clicks to set-up, a very wide and quickly expanding range of streaming TV channels, many of which are free (usually meaning ad based), are available. A sample HOME Channel interface screen is pictured in the graphic below and shows how intuitively easy it is so select a channel to begin streaming.The additional strength of the platform in my assessment is the content search capability. Given the breadth of channels available on the interface, ROKU is capable of finding where content is available for a particular consumer, and also keep track and notify via a feed when new release of a particular show or other content becomes available.There are some competitors for the client interface position in the network, like the AirTV Player which is an Android based streaming device provided by a wholly owned subsidiary of DISH Network. AirTV (DISH) in comparison to ROKU is much more limited in channel access other than Sling TV, and the interface is setup to be DISH grid TV first, and alternative streaming channels second. The interface is also very legacy oriented and presently lacks many of the simple advantageous capabilities of ROKU. As a business model, AirTV's intertwined relationship with one MVPD (DISH) is a path in my opinion that is destined for failure because of its limitations for the end consumer. Cord cutters in my review do not want another closed interface box which will limit their TV watching experience in the future.One of the key metrics which shows ROKU's high growth and market acceptance is the number of active accounts streaming content over the access platform over the last 30 days. As of June 2017, that number reached 15.1M accounts. (An active account may have more than one access device, i.e., more than one TV or other streaming device registered to the account)The active account growth over the last 3 ½ years has been very robust, with the past 12-month period showing growth of 43.3%. Investors should also note the seasonal step up that is typical in the 4th quarter due to the Christmas season. Expectations are the Christmas season in 2017 will show a similar strong increase.Streaming over the ROKU access interface reached 11.9B hours on a TTM basis as of June 2017, and hours streaming on a quarterly basis YoY were up 60%.Although streaming hours over the platform is not directly correlated with ROKU revenue because of the various sources of streaming content (subscription, ad based, free), the recent exploding growth has been very beneficial to ROKU's revenue growth with MVPDs like Hulu and others being a key driving force.The revenue metric ROKU points to as a critical indicator of its ongoing success is Average Platform Revenue per User (ARPU). This revenue number grew 34.9% to $11.32 per active account over the past year ending in June 2017.Just 3 years ago the ARPU metric showed only $4.65 per active account at mid-year. But beginning in the 4th quarter of 2015, the pace of growth in ARPU has accelerated.Looking at sales overall, ROKU recorded overall sales of $436M on a TTM basis as of June 2017. Total sales, broken down by ROKU Player revenue and Platform revenue, grew at a rate of 22.7% annually. The source of sales growth, however, was heavily weighted toward Platform revenue.Platform revenue is a function of subscription sharing and ad revenue generated on the installed base of ROKU accounts. This revenue level showed a very high growth rate of 94.6% YoY through mid-year 2017. Alternatively, the company has chosen to provide its Players for sale in the market at very affordable price points to encourage more consumers to equip their TVs with a ROKU client interface and begin streaming content. The low priced ROKU Player consumer options has resulted in lower Player sales growth (3.6% YoY), but increased the number of active accounts that are or potentially can be monetized.ROKU's gross profit over the last 12 months shows the company's current aggressive ROKU Player distribution strategy is positively affecting the direction of company profitability. ROKU's actions to aggressively grow its active number of accounts by making device purchase low cost and set-up very simple, and then monetizing the installed base with high margin subscription revenue share or ad based services is pushing company gross profit up, and gross margin overall is improving.For the 12-month period ending in June 2017, ROKU's gross profit increased 43.4%. The biggest driver of gross profit growth was Platform sales which showed gross margin of 75.6% in the first six months of 2017.Breaking gross profit down, Player gross profit actually fell by 18.6% due to ROKU's aggressive pricing strategy. However, Platform gross profit more than compensated for the decline, growing at a rate of 96.5%.On a trailing 12-month basis, overall gross margin YoY improved in the 2nd quarter of 2017 to 33.4% from 28.9%. Additionally, ROKU's gross margin for the 2nd quarter alone was 37.8%.The ROKU ad revenue model is likely to provide high upside growth over the long term as the over-the-top streaming market continues to evolve. The key for a company like ROKU is its position at the client access point (the TV) for a large installed base of Streaming TV users. This network position allows ROKU to implement a unique user ad model for any content at any time. Today, linear broadcast feeds insert ads based on time slots of broadcast and expected viewership. Subscriber video on demand business models or SVOD, (Netflix, HBO, etc.) charge the customer for content views without advertisement. Advertising video on demand, or AVOD, is the new frontier, and ROKU is the only pure play public company in the space positioned to take advantage of the market as it evolves.A good way to see how the AVOD model is likely to change the way millions of viewers are likely to get an expanding menu of great streaming TV and movie content for free in the future is by trying out the ROKU channel. I have watched several movies on the channel, and noticed the ads in the process. First, the ad content was brief, usually 15 seconds, and surprisingly was almost always targeted to something that was very likely to be relevant to me (or family). And secondly, and probably more important to consumers, the amount of ad content was substantially lower than broadcast network TV because the ad model is much more efficient and valuable for the advertiser. Hulu and CBS All Access also have AVOD based models using limited advertising for specific content. ROKU is positioned in the network to assist these content suppliers and others in implementing targeted advertising for each unique streaming session.ROKU is currently an emerging growth company, and as such, investors should not be surprised to see that overall net profit and EBITDA are still negative on a trailing 12-month basis. No pain, no gain in a market space that is emerging from infancy but remains in early development phase. More investment is very likely to be required before a sustainable quarter by quarter profit level is achieved.However, the operating cash flow burn rate at ROKU is surprisingly very reasonable for a high growth technology company. And, with $183M of cash on the balance sheet and an annual burn rate that is approaching break-even, the company is in a very strong position to execute its current strategy to grow its installed base of ROKU active users without financial stress over the intermediate, and possibly even the long term.The indication of how close ROKU is to reaching sustained profitability can be found by reviewing the quarterly net profit and EBITDA results over the past 18 months. Note how the company popped to a profitable quarter in 4Q 2016 when seasonal demand for new Players was high and active account usage and users increased strongly. Overall revenue during 4Q'16 was $147M, which equates to an annual run-rate of $588M. At this revenue level, the company showed a $3.23M quarterly net profit on a gross margin of 30.3%.Since December of 2016, ROKU has continued to grow Platform revenue much faster than overall sales, thereby improving margins. Overall sales revenue on a TTM basis is now $436M, and based on current market activity, it is very likely that ROKU will have over $500M in 2017 revenue. Given the margin improvement trend, this revenue run rate may be sufficient to make the company break even on a net profit basis for the full year within the next 6-12 months. Given the fast pace of growth being exhibited by MVPDs like Hulu and the increase in cord cutters noted in AT&T 3Q results, this estimate is entirely possible for ROKU shareholders.ROKU 3Q results will be published on November 8th.As with any investment, determining whether the current price is a good entry or exit point is critical to long-term reward. For emerging growth companies, particularly ones that are addressing a developing market, getting a sense of fair value is more art than science in my judgment.ROKU is very unique as an investment in the manner it is addressing the over-the-top TV streaming emerging market, its leadership position within that market segment, and how it will make money in the future. I do not know of another company that is a perfect pure streaming TV play comp in the public market today from which to judge whether $14 or $29 or some price is the fair price per share for ROKU. Some analysts on the Street are doing comps relative to digital advertising and advertising technology peers and justifying ROKUs price on its leadership and growth prospect relative to the group. Analysts at Oppenheimer and RBC Capital Markets initiated coverage of ROKU at sector perform and set price targets of $23 and $26 respectively. (See here)The one certainty about trying to value ROKU is that the number of pure play Streaming TV public company peers to ROKU is limited, possibly non-existent presently. The majority of the TV streaming market investment activity is being made in large tech companies like Apple, Google and Amazon or is buried in content providers like Disney, CBS, TBS, FOX and NBC Universal that have established business models that they need to transition to reach the over the top evolving market.The only publicly traded investment pure play in the Streaming TV market that I currently see is Netflix. I realize that it is a complete apples and oranges comparison to review these two companies side by side. Netflix is a SVOD model where content acquisition and relevance drives their ability to attract and keep subscribers, whereas ROKU is a step higher in the food chain, focused on enabling the entire Streaming TV eco-system and monetizing the new AVOD streaming frontier. However, to the extent both companies are deriving their future growth from the same market phenomenon (TV viewer transition to streaming), and the gross margin in the businesses are similar (currently Netflix ""cost of revenue"" margin is 33.3%, ROKU's gross margin is 37.8%), investors should want to understand how the two businesses compare on a valuation basis.Currently, Wall Street investors are willing to pay $194 a share for the future of Netflix. This price level is almost 200 time earnings, and gives the company an $87B valuation on sales revenue of almost $11B on a TTM basis. Netflix reports positive earnings, as well as EBITDA. However, the one metric that shows the risk loaded in this stock is the amount of investment the company is continually making too keep its content new and relevant. Currently, Netflix is on track to invest almost $2.5B in cash flow on content and all the streaming equipment needed to deliver the content in 2017, which means from an operational standpoint Netflix is a big cash consuming giant with a very high stock valuation. The market has been more than willing to pay a high price for this business model in order to get a piece of the Streaming TV market action.ROKU, on the other hand is much smaller presently in revenue size, with only $436M (about 25x less than Netflix, but only 5.3x less on a per share basis). As of 10-25-2017, ROKU had a market cap of $1.8B, 48 times less than Netflix. As I showed earlier in this report, ROKU has not yet reached sustained profitability, but may well get to breakeven within 6 months to a year time frame. Based on this assessment alone, given the gross margins in the two business models are similar, the substantial relative gap between the market capitalizations of the two businesses is likely to close quickly as the ROKU business scales up. On a relative size basis, Netflix has 4.72 times more shares outstanding, is slightly profitable ($1 per share) at $11B in revenue, and has a market cap of $87B. If ROKU reaches a similar level of profitability ($94M per year in net profit would be $1 per share), will the market be as generous in its valuation? If so, the market cap of ROKU could jump to $18B, 10x the current stock price level. I do not know if this would happen, but it is definitely possible that if ROKU's revenue scales to the $1B level in the next 2-3 years, which is likely, it should be capable of producing $1 per share in net profit.One big difference I see between Netflix and ROKU is the amount of investment required to monetize the market opportunity. Netflix requires substantial, persistent investment to be the premiere SVOD streaming play. ROKU, on the other hand, is poised to make money much more like Google has done with ads in internet search. ROKU is already operating cash flow positive, while Netflix is continually operating cash flow negative at over $1 per share per quarter, or $4.15 annually. This point of relative comparison reinforces the view that ROKU, at $19 per share, is likely being substantially undervalued in the market post IPO. If ROKU can scale without share dilution as it ramps up revenue to $1B to $2B annually, the relative valuation gap between the two investments should close quickly.Daniel Moore is the author of the book Theory of Financial Relativity.

Recently Roku not only increased the amount of advertisements in each group from 3 to 4, but they also increased their frequency to about every 8 to 10 minutes. Yes, 2 minutes of ads every 10 minutes or so.And THAT is when I stopped caring about The Roku Channel and chose to watch those movies and programs on the myriad of other options such as Netflix, Amazon, or YouTube.And I was not the only one,Source: Roku BlogThe above is a screenshot of just one of many comments on Roku's website complaining about the increased ads on The Roku Channel.As much as Pandora (P) was a leader in the streaming music channel, Roku is a leader in the streaming video space. Being the leader does not, however, generate PROFITS especially when both were built upon the concept of FREE.""The Roku Channel"" is an important project for Roku as they attempt to transition from hardware sales to ongoing advertising revenues.Roku was built upon ""free"" and unfortunately, ad-sponsored content will not likely be the way Roku grows, especially since they CANNOT monetize their top viewed content, Netflix, Amazon, Youtube, and Hulu.Can you imagine the outrage if Roku decided to put their ads into those premium services? How quickly would those services pull their channels?There is a reason why Netflix, Amazon, and Google are investing billions into exclusive content. That is the ONLY way they can compete with each other and ensure people have a reason to subscribe, especially if they already have a subscription to another service.More than that, all three have multitudes of ways of sharing their content, everything from mobile devices to built-in apps in TVs, Bluray players, gaming consoles and set-top boxes from your cable companies.Beyond that, both Amazon and Google have their own streaming devices.Roku is just the middleman with ZERO exclusive content of their own, nor are they in a position to invest billions in creating their own content with their small size and ongoing financial concerns.As much as retail was cut out to a large extent with the growth in direct to consumer e-commerce, companies like Amazon, Google, and Netflix cut out the middleman as it comes to licensing fees paid to studios by investing in their own shows.What most people take for granted, and what I believe many Roku investors are choosing to ignore is that Roku needs its competitors, they DO NOT need Roku.Does anyone believe that Roku would survive if Netflix decided to stop streaming to Roku devices?This is a real possibility if Netflix does not renew their agreement.Google? They are already giving Roku the cold shoulder with YouTube being the only notable Google app on Roku. You can, however, watch them all on the Google Chromecast device.Amazon? If it is not on the Roku, it is on Android devices and very soon will be available on the Apple TV devices. Of course, Amazon Prime Video is also available on their various Fire devices.Roku's success will only be around as long Google, Netflix, and Amazon let it be successful. At any point in time, those content providers can simply pull their content from Roku or flood the market with even cheaper devices putting more pricing pressures on Roku as they have already done.Roku didn't help themselves recently, however...It seems since the IPO, Roku has been rushing and it shows.First was the lackluster ""Roku Channel."" More recently, however, was a pushed system update that caused numerous audio and video errors.The Roku Reddit sub is now mostly filled with errors rather than an actual discussion which we were used to seeing discussing channels, devices, and uses.Source: RedditOf course, it is not limited to just Reddit and there are more and more users reporting issues on Twitter and other sites.The problem for Roku is that these are not minor occurrences but major issues, and something that would be thoroughly tested and avoided in a major release by Apple, Amazon, and Google.The reason why this is a major problem is that unlike those other devices, Roku forces you to update through their automatic updates. With the competitors, the users at least have an option of waiting to do a major update until all of the bugs are found and worked out.Roku also recently released a number of new devices. In true disappointment fashion, however, the new high-end device is actually a downgrade from the previous high-end device as Roku removed a digital output port on the Ultra model.Where this shows up in the investment world is that consumers do not want to deal with errors and problems. If I am watching Netflix and I am having issues with the Roku device, I will not tolerate it and simply put on Netflix on my Apple TV, Blue-ray player, cable box or gaming consoles and still be able to watch it on my TV. Ongoing issues will reflect poorly in future hardware sales, especially when the newer devices are not actually better.On November 8th after market close, Roku is set to report their Q3 2017 results, their first earnings report as a public company.Even though this earnings report will not cover any periods as a publicly traded company, it will be interesting to see what they plug in expense wise. I fully expect more losses.Technically speaking, the chart is looking bad for longs.Source: TradingViewAfter the initial IPO highs, the stock sold off and after a few days, tested the $25 range. Since then, it has been in a sell-off mode.The momentum is bearish and getting more so. After a few days of very tight trading, the Bollinger bands have started opening up and unfortunately for Roku, they are heading lower.I am currently short the stock from my original $25.XX entry and will continue to hold it short, either via short stock or long puts.I do not currently see anything as an investor or as a Roku user that would send the stock higher in the intermediate to longer term."

I think not.","Roku Inc. (ROKU) IPO'd with great and well-deserved hype as its streaming TV stick has gone viral, having accumulated more than 16.7M registered users since its release. The stock's IPO raised $137M for the company to apply toward its continued growth.Just five weeks after IPO'ing, its first quarterly report as a public company revealed a terrific increase in year-over-year revenue exceeding 40%. Although investors' exuberance may be tempered by the quarterly loss of $46M despite revenue growth.In response to the sales growth, Roku stock's price exploded from $17.00 to $32.00 per share. Now we're heading into another week and the question on every observer's mind is, ""Will Roku Stock Keep Going Strong?""I delved into the quarterly report and found the..1. Roku's Reported Quarterly Free Cash Flow Is InflatedRoku's free cash flow rang in at $22M while its liabilities grew by $63M more than its assets for the period. It looks like Roku may be starting to build a habit of kicking the can down the road when it comes to paying its vendors, and its growth initiatives have required far more investment than what the business is presently earning.How long will Roku run this deficit against its balance sheet and will it force the company to continue expanding its debt facilities? It's too early to tell for sure, but the interest payments the company is adopting won't do any favors to the company's presently thin operating margins.If the company can't turn around their operating deficit soon, investors will have to start asking themselves whether the business model is really going to generate a sustainable profit even at-scale. After all, isn't serving 16.7M users already operating at a pretty large scale?2. There Are More Than 80,000,000 Common Stock Shares Outstanding Than You ThinkThe company's recent report makes its earnings per share calculation against a common stock shares outstanding base of 5,259,796, and the company's tradable float is restricted to approximately this number of Class A shares.A quick peek under the hood showed me there are over 80,000,000 Class B common stock shares in the hands of insiders and early investors.Some timing-related accounting techniques enabled the company to defer the recognition of these shares in the Income & Cash Flows Statements until the next quarterly report (expected next year).When these newly minted common stock shares hit the books, it will be more clear to shareholders than for every $1 of potential earnings today's stockholders believe they have a right to there is only going to be 1/16th of that claim available - so how many Roku shareholders do you think may not know they have just a 1/16th claim on future earnings than the accounting statements recently presented? What will they do when they realize this at the next quarterly report?3. The Control Premium Is Not Available To You Nor I, Common PlebeiansIn the same vein of IPO'ing a company with a share class structure, which deprives the public markets from any real voting power, Roku has pulled a Snap Inc. (SNAP) move. The Roku Class A shares trading in the marketplace today control 2% of the votes in the company's governance.This ownership structure deprives these publicly traded shares of the Control Premium well known by stock analysts to be integral to the pricing power of a common stock when considering the value of ownership in a company.You can look at SNAP's price chart and see how the company's stock has suffered. Just how much of SNAP's collapse from $30 per share to $13 per share is attributable to a devaluation based on the Control Premium's absence?It is impossible to tell in exact terms, although the penalty for the absence of Control is surely substantial because most long-term investors understand the importance of actually owning a piece of a company instead of merely owning a literally meaningless, dividend-less, no-significant-voting-power claim on a company such as ROKU and SNAP represent.When will ROKU holders realize they hold a common stock claim looking a lot more like SNAP than they might like?In summary, we're looking at net cash flows portrayed to be greater than they really are, the relief of artificial scarcity in shares as the recognized common stock shares expands from ~5,000,000 to ~85,000,000, and zero control premium available to the publicly marketed common stock shares - these three factors be enough to collapse the price per share of Roku.But will it go further up before it goes down? It's hard to tell owing to the tight float and the hype around the company right now, but from the $30s, there is plenty of medium-term pain to come for shareholders.Source: Roku 10-Q For the quarterly period ended 9/30/17"
4112055,82146,2017-10-06T06:38:25-04:00,"Roku recently entered the world of Wall Street.After an exciting IPO debut, the shares have sold off.The company's stock, being so young, cannot tell us a lot of information yet; traders are still figuring out this new story.Buying Roku is a bet that it will eventually compete with Netflix and Disney by producing original content.","Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) recently became a publicly traded stock. It is a streaming concern that produces devices powered by a proprietary operating system for purposes of allowing companies that aggregate and produce content, such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), to place their content on television sets. Consumers buy Roku products so they can watch stuff from Netflix, etc.As such, to me that's a rather boring line of business into which to buy. Not necessarily a huge moat against competition. Plus, the company is challenged from a profitability standpoint. (That may be an understatement; according to this piece, Roku hasn't seen positive earnings for well over a decade.)I am nevertheless interested in the stock. The reasons for my interest are very speculative, and that should be noted. But even with the speculative angle, I can't help but want to do more research on the company.Anyone who has read my articles knows what I'm going to say next: it is the original content angle that has me excited about Roku.At this time, the company isn't talking about that. In fact, this article over at MarketWatch clearly states the thinking on the part of management about how it intends to grow. Licensing of the software, advertising, and revenue-split for products sold to consumers on its platform are, for now, its business model. (This Seeking Alpha piece poses a good question about the eventual saturation Roku may face.)I doubt that's a forever plan. It can't be.Roku has built out a solid technological platform that can aggregate the products of different content producers and provides an alternative to multi-channel video programming distributors. Consumers have choice at this point, and they can do something about the fabled cord - cut it out entirely, reduce it, subscribe to a service here and a service there for a few months and then go on to other ones, etc.Tech companies don't always rely on their technologies/platforms to be used by others to make money; they can, but once you've got a platform for content providers to use to create connections with consumers, the platform maker is going to look at the platform and come up with ideas of its own - channels, subscription services, what have you. I oftentimes use the private-label analogy - a supermarket will not just sell brands from other companies; it has created a platform - shelf space - and it will fill some of that space with its own concoctions. Margins are better, but most importantly, there is an opportunity for the supermarket to differentiate its inventory from that of the competitor.It's a little different with tech companies that rely on video content partners. Obviously, a lot of consumers probably don't decide to travel to a distant supermarket to get generic foodstuffs, as private-label products are commodities that oftentimes aren't that different from one company to the next - i.e., generic peanut butter at supermarket A is probably very similar to supermarket B's version (even if they aren't, no one thinks about it). Video content, however, actual filmed entertainment, is different - it can differentiate a business model more strongly than a private-label program. Time Warner's (NYSE:TWX) HBO and CBS's Showtime are both premium cable channels that use similar technologies, but you're going to gravitate toward one or the other based on the exclusive content contained within (the non-exclusive output deals with studios provide some differentiation as well, but while that content can be had elsewhere if needed, it isn't as compelling).It really is as simple as that to me. Roku will talk now about these other strategies, but my thinking is that, as the stock is analyzed by Wall Street and as traders battle to place a valuation on it, and as think pieces begin to emerge with their own attempts to place the company in perspective against the backdrop of the new streaming age, some of the real estate in the mind of the management team will be taken up by thoughts of taking capital and investing it in the production of exclusive content. (Hollywood will certainly welcome yet another buyer of its wares.)There is precedence. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the biggest platform/ecosystem players. Yet, we know of that company's interest in making original content. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for years said it was only a platform, but its recent moves in the video space indicate otherwise. Disney (NYSE:DIS) felt BAMTech was a great investment, but it wasn't solely because of the platform for the platform's sake - the company wants to go its own way and compete with Netflix because it believes its content is too valuable to share. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) couldn't stay a retailer for long; instead, it too wanted to be a mogul. Yes, content is king. (And branding is a royal cousin.)Roku will eventually play the Netflix game. What is that exactly? The company is overpaying Hollywood now (via debt) for total return in the future. I don't think it will jump in to the deep end of content-production pool just yet, but if the company decides to eventually swim on its own, then it will need money to, as I always say, find its own Stranger Things.There are risks to this investment idea. Check out Gary Alexander's thoughts on this here. Also, Maks F.S. lists some concerns. I do not in any way dismiss these warnings. I think, however, Roku isn't done evolving; it's probably only beginning. I also want to point out an article that includes a section on Roku, specifically some thoughts by Jim Cramer. Mr. Cramer didn't think the stock was a buy at the time, and he focused on the current business model, with no mention of an original content catalyst.I like to pull up stock charts, but in this case it won't mean anything. What action should an investor take? That's the real point. Roku is a new issue that I think should be investigated and not dismissed. I don't think the company is going to start making movies immediately (and I obviously can't say with certainty it will) or begin its own quest to become the next Disney, but it would be puzzling to me if Roku doesn't eventually engage that business model. A platform for others is a good business; creating content and IP for one's own platform, using the revenue share from other partners as a hedge, can turn out to be a great business. Netflix is the king of streaming, but there will be room for others. Roku's management must look into this area to grow shareholder value."
4113020,99506,2017-10-12T08:00:00-04:00,"Wall Street is infamous for bringing overvalued tech IPOs during the latter stages of a bull market.Many of these IPO overvaluations are driven by an attractive product or service that captures the attention of investors.The narrative of a hot product or service enables IPO underwriters to drum up enthusiasm for the offering, hence the overvalued offering price.After the IPO party is over, then the reality of quarterly financial reports begin to hit home. It becomes clear that the over-promised hype of the IPO does not match the reality of the company's actual performance.This is the classic pump and dump scheme that Wall Street underwriters have employed for decades. Millennials being the newest generation to experience Wall Street's ways are now likely wiser, albeit less wealthy.","Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) is becoming a cult stock. Visit the chat rooms of any stock forum and gauge the age, investment experience, and enthusiasm of investors in Roku. If you have been frequenting chat forums on Seeking Alpha and elsewhere for relatively recent IPOs like GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO), Fitbit (NASDAQ: FIT), Snap (NASDAQ: SNAP) and now Roku then you are aware of the strong affinity of millennials for these stocks and respective products. It is great to see the next generation of capitalists emerging. It is not so great to see how Wall Street has been treating these younger investors.Wall Street apparently loves to foist exciting tech IPOs upon investors in the cult followings that exist for some companies making their debut in the public markets. It seem that the larger the cult following, the better the chances for the IPO to be priced at a sky-high valuation. A higher valuation helps the company and the underwriters make more money from the sale of the IPO to the public. But what does the public receive in return for paying this sky-high valuation to own the stock after the IPO? Consider your investment in these over-hyped IPOs to be a payment of tuition to the school of hard knocks. Please, I am just the messenger. And if it helps at all (it won't) then please understand that Wall Street has been dumping over-hyped tech IPOs upon all of us since the days of Apple Computer (NASDAQ: AAPL).This historical price data for Apple Computer, yes it was later renamed as just Apple, is split-adjusted. So the actual IPO price of Apple on December 12, 1980, was $22 per share. The historical data shows that by September 25, 1981, just ten months later the stock had lost more than half of its value. Keep this in mind the next time that you read one of those ""pie in the sky"" articles about how easy it would have been to make a fortune off of Apple stock if only you had just bought the IPO in 1980. A more recent example of a great company coming public at a price that was initially overvalued, at least in the short term, is Facebook (NASDAQ: FB). The chart below tells a similar story to the historical price action of Apple. Yes, both Apple and Facebook advanced to become tremendous success stories, but nevertheless the IPO price of both stocks was cut in half soon after coming public:Recently, we have seen the next generation of Wall Street investors being brutally indoctrinated into the perverse and twisted world of Wall Street. There have been a number of millennial-favorite IPOs that defied gravity at their onset, soon to come back down to earth in a sharp price decline. It is possible that many millennials bought into the initial hype of these IPOs only to be disappointed by the ensuing price action as the markets brought these stocks down lower. We have seen this story play out several times recently in the following charts for relatively recent IPOs:GoPro, Fitbit and Snap are fairly recent examples of IPOs by smaller companies that wanted to compete against larger, better capitalized, major technology companies. Making the price performance of these IPOs in the aftermarket that much more dismal was the over-hyped valuation that the companies and their Wall Street underwriters were motivated to sell to unsuspecting investors.Each of these IPO cult stocks have had their die-hard followings who are often overly focused upon the product's potential at the expense of the quarterly financial reports. These less experienced investors believe that their positive experience with the product will translate into a winning stock performance. Nothing could be further from the truth. After the IPO hype fades then it becomes increasingly about valuation and quarterly reports to determine the stock's trading range. As newer investors we are all much more intrigued with the ""story stocks"" while they are in their romance phase. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) is a good example of a stock that has been in a long romance phase that does not reflect current reality. A lot of hype and enthusiasm often surrounds the IPO of story stocks in their romance phase. These stocks trade higher out of the IPO gate, then they correct sharply. Ultimately, these stocks too often become a broken IPO. The quarterly financial reports impose reality upon the wild-eyed idealism of the cult-like investors in these companies. Markets efficiently adjust the IPO bubble's enthusiasm to reduce the extreme over-valuation down to a more reasonable price level for the stock. And generally, these more reasonable price levels are below the over-hyped valuation of the IPO price. So it actually is reasonable that so many of the recent tech IPOs have traded back down to become broken IPOs.Trader's Idea Flow believes that Roku will become another broken tech IPO as we discussed in this recent article. Valuation is a key reason why we believe that Roku will trade below its $14 IPO price in the near term.Valuation Especially during the latter stages of a bull market, Wall Street and tech companies attempt to bring IPOs to market at valuations that could not be achieved in less enthusiastic markets. This piece from an Indian investor discusses the universal hype-cycle of the IPO that prevails globally due to market psychology. During a bull market IPO cycle even money-losing companies are assigned arbitrary valuations that are intended to benefit the issuing company and its underwriters at the expense of the public investors. It may not be Wall Street at its worst but it certainly is Wall Street at its most avaricious. Caveat emptor is the phrase that investors want to keep uppermost in their minds during this current bull market IPO cycle.Prudent investors also want to keep in mind that Roku has never been profitable in its 15-year existence. That is a long time to remain in business without ever posting even one year of profitability. The Roku IPO is exactly the type of money-losing, over-hyped IPO that investors want to avoid. Forget about how great that you personally think the product may be. Your anecdotal evidence should not influence your investment decisions. Rather, think like the institutional investors who drive markets with their large capital flows. Consider what an institutional investor wants to see, and does not want to see, from a new IPO.Roku's Form S-1 states that it may never achieve profitability. The rising costs associated with competition from superior technology companies means that Roku may experience increasing losses in the near future. Page 16 of the S-1 begins the discussion of Risk Factors for Roku in the public markets. The excerpt below is taken from the first risk factor listed (apologies for the small font size):The excerpt above is basically telling investors that the first quarterly financial report out of the IPO gate may contain higher expenses and larger losses than previously experienced by the company. This is not likely to help the stock price to maintain its current overvalued post-IPO price status.This excellent SA article by Maks F.S. does a great job of breaking down this IPO's overvaluation. Suffice to say that the $14 IPO valuation ($1.3B market cap) was about double what a reasonable investor would value the stock. If this sounds difficult to believe, then simply ask yourself the following question: ""Did this company's management pay Wall Street many millions of dollars to benefit themselves or to benefit me the public, retail investor?"" Yep. You got it. The $14 IPO price was about double what the stock might be worth.Candidly, even that $7 per share valuation is extremely generous but I just don't think that many readers would allow for the truth of a valuation in the $4 per share range. And today the price of Roku shares trade at $24 giving it a $2.3B market cap. Again, forget how great you personally believe the product may be and think like an institutional investor who considers valuation relative to comparable companies. Consider how the upcoming quarterly financial report will impact the stock when higher expenses cause larger losses. These are literally the key factors that will determine the bottom line for the company's financials. And these factors will drive the large capital flows that impact this stock's price. Because Roku has no earnings it is not possible to measure the price/earnings ratio to compare valuations for this IPO. Instead, a discussion of the price/sales ratio become relevant. What reasonable investor believes that sales of Roku's product mix deserves a higher P/S ratio than Apple and is nearly on par with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)? The following graphic illustrates the overvalued nature of the stock in its current trading range:SummaryIn Q217 over 50% of Roku's total revenues came from sales of its hardware products. And these important hardware sales declined by a problematic 11% in the quarter meaning that the company's growth of user base due to hardware sales is in decline. This strong article by SA's Gary Alexander discusses how a decline in hardware sales will lead to a deceleration of platform sales growth. When an overvalued IPO shows the market deceleration of growth in any key metrics, then investors should beware. Snap's stock crashed 23% in one session when Q117 financials were reported and showed deceleration of user growth and revenue growth. This was Snap's first quarterly report after their over-hyped IPO. Investors must understand that these overhyped IPOs are pricing in unrealistic expectations that cannot possibly met by the actual quarterly results. And for those investors who actually read the S-1 prior to investing in Roku, (where is that individual, I know that person is present here somewhere and from what I can tell he isn't a millennial), then you know that the company has literally told us that this first quarterly report after the IPO will have higher expenses. This is likely to cause a larger loss for the quarter. ConclusionThe Roku IPO was to brought to market with much hype and has traded far into overvalued territory after the IPO's debut. We can take a guess at what the market might do to the stock price of Roku if the first quarterly report surprises to the downside as Snap's first quarterly report did. The date for Roku's first quarterly financial report since IPO has not yet been announced.This discussion of relative valuation may provide readers with an additional perspective. A key excerpt is shown below in which it is illustrated that Roku's market cap is 50% higher than Fitbit's market cap, yet Roku has only 1/7 the revenue of Fitbit:A final word about the potential for an acquisition of Roku: After 15 years on the private market an offer for a buyout could have been made at any point. No buyout of Roku ever took place. It is likely that Roku could have been bought for a much cheaper acquisition price when it was private. Now that the substantial IPO overvaluation has been built into the price of the company's market cap an acquisition would seem less likely. There is no defensible technology moat for the company's products. And Roku is a perennial money loser. It would seem more efficient, cheaper, and smarter for competition to simply continue to develop their own ecosystem of products that will become superior to Roku's products over time. And speaking of time, Roku's cash burn rate already is reducing the company's cash position quarterly. The R&D expenses alone to try to compete and stay ahead of competing major technology companies is a major drain on this money losing company's cash position. An acquisition now after 15 years of being available at much cheaper prices is not likely."
4112110,86186,2017-10-06T12:04:06-04:00,"Roku successfully positioned itself as a key participant connecting consumers and their content in a rapidly evolving entertainment economy.So successfully, that the $1 billion IPO doubled to well over $2 billion as it freed to trade.If the bull thesis is Roku's ""platform"" business, what would the company be worth if it executes, grows platform revenues and becomes profitable?","As a former Wall Street guy, I’d live for moments when the market set itself up to present an almost perfect trade opportunity. Typically, this would happen in the format of a “pairs” trade: you’d see the price of one thing take off, while something very closely related to it – a comparable – would stay stuck, for whatever reason.Then you’d hit the phones and breathlessly call a customer, and say, “Look, John, I am watching the price of Company A trade through the roof, and Company B is in the same sector and in the same line of business and makes more or less the same money and is, right now, worth half as much.”If I was lucky, John would either sell me A (and I’d make a commission), or buy some B (and I’d make a commission) or – and this would be ideal – John would simultaneously sell me A and buy some B because regardless of what the “right” price for either company was, since they were so similar, the gap between the two valuations had to close.So, I would make two commissions, and buy John a fancy dinner.That said, where am I going with this, and how is it related to Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU)?Let me come right out and say it: I spend a lot of time at my day job thinking about the future of entertainment, which represents a problem that very few market participants have yet figured out. And right now, the uncertainties in this market are creating a pretty remarkable pair.Entertainment is simultaneously fragmenting and expanding across multiple devices (your TV, laptop, tablet, phone, and potentially even your watch) and via multiple channels (linear vs. OTT). As legacy participants compete with emerging platforms for dominance, the only thing we know for sure is that not even insiders know how exactly to play their cards.For example, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) – which, if you’ll recall, was going to murder linear TV and incumbent cable operators – went ahead and partnered with Comcast to get a spot on its X1 box this summer. This follows Verizon buying both AOL and Yahoo – which maybe makes sense, but only in the context of knowing that companies everywhere are scrambling to figure out how to connect themselves to consumers – and provide them with the content they want, when they want it, how they want it.Enter Roku, which very smartly sold itself to public investors as a little streaming Switzerland, perched symbiotically as a valued intermediary between consumers and the content they want to stream. In an entertainment world gone mad, after all, who doesn’t like the idea of being the platform that is focused on solving a key delivery and connectivity problem?Further, despite the fact Roku doesn’t make money (nothing like seeing this line in a prospectus: “We began operations in 2002 and for all of our history we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations"") there seems to be another good story here: forget about our hardware business, even though it is our biggest source of revenue, because it is low margin. Rather, the bull thesis is to focus on the “platform” offering – the ad sales and licensing revenue, which has higher margins and can really scale. That “platform” is currently growing for Roku and again, is possible to visualize this kind of platform as a key node in the future of entertainment.As it happens, I agree with this thinking. My view: a platform focused on the consumer experience – and connecting them to their content, in any and every way they want – will be a central, critical, and valuable part of the fast-evolving entertainment ecosystem.It also happens you can buy a company that is located precisely in the middle of this ecosystem, that sells hardware directly to consumers that will, agnostically, connect them to their content on any device and across every channel, and sells their operating system to content providers to customize for their own boxes and delivery systems. They also sell data analytics, and have a metadata offering that is critical in indexing content so that it is searchable and shareable.And, they currently generate more revenue than Roku does, but there’s a key difference: they’re do all this profitably, to the tune of millions of dollars.What is the name of this mysterious company you have never heard of before?It’s TiVo (NASDAQ:TIVO) – or, the company everyone has heard of before, but somehow, nobody is paying attention to right now.So last week, as I watched Roku break to trade to a market cap well in excess of TiVo’s, I have to say, the first thought that jumped to mind was “pairs trade”.We have to do a little homework to stack the two companies up, primarily because last year Rovi purchased TiVo, keeping the name, and adding a significant IP business. When the deal closed in September of 2016 TiVo was worth $1.1 billion, and Rovi was worth roughly the same.TiVo certainly suffers from low visibility – a number of publishing analysts have dropped the name since the Rovi acquisition closed, and the stock has quietly traded sideways over the past year (despite paying a dividend).But for kicks, let’s take the first half of the year from TiVo, strip out the IP results as best we can (creating a ""platform"" comp), and stack the numbers up next to Roku.At the moment, you can buy Roku for just over $2 billion dollars, and here’s what that gets you (again, just using 1H17 numbers):Factoring out the hardware (remember: hardware isn't part of the thesis here), you get Roku’s “future of entertainment” business – the higher margin OS licensing model, and the ability to monetize consumers by stuffing ads in front of them – ringing in at maybe $83 million (and no profit, but who’s counting).Or, you can buy all of TiVo for just over $2 billion, and here’s what you’d get (again, first half):If we leave a couple hundred million in IP revenues on the table, along with the $22 million in hardware (again recalling that forgetting about hardware is part of the Roku pitch) you get TiVo’s “future of entertainment” business – the high margin OS licensing model, and the software and analytics critical to driving the consumer digital experience (and content sellers’ understanding of it) – ringing in at $193 million. Oh, and there’s a profit here, with adjusted EBITDA of roughly $27M .Both companies have roughly equal R&D spend (about 19% of revenue), so there’s no glaring gap there.Begging the question: if you had these two options before you at roughly the same price and wanted to participate in the future of entertainment, and in particular, locate yourself at the critical junction between consumers and the universe of content and providers trying to get to them, which one would you pick?Would it sway your opinion if I threw in a few hundred million in IP revenues, and millions of dollars in profits, to sweeten the deal? Candidly, it fascinates me that TiVo has escaped notice and mention while Roku’s story – and stock – soars. TiVo even suffered the indignity of not even being mentioned once as a competitive threat to Roku in their S1, even though the lawyers threw in Google, Apple, Amazon, Comcast, and even DVD’s – DVD’s, for the love of Mercy!To conclude, look, I’m not a stock guy. I’m not being hyperbolic, and I’m not trying to get anyone to actually put on a trade.I’m not saying Roku stock is too high in the absolute.I’m not saying TiVo’s stock is too low in the absolute.But I am saying that, as I see it, the two occupy roughly the same space, and have a very similar – and interesting – set of options in front of them. My view is simple: if you believe in the Roku investment thesis, then you have to believe in TiVo.At this point in time, for anyone willing to do a candid assessment of the business lines and numbers involved here, you’ll find an unusual and frankly difficult to explain distance between these two companies from a valuation perspective.Now, excuse me while I call my old friend John and see if I can get him to put on a pairs trade – the key difference being, if he does it, he’ll have to buy me dinner at the end of the day (after all, I’m retired)."
4111429,79445,2017-10-03T14:42:11-04:00,"A look at Roku's valuations.Comparing Roku with GoPro and Fitbit to get a sense of what IPO investors may expect.My price targets for the stock, both long and short term.","I had to do it, it was too good to pass up.Roku (ROKU) joined my club of companies whose products I really love and believe in, but either avoid or sold short.One of the things that I try to constantly remind people is that you have to disconnect the love of the product or service with the business and the stock price.In the past few months there were a few such examples. Since the beginning of the year I have been warning readers about the headwinds to be faced by the firearms industry with companies such as American Outdoor Brands (AOBC), Ruger (RGR), Vista Outdoor (VSTO) and others. As much as I believe in gun rights, a Trump Presidency was horrible news for the gun industry. The publicly traded stocks have been pummeled this year. ""Shot Show 2017: A Warning Shot Across The Bow?""In August I discovered that YogaWorks (YOGA) was going to list their company in an IPO. As a yoga practitioner I was instantly hooked. During the due diligence process however I discovered massive valuation issues along with future headwinds and warned folks to take a balanced approach or better yet to avoid the stock. After coming out at $5.50, YOGA is now down more than 50%, trading at $2.71 this morning just a month and a half later. (YOGA: Namaste For Mind, But Not For Wallet and YogaWorks: Beyond The Numbers)I desperately wanted to love ROKU and was hoping to find an attractive price point to enter after I complete due diligence, but it happened once again.In my preview Roku article we discussed everything from the company's financials, my experience as a Roku customer and even the legal challenges faced by the company. That had me realize it was best to avoid the frenzy. If you have not done so already please take a look at my previous Roku articles - ""Roku: Great Product, Bad Business?"" and ""Roku: Beyond The Box"" and ""Roku - The Kleenex And Postage Scale Problem.""The $14 pricing on the IPO valued the company at $1.3 billion, which by most metrics is quite rich. Combined with the rich valuation, Roku's slowing hardware sales numbers, inability to monetize the top streaming sources, and their history of losses made the IPO toxic.And then it went public.I was dumbfounded as the stock price shot up to over $29, doubling far faster than even GoPro (GPRO) did. If the company was a bad deal at $14... it was begging to be shorted in the mid $20s.There is an old Japanese proverb that translates into English as ""a nail that sticks outs gets hammered.""Roku was now that nail that was begging to be hammered back into place.As much as I love my Roku devices, here is why I went short.In its IPO Roku sold over 17 million Class A shares at $14 per share, accounting for its over-subscription options.For a while, Google Finance and others sites mistakenly showed the market cap in the $210 million range. Obviously it was wrong and it has been updated to reflect fairly closely the current market cap of $2.23 billion.Source: Google Finance as of 8:57 AM 10/3/2017Why the 10x increase?Someone counted the Class B Shares.Roku has both Class A and Class B Shares. Class B can convert at a 1 to 1 rate to Class A. The difference is the voting rights, Class B have significantly more votes.Accounting for both classes, Roku at the time of IPO had over 94 million shares outstanding. Google Finance and other sites only counted the Class A shares sold in the IPO.Source: Roku ProspectusThis gives us the current $2.23 billion market cap.So let's take a look at some valuation metrics.None.Of course there are no earnings to speak of. The prospectus clearly states...""We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.""More telling however is actual performance...""We began operations in 2002 and for all of our history we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations.""Here is the full paragraph from the prospectus.Source: Roku ProspectusThe company has been around for 15 years and has yet to turn in a profit? I know what Shark Tank sharks would think of it.Would anyone in their right mind operate a business for 15 years that has yet to be profitable, sinking good money after bad?If it was your own money, would you? Probably not. But of course it is Silicon Valley where reality does not matter and where there are plenty of ""angels"" willing to take a gamble. After a while you need a bail out however to get the early guys out. For many companies that bail out comes in the form of the IPO.Yes, it is possible that one day if the business ""stars"" align and the business model changes, Roku may be profitable. So let's take a look at the more growth oriented valuation based on price to sales.As per the NYU Stern School of Business, the average price to sales ratio for electronics companies is between 1.1x and 1.59xSource: NYU Link With the $14 IPO price which valued the company at $1.3 billion placed the price to sales ratio at over 3.29x revenue.A 1.59x multiple would imply a price of $6.76 before any more dilution from the future stock options under equity incentive plans which may add another 69 million shares at prices ranging from $4.45 to $14.OK, not an electronics company?Media/broadcasting? 1.58x multiple.Advertising? 1.12xHere is the problem... even at the current (at time of writing) $21.71 per share, the company is valued at $2.04 billion or a price to sales ratio of 5x.The investment world was starved for a successful tech IPO and Roku had to be it.Remember the hype around GoPro? Everyone was going to go out and buy a GoPro camera.Smart investors were questioning the mind blowing valuations, especially as it was a hardware company.IPO bulls then came out and stated that GoPro was a media company and should be valued as such. When GoPro came to market they had revenues of more than $1 billion and were actually profitable, earning about $50 million.After the IPO the media went absurd with valuations and hype. ""Anyone"" who had not yet had a personal camera went out to buy one, causing revenues to nearly double and then everyone stopped caring.Up to nearly $90 and then down to $11. I was lucky to buy into the IPO and ride it up to $48 where I sold it, doubling my money. I did not however step in to short it.What's the price to sales for GoPro today? 1.203.How about Fitbit (FIT)? I too have one of these sitting on my desk.Fitbit also followed the GoPro IPO track. It too was the talk of the town. Revenues increased from about $750 million until everyone had one. Just like GoPro, the company was actually profitable.And then everyone came back to reality.One again about a double from the IPO and then a straight shot down even as net income started stabilizing and revenues continued to increase. IPO hype? Absolutely!Fitbit's price to sales?How about .898?Notice something? When FitBit came out its price/sales also were in the 4.5x range until it caught up to reality.Here is a reality check.In the last 15 years Roku has yet to be profitable, nor does it expect to in the near future.As we discussed in my previous articles Roku faces real legal issues and if it continues to grow those legal challenges will likely increase in frequency and severity.Roku's hardware sales fell year over year for the first six months of 2017 versus 2016. Those pricing pressure will likely continue into the future.Source: Roku Prospectus - S8Roku is not likely to monetize the top sources of streaming on its players, Netflix (NFLX), Amazon Prime (AMZN), or Google's YouTube (GOOG)(GOOGL).Roku is in far worse shape coming to market than GoPro or Fitbit were. Unlike Roku, GoPro and Fitbit were both somewhat profitable and had higher revenues. Even still, both IPOs became epic flops for shareholders who still owned shares.Unlike GoPro and Fitbit, Roku has very little to no business moat. Competition is extremely widespread with two of its streaming partners competing directly with cheaper alternatives, the Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire Sticks/Devices. There is further competition from Apple (AAPL). Even though both GoPro and Fitbit are bigger companies in terms of product offerings and revenues, both are currently worth less than Roku (based on market cap).So how about some price targets?If we apply a 1x price to sales multiple for Roku, the midpoint of GoPro and Fitbit, we get a $4.25 price per share or a $400 million market cap.If we want to be generous and assume Roku will double their revenues, we are still looking at a $8.50 price per share or an $800 million market cap. Both of these numbers are significantly lower than the $14 IPO price or the $21.84 price per share the stock is currently at or the $25.38 per share where I went net short.My initial target is $12 to $14 per share with an ultimate range of $4.50 to $8 per share before long.We do have to keep in mind however that this is an IPO and underwriters have an interest in keeping the stock price up. Before long a few reports may come out stating that Roku is the next great device and that it is a steal. Over time, this too shall pass."
4111259,99506,2017-10-03T06:32:42-04:00,"Late in a bull market, the quality of companies launching IPOs often declines. Roku is another money-losing tech IPO that has the feel of insiders cashing out on the public.Roku has never been profitable in 15 years. The $14 IPO price appears to have been arbitrary without a supporting thesis for this apparent overvaluation.Roku has followed the pattern of other hot IPOs whose prices have spiked initially but then sold off sharply to give back much of the initial gains.The market may continue to sell this much-hyped IPO lower to a more reasonable valuation as questionable fundamentals and rising competition from superior companies are factored into the price of this stock.Some IPOs are to fund future growth. Other IPOs are for management to begin cashing out. It is important to differentiate. Trader's Idea Flow believes that Roku will become the next broken tech IPO to trade below its IPO price of $14.","Full disclosure: Trader's Idea Flow is a long/short trading service with some trades being only a day or two in duration. We are often a momentum trader both long and short. For example: Our Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) long position was established on IPO day right out of the gate as the stock began trading. We then took profits the next day for a very significant short-term gain. We then established a short position. We are short Roku shares now. This post to our Marketplace service, Trader's Idea Flow, was later copied to Instablog.ROKU Price data by YChartsPrudent investors want to distinguish between an IPO where management is raising capital for future growth, or simply executing their exit strategy. Of course, you won't find any such disclosure in Roku's S-1. So, it is up to investors to look for clues, some of which can be relatively obvious. A company that is intent upon using IPO proceeds to achieve future growth can be a valuable stock, think Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and its 2012 IPO. But the IPO of a company that may be feeling its future survival threatened by superior competition should be viewed with caution. Let's discuss why after 15 years in business, the management of Roku has chosen to begin selling its stock to the public now.Roku's CEO, Anthony Wood, is aged 51. He invented the DVR in what seems like a very long time ago. Roku is Japanese for the number six. Roku is the sixth company that Wood has started. That's a lot of companies to start for one person, no? After working hard at Roku for 15 years, this individual has been unable to achieve even one profitable year, not one. No profitable years even after 15 years of trying. So, if you are age 51, onto your sixth company, and after 15 years in business you are unable to achieve profitability, then what are you thinking about for your personal financial future plans?Perhaps a young Mark Zuckerberg, while taking Facebook public at the age of 28 in 2012, thinks about world domination. Much older Anthony Wood may be at a very different stage in life where his goals are less ambitious. Perhaps shuffleboard champion at a warm residence in South Florida is more to his liking. So, while Zuckerberg's plans for the capital raised during the IPO lead to strong growth for his company, perhaps Wood's plans are more relaxed.Let's have CEO Wood tell you his plans for his IPO capital himself. In this video interview by Bloomberg Wood is asked this very question, ""What do you plan to do with the IPO capital?"" Watch at about the 28-second mark of the video. Wait. No. Did CEO Wood just tell us that, ""We don't have any specific plans"" for the IPO capital? No. Hold on. Let me replay that segment of the interview. That can't be accurate. Well, I'll be a doggone IPO short seller. I can't believe my ears. The CEO of Roku just told the market that ""We don't have any specific plans"" for the IPO capital! Then, WHY do an IPO? Unless CEO Wood is just feeling a little tired and he would like to begin dumping his risky company on public investors in exchange for a lot of IPO money, some of which Wood gets to keep for himself. Shuffleboard can be expensive, you know.And, listen as well to the same Bloomberg interview at the 2:10 mark when asked, ""Why was this the right time for Roku to go public?"" CEO Wood gives one of the worst answers that I have ever heard for his explanation as to why the company has chosen now to go public after 15 years in business. I don't think that you have to be an FBI special agent trained in identifying false statements to ascertain that CEO Wood is simply beginning to execute his exit strategy. I will give him credit for not actually telling any lies of commission. However, lies of omission are just as bad. But I don't think that the SEC can charge him with not telling the whole truth, so he has kept himself safe, and his legal counsel is breathing a sigh of relief somewhere off camera. But for us as investors, the truth seems pretty clear: there are no specific plans for the IPO money, and whatever the Japanese word for the number seven happens to be, CEO Wood is not likely to be launching that startup. It looks like it's shuffleboard time for Anthony.So, when we talk about looking for clues to differentiate IPOs intended to further the growth of the company to benefit shareholders versus the IPO that is for no specific plans at all other than to cash out management, this video interview of the Roku CEO is very telling. And, CEO Wood looks a little tired in his Bloomberg video, no? American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) might try to charge him extra for carrying those additional bags under his eyes on board his next flight. Yes, I am intentionally being a little hard on CEO Wood because never in my 30 years in the market have I seen such an obvious case of using the IPO to cash out upon investors. This isn't what IPOs are supposed to be used for. Investors deserve better. But we are in the latter stages of a bull market, and underwriters know that they can get away with dumping the Blue Aprons (NYSE:APRN), Snaps (NYSE:SNAP), and Rokus of the world upon unsuspecting investors.Perhaps working as a stockbroker with NYSE member firm Oppenheimer & Co., prior to launching my own small hedge fund during the dot.com boom, has given me a different perspective on the market and its participants than I might have had if I did not witness so much foolishness on Wall Street over the years. But CEO Wood has taken IPO foolishness to a new level. At least, have a cover story ready to tell people what you are going to do with the IPO money! Am I right? The CEO of a brand new IPO just told the world on a major business media channel, Bloomberg, that, ""We don't have any specific plans (for the IPO money)."" I know that I have just typed this three times in succession, but in all my years, I have never seen a CEO being so blunt about using the IPO to begin his exit strategy and cash out on the public. Talk about bold, brazen, and a distinct lack of respect for the investor: CEO Anthony Wood gets the blue ribbon and first prize. Investors want to watch like hawks for the lockup expiry and insider sales thereafter for any further signs of cashing out by Wood and others at Roku. The IPO may be just the first step in Wood's exit strategy.Anthony looks much more rested in the following picture than in his Bloomberg interview, don't you think? And, who doesn't love suspenders on their favorite CEO? Fashion forward and avant-garde all at once. Wunderbar!But hold on now, because there's much more for us to consider when analyzing this Roku IPO. Who starts jumping off of a winning horse this early in the race? Unless they don't believe that they are riding the winning horse. The CEO and upper management generally know their own company and the industry landscape better than anyone else. After 15 years of building and operating Roku, it would make sense that CEO Wood knows the company better than anyone else. So, why after 15 years is Wood now starting to sell his shares to the public?The following excerpt is from page 16 of the S-1 under Risk Factors, and this item is listed first:Bottom line here is that after 15 years of losing money, the company expects to continue losing money, and lots of it. In fact, in this instance, when the company tells you that they may never achieve profitability, then you should listen to them.The following excerpt from page 16 of the S-1 is also a Risk Factor and this item is listed second to communicate its importance:If you have ever read an S-1 before, then you know that there are many risks listed by a company. Candidly, the first two Risk Factors are very daunting challenges for this much smaller company. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet's Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are all steadily increasing their presence in the same space where Roku hopes to co-exist with these superior companies. Roku's chances of surviving through future rounds of technology innovation by the stronger R&D departments of these major tech firms will be determined largely by the amount of capital that Roku can invest in R&D. Considering that Roku expects to continue losing significant amounts of money going forward, it is not likely that Roku will be able to compete on the same level of R&D innovation as its larger competitors who are very well-financed.And, there it is. If you are CEO Wood looking at the rapidly changing Over-The-Top, or OTT, content industry landscape, then you are well aware of the increasing competition from major tech companies that have recently been displaying greater interest in gaining market share in the same industry as Roku.After 15 years of being unable to achieve profitability, it is unlikely that such strong emerging competition would be helpful to Roku's future prospects for becoming profitable.It would be reasonable for Roku management to begin selling its equity in its company in the face of rising competition from superior companies. Investors may want to ask the question, ""If management is selling, should I be buying?"" The answer for prudent investors may be a resounding, ""No.""Finding a larger technology firm to sell to would be ideal for Roku. But there are no assurances of any future deal. In the event that a deal does not materialize at an advantageous price, then management can continue selling its stock out to the public markets. This would be a typical exit strategy for management, and this may in fact be the plan that is in motion by Roku management already."
4110734,101924,2017-09-29T14:40:02-04:00,"Roku Inc. had a strong first day as it went public on Thursday, seeing shares rise by about 70 percent after pricing at the high range.The company has well-founded ambitions to become a service provider on top of its streaming players.While competition with larger tech giants will be challenging, Roku’s commitment to innovation and ability to survive so far are good signs.Investors should feel good about Roku’s long termpotential, though it will be better to wait until the end of the year.","Thursday was a good first day for Roku Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) as its IPO got off to a strong start. As The Washington Post reports, Roku raised $219 million on opening day, with its shares priced at $14, but that rocketed up to $23.50 per share by end of trading.However, a good first day hardly means that Roku is guaranteed to do well in the long term, as anyone watching the Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock can tell you. And many analysts are fretting about how Roku will manage to stay competitive with behemoths such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) who could all theoretically drive Roku out of business with a snap of a finger.But such fears are overblown. Roku has managed to survive against those companies up to now, is a constant innovator, and its numbers are generally trending in the right direction. While investors may be wary of tech IPOs after watching companies like Snap and Blue Apron struggle, there are reasons to believe that Roku will be different.Roku is best known for its streaming player and cell amplifier which allows customers to watch Hulu, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), and other streaming services directly on their televisions. According to its own SEC report, around 75 percent of Roku’s 2016 revenue came from its streaming player. Growth has been modest, rising from $270 million in the 2015 fiscal year to $293 million in 2016.But while streaming players may currently make up the majority of Roku’s business, MarketWatch noted that Roku “no longer thinks those gadgets are the key to its Wall Street success.” Instead, Roku sees its future in what it calls its platform revenue, which it describes as “primarily from advertising and subscription revenue share on our platform.” This includes taking a cut of subscriptions purchased through Roku devices.Over the past few years, platform revenue has steadily become a larger part of Roku’s business, making up 41 percent of business in the first six months of 2017 compared to 25 percent in 2017. Skeptical investors may look at past companies like Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) which also tried to transition to digital and data, failed, and saw their stocks decline. But Roku’s platform is on stronger footing given that it already nearly makes up half of the business.Roku certainly has grand ambitions, but the fundamental question which investors have to figure out is whether it can compete with the tech titans. Roku’s decision to focus on its platform services is fueled by the need to stay a step ahead. With Apple further developing Apple TV and Amazon and Google working on their own streaming players, Roku will be hard pressed to compete with larger companies on that front.Investors may then ask that if Roku will have difficulties competing with larger companies with streaming players, why will the platform service succeed? The answer is that while Roku may overall be a smaller company, it remains a major player in the streaming market. As TechCrunch reported in August, Roku had 37 percent of the streaming player market, increasing its lead. That speaks good things for the streaming player market, but it also means that advertisers and companies like Netflix cannot just ignore Roku. And as a smaller company, Roku can be a neutral company working with anyone as the titans focus on fighting each other.Investors should also observe that Roku has good financial numbers. While it is unprofitable like most tech IPOs, revenue is growing and it has little debt. This is an innovating company with room to grow and will not just be swallowed up in a year by Apple.There is a certainly a lot to like about Roku’s prospects as an innovator looking to compete with larger giants. But instead of jumping in now, investors should still wait a few months until the end of the year.The end of the year will provide further information about Roku’s prospects, particularly as its user growth rate and average revenue per user are expected to grow more than average during the holiday season. If Roku can get good numbers there, then things are going to look very rosy for this company.But if you should wait, investors should keep a highly interested eye on Roku as it will likely continue to do well in the near future."
4111128,103480,2017-10-02T13:40:29-04:00,"Roku went public at $14/share and jumped almost 70% in its first day of trading.The company currently provides the leading OTT (over-the-top) TV streaming player.However, player revenues are declining due to increased competition from other mega-cap tech companies.Roku touts the growth in its platform revenues, but without player sales, platform revenues will see meaningful deceleration as well.","Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) broke the ice on technology IPOs last week, soaring more than 70% in its initial debut. The themes of cord-cutting and streaming television played well in investors’ ears, and at the time of writing, the company is worth $2.5 billion - approximately twice its debut valuation and 5x EV/FTM revenues.Roku is a bit confusing to evaluate because of its dual revenue streams: it generates revenue from selling hardware players, as well as from a cut of streaming revenues from partners like Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). Streaming revenues are similar to software billings - they generate high, 80%+ gross margins, but they are still less than a third of Roku’s total revenue today. Hardware margins, on the other hand, are far less valuable - they carry an 18% gross margin - and they represent the majority of Roku’s business, and they are in decline.For this reason, it’s nonsensical to apply a single EV/FTM revenue multiple on Roku’s entire revenue base like we can with most technology companies; the two revenue streams are vitally different and should be valued separately. When valuing the entire company as a single unit, 5x EV/FTM revenues doesn’t look expensive at all, but this simplified metric is blind to the underlying economics.Roku doesn’t want you to look too much into the hardware component of its business. Roku’s offering documents and marketing materials play up the huge increase in platform revenue: +91% y/y. The company is right in asserting that this is the more important, more profitable, more recurring revenue stream. Hardware sales, after all, are one-time.But hardware sales are the catalyst to platform revenues. How will subscribers pay for content on the Roku platform if they don’t have a Roku device to begin with? Hardware revenues declined 2% in 1H17.The quick take: stay away from this IPO. At 2x its initial valuation, hype for this stock is red-hot and earnings may not materialize to support the valuation. Roku’s revenue model is fairly easy to understand. It sells its flagship Roku streaming player to consumers (you can buy one on Amazon for $50-$80), and it also generates a cut of the subscription revenues that third-party partners make from subscribers (think Netflix and Hulu). See below screenshot from a Google search of some of the different Roku players available: As of the end of June, Roku had 15.1 million active accounts, who in the first six months of 2017 streamed 6.7 billion hours of content. Users can access virtually any type of content they want - news, sports, movies, TV shows - all through partners such as CBS News, HBO Now, and Netflix as mentioned above. Content owners gain access to Roku’s wide user base and in turn, share some of the subscription revenues with Roku. It’s these subscription revenues, growing at 91% y/y in the first six months of the year, that Roku management wants you to focus on.The below infographic from Roku’s S-1 shows management’s focus metrics for the business:Management is correct about one thing: platform revenues are more valuable than hardware revenues, for a variety of reasons. The first reason is simply profitability. It costs virtually nothing to generate an incremental dollar of platform revenue; indeed, platform gross margins were 83% in the first half of 2017. This is comparable to the high gross margins seen in software companies, as discussed earlier.Compare this to 18% gross margins for Roku players - the company is basically giving them away at cost.The economics here reveal Roku’s high-level strategy: sell players as cheaply as possible to get as many users as possible, and then milk those users for the streaming royalties they generate. It’s the streaming revenues, not the hardware, that will generate the bulk of profits for the company.This is an excellent strategy - but only if Roku can keep adding new users.The first bullet listed in Roku’s growth strategy is: “Grow Active Accounts.” How can it grow active accounts when hardware sales are declining? Sure, every incremental sale of Roku hardware adds to the installed base - active accounts can still grow even as hardware sales decline - but the company isn’t disclosing how big its churn is. If sales of new Roku players don’t keep pace with the number of churning users who stop streaming on their Roku devices, Roku will see declines in platform growth. Hardware revenues declined 2% in the first half of 2017. Recall that consumers have a lot of choices now when it comes to purchasing an OTT streaming player. Roku might have been the first mover in this market, but streamers now have the option to choose between a Google Chromecast, an Amazon Fire Stick, or an Apple TV. Brand loyalties to any of these three products may win out over Roku in a customer’s mind. Sales of Roku players are already declining, and due to tough competition, will likely fall even further. Roku wants IPO investors to ignore the hardware revenue decline: they are one-time and lower margin anyway. But hardware sales are what lead to platform revenue. Without growth in the number of consumers buying Roku players, streaming hours - and streaming royalties - will decline as well.We can’t see the effects of this yet (perhaps Roku chose the opportune time to go public, before the deterioration starts to show). The decline in hardware sales have just begun and they probably won’t have a visible impact on platform revenues until a year or two later. But just because hardware produces less profit doesn’t mean that it’s unimportant - it’s the gateway to growing platform revenues.Investors bidding up Roku shares like it’s the hottest stock of the day are treating Roku like a full-on growth company. It’s not. For now, the growth in platform revenues will cover the shortfalls in hardware, but chances are more than likely that hardware sales will tumble even more due to intense competition this holiday season. And when those hardware sales start burning a hole in platform revenues, Roku will begin to shrink into obscurity.Roku joins the club of consumer-facing tech stocks like Snap (NASDAQ: SNAP) that have gone public this year to much initial fanfare, but have crumbled after investors realized that the inherent business model is not future-proof. More than likely, Roku's shares jumped due to a lack of exciting new names for investors to chew on recently - not because it's anything special in and of itself.The enterprise technology stocks that have gone public this year are much higher quality - more stable revenue bases, more technology differentiation. I'm highly looking forward to MongoDB's (NASDAQ: MDB) upcoming IPO. But as for Roku, I'd stay extremely cautious."
4111015,52612,2017-10-02T09:05:56-04:00,"Best known for its Roku streaming player for TV, the company also has a platform business that provides access to streaming content and is generating more revenue with better margins.The company's business model will shift from selling TV streaming players to licensing its streaming platform uses in smart TVs as they ultimately become the main devices for TV streaming.Roku may choose to leverage the wide use of its streaming platform to create a new type of streaming-only device, like a connected TV monitor with its built-in streaming platform.","What happens to Roku Inc. (NASDAQ:ROKU) when every home has a smart TV and no one needs a Roku player for TV streaming anymore? No, the company would not be out of business simply because the market for Roku's streaming device would cease to exist. Instead, it would have transformed itself into a TV streaming platform provider by licensing its most widely used Roku streaming platform to smart TV makers as part of the their user interface that can conveniently host different streaming channels from increasingly more content providers. The company could also develop its own smart TV, something differentiated from a typical smart TV and focusing on the specific use for TV-like streaming only.It has already been generating revenue beyond device sales, earning subscription and advertising fees as shared with streaming content providers when users use the Roku platform to access a streaming service. In 2016, the company’s net revenue grew 25%, while platform-specific revenue increased over 100%. In the first six months of 2017, net revenue rose 23%, with platform revenue up 90%.The shift from selling the Roku player to relying on a wider use of its streaming platform is already happening and helps the company secure future sales when the market for its player eventually disappears. Furthermore, margins for the platform segment are more favorable than those from making and selling devices, making the platform business a worthy pursuit, especially given that the company has been losing money all these years.In 2016, gross profit attributable to Roku’s platform revenue grew 88%, while gross profit coming from its player revenue fell for the year. To help better track and promote its platform use and revenue growth, the company has been focusing on increasing the number of active user accounts for its platform and growing average revenue per user. This is aided by the company’s seeking licensing agreements with smart TV makers to offer the Roku streaming platform on their smart TVs.At the start of 2017, 13% of the smart TVs sold in the U.S. were using the Roku platform. By the end of the first half of 2017, about one in five smart TVs were based on the Roku platform. As its streaming player sales continue to fall, platform licensing will be the main driver for increasing platform user numbers and, ultimately, revenue per active user, which already grew 43% in 2016.It should concern Roku investors that a wider embracing of smart TV by consumers will, in the end, make the market for streaming players obsolete. But with the popularity of the Roku platform, a TV streaming user interface that can be used with or without its own player, the company can actually ride high on the future wave of smart TV adoptions.The ability to connect to the internet is only the hardware part of a smart TV. How users are able to interact when selecting and viewing content rests in the power of the software part of a smart TV, namely the user interface, or the streaming platform, which is the strength of Roku’s business. The company’s TV streaming platform is number one in the U.S. in terms of total hours streamed. Its future business model based on its streaming operating system can be successful without the current Roku device business, when it can rely on a greater penetration of its platform uses.To make sure that its business can really sustain in the future market of TV streaming, the company may entertain the idea of making its own streaming TV: a two-in-one device with both a player and TV monitor. Such hardware of non-traditional smart TV could be in great demand as the cord-cutting phenomenon continues its current trend and one day reaches a critical mass. Without a pay-TV subscription and for streaming only, what users need would be a simple, connected device with a screen the size of a TV and a built-in streaming platform - a potential new market for someone like Roku, the pioneer of the TV streaming business.Investors are wise to get into the Roku play if they want the exposure to the future of content distribution outside of the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Roku solves this one piece of streaming puzzle in terms of a TV watching-like streaming experience, still preferred by cord-cutting consumers. People want to keep the remote in their hand and be in front of a bigger TV screen while streaming content on demand. As its current lower-margin, device-making business gradually phases out and the higher-margin streaming platform service business eventually takes over, the company can one day see the light of profitability."

Now comes day two of the IPO trading plan.Day one of a hot IPO is usually the easiest part. Buy the first dip out of the IPO gate and then hold on tightly while that bronco bucks.Day two can get a little dicey. Fortunately, we have a few factors in our favor that might help us to trade higher on day two of the ROKU IPO.So we are well done but only just begun on our game plan for this long to short trade for the ROKU IPO. Let's discuss what might come next.","There have been several valuable articles discussing Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) on Seeking Alpha prior to the Thursday 9/28/17 IPO. These articles have done a great job on bringing perspective on the business fundamentals and financials. Here is a link to the Roku S-1. Rather than rehash similar information in this article, we hope to bring value from a different perspective:So the above macro concepts serve as the backdrop for the successful IPO trade of Roku that is entering day two on Friday 9/29/17.Now let's get more specific into the micro concepts that are serving to assist us in making money on this Roku IPO trade. The following discussion will encompass a number of short-term trading and pattern recognition ideas:Let's recap the Roku trading game plan discussed in this Thursday's 9/28/17 2:58AM Trader's Idea Flow post. Then let's discuss the short-term trading prospects for ROKU to seek maximal exit points for our long position. And then let's also discuss the optimal entry point for the anticipated short sale of ROKU. So to be clear, we are currently long ROKU and looking for an exit point on this current momentum trade higher. We then want to seek the maximal point to flip the ROKU trade from long to short.ROKU Price data by YChartsHere's some context and background on the trade that may be useful for those who wish to consider either a long or short position in this stock in the near term:OK, enough of that looking into the rearview mirror contextual background stuff. Let's get ready for day two of our ROKU IPO trade:2. The other IPO that Trader's Idea Flow rode day one momentum higher this year was Snap, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNAP). We were long on IPO day for a successful momentum trade higher prior to entering our Snap short on day three. The chart below shows a more common two-day IPO momentum price spike higher:So day two of the ROKU IPO in the morning could be your momentum price peak as it was in the case of SNAP. Or ROKU could be on to a multi-day move higher as was the case for RDFN. How do you know which of the two trading events is happening for ROKU, a two-day move or a four/five day move higher? The RDFN trading event was a rare beast of an IPO that surprised to the upside. But the SNAP IPO was more predictable.SNAP showed us a classic Breakout Failure Pattern on day three of the IPO as illustrated on the daily chart above. This article discusses this usually reliable pattern that we will be looking for on our current ROKU trade.As we enter day two of the ROKU IPO trade we are now looking for a maximal exit point. This exit point may not present itself until day three or later.When an IPO is breaking out higher on a brand new chart, then one of the few reference points is pattern recognition. If the Breakout Failure Pattern presents itself, then we will use this tool to signal our exit point from our long position. Trader's Idea Flow anticipates the best potential for seeing a Breakout Failure Pattern would be the morning of day three. We also will be mindful of the short sale trading opportunity that may present itself after ROKU's upward momentum has become exhausted. The same Breakout Failure Pattern that signals our exit from our long position will also signal our entry to our short position.The entry point for the upcoming short position may not present itself until day three or later of the ROKU IPO trade. For now let's remain focused on day two trading action keeping in mind that the stock is likely to gap higher in the morning and spike higher in price. This morning price spike, if it happens, could be an opportunity for you to exit your long position. If you feel like ROKU has enough strength of momentum to trade higher into a day three move, then you will act accordingly.Summary and Conclusion:Roku is a company in transition to a higher profit margin, platform business model. Wall Street recognizes this event and seems to be in the process of assigning a higher valuation than Roku would have received if the company were perceived as just a hardware provider.As other articles have discussed, Roku has a number of very challenging competitors at major tech firms. This is a valid reason for concern and a cornerstone of the bear case against Roku. There are currently a number of favorable macros that are aligned to give the Roku IPO a boost.After a successful day one for our ROKU IPO trade, we are now on the lookout for a maximal exit point on day two or later. We are mindful of the upcoming trading opportunity that will present itself to the short side.We are looking for sell signals such as the Breakout Failure Pattern to appear on day three or later.Trader's Idea Flow does not provide any investment advice of any sort to anyone at anytime.

4110221,70365,2017-09-28T11:51:25-04:00,Roku is a leading OTT provider going public this Thursday.The company's business model is currently in transition from selling OTT streaming devices to driving revenue from partnered streaming companies and selling ads.A closer look at valuation reveals that Roku's IPO offering price is very attractive.,"Roku, Inc. (ROKU) is an American private company that manufactures and sells home digital media products and operates subscription-based video streaming services and software platform enabling developers to build their channel streams through the distribution of their original content. According to a survey conducted in the first quarter of 2017 by Kantar Millward Brown, Roku operated the number one TV streaming platform in the United States as measured by total hours streamed. As of June 30, 2017, the company had 15.1 million active accounts. Based on a different data set from March 2016, Roku successfully managed to carve out almost half the OTT device market as can be seen in the output below.Source: Comscore.comLooking at the global entertainment and media outlook, the over-the-top content - OTT - industry is on the rise. Last year, PwC's global media outlook 2016-2020 report revealed that unlike other home video entertainment, OTT streaming market share expands at a steady pace. In the United States, which account roughly for the third of the global market, revenues have already successfully passed US$17.2 billion milestone.Source: themediabriefing.comAs Roku has increased the percentage of its total revenue that comes from its platform business over time, its hardware player segment's revenue share has slowly faded. Platform revenue now represents approximately half of the company's total revenues. As the industry's hardware device margins have been recently under pressure, the ongoing transition towards a more software-oriented company makes perfect sense.Source: Techcrunch.comIn the light of revenue variation of popular Peter Lynch's earnings line for the projection of intrinsic per share values of the company, I see Roku's IPO as very attractive. According to my model assuming 25 percent annual revenue growth, 119.3 million shares outstanding (94.7 million total Class A and Class B common stock outstanding after the offering + 24.6 million shares of Class B common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options) diluting at 10 percent annual rate and an average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 5x, the company's intrinsic value by the end of 2020 is forecasted to reach $28 USD. With respect to the suggested offering price of $12-$14 USD per share, this intrinsic value implies more than 25 percent total annualized rate of return upside potential. Should the price-to-sales multiple decline to 3x, the company's shares could still reach a positive annualized rate of return of almost 10 percent as can be deduced from the valuation output below.To sum up, Roku presents a very attractive IPO. With respect to its small market cap, the company might also become a potential takeover target. This would undoubtedly result in some takeover premium benefiting the company's shareholders. Even though the company is still in the red on the bottom line, its top-line growth suggests that Roku's overall business concept is viable. With an ongoing transition towards a more software-based business model, I believe Roku has its best years yet to come.Author's note: To bring similar articles to your attention, please consider subscription of my SA feed by clicking on the ''Follow'' button at the top of this page.Disclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion and do not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

4110761,25120,2017-09-29T16:26:57-04:00,"Roku's IPO has been a huge success.Following the great returns, expectations have risen too much for me, especially as the valuation requires more growth.As I fear about the business in the very long run and take notice of the high multiples, Roku remains an easy avoid, but dangerous short.","Roku (ROKU) aims to be the TV streaming platform which connects the entire TV ecosystem as pioneers of streaming to the TV. Investors seem to agree and love the dominant positioning of the business in an emerging OTT market, while shares were offered at the high end of the preliminary offering range at $14. Shares jumped to levels as high as $23-24 following the IPO, in what can easily be called a major success.Following this success, expectations have been on the increase, as I am cautious given the uncertainty about the long-term business model and further growth required to create reasonable valuation multiples.Roku enables consumers to stream the content they love on a single platform in a convenient way on their own TV. The company has over 15.1 million active accounts, and those people use the service at mass, with more than 6.7 billion hours being streamed in the first half of the year. That is over 440 hours for each account, or nearly 2.5 hours every day.When consumers use Roku to stream content on their TV, they have more options to watch and control over their expenditures on content. Consumers can browse through endless numbers of movies, episodes, but also live sport and music events, as they can compare the costs from various content providers in an easy manner. Besides streaming Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu, HBO, consumers can opt for news or sport channels as well, with the wide choice being a major advantage. Content providers still stand to gain if they offer free content through Roku, being able to include advertising in those programs. Additionally, some content providers are arguably too small to offer their own subscription services.The benefits for consumers are obvious, being able to reach much greater assortment of content in a simple overview. Content providers benefit from a large audience, as well as monetization opportunities tailored to their desires. Social and technological trends are clearly benefiting the company as the over-the-top market is growing amidst cord-cutting, and young households not getting cable altogether.The company generates revenues from selling hardware streaming players as well as from platform revenues. The latter is comprised of advertising and subscription revenue sharing agreements, among others.Roku sold 15.7 million shares at the high end of the preliminary offering range of $12-14 per share. The previous sentence is a bit misleading as selling shareholders offered 6.7 million shares in the offering, making that gross proceeds for the company total $126 million. The 95.7 million shares outstanding, following the offering, represents a value of $2.3 billion at $24 per share.The finances are a bit complicated, as the company is growing quickly, which involves large expenses, while it is transitioning from hardware to software (platform) revenues at the same time. Revenues were up 25% in 2016 to $398.6 million. Hardware revenues were up just 9% to $293.9 million as platform revenues more than doubled to $104.7 million. Operating losses increased by 15% to $43.4 million, but narrowed on a relative basis to 10.9% of sales.Growth continued in the first half of 2017, albeit at a slower pace. Sales were up 23% to $199.7 million, which is a solid achievement after hardware revenues were down 1.5%. Platform revenues nearly doubled again to $82.4 million, which is aiding the margin developments of the business, as losses from operations narrowed significantly to $21.2 million, a more than $11 million improvement from the first half of 2016. One has to take into account that the business is seasonable with watching hours being up in the winter, and advertising revenues peaking in Q4 for obvious reasons. That quarter has made up 35-40% of sales in previous years, as Roku actually posted a modest operating profit in Q4 of 2016.Following the IPO the company has another $126 million in gross proceed on top of the current cash holdings of $70 million. This cash position of $180-190 million is only offset by $22 million in debt, for a net cash position of roughly $160 million. That is a reasonable number, sufficient to finance the current (narrowing) losses for another 3-4 years to come.With a $2.1 billion operating valuation, the company trades at roughly 4 times forward sales, which could approach half a billion this year. That is misleading a bit as the majority of revenues are still comprised of low margin hardware revenues, but the growing software business is really where the business is. Platform revenues could hit $200 million this year on let's say 15-20 million accounts. If we believe that the platform will be the leader in the coming years and could grow to 100 million accounts, platform revenues could hit a billion in let's, say 5 years from now. That would be a very rosy scenario as the current count of 15 million grows by roughly 5 million new accounts each year.In that case, platform revenues could hit $1 billion, with ARPU currently trending it $11, a number which has consistently risen in recent quarters. If this could rise to $15-20 in case of a 100 million user base by 2022, revenues of $1.5-2 billion might be within reach. With gross margins of 80-90%, I see no reason why this could not be +50% margin business, for operating earnings of $750 million to a billion. That could translate into after-tax earnings of $600-$800 million, which translates into a $15 billion valuation if we apply a small premium to the overall market valuation multiple.That sounds like music to the ears of investors, translating into a $150 per share valuation. That said, attaining a 100 million user base might be very difficult, if not impossible in the coming 5 years. If it would become reality, shares could increase by a factor of 6 times from current levels, for returns of 40-50% per year, indicating that this scenario might be too rosy.In comparison, if Roku would achieve 50 million users and ARPU of $15, revenues of $750 million and margins of 40% translate into operating earnings of just $300 million, or $240 million after tax. That yields a $5 billion valuation, which implies that the valuation could roughly double in the coming five years. While this still looks appealing, it does not translate into very impressive returns, given the operational achievements which are still required to achieve this valuation and the risks alongside the road.The story of Roku makes sense and looks great, but the risk-reward is not appealing enough for me after shares have jumped 70% from the IPO price. Growth, notably in marketplace/software revenues is to be applauded, but the reality is that Roku is just a middleman between distributors and users.While Netflix offers a similar service, it has created loyalty with own shows as well, as the loyalty from users and content providers to Roku might be very limited. Even better, Netflix is available on phones and tablets as well, unlike Roku which focuses solely on TV. Even worse, (potential) competitors are the worst you can face, including Apple and Google, among others.Add to that uncertainty in the business model in the long term, including a trend to watch more on mobile devices, the typical Silicon Valley structure of dual share classes, and the high valuation, and it is easy for me to avoid this IPO. Potential returns of 17% per year, if Roku hits a 50 million user count by 2022, look appealing, but achieving this requires growth of 7 million users a year. This comes after the current growth trajectory is stuck at 5 million, and incremental growth might be harder to achieve, as the business model might be obsolete in the long run.The fact that insiders are happy to cash in some chips at $14 says enough. I am having a neutral stance until shares hit the teens again and information from Q3 becomes available, before reconsidering my stance. Shorting is dangerous as the limited market capitalisation, and large user base might make it a target to be acquired by multi billion cable/network/phone business."
4110115,21820,2017-09-28T03:03:12-04:00,Increasing ARPU and revenue mix shift are two big positives.The company has a strong relationship with Netflix but gets minimal revenue.Its contract with Netflix has not been renewed and could be a major loss.IPO coming several years too late for a streaming company.,"Streaming device leader Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) is set to go public for the first time this week. While there is a lot of hype around the company and the IPO, there are also some huge risks and red flags in the filing. Roku is doing a good job increasing its user base and also monetizing it better. However, several key risks are coming soon, and the IPO looks like a major miss here.The OfferingRoku will offer (S-1) 15,668,000 shares at an expected pricing of $12-14. The company is selling nine million shares itself and also selling shares from several current stakeholders. The primary purpose of the IPO is to provide financial flexibility and also to create a public market for the company’s shares.(Source: S-1)It’s apparent from the first line of the offering that the company has a nice history of being an early pioneer. “We pioneered streaming to the TV,” reads the filing. Roku lists its mission as being the streaming platform that connects the entire TV ecosystem. The company took an early lead in the streaming race and was an early adopter of providing Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to customers. Times have changed, and Roku now faces competition and is seeing Netflix provide minimal revenue and have other means to get in front of customers’ eyes.(Source: Business Insider)Some impressive numbers were portrayed in the filing that could lead to some bullishness on Roku stock going forward. The company has 15.1 million active accounts. Over the last 12 months, customers used Roku to stream nearly 12 billion hours of content. The average revenue per user is increasing for the company and was $11.22 at the end of June.The company lists its competitive strengths as:The growth strategy in the filing is rather vague, but also right to the point:The PositivesRoku is shifting its revenue model to see a larger portion of sales from platform services (advertising, subscription) instead of its early hardware revenue model. In the first six months of 2017, it produced $199.7 million in revenue, an increase of 23%. Revenue from streaming players represented 59% of the total. Platform revenue made up the other 41% of the total. In 2016, player revenue represented 74% of the company’s total. From a financial perspective, it’s increasingly important that Roku keeps this trend of shifting to platform to continue. Despite making up only 41% of the company’s overall revenue, the platform segment made up 81% of Roku’s gross profit in the first six months of 2017.One of the biggest metrics for the company is average revenue per user (ARPU). Roku has watched its ARPU steadily rise each quarter. In the first six months of 2017, ARPU was $11.22. This is significantly higher than the $9.28 and $6.48 year-end figures for 2016 and 2015 respectively. As the company gets less revenue from selling streaming players, it needs to better monetize its strongest asset, its user base. The steady increase is a good sign and is the biggest point of optimism I see if investors take the leap of faith with Roku shares.(Source: S-1)Several technology sites have hinted at new Roku devices coming this fall. If appropriately timed, they could provide short-term boosts to the share price. Rumors include a new 4K streaming stick, universal remote, and a smart speaker. None of these new devices were listed in the filing, and the company has been declining to comment on any of the websites posting about the rumorsThe NegativesThe biggest negative found in the Roku IPO filing is the company’s relationship with Netflix. Roku and Netflix go way back and have been partners for some time. Netflix also owned a portion of the company for years, before selling its stake in 2009 for a small gain. While Netflix once needed Roku to push its content to people’s televisions, it is now less reliant on Roku, and as a result, is not paying anywhere close to what it once did. In fact, it’s worth pointing out that Roku may need Netflix more than Netflix needs it, which is bad for investors here.Netflix represented one-third of all streaming content for Roku during the recently reported six months. Despite it being the biggest streaming source for Roku, the filing says “revenue from Netflix not material to overall revenue”. You read that right, revenue from Netflix is now next to nothing for Roku despite making up such a large percentage of the reason customers use their Roku box.The top five streaming channels (including Netflix) made up 69% of hours streamed in the recent six-month period. Another one of those streaming channels, YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), also provides no revenue to Roku. Instead of capturing revenue from its biggest streaming sources, the company is essentially giving this content away to try and get customers to subscribe to smaller streaming services and put advertisements in front of customers to capture that additional revenue.To make matters worse, Roku and Netflix operate on a contractual basis. Netflix has renewed its deal with Roku several times throughout the company's history. However, the current contract ends in 2017 and has not been renewed. This was a risk factor heavily discussed in the filing that investors need to be aware of. If Netflix chooses not to renew with it, customers would dramatically switch away from Roku players to competitors like Amazon Fire (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google Chromecast, and others.Roku faces major competition from several streaming devices, most notably Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire. Roku was a convenient option for years to be able to stream multiple subscription services like Netflix, Hulu, and HBO. These competitors now offer the same services, but also have additional benefits. The Chromecast I use allows me to easily stream content from my phone or tablet from most applications or websites without ever having to fumble around for a remote or switching the input channel on my television. Keep in mind that Amazon and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are also playing nice now, putting Amazon Prime on Apple TV. The need for a Roku box is growing increasingly smaller.A look at Roku’s financials will show the company continues to post losses and has negative cash flow. The company has had only one quarter that saw positive earnings. While many tech companies operate for years at a net loss, Roku is past the early stages and should be showing better earnings support.It is becoming more dependent on smaller streaming services. The company recently misfired with not being able to handle the premiere of “Star Trek Discovery” on the CBS All Access (CBS) app. Multiple complaints came in for Roku and not being able to watch this highly anticipated programming. While this is only one example, and other streaming services also experience disruption, it is a big blow for Roku, as it is more reliant on getting sign-ups for non-Netflix services, and it also came less than a week before its IPO.ConclusionRoku had an early lead in the streaming device market. This IPO appears to be too late to take advantage of the growth ahead of the company. Roku has several positives in its IPO filing, including an increase in average revenue per user and the revenue mix shift to platform and advertising. The company’s reliance on Netflix and an unclear future, along with increasing competition from other streaming devices, make the Roku IPO less appealing than it would have been several years ago."
4110125,66213,2017-09-28T04:01:25-04:00,"Roku's IPO has been priced at $14 per share, representing a valuation of $1.3 billion.
        The company faces some intense competitors, but is growing the most profitable segment on their revenue.
        I think the Roku IPO is priced fairly for the company and investors.","The video streaming pioneer, Roku (ROKU) has been priced at $14 per share for its IPO, which will raise about $219 million in proceeds. This gives them a valuation of $1.3 billion, compared to their valuation of $992 million in November 2016.CompetitionRoku’s competition is fierce and growing. They face the big 3 heavy hitting competitors Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Apple (AAPL), who all offer their own streaming devices. While most people wouldn’t dream of going toe to toe with those 3 tech monsters, Roku has held their ground. Not only have they held their ground, but they have actually increased their ground by growing their market share.As you can see from the chart, not only does Roku have the largest percent of the market share, but they actually gained ground against their competition from Q1 2016 to Q1 2017. Roku offers a variety of products ranging in price, which may be what is making them appeal to a larger customer base. Either way, Roku has shown they can take on the heaviest hitters and they aren’t going away.But it’s worth noting that Roku’s competition doesn’t just end with those 3 tech giants. While those are the big direct competitors, they still face competition from television manufacturers, such as Samsung and LG, who have built in streaming capabilities. Then add on gaming systems such as Microsoft (MSFT) Xbox and Sony Playstation who also have streaming capabilities and you’ll see why competition poses as a serious threat.GrowthUsually the real story with these tech type IPOs is the growth story. There is no question that Roku is experiencing strong growth - revenue for 2016 was up 25%, revenue for the first half of 2017 is up 23%, and active accounts and hours streamed have increased every quarter since 2014. Now throw in the fact that they have been growing their market share against their giant competitors and you can see that they have a pretty nice growth story behind them. However, it is the future growth that investors need to keep their eye on.Although Roku saw a small setback in hardware Roku sales for the first 6 months of 2017, that is not where the real story is. They are increasingly generating more and more revenue from their platform, which comes from advertising and content transactions and subscriptions through their streaming platform. In 2015, revenue from their platform accounted for less than 16% of total revenue, compared to the first 6 months of 2017, which it accounted for more than 41%. And not all revenue is created equal.Source: Roku's S-1The chart above shows Roku’s gross profit. As you can see, although the player sales make up the majority of their revenue, the platform sales make up the majority of their gross profit. Roku has not just diversified their revenue, but they have done so by significantly increasing sales in the most profitable revenue stream.ValuationI think Roku is going to close out 2017 with total revenue of about $488 million. At $14 per share, Roku would raise approximately $219 million and fetch a valuation of about $1.3 billion. If I use my forward revenue estimate for 2017, a $1.3 billion valuation would equate to approximately 2.67X sales. This is actually a pretty good multiple for investors. The consumer electronics industry P/S ratio is about 2.6 with a low 3-year revenue growth rate of only 3.9%. The 3 big direct competitors; Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet are all trading at higher sales multiples. Although these companies are direct competitors, the valuation process doesn’t apply quite the same as the majority of their sales come from other revenue streams.On the balance sheet, Roku has strong liquidity with cash of $70 million, representing a cash ratio of 0.68 and a current ratio of 1.6. However, Roku does have a shareholders’ deficit, but that will be wiped out with the IPO proceeds. Nevertheless, Roku won’t be in dire straits, but they aren’t going to have a very strong balance sheet to back their $1.3 billion valuation. Given tech company IPOs, this isn’t very surprising. We usually expect some sort of leverage and Roku is very tolerable.ConclusionI like Roku at $14 per share. They grew their platform revenue by over 90% for the first 6 months of 2017, which is where the cash is. In that same time period, platform revenue had a gross profit margin of 76%, compared to 12% gross margin on their player revenue. So don’t get too caught up on player sales and follow the cash flow potential coming from their platform."
4109802,79445,2017-09-27T09:51:25-04:00,Discussion of Roku's problem with illegally streamed content.Quick look at Roku's private channels.Initial reactions to Roku's official streaming channel.,"Just last week, there was an uproar in the Roku (ROKU) community on Reddit. That uproar was over the end to one of the most popular Roku ""private channels,"" XTV.Source: AuthorAfter third-party complaints, or simply Roku deciding to clean up its act, it has shut down the popular channel that let users stream live channels and a vast on-demand library of recent and current shows.This got me thinking. To what degree have Roku's sales been influenced by the illegal use of Roku devices to access pirated content?I believe Roku faces the ""Kleenex and Postage Scale problems.""When we think Kleenex, we all think about the various commercials about blowing noses, right?The reality is, blowing noses is not the only use of Kleenex tissues, and we all know it.If Kleenex is to be used strictly for blowing noses than Kimberly-Clark (KMB) has an issue. The myriad of uses for Kleenex tissues and competitors goes beyond what the company would want you to think.Just like Roku and other streaming players, while the variety of uses for Kleenex are not illegal, the companies would want to avoid having the spotlight there.The direct comparison and problem for Roku, however, can be seen in the market for consumer postage scales.When I worked my first retail job at Staples (SPLS), I was in the technology and business machines department. As a young 18-year old, I was interested in technology, and the mailing from home trend was getting popular. You kept getting those Stamps.com offers with free postage, all you needed was a scale.For a few years, postage scales were quite a popular item as everyone apparently wanted to skip the trip to the post office and elderly adults, business professionals, and soccer moms bought scales. But then, it died off.Postage scales are still sold today in many stores, but there is a change. All of the sudden, many of those postage scales are now no longer on the shelves, and you need to have an employee bring one from behind the counter or a secured area.Further yet, some stores require an ID to purchase one and/or do not accept returns as some have come back ""unclean.""Why go through all this trouble? As it turns out, a large percentage of the postage scales sold were used to measure drugs.Postage scales, prepaid cell phones, crypto-currencies, and streaming devices. All products and services designed for legal purposes which were largely successful due to them being used in illicit acts.The problem for Roku is that outside of the core believers who purchased the devices to stream their Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), numerous purchases for Roku devices were to stream content illegally. Thus presents the problem.On one hand, Roku needs to stay on the legal side of the business as, if things get worse, they may face the issues of getting shut down like Napster and other file-sharing services. Yes, they provided the platform.On the other hand, does Roku want to lose the sales of people who are buying the device to stream questionable content?Traditionally, Roku has let illegal private channels run as long as it was not an issue, likely not taking action until they got some legal complaint from the content owners.With many of the channels, it is fairly easy to identify the bad actors. They are public or private channels which were free to download and use, and the illegal content was blatantly obvious. They gave you free access to recent shows such as 24/7 on demand Game of Thrones and Walking Dead.The less obvious piracy and likely the bigger but harder to identify are the paid private channels that are popular in the ethnic communities.As I alluded to in my previous ROKU articles, one of the reasons that I own a number of Roku devices and how I came to hear of it was from my brother who bought his in order to watch Russian television.Through both Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ), there are Russian channels which are available to add to your cable service, but both ask for ridiculous prices for channels that are free in Russia. $25 for two or three channels? No way.Through Roku, there are at least three services where you can get Russian television packages as low as $10 per month for over 150 channels, including 100+ Russian channels plus various other channels from CIS countries plus the Middle East.Are they legal? I don't know. But I would estimate the majority of the Russian speakers who own or heard about Roku learned of it through the process of searching for Russian television.As I learned, the problem is even bigger in the Spanish communities where you can get hundreds of US and Latin channels for the same $10 to $20, and that even includes pay channels like HBO and PPV.The problem was so bad that Mexican media companies filed suit, and Roku is now banned from sales in Mexico. Read about it here.Were those sales significant? I believe so, because Roku stated that it plans to fight the ruling. It sold Roku in Mexico through its website, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) for Mexico and Walmart Mexico (WMT).The issues, of course, are not limited to just Mexico and also apply to the English-speaking world as we have seen in the United Kingdom.In a major win for broadcasters, the English Premier League and the Internet Service Providers now have the ability to simply shut down any IP address, which is streaming questionable content, bypassing the hardware controls.With this decision, the question of whether Roku would shut down illegal channels is no longer a issue as it is the internet service providers who are cutting off the cord.As we discussed in our last article, Roku recently launched the Roku Channel where it offers streaming movies and embeds its advertising in the streams.Two birds with one stone, right? Roku is able to give cord cutters another choice in movie streaming that is legal AND generate some much needed revenue.Roku has finally released the channel and am proud to say, I am currently watching a movie while working on this article.After having XTV shut down, Roku Channel is much needed. But is it a solution? My take on it is that it feels like a rush job to answer some real IPO concerns. The channel shows.The user interface screams ""cheap"" and is on the level you would expect from a private channel run by an individual. It is completely not up to par or what you would expect from a multi-million dollar company.The second and bigger issue is the lack of movies. The channel features about 50 or more movies, documentaries, and TV shows that can be streamed. The vast majority of the movies are from the 80s to early 2000s. Not even on Amazon Prime do you find so many Jean Claude Van Damme and Steven Segal movies... movies that went direct to DVD/VHS.Source: AuthorOne of the three movies I considered and have chosen to watch is Ronin, the 1998 Robert Deniro and Jean Reno movie that has become a cult classic for car chases and gun fights.During the movie, I was interrupted every 15 mins or so to watch three advertisements each break, 30 seconds each. Unfortunately, out of all the commercials, many were repeats to the point that by the 3rd time I saw a commercial for The Cosmopolitan hotel and casino, I started to get pissed off that the commercials were at much higher volume than the movie. The other commercials were Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), American Express (NYSE:AXP), Claritin, and I forgot the rest.While I believe this is a good start, there is no way it is replacing Netflix, Amazon, Hulu or even YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) for my watch time. Beyond Ronin, the only things of interest to watch for me are the 2006 movie ""The Pursuit of Happiness"" and 2003's ""Bad Boys 2"".Note: After completing the article and going through the edit process, I just realized that the majority of the movies on the Roku Channel are also available on other free channels like Tubit, along with paid services like Netflix.When considering the IPO, I believe it is imperative to seriously consider illegal streaming as a big threat. Roku even outlines this in its IPO filing.Source: Roku S1While Roku can somewhat control its sales trajectory of Roku devices for illegal streaming through controlling private channels, as we have seen in the UK, if the ISPs are allowed to shut down internet connections, it is out of Roku's control.A significant amount of Roku's success comes from illegal streaming, and I would LOVE to see Roku both acknowledge the issue and try to quantify the impact on revenue.As we have seen, Roku is seemingly in between a rock and a hard place. On one hand, it has control over what goes on to its platform, while on the other, if what helped make it successful becomes a bigger issue, governments can step in and put an end to them.Any Roku potential investor needs to seriously consider these risks in their due diligence process."
4107657,101421,2017-09-18T11:22:53-04:00,"Roku wants to sell 9 million shares of its Class A common stock along with 6.7 million shares from selling shareholders at a midpoint price of $13.00 per share.The firm is transitioning from a device-centric focus to device and advertising business model.Given its growth trajectory and progress management has made diversifying its revenue streams, my opinion on the IPO is a BUY.","Entertainment streaming service provider Roku (ROKU) has filed proposed terms for its $204 million IPO, seeking to sell a total of 15.67 million shares at a midpoint price of $13.00 per share.Roku has developed a family of set-top boxes and related services that enable consumers to view television content at a time of their choosing.Management is growing the business smartly while diversifying revenues from its historical focus on the device to now selling advertising and services as a major part of its revenue stream.My opinion on the IPO is a BUY at the proposed price of $13.00 per share.Roku was founded in 2002 to improve the television viewing service by creating a hardware and software system that enables on-demand viewing.The firm was founded by Anthony Wood, CEO, who also founded ReplayTV where he ‘invented the first DVR.’Below is a brief overview video of Roku’s streaming players. A more recent video would have included the recently launched ‘Ultra’ viewer, which is Roku’s flagship device:(Source: Roku)Roku also sells Roku TVs, which integrate the firm’s operating system into the TV.Additionally, Roku sells advertising via ad units of differing types across its service and is focusing its future development efforts more intently on the advertising portion of its offerings, as the revenue chart breakdown shows below.(Sources: TechCrunch and Jan Dawson/Jackdaw Research)Roku wants to sell 9 million shares and selling stockholders want to sell 6.7 million shares of Class A common stock at $13.00 per share for expected gross proceeds of approximately $204 million, not including customary underwriter allotments.Assuming a successful IPO, the company’s post-IPO valuation would be $1.23 billion on a likely annual revenue run rate of $450 million, resulting in a Price/Sales multiple of 2.74x.Roku’s topline revenue growth for 2017 will probably be in the neighborhood of 12.5% on a 2016 base of $399 million.Gross margin has been increasing, with 1H 2017 coming in at 38%. However, Roku is still using significant cash in operations, exceeding $30 million in each of the past two years and currently on track to exceed that figure in 2017.As of June 30, 2017, the firm had $70 million in cash and $185 million in total liabilities, so adding the IPO net proceeds of perhaps $100 million after expenses, the firm would likely have $160 million in cash going forward, ample to meet its existing obligations for the near future.I previously wrote about Roku’s IPO prospects in my article, Roku Files $100 Million Placeholder For U.S. IPO.In that article, I highlighted that Roku has been posting very good results with ‘rapid growth in streaming hours,' a sign that users are continuing their transition to the platform and streaming services in general.However, management has been shifting the business model from a device oriented focus (Player) to an advertising-centric one, which it refers to as 'Platform.'It has made good progress toward that goal, apparently generating approximately 48% of its revenue from advertising services in 2Q 2017.If management can continue to grow revenue through this combination of hardware and services, then in my view it will justify its proposed Price/Sales multiple of 2.74x.By comparison, broadcasting firms were priced at a sales multiple of 1.58x in January 2017, according to NYU Stern valuation data.So, Roku’s current growth trajectory and progress diversifying its revenue streams would appear to make a case for buying the IPO at the proposed share price of $13.00.My opinion on the Roku IPO is a BUY.I write about IPOs, corporate investment in technology startups and M&A deals.

4104588,101924,2017-09-06T15:09:39-04:00,"Roku, a tech company which sells both streaming boxes and smart TV interfaces, has launched preliminary plans for its IPO.Roku is transitioning away from low-margin hardware to high-margin software, which will allow it to become a neutral platform for content publishers.The company is unprofitable like other tech IPOs, but losses are shrinking and revenue is growing despite intense competition.","In good news for a generally successful 2017 tech IPO market, streaming and hardware company Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) announced preliminary plans for its IPO. Roku recently filed an S-1 report with the SEC, putting down a placeholder value of $100 million and indicating that it plans to file under the label ROKU. In July, Roku was apparently seeking a valuation of $1 billion.There are reasons to be skeptical about Roku’s fortunes. The idea that a company with 15.1 million active accounts can be called “little” may seem absurd, but that is the reality which Roku must face as it moves to compete against giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). And like so many current tech IPOs including the disappointing Snap (NYSE:SNAP), Roku is not profitable and makes no promises to be so in the foreseeable future.But there are reasons why investors should expect Roku to continue to hold its ground and this IPO to do well. Roku is a company looking to move into the right direction as it transitions from low-margin hardware to high-margin software and is in great position to take advantage of the growing popularity of cord cutting. Investors should listen to Roku about how they will take advantage of new trends in TV streaming and strongly consider this stock.There are two key elements to Roku’s business. Roku sells boxes which allow customers to stream Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other streaming services to their televisions. Furthermore, it also licenses software and collects advertising revenue from its investment in India as part of its so-called platform operations.If Roku was only a hardware manufacturer, I would be telling investors to stay far away from this company in part due to competition from larger peers. Apple already sells its own streaming box Apple TV, and there is further competition from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). Roku’s device is significantly cheaper than Apple TV, but Apple could try to slash prices to put the squeeze on Roku and has greater bargaining power with retailers. And investors have to consider past, smaller companies like Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) which sold small tech devices and struggled after going public.Given that Roku player sales made up about 75 percent of its 2016 fiscal year revenue, this grim prognostication of its hardware department may discourage investors. But it is the other 25 percent and its platform operations which matter. While Roku’s platform operations made up 25 percent of Roku’s net revenue, it made up over 60 percent of its gross profit. And in the first six months of 2017, platform operations made up over 40 percent of its revenue and 80 percent of its gross profit.These numbers along with statements from Roku CEO Anthony Wood make it clear that Roku wants to not just be a company making boxes, but one which makes money through ads and licensing its technology to other manufacturers. And as TV streaming continues to grow more popular, Roku is in a strong position to do just that.In fact, Roku’s small size can be an advantage. While the mega titans like Amazon and Apple brawl with each other for supremacy in every tech field, Roku can sit in the corner and be a neutral player happy to work with any streaming service. For now, Netflix is Roku’s biggest partner and accounts for about a third of customer total streaming hours.Skeptics have claimed that if Netflix were to terminate its contact with Roku which expires next year, Roku would be in serious trouble. But while that is true, Roku is not particularly more dependent on Netflix relative to any other streaming device. Roku correctly points out that Netflix makes up “approximately 35% share of traffic on North America fixed networks.”Roku is big enough of a player that streaming services cannot afford to drop it easily, and it is nowhere as intimidating to deal with as larger corporations. It has a solid niche, it is transitioning and adapting well to changing technological trends, and while it is unprofitable, its losses have somewhat declined.The problems of competition will be a threat and investors should ask Roku about more details about its long-term technological interests and future projects. But there is plenty of time as Roku has not released details about how much it actually plans to raise or share price. The blinding failure of Snap has prevented investors from seeing that many tech IPOs in 2017 have performed well, and there are plenty of reasons to believe Roku can also do well."
4105184,79445,2017-09-08T02:27:43-04:00,Discussion of the newly introduced Roku Channel.A look at the potential financial impact.Discussion of the competitive threats.,"First of all, thank you to everyone who has read my previous Roku (ROKU) article and commented on it. I was blown away by the response and that it was one of my most widely read article over the last year and the MOST widely read article on mobile devices. Mind...Blown!If you have not read it yet, please take a look at ""Roku: Great Product, Bad Business?""One of the big discussion points that came out of the article's comments was centered around the idea of how Roku would monetize their watch time and grow service revenues.You can only charge so much for placing a company's button on the remote and there are only certain places to place ads on the system's home screen.After all, Netflix (NFLX), Amazon (AMZN) and Hulu would not likely let you place your own ads in their services, and Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) is not sharing their YouTube advertising revenue stream.So how do you monetize it?Just yesterday Roku announced a new in-house channel that would give users free content supported by advertising.Source: Roku BlogAny IPO investor who is concerned with profitability should take note.Source: Roku BlogFor those who are not familiar with Roku or ""channels,"" this is essentially a video on demand service or a very small Netflix, where you will be able to watch movies and other content with advertising.It is NOT a live TV channel, however.It's revenue, right?With declining Roku hardware sales figures as seen in the offering documents (based on falling prices and cheaper units), Roku needs to significantly grow service revenues in order to stay alive long-term.How much revenue can this mean? Let's try to find out.The good news is, Roku has 15.1 million active accounts.Digging through the offering documents we know that an ""Active account"" is defined as a distinct user that has streamed content over the last 30 days.Source: Roku S1We further know from the S1 documents that users have streamed over 3.5 billion hours over the last quarter. Assuming all of those were from active users, that works out to over 231 hours per quarter per user.The Roku Channel would be brand newHow much does it mean for advertising?Let's say in the best-case scenario, Roku takes 10% of the total stream time. This would mean 350 million quarterly hours or 23.17 hours per user per quarter.Advertising rates vary, but on a popular TV show, an advertiser can be paying $20 for a 30-second spot per 1,000 views or CPM.YouTube charges advertisers about $7.60 CPM for a 30-second ad. Let's go with those numbers as I feel that is what Roku is most likely to get.On their blog, they promise about half the ads of regular television.Regular TV currently shows about 15 minutes of advertising per hour. Let's take Roku at their word and assume eight minutes of ads per hour for the Roku channel.Eight minutes of advertising would be enough for 16 thirty-second spots.16 * $7.60 would get us $121.6 CPM per hour,$121.6 * 23.17 hours per user gets us $2,817.Divide by 1,000 and multiply by 15.1 million users and we have about $42 million in revenue per quarter.What we have to take into consideration, however, is that Roku has stated that they may be sharing that revenue with a network partner so that $42 million in revenue may go down to $21 million if they do a similar split to Google/YouTube.The other big IF is IF Roku can actually capture 10% of the total streaming time to their channel.Currently, Netflix accounts for about 1/3, and the top five account for most of those hours.The bad part is Roku has competition.The first and most obvious are the current top watched channels, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, Sling, YouTube.Source: Screenshot from my Roku account.Then you have the other multi-platform channels such as Pluto, Crackle, and Tubitv which give you free movies.Source: Screenshot of my Roku page.You further have Roku ""channels"" for networks such as TNT, CW, TBS, Fox, A&E, USA, History and others that let you watch their own content, most often without commercials.Source: Screenshot of my Roku page.Thanks to a Seeking Alpha reader who commented on my previous article, I now know that if you have cable service from Comcast (CMCSA)/xfinity or Spectrum, you can use your Roku as a cable box.Source: Screenshot of my Roku page.Finally, there are ""private"" channels such as NowhereTV, FilmOn, XTV and others that let you watch live channels and video on demand from anywhere in the world for free.Monetizing the streaming is the appropriate next step for Roku if they want to be profitable.There is very little money long-term in hardware, especially once research and development costs are considered for the next generation of products. We have already seen pricing pressures on streaming devices and it is likely to continue in the future. Unlike Amazon, Google and Apple (AAPL), Roku cannot afford to give away free devices, especially since they are only monetizing a small percentage of the views.We do know that Roku HAS TO monetize streaming. Yet, it is highly unlikely they will monetize the majority of the streaming time which currently goes to the top streaming networks.The question becomes then, will users tune in to the Roku Channel? Or will they just pass it up?One thing for certain, it will take weeks to even find out. Even though Roku has announced it, it is not yet available on Roku devices.Sounds like a last minute move to please potential IPO buyers? Perhaps.One thing for sure, however, Roku users are quick to offer suggestions...Source: Roku Blog CommentsAs a Roku customer with multiple devices, I am pleased to see even more content added to Roku which will make cord-cutting easier. Will it make any difference to me? Eh, not really. I will browse the channel just in case I am out of things to watch on Netflix, Amazon, YouTube and am not in the mood to watch any live TV or video on demand content from XTV.As an investor, I am pleased to see Roku try more to monetize their network but I am not sure if this has legs or will merely drive people away to other content and channels. It does feel to me a bit forced and premature considering the announcement comes shortly after the IPO announcement and weeks before the channel is ready to be rolled out.Only time will tell and am looking forward to the ride.Thank you for reading and your comments as always."

Roku pioneered streaming to the television through a device that used the internet. As of June 30th, Roku has 15.1 million active accounts. In the first six months of 2017, Roku owners have streamed 6.7 billion hours through their Roku devices. This is 62% more hours streamed in comparison to the same time period in 2016. Roku devices give users access to more than 500,000 movies and television shows as well as live sports and more. They offer access to content in three different ways; subscription, ad-supported and transactional. The Roku device is intended to offer users a way to choose the content they want without having to pay for a cable television subscription, often referred to as cutting the cord. This is the number one TV streaming platform in the United States by hours streamed according to a survey commissioned for the first quarter of 2017. Roku believes that content publishers and advertisers both benefit from having access to this over-the-top customer base that is entirely on one platform.In the first 6 months of 2017, Roku generated $199.7 million in revenue, an increase of 23% year over year. In 2016, it generated a total of $398.6 million, a 25% increase from the fiscal year 2015. Roku generated revenue from selling its steaming players as well as through the sale of subscriptions and advertisement on its platform. In the first 6 months of 2017, player revenue represented 59% of total revenue while platform revenue made up 41%, a 91% increase year over year.Roku believes that the value of the company will come from its ARPU:Source: TechCrunchThis increase in ARPU is a pretty impressive stat for investors to consider. It is clear that Roku believes it can find profitability as it shifts its business model to focus on revenue from its platform rather than device sales. Despite its improvements in ARPU, Roku still posted a loss of $24.2 million for the first half of 2017. If it continues at this pace, it will post a loss of $48.4 million, even larger than its loss of $42.8 million in 2016.Investors who are considering investing in Roku should look at some comparable hardware companies that turned public in 2014 and 2015, respectively.First, let's examine Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), a hardware company that IPOed in 2015.FIT data by YChartsFitbit has struggled greatly since its IPO in 2015. The share price, which spiked to over $50.00 in late 2015, has settled under $6.00. The main difficulty Fitbit faces is its dependence on new device sales to maintain and grow its revenue. It seems that Roku's management has already realized that device sales are not going to be a sustainable growth model. Even with this understanding, Roku's primary revenue still comes from its device sales. Potential buyers should look at Fitbit's performance following IPO before considering a purchase of Roku shares.Next, we should examine GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), a company that went public in 2014.GPRO data by YChartsAfter shares spiked to over $90.00, they have now settled below $9. Again, we should consider the fact that GoPro depends so heavily on device sales, which Roku is hoping to avoid. Investors have made the mistake of grossly overvaluing these device companies that only offer one product twice before, so what is stopping the same from happening with Roku?Source: TechCrunchRoku, GoPro and Fitbit are all similar in that they offer one kind of product. Fitbit offered the first fitness wearable, GoPro offered a new kind of camera and Roku offered one of the first OTT streaming devices. The question is, will Roku be successful in its attempt to shift from a company that generates its revenue from device sales to a company that generates the majority of revenues from its platform.An excerpt from a TechCrunch article summarizes the challenges that Roku will face:Read the quote above, one company is not like the others. While Roku may have been the first to market, it is facing off against three tech juggernauts. Unless there is a potential for Roku to be acquired, I simply do not see a way it can survive the competition it is facing. Investors can tinker with numbers and dissect financials as much as they would like, I do not believe that Roku has strong future prospects, simply because of its competition. Twice, investors have seen tech device companies IPO and crash. I believe it is likely that Roku will share the same fate as GoPro and Fitbit following their IPO."
4103794,79445,2017-09-03T04:54:38-04:00,Discussion of the recently announced ROKU IPO.We take a look at the product and its benefits and the competitive threats.Initial quick dive into the financials.,"Even though I was not planning on writing about Roku Inc. (ROKU) until next week, I was inspired. I was inspired to do some ROKU research while watching Shark Tank... on my ROKU 3 unit.As someone who is concerned with the state of the economy, I am interested in the upcoming IPOs for the sole reason to see if they are quality companies, or merely companies who are rushing to come out towards the end of the bull market before the market crashes in order to cash out previous investors.My last IPO articles were focused on YogaWorks (YOGA), and while I am a fan of the Yoga lifestyle, the financials simply did not line up. The company was simply not profitable, no matter how much the revenues grew. Since my initial articles, the stock fell more than 20% and fell more than 35% from its IPO price.Roku produces a product that I LOVE... but is it yet another YogaWorks?Or as they beautifully state on Shark Tank... It's a Product... NOT a Business.For those that are not familiar with Roku as a company, let's spend a few minutes reviewing what it is and why I own 2 Roku boxes.Roku was the first mainstream solution to playing Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) streaming service to your TV in 2008.Since then, Roku has gone through multiple generations of devices and we are currently on the 5th generation of set top devices.Today, Rokus are full featured, developer friendly devices which let millions of people cut the cord from cable companies and to easily stream internet content to their television.Through a Roku device you can easily watch your Netflix, Amazon Prime Video (AMZN), Hulu and Sling TV subscriptions, out of the box.More than that, you can also watch the numerous on the go premium services from HBO, Showtime and others, along with all you can consume content from free sources like YouTube (GOOG) (GOOGL).Beyond the mainstream channels, you can also access the thousands of other public and private programs to access global content from any category.We personally use our Roku devices to easily watch our 100+ Russian channels on TV. The benefits are clear, we can either buy a Roku device for $30 to $100 and pay $9 a month (to the service provider) for the package, or $20 a month for 3 channels to Comcast or Verizon.The Roku following is strong and broad, having found a home with cord-cutters (people who are canceling their cable TV packages) and people seeking an easier way to consume global content.The problem for Roku, however, is that it is not the only game in town anymore.Straight from ROKU's S1 offering document we get the following:Source: ROKU S1Therein is the problem. Without looking anywhere else, today Roku's mainstream competition alone is Apple's AppleTV (AAPL), Google's Chromecast device and Amazon's Amazon Stick.This competition should be taken seriously because they are single handidly responsible for Roku having to develop lower cost products.Traditionally, Roku's lowest cost offering was $49 for devices such as the Roku 1 device.After the barrage of cheap, perhaps subsidized devices such as the Chromecast ($35) and Firestick ($35), Roku was forced to develop the cheaper Roku Stick ($39) and the Roku Express ($29).As noted above, Roku's competition today is no longer limited to just add-on devices. Roku is now also competing with internet enabled televisions such as Samsung's, which support the major streaming services out of the box.Lastly, you have competition from add-on hardware such as the XBox (MSFT), PlayStation (SNE) and Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) consoles along with set top BluRay players.Did I mention that my Comcast cable box also let me stream my Netflix? Yep. The cable providers are now expanding their set top box capabilities with streaming services.It is not 2008 anymore!But the market is big enough, right?Perhaps.Yes, the streaming market is huge and it is an almost certainty that more people will be looking at devices like the Roku as they get rid of their expensive bundled cable plans.While we do not know Roku's entire operating results, we do have data of the last few years.Roku was able to finish out 2016 generating over $398 million, and increase from $319 million the year before.Roku has further generated $199 million in the first 6 months of 2017, up from $162 million for the first 6 months in 2016.Source: ROKU S1As we can see, Roku has two reporting segments, Hardware/Player sales and Platform sales.The platform numbers are Roku's way of monetizing the platform beyond the sale of the player.Source: ROKU S1In essence, the two best places to see the advertising are on the home screen like we can see in the screenshot advertising Game of Thrones, and the buttons on the remote.Source: Roku S1Buttons on the remote? Brilliant. Who would have thought?For the longest time I figured it was just the way it was. I even bought my Roku because it had one button access to Amazon Prime Video as you can see in the picture of my remote control below.Source: MaksFSTo my surprise, the current remote features Sling and Showtime, replacing Amazon and RDIO.Source: Roku.comRoku apparently also takes a commission when you purchase a subscription to one of the services through their platform.The one big area of focus, however, is advertising in content.In fact, I have also seen a number of articles in the media focusing on this point.But... there is a problem.The problem you see is twofold.First... I bought a Roku NOT to see advertising.The other problem and the bigger problem is that we have yet to see it really work.Source: ROKU S1Amazon and YouTube want people to keep watching their content, not anything else on Roku.They may also not want to share any information about the user's watching habits.Perhaps the bigger issue is... Those main channels are also accounting for the vast majority of the watch time.Source: ROKU S1The top 5 channels account for 70% of the total hours streamed. We can assume those 5 would be Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube and I am guessing Sling.With the exception of Sling, I do not believe the other top providers would be too happy to share their user data.As per the above statement, even though Netflix accounted for about 1/3 of the total watch time, it is not a ""risk"" because ""although Netflix is the largest provider of content across our platform, revenue generated from Netflix was not material to our overall revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2017, and we do not expect revenue from Netflix to be material to our operating results for the foreseeable future.""You know what I call that? A HUGE FREAKING PROBLEM! Your top content provider accounted for ""no material revenue"" and is not expected to in the near future?Source: PinterestBut wait... it gets better.Roku does talk about the growing number of ad-monetized streaming hours, the largest of which being YouTube.Source: ROKU S1For all of their competitive threats and issues, Roku is profitable and operating on fairly healthy gross profit margins.The biggest problem, however, in all of their operating history, Roku has yet to turn an operating profit, burdened by corporate expenses and ongoing research and development.While I have not dived in too deep into the S1 yet, my initial reactions are that while I am excited as a customer, I am still very far away from seeing this as a sustainable business in the long term.The product is fantastic... but as a user I do believe the best and most opportune times for Roku are behind them. Simply put, there is nothing really proprietary about what Roku accomplishes that cannot be replicated by other devices.The Roku devices are access tools to content. More importantly, none of the top content consumed on Roku devices is exclusive to Roku and can be accessed in a number of other ways.Would exclusive content help Roku build a moat? Absolutely... but I don't believe that is the direction.Obviously every business has a value and we will have to see with Roku.I hope this was helpful in your due diligence search and thanks for reading and your follows!For the complete offering documents, please take a look at the S1 here.Income IdeaInterested in sustainable income ideas?

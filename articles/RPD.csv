It plays in fast-evolving segments of the cybersecurity space. These segments have expanded its addressable market. Rapid7 has the capability to gain market share. Its forward growth, margins, and cash flow guidance are promising. Its growth options are also enticing. Rapid7 has also improved its balance sheet. Its improved margins and cash flows leave little reasons to worry about its ability to meet its interest and future debt obligations. I believe Rapid7 will continue to leverage its brand and experience in the vulnerability management space to cross-sell its new offerings. I will be upgrading to a bullish rating.All products delivered as Rapid7 outperformed last quarter. The solid go-to-market motion for security transformation offerings, including IDR (cloud SIEM), Insight Connect, and DivvyCloud, contributed to the overall revenue and ARR growth. Rapid7’s land and expand strategy also delivered as ARR/Customer grew to $41.6k (+20%y/y). The usage of Rapid7’s solutions offset headwinds related to COVID-19. Due to the strong Q2’20 outperformance in addition to the solid momentum of its offerings, Rapid7 comfortably raised Q3’20 and FY revenue guidance.Rapid7 raised ARR guidance for the full year by $15m at the midpoint to a range of $404m-420m. This represents a y/y growth of 24%. Full-year revenue guidance was also raised to a range of $399-403m or growth of 22% to 23%. Total revenue for Q3'20 is expected to be in the range of $100.7 million to $102.3 million, representing a growth of 21% to 23%.Going forward, demand will continue to be driven by Rapid7’s strong lineup of security offerings. The recent addition of cloud security offerings to protect cloud workloads, configuration, and network traffic analysis capabilities provides a strong tailwind to its growth momentum. Rapid7 is one of the few players innovating for the fast-evolving DevSecOps market. I view this strategic focus as a strong sign of its ability to drive sustainable growth in the long term.Rapid7’s platform strategy has been immensely strengthened in recent quarters. The recent debt issuance has provided more capital to accelerate its market share expansion drive. In recent quarters, Rapid7 has unveiled new capabilities to expand the power of its platform.Cloud Identity and Access Management Governance Module for DivvyCloudThis is part of Rapid7's strategy to expand its presence into the cloud security space. The IAM module improves on the identity security offerings provided by cloud platforms. This plays into the cloud security posture management sub-segment of the cloud workload segment.Enhanced Endpoint Telemetry for InsightIDRRapid7 recently added Enhanced Endpoint Telemetry (EET) to its SIEM solution. This capability gives customers more visibility into endpoints to improve security investigations.In addition to its network traffic analysis capabilities, I believe EET is a way for Rapid7 to distinguish itself in the congested endpoint security space.I expect cost savings related to offline activities to be reinvested into growing Rapid7’s sales capacity to drive more growth opportunities in the second half of the year. While billings improved last quarter, I remain wary of macro headwinds to billings via reduced contract duration from cloud engagements. I anticipate EPS headwinds due to hiring ramp, higher net interest expenses, expenses from the acquisition of DivvyCloud, and cloud investments. I expect the headwinds to be partially offset by usage expansion and upsell. Despite these headwinds, Rapid7 raised full-year non-GAAP loss per share to be in the range of a loss of $0.14 to a loss of $0.10. This benefits its full-year cash flow from operations guidance of a loss of approximately $15 million. This is an improvement from the -$25m it initially guided. I believe these metrics are encouraging against a backdrop of intense competition in the cybersecurity space.Rapid7's improved competitive positioning continues to pull it away from being perceived as a pure vulnerability management platform. Its growing capability in DevSecOps resembles the strategy being deployed by pure DevOps players such as Datadog (DDOG) and Elastic (NYSE:ESTC). Rapid7’s competitive positioning is differentiated via its capabilities in vulnerability management, network traffic analysis, security automation, and threat intelligence. I expect these unique capabilities to endear customers to its brands.Rapid7’s valuation highlights the potential for multiple expansion, which will be driven by its growth factor. While investments to drive growth will continue to impact its profitability and cash flow factors, the growing ARR and margins trend point to a future with well-rounded valuation factors. The additional capabilities in cloud security and network traffic analysis give it a platform that can be mimicked by only a few competitors.Source: Seeking AlphaIf we look at Rapid7's value factor, we find out that algos/quants consider book value and GAAP metrics. Rapid7 reported an adjusted EBITDA of $7.5m last quarter compared to $2.7m in the previous year. This amounts to an 8.3% EBITDA margin, while Rapid7 is still investing in growing market share. Adjusted-EBITDA excludes certain non-cash items and non-recurring items, including stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, litigation expenses, and acquisition-related expenses. Analysts are expecting revenue to compound to $566m by CY'22. If we apply an EBITDA margin of 20%, this results in a Debt/EBITDA ratio of 4x within the next two years. This ratio is attractive because revenue is still compounding in the mid-teens, largely from its expanded capabilities in cloud security and security operations.Source: Rapid7Also, the sales ratios are compared to the sector average. I provided a group of stocks that are better comps in the first valuation chart. From the chart, it is obvious that Rapid7 is not expensive when considering its huge growth factor. This growth factor benefits from its capabilities in cloud security, security operations, automation, and vulnerability management. The cloud security market is valued at $5b-7b. It is expected to grow to about $10b-12b over the next three years. I expect Rapid7 to win 4-5% of the cloud market. This represents an additional $50m-100m in annual recurring revenue, excluding add-ons from automation and SecOps. I believe the added revenue opportunity will come at a huge margin because Rapid7 will be mostly cross-selling to its installed base.Source: Seeking AlphaWhile Rapid7's growth factor is impressive, it is slightly weakened by earnings and cash flow growth. Earnings volatility isn't insightful when a tech stock is still investing in the early stage of its business lifecycle. This is due to occasional accounting expenses from acquisitions and non-cash compensation expenses. Also, Rapid7's recent debt issuance increases interest expense. Despite this scenario, it is impressive to know that Rapid7 is growing working capital and cash flows.Source: Seeking AlphaIn terms of its profitability factor, most of the profitability metrics are also impacted by the non-linearity of capital investment to grow market share. Two promising metrics are gross margins and Capex/Sales. A 71% gross margin is hard to find in the tech sector if you are not a SaaS stock. The sector median gross margin is 47%. This means metrics like the ROA, ROCE are inapplicable as they only consider the period earnings. The recurring nature of SaaS revenue means these metrics underestimate future earnings to be derived from current capital investments.Source: Seeking AlphaRapid7's momentum factor is impressive. This is partly due to its strong growth factor and the broad market demand for tech stocks. YTD, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500. I believe the market is yet to digest the potentials of the new growth options from its new security capabilities. These growth options will drive more returns in the coming quarters.Rapid7’s demand-side risk factors will continue to be offset by its ability to drive multiple product adoption from its installed base. I'm confident in its go-to-market motion. Readers will recall that the Q3'20 guidance baked in macro volatility.Rapid7's financials point to strong potential for multiples expansion, and its recent debt issuance provides ample liquidity to weather short-term volatility to its operating cash flows. The non-GAAP operating margin and operating cash flow guidance point to Rapid7's focus on improving earnings and FCF.Pressure from competitors will come from niche segments such as endpoint security. I've also observed DevOps players developing security operations capabilities as a major threat to its growing DevSecOps capabilities. This will be the biggest risk concern next to the frothiness in the tech space.Rapid7 continues to provide a favorable risk-reward opportunity for growth investors. Investors need to be able to overlook its weak profitability factor and potential headwinds to cash flows due to the volatile macro environment. The current valuation continues to underrepresent the potential in its newly acquired capabilities beyond the vulnerability management space. These capabilities will drive strong growth in the coming quarters. I believe Rapid7 is an attractive investment opportunity to bet on the future of cloud security.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4360790,103012,2020-07-25T07:36:19-04:00,"As work and personal lives move to the cloud, it exposes people to sophisticated threats and puts cybersecurity as a top priority.As an enterprise solutions provider, Rapid7 is regarded as a leader in most of its product categories and is worth a look as a long-term investment.However, short-term headwinds caused by COVID-19 are hurting growth and profitability. The company will fail to break even in 2020 and even in 2021.The company remains very inefficient in generating sales and has yet to achieve the 'Rule of 40' benchmark in various stages of the product life cycle.We believe the market recognizes these shortcomings and values the company reasonably at 8x sales.","IT trends come and go, but cybersecurity is poised to stay as every company is turning into a software company. A name that will benefit from this mass migration is Rapid7. But is it a wise investment?Founded in 2000, it has been growing at a steady pace and developed cybersecurity solutions across the entire IT environment. Today, it is a leader in vulnerability risk management (‘VRM’), rubbing shoulders with Qualys (QLYS) and Tenable (TENB), and also in security information and event management (‘SIEM’), competing with FireEye (FEYE) and Splunk (SPLK).While the market is hyper-competitive, the pie grows rapidly. To capture further growth, Rapid7 has recently acquired DivvyCloud (May 2020). This move promises to solidify its position within Cloud Application Security and helps to multiply its total addressable market to $34B from $9B. From the macro perspective, major opportunities abound.Despite the top position accolades and apparent tailwinds, we wonder if Rapid7 will sustain its 30%+ growth, or achieve economies of scale quickly enough to stay at the top. Having been around for 20 years, it is still a relatively small company with $350M in annual sales. It has grown over 30% in the past five quarters but has started to slow down. The management has guided near-term growth down to 20% until COVID-19 problems go away.What's more, at the core, its customer retention rate is also slowing down. ARR growth (annual recurring revenue) halved to 15% in FY2020. Thus, despite the rapidly expanding market, Rapid7 is underachieving.We want to select the best SaaS company in our portfolio in this seemingly frothy market. But with Rapid7, we need to take a big leap of faith to start a position. On balance, we believe the market is rational to value the company at 8x sales, in the middle of the cybersecurity cohort. For now, we would stay on the sideline and may start a position at a significant dip.Before COVID, businesses were digitalizing steadily. During COVID-19, the migration has gone en masse.However, the rampant shift to digital and migration to the cloud presents complex security risks and expose everyone to unpredictable attack avenues.Unquestionably, recent research has pinpointed security/cyber risks as the most important initiative for 2020, stating that more than a third of all companies will engage a service provider to mitigate this risk. Only 5% of all companies surveyed are shunning/deferring action.The trend is a huge tailwind for Rapid7. The management forecasts that Rapid7's total addressable market will grow from $9B to $34B in the near future.Source: Rapid7 Q1 2020 results earning call presentationA large part of the expansion of the total addressable market is expected to come from the recent acquisition of DivvyCloud, in combination with InsightAppSec, and tCell, adding $7B alone.Now, the question is, will the company be able to take advantage of the expanding market?We would not be so sure.Let's review the most recent financials. The company reported Q1 FY20 earnings on May 9th. The snapshot below shows that Rapid7 executed exceptionally.Revenue grew 33% YoY, continuing the strong momentum for 5 quarters. Source: Rapid7 Q1 FY2020, 10-QImportantly, 90% of its revenue is recurring, and this portion improved rapidly in Q1 (+31% YoY).This shows that more customers renewed Rapid7’s service, backing up the company’s strong claims as a leader in VRM and SIEM, both are also validated by external sources.The Gartner Magic Quadrant shows that Rapid7 scores top positions in VRM and SIEM segments.Altogether, Q1 FY2020 was a success, capping off a strong run of 5 quarters and showing solid growth stretching back from 2015.However, the future is not as rosy.In the short term, Rapid7 is likely to experience reduced revenue and ARR growth (14%-20%). Additionally, this year will also mark another year of unsuccessful attempt to break even. The management is cautiously optimistic that it can start to generate free cash flow in 2021.This goes to show that the rapidly growing market does not necessarily mean the pie is up for grab. Rapid7's strong product adoption rate in the past four years has yet to translate into profitability and cash generation. The latter is crucial, especially for companies that are showing signs of slower growth.Let’s put Rapid7's financials to a bigger test, SaaS ‘Rule of 40’ and Magic Number, and see what the numbers tell.Unsurprisingly, Rapid7 failed the holy grail benchmark 'Rule of 40' for SaaS companies. A measure used widely to predict SaaS companies' future success at various stages of the product life cycle.We can broadly divide a product life cycle into (i) product-market fit, (ii) growth, (iii) maturity & optimization, (iv) decline. Rapid7 already found product-market fit, so we’ll assess how it performs in the latter 2 stages. SourceAt the growth stage of the product life cycle, Rapid7 is expected to ramp up sales, thus it would be unreasonable to expect Rapid7 to be profitable. However, when comparing to companies like Splunk, CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD), or Slack (WORK), it is clear that the peers’ growth rate is in a different league, recording 50%+ growth. Yes, they are still not profitable (and burning cash), but they are investing correctly to achieve hyper-growth, displacing incumbents, and are rewarded with much higher valuations than Rapid7 (see next section).If we place Rapid7 at the optimization stage of the product life cycle, we would not expect Rapid7 to record a CAGR of 30% over a long period; however, it would need to be modestly profitable at the very least. As mentioned, the company is forecasted to grow at 20% and burn cash for at least the next three quarters. From this vantage point, Rapid7 is underperforming.Companies that are in this stage (<40% growth) such as VMware (VMW) and Veeva Systems (VEEV) are printing cash (30%+ yield). Their growth rate has slowed and stabilized, but they more than compensate in economies of scale (moderating R&D investment, optimizing SG&A for growth vs. retention) and/or in leveraging their existing customer base (up-selling and cross-selling, and exploring new business models).Unfortunately, Rapid7 is moving towards neither of these categories. SaaS Magic Number is widely used to measure sales efficiency. Rapid7 scores 0.22. It means that for every dollar spent on sales and marketing (S&M), the company is generating only $0.22 of sales, thus, very little ARR.As a rule of thumb, anything lower than 0.5 and the company should pause its investment in S&M. To put this in context, CrowdStrike scores 1.2 during the same period. SourceThe table below shows that the market rewards companies that can demonstrate hyper-growth in the early stage of the life cycle or/and generate high profitability in the latter stage. Rapid7 is performing strongly in neither, hence, it is being valued right in the middle of the cohort.Source: Authors’ working, company financials.*ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) growth was 88% in Q1 FY21Macro tailwinds from digital transformation projects appear to be the biggest driver in the short term. Investors rushed in flocks to this space, driving up valuations to levels not seen since 1999. We are not saying that a bubble is forming, some of the SaaS companies are duly deserved with premium valuations; however, it is becoming more difficult to pick out winners in this space.Our analysis shows that Rapid7 is one of the main beneficiaries of this long-term trend. Unfortunately, it is not guaranteed that it will succeed. In the short term, it faces slower topline growth and customer retention. Meanwhile, the company didn’t shine in either spectrum of the 'Rule of 40' benchmark, failing to grow fast and/or generating high profit. The low Magic Number also shows that its S&M is highly inefficient.As it stands, we believe the market does recognize Rapid7’s underachievement and values the stock fairly. Maybe the recent acquisition, DivvyCloud, is just the wildcard it needs. We will have to wait and see."

This has impacted its valuation multiples.The appetite to stomach short-term volatility is required to generate significant returns.","Source: BuiltInAustinRapid7 (RPD) is uniquely positioned compared to its peers in the VM (vulnerability management) space as it evolves the capabilities of its VM and SecOps (security operations) platform. Its financials reflect the cash outlay and margin sacrifice needed to innovate in the short term. Investors should focus on its evolving capabilities in cloud and network security to understand the full picture. These capabilities will give Rapid7 a unique edge as a security player combining vulnerability management with solid capabilities in security operations, endpoint security, and cloud security. Given its subdued valuation, the potential to outperform is strong.SecOps-Vulnerability Management-Cloud-ARRDemand for Rapid7's solutions has evolved beyond vulnerability management. Today, Rapid7 offers solutions that extend into the DevOps (evolves into SecOps) space. These solutions help with discovery, collection, analysis, and insight generation from network and endpoint data. Its SOAR (security orchestration, automation, and response) product automates the SecOps process via custom integrations and workflows to drive business efficiency. Rapid7 also has capabilities in modern application security. In recent quarters, Rapid7 has evolved its SecOps strategy to include capabilities in network traffic analysis (via the acquisition of NetFort), and cloud security via the acquisition of DivvyCloud. SIEM solutions are built to ingest and analyze network traffic, which makes the acquisition of NetFort a solid fit. The acquisition of DivvyCloud will drive the breadth of its endpoint coverage and threat intelligence with top cloud service providers. The combination of these capabilities will drive product retention, expansion, and sustainable growth.Rapid7 highlighted its strong ARR (+31% y/y @ 90% of total) growth during its last earnings call. It also highlighted its strong renewal rate, which drove revenue. Going forward, Rapid7's SecOps strategy, which enables deep visibility and expansion into endpoints and networks, will drive the demand for its platform. This will power the revenue growth guide of 20% in 2020. This will help Rapid7 maintain its leadership position in the VM space.Platform-Land & Expand-Margins-FCF-LiquiditySource: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)The need to drive growth has led to innovation through strategic acquisitions. These acquisitions were designed to expand Rapid7's endpoint and cloud visibility. The acquisition of DivvyCloud gives Rapid7 strong capabilities in cloud posture management, IAM, governance, visibility and monitoring, and platform extensibility. DivvyCloud provides continuous security and compliance for all the major cloud service providers. It also provides integrations with third-party platforms like Slack, Jira, ServiceNow, and PagerDuty.NetFort brings capabilities in network security monitoring. This extends to cloud platforms like Azure, and AWS where VPC traffic can be logged and studied. The end goal is to have more insight into new data lanes and endpoints.Endpoints and cloud platforms play into near term growth trends (digital transformation and WFH). By improving its visibility, Rapid7 will provide better insights to its customers via its SIEM solution. It will also be able to integrate with more cloud and SIEM vendors to power its SOAR solution. This will help Rapid7 plug churn by increasing value add to its customers. It will also drive customer retention as its offerings will be tough to replace. Rapid7's SecOps solutions are complemented by its consulting services. This will help Rapid7 play in the evolving EDR and XDR space which requires solution providers to drive security insights and business efficiency.Source: Morgan StanleyRapid7 prices per asset. Due to the proliferation of endpoints and cloud assets, ARR and ARR/customer will trend upwards. Positioning to gain from near term growth trends has impacted Rapid7's profitability factor. Gross margin will take a hit due to cloud hosting cost. GAAP operating margin and income margin will also be impacted by stock-based compensation to drive sales. The bet is that revenue growth will outpace OPEX growth due to seat expansion. This is inevitable given the near term demand tailwinds.The growth bets will also put a strain on free cash flow. Rapid7's balance sheet isn't spared either. It recently had to take on more leverage after issuing new debt ($200m). This has made its balance sheet the least attractive compared to Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) and Tenable (NASDAQ:TENB).Partnerships-Acquisitions-Integrations- Global ExpansionRapid7's strategy in the VM space is unique. While Tenable is doubling down on being the best VM, Rapid7 is evolving its capabilities as the platform that can collect, analyze, and drive actionable insights from multiple endpoints. It is also aiming to do this efficiently via its SOAR solution. This has informed its integration with SIEM vendors like Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE). The acquisition of DivvyCloud strengthens this strategy.Qualys is picking up its pace of innovation. It recently passed the asset discovery stage, where it increased the volume of endpoints it can monitor by offering its asset discovery tool for free. The next step is to add EDR capabilities to detect and respond to cyber threats. To do this efficiently, it has to come up with a robust SIEM offering akin to Rapid7. The advantage is that Rapid7 has a deeper experience and knowledge of the IDR space. Tenable is focusing on prioritizing security alerts and intelligence. It is also expanding its offerings into industrial systems via its recent acquisition of Indegy. Rapid7's biggest competition will come from EDR and SIEM players. This will mostly affect new deals. Existing customers will be delighted with the improved cloud and SIEM capabilities from DivvyCloud.Growth-Margins-FCF-Analysts-MomentumSource: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Rapid7 trades in line with its peers. Its valuation has been suppressed in recent quarters due to its low gross margin compared to competitors. This impacts the near-term acceleration of its margin improvement. Rapid7's debt load is also a concern when compared to its competitors. Rapid7's cash flow growth is going to be affected by customers' unwillingness to pay upfront due to the macro impacts of COVID-19. This drove its recent debt issuance. Rapid7's optionality will come from its ability to maintain its retention rate due to its added capabilities. This will be supported by its new cloud and network analysis solutions. These solutions will drive user growth. They will also power Rapid7's threat intelligence database. Rapid7's ability to partner with DevOps players will also improve due to its focus on network traffic visibility and cloud security posture management. These capabilities will come together to power Rpaid7's growth factor to drive multiple expansion.Demand-side risk factors are minimal due to favorable near term growth trends. Rapid7 is also ahead of the execution pace of most of its competitors.Rapid7's financials will rely heavily on its growth factor in the near term. This is risky, heading into the next earnings season. Revenue collection and cash flows will be under pressure if SMBs churn or demand new payment terms.Pressure from competitors will be in line only if Rapid7 can throw the weight of its brand behind its offerings. The SIEM space has strong players like IBM and Splunk. The EDR space is led by CrowdStrike and SentinelOne. Network security vendors are also reinventing their EDR offerings.Valuation risk is in line as Rapid7 trades fairly close to the average of its peers. This is despite its double-digit growth.Rapid7 has acquired most of the necessary capabilities to add value to its customers. These bets have put a strain on Rapid7's financials and valuation multiples. Short-term investors will be scared by accounting metrics that can trigger post-earnings volatility. There isn't evidence of a clear go-to-market weakness. Rapid7's strategy is to drive maximum customer value while partnering to accelerate its growth. This strategy will continue to power its growth factor in the long term."

While growth will be stalled in the short term, expanse into cloud security, continued cross-selling, and a wealth of offerings for its Insight platform will propel Rapid7 back to historical growth patterns.Rapid7 is a global cybersecurity company delivering visibility, analytics, and automation solutions via its Insight platform. Its primary offerings are composed of InsightIDR (a SaaS-based SIEM solution), InsightVM (Vulnerability Assessment), InsightAppSec (Application Security), InsightConnect (Automation), and DivvyCloud (Cloud Security), which it acquired earlier this year. Rapid7 markets to businesses of all sizes, with mid to large-sized enterprise clients currently contributing approximately half of ARR. Also, Rapid7 serves a wide range of verticals with its largest representing only 15% of ARR according to its most recent earnings call.Rapid7 released Q1 earnings in early May, revealing growing ARR (Annualized Recurring Revenue) despite the initial purchase delays that have come as a result of the pandemic. Total revenue and ARR grew by 29% and 31% respectively YoY. Also, recurring revenue increased to 90% of total revenue from 85% YoY, a strong sign for the business. ARR per customer increased by 15% year over year and 3.57% quarter over quarter.I have included a chart outlining the quarterly growth trends in ARR and customers as it should provide some better context:Source: Rapid7 Q4 2018 through Q1 2020 10-Q'sWhile growth during Q1 2020 looks worse than past quarters, especially in customer count, I’m not too worried overall. ARR has consistently been boosted by strong quarterly growth in ARR per customer, a clear trend that should help power Rapid7 through 2020 if potential new customers continue to hold out. Successful cross-selling is one of Rapid7’s overall strengths, which I will dive into soon. If there was a clear downward trend in customer count leading up to Q1 2020, then I’d be more worried about the future of the company post-pandemic. However, this is not the case, and I wouldn’t imagine the slowed growth in customers is any more than a temporary issue.During Q1 earnings, management also adjusted 2020 guidance. It now expects annual revenue of $388-$395 million, a net loss/share of $0.14-$0.19, and a negative cash flow of $25 million. It should be noted that pre-COVID, it was projected that Rapid7 would be cash flow positive in 2020. However, management still projects Rapid7 to be cash flow positive by 2021. Management also has a strong history of successful annual guidance, hitting or beating annual revenue and EPS projections every year since 2015.Gartner has consistently ranked Rapid7 in its leader’s quadrant for SIEM, which will continue to help with marketing efforts and is reflective of the overall quality of the Insight platform. Based on Gartner Peer Insights reviews, customers have been very satisfied with Rapid7’s InsightIDR, its core offering, especially in terms of integration and deployment, where it is one of the most highly rated solutions in the ease of deployment category. While security will remain a priority and the need to protect information has never been greater, IT budgets have no doubt been cut with IDC predicting a 5.1% drop in overall IT spending. Long, drawn-out deployments can be extremely costly, and I believe that now more than ever, customers will look for ready-built solutions that are easy to integrate and deploy. It also helps that Rapid7 has put a great amount of effort in the past year to expand its integration potential, now supporting over 80+ data collaboration, workflow, and ingestion partners.Another major benefit to Rapid7 is its numerous complementary technologies on top of its core InsightIDR product. This has led to a significant amount of cross-selling and growth in ARR per customer at a CAGR of 24% since Q1 2017. Management has stated that ARR per customer has the potential to reach more than 5x the current levels. While I by no means expect it to reach anywhere near that potential, it is a good sign that management expects growth in ARR per customer to be a longer-term trend. Besides, this past quarter has proven the importance of continued cross-selling. Customer growth was flat, but growth in ARR per customer lead to still decent growth in overall ARR.The recent acquisition of DivvyCloud should also help to boost cross-selling this year, which will be important as I expect customer growth to remain relatively flat for the rest of 2020. The acquisition will no doubt allow Rapid7 to better serve the cloud security market, which has seen rapid growth in the past, growing at a CAGR of 23.5% since 2014 according to Allied Market Research. In addition, I feel confident that COVID-19 should boost the market as the pandemic should further drive companies’ transition to the cloud. Going back to the IDC report from earlier, it was predicted that infrastructure spending would increase by 3.8% in 2020. This growth is almost entirely expected to be driven by cloud spending. In comparison, every other subset of IT spending is expected to see negative growth.Source: Rapid7 Q1 Earnings Call PresentationRapid7 competes in a very fragmented market against much larger names such as Splunk (SPLK) and IBM (IBM). While the expansion into cloud security should help for Rapid7, no company has a significant moat, and switching costs can be relatively low. Overall, I view cybersecurity as a space with many smaller winners, and I don’t expect any company to ever have a dominant market share.While I don’t foresee churn to be a major issue due to cybersecurity being such a priority, Rapid7 will likely continue to see flat customer growth into 2020 as many potential customers will continue to delay the adoption of new cybersecurity platforms until there is more clarity surrounding their IT budgets. As a result, customer acquisition costs are bound to increase, slowing Rapid7’s historical margin growth. I anticipate customer growth to return to normal or faster rates as we exit the worst of the pandemic. However, I’m not going to speculate too much on that front.Rapid7 is also much more leveraged compared to its peers with a debt/equity ratio of 3.52x. While this may weigh on Rapid7’s future relative valuation, I’m not too concerned. Rapid7 doesn’t have any major debt maturities until 2023, and by then, many of the current headwinds affecting the company will be long gone.In valuing Rapid7, I decided to take a relative rather than an intrinsic valuation approach. For my comps, I used Tenable (TENB) and Qualys (QLYS), which are direct competitors of Rapid7, as well as ProofPoint (PFPT) and Ping Identity Holding Corp (PING). While all four are in Systems Software, Proofpoint and Ping Identity aren’t direct competitors to Rapid7. However, I felt it was a fair comparison due to them having similar growth, margins, and exposure to IT budget cuts. For my valuation metrics, I chose Price/Sales and EV/Sales due to them being most appropriate for technology growth companies. Below is a chart comparing the relevant metrics as well as the median for each excluding Rapid7:Source: Seeking AlphaBased on this analysis, Rapid7 is slightly below the median on both a Price/Sales and EV/Sales perspective. Systems Software is also undervalued as a sector in my opinion, and I expect it to appreciate as we start to get a clearer view of the pandemic.Overall, Rapid7’s well-regarded Insight platform, the cloud security prospects, and the potential for further cross-selling make me feel confident in Rapid7 as an investment opportunity. I expect valuation to return to February levels within the coming months, as investors are already regaining confidence. It’s not too late; Rapid7 is a buy."

Click here to find out more »In an increasingly digital world, cybersecurity is becoming more and more essential to large and small businesses alike. At the center of this transition is Rapid7 (RPD). With ~28% Revenue growth over the last three years, Rapid7 is a promising company in a broad and expanding cloud-based market. The cybersecurity company is focused on enhancing resolve and efficiency for customers who face constantly evolving cybersecurity challenges. With its diverse portfolio of products, Rapid7 is uniquely positioned to be a leader in the cybersecurity market for years to come.The company's main revenue driver is in the Vulnerability Risk Management (VM) space. According to the 2019 Forrester Wave Report, Rapid7's InsightVM saw a potential 342% ROI within three years. In addition to this astonishing number, customers also saw a decrease in cybersecurity spending and incident volume. This is evidently a compelling argument for Rapid7 as a leader in the Vulnerability Management space where it competes with Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) and Tenable (NASDAQ:TENB).Rapid7 also has products in:The company's SOAR solution is called InsightConnect. This product allows customers to customize workflows and tools with over 290 plugins. On the company's 4Q 2019 Earnings Call, CEO Corey Thomas mentioned plans to accelerate investment in this solution in 2020. While in the early stages of its development, he views it as an emerging product in North America.InsightIDR is the company's SIEM solution, which currently makes up more than 20% of revenue. InsightIDR's competitive advantage lies in its ease of use and seamless cloud capabilities. Thomas noted on the 1Q 2020 earnings call, it is one of the few solutions that natively collects endpoint data from the cloud no matter where people are staffed in the world. This solution saves customers the pain of setting up core infrastructure and seamlessly gathers key end to end data points. This end to end solution is specifically advantageous as companies move toward an increasingly remote work environment.To sum up the exciting opportunity of these two products, here is what Thomas had to say on the 4Q 2019 Earnings Call regarding new market penetration:""So you saw that dynamic, especially with IDR last year as for the first year that really became much more of a global business and we think there is lots of growth in IDR over the next couple of years and that's a catalyst. Likewise with SOAR...we do expect some momentum if we continue to see progress on a global basis.""Shown below is the company's breakdown of its Target Addressable Market (TAM) in the 1Q 2020 Earnings Call Presentation. Source: 1Q 2020 Earnings PresentationAs seen above, both SIEM and SOAR represent underpenetrated markets, and Rapid7 claims the solutions to be a leader in both. Less than 25% of the company's TAM has been tapped, leaving ample room for opportunity. To further reference this opportunity, see below for SIEM market research by Gartner, the world's leading research and advisory firm.Sources:(2018 Gartner Magic Quadrant for SIEM) (2020 Gartner Magic Quadrant for SIEM)These two studies from October 2018 and February 2020 rated companies based on their completeness of vision and ability to execute within the SIEM vertical. Rapid7 has risen quickly from a ""Visionary"" to a ""Leader"" via an increased ability to execute. This is most likely due to increased headcount and Sales/Marketing efforts for their InsightIDR product. The company has already seen some expansion in the enterprise market due to its acquisition of Netfort in April 2019. Top management mentioned in the 4Q 2019 Earnings Call they expect this momentum to accelerate in 2020 and 2021. This will be something to watch in the upcoming months in order to project market share over the next few years.Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) is Rapid7's leading revenue indicator and has shown healthy growth over the years, growing from ~90MM in 2015 to over ~330MM today. Top management has recognized ARR as a strength of the company and specified that the growth strategy lies in customer acquisition. Thomas made light of this on the 1Q 2020 Earnings Call, citing the company's strong ability to up-sell and cross-sell to existing customers. Shown below is ARR over the past 8 quarters, which has grown an impressive 76% in two years.Source: Gridlex SAAS Metrics Data & AnalyticsGiven this more than capable ARR, it will be important for the company to land with both International and Domestic enterprise customers.Qualys and Tenable both serve as strong competition in the Vulnerability Management space. When compared with it's VM competitors, Rapid7 is right in the middle. They are growing at a faster pace than both companies, but Qualys is the only one boasting strong positive free cash flow. The company boasts a 33% EBITDA margin while Rapid7 and Tenable lag with -10% and -22% respectively. It should be noted that Qualys has historically derived roughly 70% of its revenue from its VM product. Thus, its impact on Rapid7 will diminish as the latter company continues to build out market share of its SIEM and SOAR products. Below is a chart of stock prices for each company since the lows of mid-March. The market has preferred Qualys, and for good reason.Source: Gridlex SAAS Metrics Data & AnalyticsAs the recent stock prices indicate, investors are confident in Qualys' ability to fight through the COVID-19 pandemic due to its strong free cash flow and lack of debt on its books. Those two qualities are especially valuable in the current economic backdrop and explain why the company is valued at 12.5 EV/S. The negative earnings of Tenable and Rapid7 have deterred them from a bounce back like Qualys, although the tailwinds of cloud momentum have allowed both companies to trade around ~7.5 EV/S. Below is a table representing some key metrics for each business:Source: Gridlex SAAS Metrics Data & AnalyticsAs is evident in the table, Rapid7 is trailing in both the Enterprise and International markets. Only 52% of its revenue is from large enterprises. This highlights an area of potential growth for the company. In addition to an aim at landing with enterprises, management is also focused on expanding International revenue generation. It has represented 15, 15, and 16% of revenue in the past three years, demonstrating room for growth in that area. With that being said, International revenue grew 46% YoY in 1Q 2020 and the company is still developing data centers overseas. Many overseas companies are unable to use data that doesn't exist within their borders, so these data centers are crucial to International expansion.Although Rapid7 has shown genuine promise of significant future growth, there are still a few risks to watch out for. First, the company operates in a rapidly growing industry with many unknowns. M&A is particularly frequent among SaaS companies as they are always looking for synergies and other ways to increase efficiency. This represents a zero-sum game where Rapid7 could either gain or lose market share.Another obvious risk is the impact of COVID-19. On the 1Q 2020 Earnings Call, CFO Jeff Kalowski revised ARR growth in the range of 14%-20% for FY2020. This makes sense as customers are cutting costs across the board due to increasing economic uncertainty. With that being said, companies simply cannot afford to cut all cybersecurity costs and the ongoing shift toward remote work plays favorably into Rapid7's product portfolio. Once customers are able to shore up their balance sheets and consumer confidence returns, Rapid7 should bounce back to mid-30's ARR growth.Another potential risk is the entrance of new competitors into the verticals Rapid7 currently occupies. While the company is well-positioned in VM, the SIEM and SOAR sectors could become increasingly competitive and drive down price flexibility. These risks will have to be monitored over time, but Rapid7 finds itself in a strong position in the current SecOps environment.An often-used component of SaaS growth valuation is the rule of 40. The rule states that the addition of Revenue Growth and Profit Margin should be in excess of 40%. While the profit margin can be calculated in many ways, EBITDA is steady across all companies and thus used in this case. Rapid7 grew its revenue by 33% in 2019, while the EBITDA margin was a lowly -10%. The company fails the rule of 40 at 23%.Despite failing on the rule of 40, Rapid7 is undoubtedly poised for strong growth in the coming years, and well on its way to positive cash flow in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated reliance on the cloud and Rapid7 is well-positioned to benefit from this transition in the coming years. Using a DCF model to evaluate Rapid7's future cash flows, the company seems to be undervalued. The model assumed a 35% CAGR for ARR. This assumption was made due to the company's previous history (34% or more ARR growth in the previous 4 years) and promising momentum in the enterprise market. As for customer acquisition, the CAGR was 10% which represents the low end of the company's historical numbers (10%-20%). The long term growth rate was assumed to be 5%, in line with historical GDP growth. The model also assumed a 9% WACC, in line with SaaS averages.Discounting the sum of all future cash flows back to net present value, the model returns a total market capitalization of ~3.18B. Using the current shares outstanding of 55.5M, the share price comes out to $57.37. This represents an upside of 15% from the current price. As previously mentioned, the company is currently traded at ~7.5 EV/S which is right around par for the industry as a whole. Assuming the aforementioned market cap of $3.18B, the company's fair value would be ~9.5 EV/S. This is a comfortable margin of safety for investors at the current price and the stock remains bullish amidst the shift to the cloud.Though this valuation gives a considerable margin of safety, investors may still want to hold out for a better price. With a potential second wave of COVID-19 lurking, the market is volatile and may be due for a correction. Assuming a ~10% market plunge, Rapid7 could drop to the mid 40's, where it would be a tremendous bargain. Long term investors would be wise to wait out the economic uncertainty over the next few weeks and aim to buy at a price somewhere below $50."
4351093,35181,2020-05-31T03:50:33-04:00,"Strong revenue growth of 32% and $300 million in cash.The stock price is undervalued based on its forward sales multiple.Rapid7's stock price has lagged behind other digital transformation stocks this year but should move in sympathy with stronger performers.Negative free cash flow is a deterrent, but I'm bullish on the industry.","Rapid7, Inc. (RPD) is another company in the thick of the digital revolution, providing cybersecurity solutions in the area of Vulnerability Management (VM), Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Cloud and Application Security, and Security Orchestration and Automation Response (SOAR).(Source: Rapid7)Rapid7 competes with the following companies:In the Q1 2020 earnings call, the company management indicated that they had seen ""modest impacts from COVID-19-related purchase delays late in the quarter."" Guidance for 2020 is for 19% to 21% revenue growth, a fairly conservative figure that considers the impact of the pandemic.Unlike other digital transformation stocks, Rapid7 has not bounced back from the February-March bear market. The stock is still down 13% year-to-date. Compare this to the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY) which is up 13% for the year. (Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)I believe that the company's negative free cash flow is a black eye and one reason why the stock is held back. In addition, certain other cloud security companies such as Splunk and Tenable appear to be somewhat undervalued relative to the software industry. I believe that there is a perception that the cybersecurity segment is crowded and will result in diminishing growth prospects as time goes on.But based on recent market activity, I believe that cloud stocks are starting to show strength, and although Rapid7 is a market laggard, it will rise in sympathy with the rest of its peers. I am bullish as the rising tide will lift Rapid7. Although the company's free cash flow is negative, the balance sheet has been shored up with the recent issue of $200M of convertible senior unsecured notes. According to management, Rapid7 now exceeds $300 million in cash on the books which should be enough to survive the pandemic and then some.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The rule provides a single metric for evaluating both high-growth companies that aren't profitable and mature companies that have lower growth but are profitable. Revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) must add up to at least 40% in order to fulfill the rule. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can tolerate some level of negative free cash flow. But if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth. This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.The two factors required for calculating the Rule of 40 are revenue growth and free cash flow margin. Rapid7's annual revenue growth for the last year is 32%. However, the company's free cash flow margin is negative, approximately -5% for the latest quarter.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)Therefore, the Rule of 40 calculation for Rapid7 is as follows:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 32% - 5% = 27%Rapid7's score does not come close to fulfilling the Rule of 40, suggesting that Rapid7 has a lot of work to achieve a healthy balance between growth and profitability.Despite the failure to meet the Rule of 40, Rapid7 does have some positive factors going for it. For one, its SG&A expense margin is a decent 85%, much better than many high growth companies that often have SG&A expenses in excess of revenue.NOTE: SG&A expenses include R&D as well as SBC.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)I have already mentioned the company's strong cash position of $300 million, enough to carry the company through some hard times.In addition to all of the above, I should mention that Rapid7 has beaten analysts' estimates for both revenue and EPS the last 5 quarters. I find that consistent performance ""beats"" suggest that company management is conservative and that there is a higher likelihood of positive surprises in the future.(Source: Portfolio123)There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how Rapid7 stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward sales multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, Rapid7 is positioned well below the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is very undervalued on a relative basis relative to its peers. Note: The same can be said for Splunk and Tenable.There are several risks that investors should consider before investing in Rapid7. First of all, I view the current stock market action to be somewhat reminiscent of the Dot.com era, immediately prior to the crash starting in 2000. Back then, I quadrupled my investments in a few months. Technology stocks were hopping. But it didn't take long before the market turned into a disaster.While Rapid7 is undervalued in my opinion, there are many stocks that are way overvalued, stocks such as Zoom (ZM), Shopify (SHOP), Atlassian (TEAM), and Coupa (COUP). A new software bear market would likely cause Rapid7 to get swept away along with its extremely overvalued software peers.While I believe that the long-term picture is rosy for Rapid7, investors should consider the effect of the negative free cash flow over the long haul, especially if there is a long and deep recession.Rapid7 is a cybersecurity company that has lagged the general software industry this year. It is underappreciated along with other cybersecurity companies such as Splunk and Tenable. I expect that Rapid7's stock price will rise along with the bullish market for cloud stocks.Rapid7 has strong revenue growth of 32% per annum and a strong cash position of $300 million that should tide the company through the global recession. The company does have a negative free cash flow margin that causes it to fail on the Rule of 40. This is a risk item that investors should be wary of.All-in-all, I am not super-excited about Rapid7 as an investment, but I believe that the stock is undervalued and will rise with the tide this summer. Therefore, I am giving Rapid7 a bullish rating."

In our most recent coverage about Rapid7 last December, we highlighted the company's strong growth in its VRM (Vulnerability Risk Management) business and its open-source Metasploit project, which will continue to be a long-term hidden asset as Rapid7 navigates the rapidly-changing cloud security industry. In Q1 2020, Rapid7 continued maintaining its solid growth despite the near-term slowdown due to the COVID-19 situation, and it will guide towards profitability and being cash-flows positive beyond Q4 and 2020. In our view, Rapid7 will remain as a top-of-mind choice in the cloud cybersecurity market longer term, due to its strength across all core categories and the continuing global awareness of its offerings driven by the Metasploit project.We identify two key catalysts that we believe will drive long-term growth for the business:Rapid7's comprehensive and market-leading cloud cybersecurity offerings remain a unique selling point. While it has been well-known for its insightVM VRM offering, which has received various leadership awards from leading IT solution research firms such as Gartner and Forrester, Rapid7 has also expanded into SIEM & IDR, AppSec, and Automation spaces in recent times. Except for its emerging Automation offering InsightConnect, all Rapid7's offerings, such as InsightIDR, insightAppSec, and recently-acquired DivvyCloud, have gained meaningful tractions and become co-category leaders with those of Splunk (SPLK), Qualys (QLYS), Tenable (TENB), or Micro Focus (OTCMKTS: MCFUF).(Source: company's Q1 earnings call slide)Rapid7 is also one of the only few vendors with a strong, comprehensive, and unified go-to-market approach and offerings. In our view, this will increase the mission-criticality of the combined offering and further boost the growth in mid-size and enterprise install base expansion rate and ARR per customer. At present, mid-size and enterprise clients already make up 50% of ARR.(Source: Q1 2020 earnings call slide)Despite the COVID-19 situation in Q1, the company still saw a solid 31% ARR growth YoY, driven by the 15% growth in ARR per customer. In Q1, the company has also guided a long-term ~5x increase in ARR to $200,000, which still did not account for DivvyCloud expansion, hence conservative. As a result, though the company will expect the full-year ARR and revenue growth to decay to 17% and 20% consecutively, we think that the long-term prospect remains very attractive.Rapid7's open-source Metasploit project is a hidden asset that will continue to drive long-term awareness and relevance in the rapidly-changing cloud cybersecurity industry. While Rapid7 will continue to onboard and expand new mid-size and enterprise clients through its high-touch, unified go-to-market approach which often involves security and IT consultations provided by its channel partner, inside sales, and field sales teams, its open-source Metasploit project continues to serve as a complementary bottom-up approach to the primary go-to-market that will drive overall awareness of Rapid7's business.(Rapid7 and Metasploit vs Qualys vs Tenable. Source: google trends)Rapid7 has owned the well-known open-source Metasploit for over ten years, through which it has helped increase community-driven awareness about Rapid7. Based on the Google search trends, Rapid7 and Metasploit combined have had more popularity than Qualys and Tenable, which both provide equally competitive penetration testing offerings.(Source: github.com)The fact that Metasploit is an open-source project will also help Rapid7 stay competitive and relevant in the cybersecurity market. The active open-source community continually updates and improves the code base regularly, as it has been forked over 10,000 times and actively discussed by over 20,000 developers. With this continuing awareness, we expect the company to eventually reduce the overall marketing expense as a percentage of revenue from +45% today to approximately 35% to 40% in the long run. Over the last two years, the figure has also declined from 50% to 47% in Q1 2020, while gross margin has also been steady at +70%, despite the continuing push for market leadership across all categories.The outlook for 2020 will not be as initially expected, given the guidance for slower revenue growth of +20%. Despite the COVID-19 in Q1, the delayed deals across the IDR category, which outperformed until Q4 last year, seem to reflect the lower mission criticality of the offering. This remains temporary, however. As the company continues its investments into unifying its go-to-market approach around its comprehensive, end-to-end offerings, we expect growth to reaccelerate to +30%.Rapid7 possesses all the characteristics for success in the rapidly-changing, yet highly attractive cloud cybersecurity market, including continuing investments in R&D, end-to-end offering, and community-driven insights and growth. Driven by these factors, Rapid7 can deliver both an attractive growth and profitability profile. In Q1, the management also reiterated the intention to achieve a cash-flow positive in 2021 and profitability this Q4. Since our first coverage last December, the stock has been down ~10%, though it previously had a +16% run to ~$63 per share in January. The COVID-19 situation has put pressure on the stock as it is now trading at ~$49 per share, creating a good entry point.(Source: stockrow)Rapid7 is currently trading at ~7x P/S. Together with Tenable, which has a similar ~8x P/S and growth rate, Rapid7 is still not a cash-flow-positive company. Both companies also do not pass the rule-of-40. Qualys, which trades at ~13x P/S, has satisfied both rule-of-40 and cash flow profitability, though its growth rate is only half as much as those of Tenable and Rapid7. Considering the management's guidance to push for profitability through more disciplined expense management in Q4 and the long-term upsides, Rapid7 is undervalued at ~7x P/S in our view. The company can potentially trade at 9x - 10x as a company with a positive operating or cash-flow margin. Conservatively, given the maintained 7x P/S, ~50 million outstanding shares, and the expected $319 million of revenue, we set a price target of ~$56 per share."

The company fails on the Rule of 40.High debt load is a concern that will curtail any M&A activity in the very competitive cyber security market.,"Rapid7 (RPD) is one of several cybersecurity companies, including Zscaler (ZS), CyberArk (CYBR) and Qualsys (ALYS), that have taken a beating on the markets recently. Rapid7 is down more than 20% in the last couple of weeks alone.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)While software stocks, in general, have been hit hard, cybersecurity stocks have suffered the most, primarily due to weak forward guidance. Some of this can be blamed not only on conservativeness by company management and investor mood, but the poor guidance also is a reflection on the intense competition in a crowded cybersecurity market. For example, Rapid7 had revenue growth of 34% in 2019 but is guiding for revenue growth of 21% to 24% for 2020.While I believe that Rapid7 is quite undervalued based on its forward sales multiple, there are two issues that I find unattractive with this company. The first is the negative free cash flow margin.(Source: Portfolio123)The second issue is the extremely high debt load that the company is carrying. The company is sporting a total debt to total equity ratio of 3.2:1. And all of the debt was incurred in less than one and a half years.(Source: Portfolio123)The high level of debt will certainly hamper Rapid7's ability to acquire or be acquired in this industry which has a high rate of M&A activity.The free cash flow plus high debt level along with the general market turmoil lead me to give Rapid7 a neutral rating.The following scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales vs. estimated forward year-over-year sales growth illustrates Rapid7's stock valuation relative to the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red on the scatter plot and represents a typical valuation based on next year's sales growth. As can be seen from the chart, Rapid7 is undervalued relative to its peers based on its forward sales multiple.One industry metric that's often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It's an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to one of my previous articles.In Rapid7's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 35% - 10% = 25%The calculation comes out below 40%, indicating that Rapid7 has work to do in balancing its growth and profit.The cybersecurity market is very competitive. The following list summarizes Rapid7's competition according to the last quarterly report:Rapid7 has been taking a beating lately, along with other cybersecurity stocks. Rapid7 stock is down 20% in the last couple of weeks. One of the reasons for the decline is weak guidance. While Rapid7 grew revenue by 35% in 2019, the company is guiding for 21% to 24% in 2020. While I believe that the stock price is undervalued based on the forward sales multiple, there are other issues that I find unattractive in an investment. The first is the negative free cash flow margin of -10%. This causes the company to fail on the Rule of 40. The second issue is the large debt load that the company is carrying. The large debt will curtail any future M&A activity without diluting shareholders.Given the above two issues, and the generally sour mood of the market, I'm giving Rapid7 a neutral rating."

This is also consistent with management's forward guidance. While the stock has given back some of the gains in previous quarters, I find the current price point compelling as it offers a balanced risk/reward opportunity for growth-driven investors. Value investors will continue to frown at the lack of profitability, though the strong gross margin and ARR trend continue to point to a compelling path to profitability. I will be reiterating a hold rating due to the growing competition in the cloud security space, which will continue to impact pricing flexibility and greenfield win rate.Heading into the last earnings call, Rapid7's valuation was mostly sensitive to three factors:Source: Author (using data from Conference Call)ARR growth was strong (+35% y/y), powering revenue growth of 34%. This was a function of a strong blend of demand and execution. Management is now guiding for ARR growth of 21-24% in 2020, which is above the target provided during the last investor day. ARR per customer is hovering around $37k, and management sees strong potential for this to expand to $200k. This represents a significant upside. In the absence of near-term macro and competitive headwinds, I expect the ARR trend to continue.My biggest concern revolved around the uptake of new products, including Insight IDR, SOAR, and AppSec. As highlighted in the sentiment analysis above, management was positive about the demand and cross-sell potential of new products. Though going forward, growth remains heavily dependent on the VM (vulnerability management) business. My biggest concern stems from competitive pressure from network security players who are creating VM-like cloud security solutions. More cloud security players mean less room for pricing flexibility.I was impressed by Rapid7's rank in Gartner's latest SIEM quadrant. Rapid7 remains the highest-ranked pure-play cybersecurity company ahead of the likes of Fortinet (FTNT), McAfee, and FireEye (FEYE). Gartner's near-term worries mostly revolve around its limited technology alliance ecosystem and limited integration with third-party analytics tools. Besides those, the SIEM solution fits in perfectly into Rapid7's lineup of security products.Source: Author (using data from Conference Call)While analysts didn't ask questions about its competitive positioning, the strong demand for its products is a sign of little competitive headwind. Its products continue to rank highly on third-party testing and review sites, as highlighted in the product section. Network security players like FireEye are taking cloud security seriously. FireEye's Verodin solution is more like a vulnerability assessment solution. The same goes for other cloud security players like Check Point (CHKP).Rapid7's balance sheet isn't the most attractive with cash of $247m and debt of $262m. Though its current ratio of 1.38 and long-term debt of $182m means it can continue to meet its short term financial obligations.Going forward, Rapid7's path to profitability remains compelling long term. Demand for cybersecurity solutions remains strong, and the potential to improve margins by growing ARR per customer is compelling as it sells more add-ons.Data by YChartsAs with most SaaS stocks, if the market share acquisition runway is large, a sales multiple within its peer average is fair. Investors need to inspect factors like its competitive moat and the ability to generate sustainable free cash flow. In the case of Rapid7, most of the necessary boxes have been checked.Source: AuthorRapid7 has most of the top features I scan for in a quality SaaS business. These include:The risk inherent in the business includes the lack of profitability, which weakens other investing factors like EPS guidance and value. Also, the adoption of new solutions is susceptible to the willingness of potential customers to share internal data with its cloud platform (affects mostly its SIEM solution). Otherwise, Rapid7 has what it takes to continue dominating the vulnerability assessment space.I will be reiterating a hold rating. I prefer a valuation of 7x P/S for a late-stage growth cyber play like Rapid7, which belongs to the 2016 cohort of my investing database. I find its strong growth guidance compelling in the near term, and the potential to grow ARR will continue to make Rapid7 an attractive investment in the near term.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4340984,98236,2020-04-29T12:42:28-04:00,"Rapid 7 is a leading cyber-security company with offerings historically addressing the SMB space.The company has a surprisingly modest valuation given its growth and opportunity set.It is ranked as a leader in the SIEM space but has more than a few other solutions appealing to both its historic SMB base and to much larger enterprises.The company's newest solution bundle, SOAR, is starting to achieve significant growth not baked into prior estimates.The company has preannounced a significant upside in terms of revenues and earnings despite the impact of the virus on the overall economy with ARR growth greater than 30% and reported revenue growth of 29%.","How fast can Rapid 7 run in the time of the virus-faster than the consensus might have thought before this afternoon. I have written both to subscribers of my Ticker Target investment blog and on SA that a portfolio that exclusively tries to focus on “virus related names” is not an optimal strategy. Many work at home investments have appreciated spectacularly leaving little upside in the short term. Zoom (ZM) is an exemplar of that trend but there are many other names both in the software space and elsewhere whose valuation is supported by the belief that their operational results will be bolstered by the impact of the Covid-19 virus on the economy.But there are names that work now, in this time of the virus, and will work equally well as the economy emerges from the crisis caused by the Covid-19 impact. One area of focus has been cyber-security. Cyber-security is not a ""nice to have""-it is a requirement in today’s world that grows every year as crooks focus on “going where the money is.” And the fact is, that with network complexity rising as more end-points are created, with major security requirement to secure end-points and the whole network, it seems likely that cyber-security demand growth will accelerate to above trend levels in 2020.The security space has received lots of scrutiny from investors as most analysts have come to expect that the work-from-home paradigm is going to need the support of more cyber-security infrastructure. Even a cyber-security laggard like Checkpoint (CHKP), which has reported it Q1 results on Monday, 27th April, has seen demand tailwinds as a function of the desire of enterprises to build a security infrastructure for their networks which are now much more widely dispersed due to the work-at-home paradigm.Before I start writing on the subject of this article, Rapid 7 (RPD), I need to suggest some over-arching themes; seemingly the impacts of the virus on the economy and on IT vendors in particular are the area of focus for most brokerage research in the IT space at this time. If one were to read brokerage articles about enterprise software, one would reach the conclusion that few if any names are worth buying. The other day, I read a less than logical article about enterprise software from JPMC downgrading essentially every erst-loved enterprise name in that team’s coverage universe. Others on that bandwagon have included analysts at GS and more recently analysts at Needham and Canaccord Genuity have climbed aboard what I might label the dirge express. Some prominent hedge fund managers have made similar calls. And the commentators on SA seem to have imbibed an overdose of negativityThere is an old adage about the market climbing a wall of worry. Every analyst and observer worthy of the name is worried that business was not good for enterprise IT vendors at the end of the March quarter. I do not think that either binoculars or a telescope were needed to make such an assertion. Indeed, with much of the economy shut down it would be quite surprising if most It customers were focused on buying IT solutions at the end of the quarter.And yet-While I am started writing this on Monday there has been some indication that demand for IT solutions has not totally gone away and did not do so, even at the end of March. Besides the beat at Checkpoint, announced on Monday morning, there have been beats at FFIV (FFIV) and at Impinj (PI). In the reports this afternoon, the beats were at a level usually not seen from companies reporting in the IT space.I really had no expectation that it would be possible for a vendor with the focus of Impinj to be able to report no less than a 25% revenue upside this past quarter with highly attractive unit economics-although to be fair, the outlook for Q2 is apparently not nearly as pretty as the results achieved in Q1.One basic concern on the part of analysts is the bounce that software stock have seen since they made lows in mid-late March. I get the fact that software stocks have rebounded strongly since the first glimpses of a remediation scenario started to appear towards the end of last month. Software stocks were quite oversold at that time, and they are perhaps a bit overbought right now. So, they might not respond as much to good quarters, or less bad quarters, as strongly as would otherwise be the case. But there are quite sound reasons for the appreciation other than a bounce from an oversold status.I do not think the reason why stocks are appreciating has much to do with expectations for the March/April quarters, or even for the two quarters beyond that. It strikes me as risible that anyone really thinks investors are unaware that the economy ended the March quarter in full retreat, or that 1st time claims have totaled over 26 million the last 4 weeks. I think investors are responding to the fact that the economy, bit by bit, and around the world, is starting to reopen. And investors are betting on a “V” shaped recovery not for any particular reason other than the massive level of stimulus being poured into the breach. Unlike some commentators on this site, and other prognosticators, there is nothing evil with using the government to replace demand in one of the more defining moments in the lifetimes of most of us. And debt is neither bad or good, but a thing as most of us who follow economics will have learned at some point in our professional training.The future of this administration depends on something that looks like a ""V"" shared recovery, and the Fed Chairman has put a stake in the ground that I think is far deeper than appreciated by some. The fact that this crisis was entered in the midst of the strongest economy seen in generations has seemingly not been factored into the discussion. Even the Japanese, historically not first to the party when it comes to bold economic policies, are on board this time around with both fiscal and monetary stimulus. Many of us are old enough to recollect that the stimulus passed with some controversy in 2009 was all of $900 billion. It is 3X that already and still counting. And as to QE, that upside is even larger.And as part of QE, it is appropriate and logical to expect that the discount rate used in developing some kind of DCF model is far lower now, than in the recent past. How could it not be under current circumstances. And a lower discount rate is not evil either-it is simply and expression of the lower returns of alternative (and presumably safer) investment. And a lower discount rate inevitably relates to a higher valuation. The combination of expectations for rapidly improving operating performance 6 months out, coupled with a lower discount rate is the equivalent of a large dose of catnip for many cats. (Apparently some cats are unimpressed with catnip, just as some commentators disdain QE) And to this, as I will discuss below, the ROI of some solutions in the enterprise software space, pandemic or not, has rarely if ever been higher. The folks writing their generic dirges about the enterprise software space being in free fall were nowhere to be found when these companies made highs in mid-February. Now, with the shares, in general, still a bit below where they were when they made their highs, the wall of worry that has been built is far higher than the wall being constructed on our southern border.Again, just based on the reaction of stocks to certain levels of performance the last couple of days, suggests that investors can still be impressed and will respond to operational performance that is better than feared. See Google (GOOG) for today's major example. (Although I have to confess, it seems likely that in a more benign environment, with fewer risks and uncertainties, Impinj shares, in particular, might have done better than a 13% share price increase for the quarter it just Monday evening.)I don’t expect the trajectory of either the market or of enterprise software names to be straight up. And there will be more than enough misses and weak guidance to go around as the balance of vendors report their results for the March quarter. And it will be the rare company indeed, that has either great visibility or some magic want with which to forecast strong results.But equally, I believe that focusing on how deep and painful the trough is and will be in operational performance is not providing investors with the perspective they need. That perspective is not based on conditions now, in the depths of economic pain, but perspective based on a recovery in a couple of quarters. And the balance of this report, focused on Rapid 7 and its security solutions looks through the economy and tries to forecast the progress of the company on the other side of the abyss.Rapid 7 shares are up a bit less than 50% over the last year, but they made a high as long ago as last July. The shares saw a trough of just under $36, or a 45% drop from the company’s peak value. At current prices, it has recovered 34% from its recent late March trough, but the shares are still down more than 20% since the start of the year. The shares fell after the last earnings release, a result of the very conservative guidance that was provided. The CEO discussed in the conference call Q&A that the company’s guidance was supposed to represent more reality than conservatism based on having better visibility. It is simply impossible to know how that might have played out in this environment where the basis of the forecast has been turned upside down. Fortunately, for this writer and for investors, it is not anything that needs to be determined in terms of making an investment recommendation-although if I had to guess, absent the economic devastation seen, the company would have continued its outperformance, and indeed it may still achieve better than expected results when it reports.The company on its call, reported strong momentum in the first few weeks of 2020 and at that time suggested that its end markets were healthy with plenty of upside potential. That is probably as true today, as it was two months ago, given the priorities of enterprises investing in software solutions. The real reason the software space has proven to be quite so resilient is the ROI of the solutions being offered. I am not going to reprise an argument here, I have made many times and in different forums. But users get more now for buying software than has been the case in the past. The attachment here is from a commissioned study-a paid endorsement, no doubt, but no less true for all of that. If users can get this kind of ROI from using Rapid's products, then why wouldn't they prioritize it, and acquire it, even in the face of the economic storm of the virus? https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rapid7-insightidr-delivers-445-roi-130510949.htmlThis will be an article about Rapid 7-really-despite the detour into the land of macro considerations. Rapid 7, for those unfamiliar with the name, is a specialized cyber-security vendor whose main product, which it calls Insight Cloud is focused on visibility, analytics and automation which allows users to reduce vulnerabilities, monitor, for malicious behavior and investigate and shut down attacks and automate routine tasks. While RPD is known as a SIEM vendor, its technology has taken it into realms of observability, one of the hottest software spaces around these days. It also has a major product initiative called SOAR which extends quite far from SIEM in terms of its functionality which includes task automation and orchestration.Many people look at RPD and its closest competitors Tenable (TENB) and Qualsys (QUAL) as the leading SIEM vendors for mid-market enterprises. RPD, overall has been achieving substantial growth at moderate scale, and in the wake of a very strong Q4, it reached non-GAAP profitability prior to expectations. The company is scheduled to report its results on May 7th. This article does not attempt to make a call on just what the company might report and how it might guide. I assume that if results were going to be dire, the company would have pre-announced some results already. If I had to guess, I would expect that the company will exceed the reduced level of expectations embodied in the consensus, but given the conservatism this company has used in its guidance, I simply have no way of handicapping what the company might choose to forecast, how much of the forecast might be credible, and indeed whether the company will even provide a forecast. (Readers, please note that as I finished this article, Rapid 7 preannounced an upside for the quarter-I did not choose to alter this section, but at the end of this article, I do comment on the specifics released as well as other late breaking news reported by this company.)Rapid 7 actually has a relatively modest EV/S valuation based on its likely growth over the next 3 years. As mentioned, the current consensus revenue growth forecast for the company is less than 20% this year, after adjusteing for forecasted impact of the economy on Rapid’s growth. At that level of growth, the EV/S ratio is around 5.7X. My own guess is that revenue growth will prove to be somewhat stronger than a sub-20% number and thus the real EV/S is somewhat less than 5.7X.I think the space in which the company operates and its competitive position can support a 3 year growth rate of 30%. Currently, the company has an ARR/user of around $38k. It has as an aspirational goal for ARR/Customer of $200k. At 30% growth, the 5.7X EV/S the company has is about 45% below average for its growth cohort. In fact, the EV/S ratio for the company is about average for a company with growth in the mid-high teens percent.One specific reason I am optimistic is the likely continued success of what is called SOAR. The Rapid 7 SOAR offering which I have linked here defines a solution that includes Security Orchestration, Automation and Response: Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR) Solutions The set of products that Rapid offers through this product set is showing significantly greater growth than the company’s overall growth forecast. This is an initiative that has apparently been well received by Rapid’s user base and is planned to be the focus of additional investment. In the latest conference call, management suggested that it would not include revenue expectations for SOAR initiatives until it had a clearer understanding of demand as the product gains some further experience in the market. Essentially, the market opportunities that the company has with SOAR and with its cloud offerings are not included in its guidance. Given the strong reception to SOAR, it seems a reasonable assessment, the prior to the impact of the virus, the company was contemplating another year of growth greater than 30%. At this point, and with the current valuation, it certainly doesn’t need to achieve that level of performance in order to recommend the shares…but the security space, at least at this point, seems to be one in which the economic and physical impacts brought on by a response to the virus are seemingly having less of impact than in other areas of the IT firmament.The company’s strong improvement in profitability last year has moved its free cash flow margin to average for its current growth cohort. But I have assumed only a modest improvement in free cash flow margins, which puts the valuation of the shares at around average in terms of that metric.Last year Rapid 7 grew 35% in ARR and 34% growth in revenues as reported. The company actually grew its product revenues by 47%, but as it migrates its acquired Netexpose base to a product consumption model, it has lost reported maintenance revenues due to the definitions that have reclassified revenues from Netexpose to product. The combined growth rate for product + service came to 37%.The company, at the time of its latest earnings release on 2/10 forecast ARR growth of 25% and reported growth of 24% for the current year-slightly greater for Q1. The company also forecast that it would be non-GAAP profitable for the full year. The company reported that it had 9000 users at the end of last year, up 16%, and that its average revenue per customer had also risen 16% to $37.5K. The rather modest ARR per user, particularly when compared to other vendors in the SIEM space, and the company’s rather broad product set suggest it has a very significant growth opportunity for cross-sells and up-sells.Since the advent of the virus, and the impact it has had on the economy, estimates for RPD 7 have been reduced noticeably. At this point, consensus revenue are forecast to grow at 19% this year and by 20% in 2021. Q1 estimates are now at the bottom of the range with regards to revenue. While I would not suggest that readers attempt to play this name based on an expectation that growth might exceed the current consensus, I do think the current share price as I write this, of about $46/share or possibly less is a good entry point, and the near term set-up has more opportunities than risks.Rapid is classified by Gartner as a leader in the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) space. I have linked to the report here for the convenience of readers: https://www.rapid7.com/c/2020-siem-mq-leader/1/ I have written for some time now about the various SIEM vendors, most notably Elastic (NYSE:ESTC) recently, and about Splunk (SPLK) which has been the leader in the space for some years. SIEM itself is a substantial market and the latest survey’s suggest that it will reach nearly $7 billion over the next couple of years. At this point, Splunk dominates the space with an estimated market share of greater than 50%. The CAGR of the space as a whole is estimated by most analysts to be in the low double digit range.Rapid 7 doesn’t really compete with directly with all of the SaaS SIEM vendors out there; historically it has been focused on the SMB space although with users such as Adobe (ADBE), Aetna, Comerica, Hilton Ingram Micro and J&J (JNJ) it certainly has some marquee enterprise users. Much of the time it is considered a direct competitor of Tenable (TENB) and Qualsys (QLYS). As the attached review makes clear, the Gartner surveys show approximately equal capabilities for the products offered by Tenable and Rapid.Compare Rapid7 vs. Tenable in Vulnerability Assessment | Gartner Peer Insights. The comparison between Qualsys and Rapid from this third party source provides a higher score to Rapid: Rapid7 vs Qualsys. Rapid is growing at a significantly greater rate when compared to Qualsys and has done so for years. Qualsys makes money and generates cash and in the last couple of months that has proven to be an attribute investors are more focused on then in the past. This has lead to a 52% spike in Qualsys shares since mid-March and has driven its EV/S ratio to greater than 10X. One of the components of an investment thesis for Rapid is the significant valuation gap between Qualsys with its lower growth but higher profitability, and Rapid. In the “risk-on” environment that I expect to prevail, a higher growth name like Rapid is more likely to be a superior investment.Probably of equal significance is the evaluation of Rapid 7 vs. Splunk. The attachment here is from another 3rd party source. It seems to give the advantage to RPD based on support . RPD is probably more intuitive, easier to install and offers a clean and customizable web interface according to the reviewer ( a SI partner of Rapid 7 ): Rapid7 Insight IDR vs Splunk: What is the best SIEM solution for your company?Rapid 7’s TAM includes areas quite a bit beyond its SIEM core. Perhaps the single most used feature of the company’s platform is vulnerability management. Vulnerability Risk Management has a number of features and is able to look at both end-points and virtual infrastructure. The company offers software called Metasploit. This is a tool that tests for potential penetration of user software. It allows for the simulation of real-world attacks on your network to enable security teams to spot and stop a significant percentage of breaches. Overall, while SIEM is the best known area in which this company operates, it is probably the most penetrated and has the lowest level of percentage growth. The company has taken some of its offerings and made them conform to a set of compliance solutions. It has verticalized some of its products. It has developed tools based on user behavior analytics to detect anomalies. The company also offers solutions that detect incidents and respond automatically before breaches threaten network integrity.The company offers a toolkit called InsightDR which combines several aspects of the security paradigm. Users can use the insight solution to detect and respond to incidents, monitor authentication, and maintain endpoint visibility. It is based on SIEM technology, but also includes endpoint forensics and an easy to understand dashboard offered as part of a SaaS consumption model. I mentioned earlier that RPD’s focus for much of its life, and really still today has been based on focus on the SMB space. InsightDR however, coupled with the functionality added by a recent acquisition called NetFort, is part of a strategy to move upmarket, obviously a key component of increasing the ARR substantially and driving 30%+ growth.IDR has now gone from about 10% of total bookings a few quarters ago, to more than 30% of current new bookings with some expectation that it will reach 40% of new bookings shortly. It is showing growth of about 75% in ARR, and it is obviously one reason to be quite optimistic about the company’s ability to achieve consistent growth rates higher than those it had forecast. Even though the solution is more expensive and perhaps more complex than other Rapid products, it has proven to be an offering capable of landing new users at a pace better than other Rapid products of the recent past.The company’s growth strategy is basically predicated on its ability to grow its ARR per user from the current level of $37.5K to an aspirational goal of $200K/user. Obviously, there is a substantial disconnect between the company’s growth rate projection given as part of its guidance, the current consensus growth projected by the First Call consensus for 2020/21 and its aspirational goal. The ability to achieve the kind of growth per user embodied in Rapid’s aspirational goal is going to be more a function of cross selling, than simply selling more seats. The company has been quite successful over the past 3 years in growing its ARR-indeed, in the past 2 years alone ARR per user is up by more than 60%. I do not think it is necessary to expect much beyond current trends to believe that this company will actually be able to grow at a 30% CAGR on average over the next 3 years, regardless of the specifics of the company’s growth forecast from before the advent of the virus impact or the current constrained forecast which suggests a material impact on the company from the upside down economics we are currently confronting.Finally, thus far in its history, Rapid has been a company with most of its revenues coming from North America. As of Q4, North America represented 84% of total revenues, and that is actually down marginally 85% in the year earlier quarter. Regardless of the product type, the runway Rapid has for sales outside of North America is even larger than its opportunities in the US and Canada. The company had been opening data centers around the world to comply with data security regulations; just how that might play out for the balance of 2020 is something that will no doubt be discussed when the company reports earnings next week.As mentioned, Rapid achieved non-GAAP profitability in Q4. Profitability was a function of the company’s significant revenue over-attainment. The company did enjoy a modest gross margin improvement. Overall GAAP gross margins reached 72.4% up from 71.9% in the year earlier quarter. The 50 bps improvement was a function of a higher proportion of product revenues and a lower proportion of professional services revenues.Unit economics showed some operating leverage on a GAAP basis and more non-GAAP which is the focus of most investors; overall in the quarter GAAP operating expense rose by 31% compared to the 33% growth in total revenues. General and administrative expense rose by 25%. Sales and marketing expense rose by 37% in the quarter, consistent with the growth of product and service revenues.Stock based comp rose by 70% year over year, and that allowed overall operating margins to exceed breakeven, both for the quarter and for the year as a whole. The company generated a small level of EPS for both the quarter and for the full year.The company’s operating cash flow was modestly positive last year. While the increase in deferred revenue grew about 20% in Q4, it did not grow for the year as a whole. Overall, the company’s cash flow was constrained by changes in other assets and liabilities. As the company moves to a sales focus that is more likely to attract larger enterprises, it seems to this writer that the proportion of deferred revenue in a typical booking will rise substantially, and this should allow operating cash flow growth to exceed current management expectations.So far, it is not apparent that the company is slowing down hiring materially, although obviously travel has stopped and I am sure there have been some constraints on particular expenditures due to the impact of lockdowns which are particularly strict in the Greater Boston area where the company has its HQ. I have linked here to job openings at RPD 7 which at some level suggest business as usual: JobsSome of these jobs have been posted as recently as two days ago suggesting there is no current hiring freeze, the usual early warning sign of troubles for enterprise software vendors.Should readers buy Rapid 7 shares. Most people here want to know whether or not to buy them into earnings, and that is the kind of prognostication I simply can’t offer. Much depends on the risk-on mentality of the market; and obviously much depends on the specifics of the Rapid quarter. I have no expectation that it will have the kind of result printed by Impinj or by F5. I also do not believe it will fall as far below Q1 guidance as is embodied in the current consensus.My recommendation is based on the current EV/S ratio being at a level far below average for the company’s growth cohort. And I believe that the way the company put guidance together, excluding its new SOAR offering from estimates, provides a significant cushion in terms of operating results that may not be appreciated by readers-it certainly wasn’t understood by this writer until studying the conference call transcript.ConclusionAs I finish writing this, RPD 7 has announced a private offering of $200 million of aggregate principle amount of senior convertible notes. I assume the terms will be such as to constitute essentially free money for this company and illustrate just how different the economy is today when compared to the situation at the time of the great financial crisis. As was inevitable, RPD had to disclose preliminary financial information so that it could complete the offering. The results were a significant upside. Revenues were about 3.3% above expectations, and EPS showed strong leverage, beating the prior loss projection by about $2 million or 33%. The company also announced an acquisition of a company called DivvyCloud for $145 million, which will consume most of the proceeds from the convertible offering. Divvy appears to be a hot company whose revenues increased by more than 110% last year, probably to a range of around $20 million, based on the limited information available. The mission statement quoted here suggests that Divvy is an excellent strategic fit for Rapid:I am not going to change the balance of the report - at this point few other metrics that were released: the company did not close lots of new account deals last quarter, it saw a 31% increase in ARR, and its renewal rate might be said to be at the lower end of the acceptable range. As mentioned, this company has a large cohort of SMB clients and some of them were probably done in by the economic crisis.The shares are trading down after market despite the beat - or so it seemed as I wrote this, perhaps because of the metrics mentioned above, and perhaps because of the feared dilution from the Divvy merger. I think the case for the shares has gotten better and not worse, that the Divvy merger will augment growth and I would take advantage of this pullback to initiate a Rapid 7 position."
4311502,102101,2019-12-09T16:10:58-05:00,Management continues to see a lot of reasons to pursue growth.Margins haven't improved due to the recent investments to beef up and diversify its product lineup.The growth narrative will continue to overshadow the lack of profitability in the near term.I rate Rapid7 a Hold with a price target of $57 based on its leadership in the vulnerability assessment space assisted by new offerings which will drive average customer value.,"Source: BuiltInBostonRapid7 (RPD) continues to invest in driving market share within and outside the vulnerability assessment space. While the new products need some time to drive average customer value as Rapid7 cross-sells its offerings, the current valuation at a P/S (FWD) of 8.25x and market cap of $2.7 billion is conservative compared to the valuation commanded by most unprofitable SaaS plays. As a result, I will be maintaining a Hold rating with a price target of $57.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Rapid7 continues to demonstrate strong growth in the vulnerability assessment space. Last quarter, total revenue grew 33%, customer count grew 17% while ARR grew by 43%. In my previous thesis, I highlighted how the need for security assessment and compliance amongst enterprises would continue to drive demand for Rapid7's solutions. The steady growth momentum and the recent guidance raise strengthen this thesis. In the near term, the growth narrative will prevail as more enterprises recruit penetration testers and security researchers to perform network audits while making organizations 100% compliant with the latest privacy and security standards. As a result, I remain bullish on the near-term demand for Rapid7's solutions.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Rapid7 delivered strong results last quarter. This was driven by strong demand for its SIEM (Insight IDR) and vulnerability management solution. Other products remain a small part of the revenue with a compelling value proposition. This includes InsightOps for data logging, InsightAppSec for application security, and InsightConnect for security automation. Going forward, management is taking a growth first approach, with a focus on profitability only if sustainable growth can't be realized. Going forward, growth is expected to be driven by its vulnerability and SIEM solutions with strong assists from other products. Renewal rate is expected to come down slightly as the professional services segment draws down. Remember, the professional services segment is billed on a perpetual licensing basis, and customers are being migrated to the new cloud subscription billing model.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Operating margin improved slightly, though not as pronounced as expected. Management's keen pursuit of growth and the ongoing transition to a subscription-based billing model weigh heavily on margins. This also comes amid the push to cross-sell less noticeable offerings like InsightAppSec, InsightConnect, and InsightVM. It will be interesting to watch how these products ramp up. I'm most bullish on InsightConnect as an add-on given that it jives with the push by enterprise for automation and security orchestration solutions.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Operating cash flow is still primarily a function of stock-based compensation. Given the negative contribution from net income, improvement in working capital can help drive more cash flow as billings from the cloud offerings ramps up.Investing cash flow has been driven by a significant ramp in Capex ($9.3m) compared to the previous year ($2.8m). There have also been two cash acquisitions within the last four quarters to strengthen and diversify its product offerings. The $228m debt issuance in Q3'18 has been the last major financing cash inflow. Rapid7's debt to equity ratio at over 300% isn't the most attractive.Overall, I'm neutral on Rapid7's business and financing position until profitability ratios improve or management demonstrates it can drive ACV by cross-selling its smaller offerings.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)I will be maintaining a bullish valuation, which assumes a double-digit growth in revenue given Rapid7's leadership in the vulnerability assessment space. This also assumes a rapid improvement in operating margin as the high-margin subscription model takes front and center stage. This drives my FCF margin projection to ramp to 30% of revenue, up from 8% of revenue in 2019. This is a bullish assumption. I prefer to discount my cash flow at a weighted average cost of capital of 12% to normalize for the huge volatility in the cloud space. Using a growth till perpetuity of 2%, a Gordon growth model gives a terminal value of $2.1 billion with 2024 as my exit year. The present value of the FCF stands at $582m. Adding cash of $247 million and a debt of $262 million, we get a market cap of $2.6 billion. Using shares outstanding of 47m, this gives a share price of $56.8. This translates to a forward P/S of 7x.Source: Gartner (SIEM Magic Quadrant)Management gave positive feedback about the macro environment:The cloud space remains a volatile space that has attracted a lot of speculators. That remains the most significant risk factor in the near term as any downward guidance from a big cloud name often affects other equally unprofitable cloud plays.From a competitive standpoint, Rapid7 is strong, given its broad lineup of cloud-based security solutions. In the SIEM space, the presence of Microsoft (MSFT) is worth watching. This was raised by Rob Owens of Keybanc Capital Markets in the last conference call. Microsoft Azure Sentinel SIEM service became commercially available in September and could pose a serious threat to Rapid7's market share expansion plans.Overall, I'm neutral on Rapid7's competitive and macro positioning given the level of congestion in the SIEM space and the volatility in the cloud space.I remain positive on Rapid7's growth strategy and improved product strength. Overall, Rapid7's go-to-market strategy isn't as compelling as expected. With the current valuation in line with its peer average, I will be maintaining a Hold rating with a price target of $57."
4318392,103130,2020-01-22T14:53:19-05:00,"Rapid7's share price has outperformed the market and its benchmark in the past year.Annual recurring revenue growth has accelerated, proving that management has been effectively transitioning to a subscription model.Customer growth has accelerated, showing that new customers are signing up.Rapid7's valuation finally fairly reflects its potential, relative to peers.","In my previous article on Rapid7 (RPD), I became bullish on this company after share prices fell 20% and higher gains to annual recurring revenue proved it was on the right track toward converting to a SaaS business model. A year later, I want to revisit my rationale for going long on RPD, and see if the same factors that prompted me to recommend a long position still exist today.Before getting into the financials, let's see how Rapid7 shares have performed in the 12 months since I last wrote about the company.Data by YChartsMy last article was published on January 7, 2019. This means RPD's share price has risen approximately 85% in one year.Data by YChartsTo provide better context for the company's performance, I chose the Technology Select Sector ETF (XLK) as a benchmark since RPD is best categorized as a technology firm. In my previous article, both RPD and XLK fell 20% in the last four months of 2018. This time, RPD outperformed XLK by 28%, and consistently outperformed the technology benchmark for the majority of 2019.Now, onto the analysis of Rapid7's financials-starting with revenue. (Source: RPD SEC filings, table created by author)The table above displays third quarter revenue for each of the last five years. If you look at revenue growth between 2016 and 2015, it was very strong at 42% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. However, 2018 and 2017 witnessed revenue growth dip into the mid-20% range, which is not bad by itself, but raises concerns as to why performance suddenly dropped off, unless 2016 was an abnormally good year in terms of sales. Anyways, the revenue situation has improved in Q3 2019; revenue grew 33% quarter-over-quarter in the latest report.What I appreciate about the numbers in the table above is that management was spot on about predicting the slowdown in total revenue as the company transitioned into a subscription model. The company's leadership has mentioned this in previous years, and also mentioned it in the 2018 10-KUnlike many SaaS companies I have come across, I greatly appreciate that management has not only been upfront about the negative short-term effects of this transition to a subscription model, but has also delivered on revenue growth as the company weans itself off license sales.Onto the next topic, below is chart of annual recurring revenue (NYSE:ARR). Considering that my bullish sentiment on RPD hinges on its ability to fully convert to subscription revenues, tracking ARR growth is vital. (Source: RPD SEC filings, table created by author)As we can see, ARR growth is 11% higher compared to growth in 2018. Rapid7's ability to maintain 30%+ ARR growth each year was impressive enough, but now growth has accelerated despite hitting over $200 million in ARR in 2018. This is a strong indicator that Rapid7 has done well to lower its dependence on (unsteady) license revenue, and convince new/existing customers to sign up for its subscription offerings.Speaking of customers, let's see how RPD's customer count has changed in the last year, to figure out if new customers are driving revenue growth, or if existing customers are playing a larger role. (Source: RPD SEC filings, table created by author)Disregarding the anomalous increase in 2016, Rapid7 shows accelerating customer growth, with 2019 having 17% more customers compared to the prior year. Another quote from the 2018 10-K provides a possible explanation for why new customers may be drawn to subscription services over license products.The key point is that subscriptions save companies money upfront, because they are not paying for everything at once. This helps make other companies' balance sheets look smoother between periods, which is why we are seeing new customers line up for Rapid7's subscription offerings. I wish I had data on the churn rate for current Rapid7 subscribers, but unfortunately, RPD does not provide numbers for that.Moving on, let's take a look at how management has managed costs. (Source: RPD 2019 Q3 10-Q)In my last article on RPD, I cited my concern that Products cost of revenue was growing too quickly. Gross margin had actually decreased 0.2% between the prior periods due to the massive increases in cost of revenue. Fast forward to the latest earnings report, and gross margin is back to 71.6%, as it was in 2017. It's good that gross margin is back to increasing, but Rapid7's transition may provide a valid excuse for the lack of robust gross margin growth.The transition to a recurring revenue model for Rapid7 means it must host the infrastructure for storing and giving customers access to their services, data, and etc. In other words, Rapid7 has had to invest in cloud infrastructure instead of relying on customers to build out their own infrastructure to use RPD products. This is good in the long-term, because centralized infrastructure saves customers money and makes updating products more straightforward. However, Rapid7 has to stomach the upfront costs related to setting up the cloud infrastructure, which has been the primary reason for the large increases to Products cost of revenue. Over time, we should expect cost of revenue increases to level off as the centralization benefits allow RPD to scale their services more efficiently. For now, I am glad that gross margin increased in the latest report.Next, we will go over the balance sheet. (Source: RPD 2019 Q3 10-Q) Focusing on current assets, I do not see much activity going on. Lumping together Cash and Short-term Investments, there was a 5% decrease between periods. This is insignificant, as there have been many capital expenditure and capital raising activities in the last year, thus liquid assets have actually held fairly steady. The total amount of Cash and Short-term Investments is also plenty to serve as a strong liquidity buffer in case of unforeseen issues in the future. (Source: RPD 2019 Q3 10-Q) Jumping into the liabilities section, I do not see much change from last time. In my last article, I pointed out that there was a large addition of convertible senior notes that added substantial cash to the balance sheet, but this time there is only a modest increase to that category. Aside from that, Deferred Revenue grew 5%. That is a small amount, but that number should rise in coming quarters since RPD has documented significant growth to annual recurring revenue in the last few years.Lastly, I want to see how Rapid7's competitors stack up against it.Data by YChartsTenable Network Security (TENB) and Qualys (QLYS) are Rapid7's closest competitors. When I compared these companies with Rapid7 one year ago, these were their enterprise values (EVs):Rapid7 had the lowest EV, but based on the latest data from Ycharts, Rapid7 has overtaken its competitors with a $3.04 billion EV, while Qualys and Tenable possess EVs of $2.99 billion and $2.32 billion, respectively. In my previous article, I suggested that Rapid7 may have been trading at a cheaper multiple than it deserved, and looking at its valuation today, it seems to be more fairly valued relative to its peers.Data by YChartsHere is another comparison-this time with share prices. Rapid7 has substantially outperformed its peers in the course of one year, with its share price growing over 84% in that time span.Last time I wrote about Rapid7, its share price had fallen 20% (which was in line with the technology sector benchmark, XLK), prompting me to recommend that investors go long on the company since it appeared undervalued at the time. Today, Rapid7 has overtaken its closest competitors in enterprise value, showing that investors have realized the potential of this stock. Despite the massive gains to share price made in 2019, Rapid7's management continues do well in the transition to a recurring revenue model, with ARR growth accelerating in 2019, and poised to accelerate further in 2020. Therefore, I recommend investors go long on RPD if they are not already invested."
4310490,104952,2019-12-04T12:04:39-05:00,"Rapid7’s VM business continues to drive solid customer growth in Q3. Total ARR grew by 43% YoY to $310 million, following the 17% YoY growth in customer count.The company’s ability to drive growth through strategic R&D and marketing activities, as we have seen in the Metasploit project initiative, remains exceptional.We expect a ~13% potential upside by the end of FY 2020, where we see a strong possibility to reach $400 million of revenue.","In Q3, we see a continuation of strong YoY growth in Rapid7's (RPD) overall ARR, average ARR per customer, and the recurring portion of total revenue. Furthermore, the company also had a guidance-beating quarter in Q3 with $83.16 million in revenue, which represents 33% YoY growth. In the long term, we maintain our bullish view on the stock. In particular, we are confident in the company’s strategic R&D and marketing activities as we see in its Metasploit project initiative. Ultimately, we believe that it will be the key driver for the continuation of long-term outperformance across various cloud IT security markets.Rapid7’s VM (Vulnerability Management) product, InsightVM, still proves to be a key growth driver for Rapid7’s solid customer growth in Q3. Total ARR grew by 43% YoY to $310 million, while the customer count also grew by 17% YoY to 8,600. Overall, as the management indicated, we see double-digit growth rates across the board:All these are great signs that Rapid7’s technical innovation has been paying off. In particular, we have learned how InsightVM and Insight IDR gained momentum through automation-related use cases in remediation management, integrated investigations, and containment. In the long term, we even put a lot of confidence in Rapid7’s VM business to drive growth. In the last three years, more than 50% of Rapid7’s revenue has been attributable to its VM offering, which includes Metasploit, Nexpose, and InsightVM. While such dependency can become a risk factor going forward, we instead believe that there is massive value in Rapid7’s VM dominance, primarily due to its Metasploit initiative.(source: google search on penetration testing tools keyword)What we like about Rapid7’s Metasploit is the fact that it has an active online community of contributors and solid brand recognition in the security industry due to it being an open-source project. Ultimately, we think that the Metasploit brand enables Rapid7 to become a well-known domain expert when it comes to VM in penetration testing. In that regard, we see a long-run sustainable growth opportunity where Metasploit can drive relevant organic traffic to Rapid7’s other conversion-optimized marketing homepages.(source: stockrow)As Rapid7 scales that part of the marketing channel, we will expect to see a continuation of a steady declining trend in its Sales and Marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue. In the last two years, the company has maintained such trends as its businesses mature. Rapid7 currently reinvests approximately ~30% of its revenue in Sales and Marketing activities, which is around ~15 PPS lower than it was two years ago.Through its sustainable marketing and R&D activities, we do not see any critical risk factor in Rapid7 aside from the increasingly competitive environment in the US, where around ~80% of its revenue comes from. This can potentially encourage the company to further its international expansion, which can present a challenge. Typically, we will expect to see higher variations in the IT security knowledge among the potential sales channel partners overseas. As such, there will be a concern as to how Rapid7 can achieve the same level of outperformance through a similar go-to-market strategy. As of 2018, almost ~40% of Rapid7 revenue has come from its sales channel partners.Overall, we believe that Rapid7’s core competency in VM and strong execution will continue to drive shareholder value going forward. Ultimately, we think that there is a big chance for Rapid7 to finish FY 2020 with ~$400 million in annual revenue and maintain a P/S of ~7.8, which is the midpoint of the current and forward P/S of 8.56 and 6.96, respectively. The expected P/S of 7.8 means the company trades at a similar P/S level to its peers such as Tenable (TENB) and Qualys (QLYS). The assumption of ~49 million share count further sets our price target at ~$67 per share by the end of FY 2020, which represents a ~13.7% upside. Consequently, the company’s exceptional VM brand, which has maintained the relevant flow of traffic and conversions, should serve as a margin of safety for the stakeholders."
4287834,102101,2019-08-26T03:23:13-04:00,"Rapid7's product diversification and growth narrative points to the need for improved valuation.The company provides one of the best vulnerability assessment solutions, and it is well-positioned to gain more market share.Rapid7 is a Buy, as the company's valuation is yet to reflect the full capabilities of its products.","Rapid7 (RPD) is a leading provider of on-prem vulnerability assessment solutions. However, in recent quarters, it is proving to be more than just a compliance and audit security vendor. The company has introduced three more products, while making key acquisitions to strengthen its capabilities. The Street is still valuing Rapid7 like a traditional vulnerability assessment company. Fast product growth, customer growth, high retention rate, and annual recurring revenue paints a different picture of a company which has expanded its TAM and capabilities. As such, Rapid7 deserves a better valuation, and there is more room for multiple expansion from here.Rapid7 came under my radar after I learned that it acquired Metasploit. For penetration testers, Metasploit is one of the leading industry tools for performing vulnerability assessment and network scanning. I used it in my days of learning penetration testing to write exploits and payloads. The sheer sight of what the tool is capable of is astounding.Metasploit reminds me of the film Snowden. You know how the NSA can scan multiple networks and find exploits while making it look like it's nothing? You can make your security lab out of its open source Metasploit framework. It's a powerful tool for detecting security vulnerabilities in networks, apps, and defense systems.Today, Rapid7 is more than that. It has added more capabilities in IDR (incident detection and response), app security, security orchestration, and automation. That's why it's used by 40% of Fortune 500 companies. Due to the level of congestion in the space, many investors are wary of the ability of new cyber plays to maintain fast growth while improving profitability. A lot of investors are risk-averse, and it's justified, because a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.Rapid7 has a similar DNA to most cybersecurity companies. It has recently transitioned to a subscription-as-a-service model. This move increases operating costs during transitioning, due to the development of the required cloud infrastructure. We are in the tail end of the transition, and the evidence is clear that the SaaS model is going to improve growth and profitability. ARR is currently 87% of revenue, while the renewal rate is well above 100%. The customer count is also growing. Near term, bottom line profitability ratios will continue to blink red. This might deter impatient investors and keep the stock range down and depressed.At a market cap of $2.6 billion, Rapid7's valuation is not scratching the surface of what its acquisitions are capable of. The multiple cross-sell and up-sell opportunities offered by its network packet inspection solution (acquired NetFort), application threat defense and monitoring (acquired tCell.io, Inc.) and the triple-digit growth from its IDR solution are understated in the company's valuation.The stock isn't overvalued by most valuation ratios. It has a forward P/S of 8.3X versus Qualys (QLYS) (10.4X) and Tenable (TENB) (6.1X). This is driven by its quarterly revenue growth of 35% versus Qualys (15%) and Tenable (34%). Selling the business for $2.6 billion will be a steal for any acquirer given the level of growth it's been able to sustain.Going forward, I expect profitability ratios to continue to improve as management drives sales and product efficiency through its cross-sell and up-sell strategy. Its flagship Nexpose product (responsible for ⅔ of revenue) is a top-three product in RFPs for vulnerability and network security scanning solutions.Its IDR and app security offerings rank favourably in Gartner's quadrant for top SIEM and application testing solutions. In terms of market share, IDC published a report which was shared by Qualys in 2018, in which Rapid7 was ranked behind Qualys and Tenable, its top two competitors.(Source: Qualys)As a security researcher, I tend to favour companies with strong support for open source tools, as it helps spread the word amongst tinkerers and developers. In this regard, Rapid7 leapfrogs its competitors. The Metasploit framework relies on contributions from the best security researchers and bug hunters in the world. As a researcher who has written exploits, I can vouch for the depth and capability of its exploit database.Moving on to its financials, Rapid7 is currently enjoying double-digit grow ahead of its analyst day guidance on both revenue and ARR. The only worry for me is the operating and profit margin, which have worsened due to investments in sales strategies to accelerate growth. Free cash flow has also taken a hit due to acquisitions. Management is guiding for breakeven in 2020. I won't be deterred if it takes longer than that due to the investment required to sustain growth. However, I will be on the watch for improvements in gross and operating margin as an indicator of the product and sales efficiency that management is touting. Rapid7 has a gross margin of 71% compared to Qualys (77%) and Tenable (84%). Its operating margin is -15% versus Qualys (20%) and Tenable (-26%).The Street hasn't fully baked in the shocking earnings beat, which means the stock isn't susceptible to a knee-jerk reaction in the result of an earnings miss. The average analyst revenue estimate in 2019 is $319 million (+30% y/y) and $394 (+23%) in 2020. The average price target is $71/share, which implies the stock is trading at a 31% discount to analysts' consensus estimates.When valuing cybersecurity companies, I like to put myself in the shoes of the stereotypical forward-thinking chief information security officer of a Fortune 500 company. Using my industry and product experience, I try to answer a simple question: Would I buy this product if I were a CISO, and how much would I be willing to pay for it? From my experience, it's a big ""yes"" for Rapid7. I'll install Rapid7 and task my security researcher with the responsibility of bug hunting and getting ahead of the latest zero-day exploit. It isn't too much a price to pay to stay ahead of the latest threat vectors. I assume every other Fortune 500 CISO will be thinking along these lines. Other mid-market businesses will definitely need some awareness, and I believe the security industry is getting to that point.In this regard, I'll rate Rapid7 a ""Buy,"" as I'm confident in the capabilities of its product and I believe the company will continue to gain market share as it intensifies its effort to raise awareness about cybersecurity best practices."
4273366,35181,2019-07-03T15:19:53-04:00,"Rapid7 has transformed into a SaaS with 85% of revenues being recurring.The company is pioneering the Security Operations industry, but there is intense competition.Rapid7 has prioritized a new global headquarters over ramping up sales and marketing. This may ultimately impact market share of the new market segment.Falling FCF margin has resulted in failing the Rule of 40 used by some analysts to judge the health of a company.I have assigned this company a rating of neutral and will revisit in late 2019.","Rapid7, Inc. (RPD) provides cybersecurity analytics and automation to more than 7,900 organizations. Rapid7 is also a pioneer in Security Operations (SecOps), a relatively new field that the company hopes to become a dominant player in. While Rapid7 appears to be a strong company with good growth, I have some reservations about the stock as an investment. These concerns include falling free cash flow margin, large expenditures that will extend into 2020 and intense competition for the SecOps market. And there is the possibility that the SecOps market develops as the company hopes it will. For these reasons, I give Rapid7 a neutral rating with an eye to revisit the company later in the year.Rapid7 has been transforming its business for the last few years, going from selling perpetual licenses into a Software-As-A-Service (SaaS) business, and from essentially one product (Vulnerability Management) to a suite of products that provides upgrade and cross-sell opportunities. 85% of sales are now recurring and the transformation to SaaS is almost complete, while the product suite is still evolving. The company calls the current offerings the “four main pillars of SecOps” as described below:(Source: Rapid7 2018 Q4 - Results - Earnings Call Slides)To date, the majority of enterprise spend on cybersecurity has been on threat protection products, including network, endpoint and web security that are designed to stop threats from penetrating corporate networks. Rapid7 is staking its future in large part on the growth in the market for SecOps, a fledgling and highly competitive industry that is constantly evolving. Given that there is no significant history for SecOps to base guidance on, this is a risky bet for Rapid7.According to company management:Enterprises may continue to allocate their budgets to vulnerability management and not embrace the more comprehensive cybersecurity products that Rapid7 has to offer.As I mentioned earlier, the cybersecurity market is highly competitive.Omitted from the above is Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure Sentinel. There are other interesting approaches to cybersecurity such as Okta’s (OKTA) Zero Trust that may eat away the Total Addressable Market (TAM). Also, some enterprises are reluctant to use cloud solutions for cybersecurity because they have concerns regarding the risks associated with the reliability or security of the technology delivery model.As I explained in my last article on Wix (WIX), high-growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, they often confound analysts, with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, the software company ""Rule of 40,"" and my favorite: company performance relative to analysts' estimates.Rapid7 had a good year with trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 25%, according to portfolio123. Note that the revenue growth may be somewhat skewed due to the change in accounting method from ASC 605 to ASC 606, making historical figures non-comparable. I am going to stick with the figure of 25% as the guidance provided in the Rapid7 2018 Q4 - Results - Earnings Call Slides was for 26% revenue growth for 2019.Rapid7's free cash flow margin TTM has dropped recently and now sits at -12% of revenues.(Source: Portfolio123.com)While some of the drop in the chart may be explainable by the change in accounting, the final figure of -12% is real. According to company management:Not only that, but some sales & marketing expenses have been pushed out due to the significant spend.Ramping sales & marketing is a critical tactic that most companies do towards the end of the transformation process to SaaS. The goal is to capture as much market share as possible as soon as possible, giving a foothold in the industry and hopefully creating an economic moat. Yet, Rapid7 has bumped the ramp of S&M to some future period of time. This expense has been sacrificed to build a global headquarters. The global headquarters may be a good long-term move, but it is pushing out sales resources needed to grow the business.Examining how a company performs versus analysts' estimates gives me a feel for how conservative the management is and how well they communicate with the investment community. This is a good predictor of what to expect in future quarterly results. With that said, Rapid7 has an excellent record of beating analysts' estimates. The company has exceeded estimates for the last five quarters for both sales and EPS.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Analysts are challenged when it comes to valuing software companies. While these companies tend to generate high revenue growth rates, they also tend to be unprofitable due to large investments in research & development and sales and marketing. Discounting future cash flows requires many assumptions that are typically unreliable and difficult to support.One industry metric that is often used for early- to mid-stage software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as the figure is useful in a later part of my analysis.Some analysts interpret the Rule of 40 as follows: If a company's growth rate is at least 40 percentage points higher than its free cash flow margin, then a high-growth SaaS company can burn cash in order to drive growth.Rapid7 is burning cash. SG&A expenses are 87% of revenues, higher than what would be expected from a more mature software company that would typically have a figure around 50-60%.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative, and R&D.On the other hand, Rapid7’s SG&A expense is more reasonable than some other stocks that I have analyzed recently, such as Okta, which has more than 100% SG&A as a percentage of revenues.According to the Rule of 40, the cash burn is OK so long as revenue growth plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more.Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 25% - 12% = 13%In the case of Rapid7, the cash burn appears to be ""not acceptable"". Revenue growth would need to be higher than 50% to support the negative FCF.Rapid7 is also a pioneer in SecOps, a relatively new field that the company hopes to become a dominant player in. Rapid7 has transformed its business to SaaS and now has 85% recurring revenues. The company's original product, Vulnerability Management, and related software, still accounts for more than 50% of revenues. New product suite additions, although they appear to be promising, are still in their infancy, and there is the risk that the SecOps market may not grow as the company anticipates, or the competition may prove to be formidable. The company is spending a significant amount of money on a new global headquarters that has put free cash flow into negative territory and caused the ""Rule of 40"" to be violated. The Rule of 40 is often applied to small and mid-sized companies. For these reasons, I have given Rapid7 a neutral rating with the intent of revisiting the fundamentals in late 2019.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"
4265025,20521,2019-05-17T20:39:07-04:00,Rapid7 continues to grow its footprint through acquisitions.Competitors and tech giants also are eyeing the security space for acquisitions.Rapid7 will need to continue to drive growth both organically and inorganically to stay relevant in the market.,"According to a recent ResearchAndMarkets report, the global security and vulnerability management market is expected to grow to $14.7 billion by the year 2024. Organizations of all sizes are expected to increase their focus on preventing security attacks instead of waiting for system flaws to catch them off guard. Boston-based Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) is a leading security solutions provider that recently announced its first quarter results that surpassed market expectations for the fourth consecutive quarter.Rapid7's revenues for the quarter grew 34% over the year to $73.2 million, significantly ahead of the market's expectations of $69.85 million. For the quarter, it reported a GAAP loss from operations of $9.7 million and non-GAAP income from operations of $0.6 million. Non GAAP EPS came in at $0.02 compared with the loss of $0.08 per share forecast by the market.By segment, revenues from products grew 60% to $56.3 million, maintenance and support revenues fell 11% to $9.6 million, and professional services revenues declined 13% to $7.3 million for the quarter.For the current quarter, Rapid7 forecast revenues of $74.3-$75.9 million with a loss of $0.08-$0.06 per share. It expects to end the year with revenues of $312-$318 million with an EPS of $0.05. The market was looking for revenues of $73.7 million with a loss of $0.01 per share for the quarter and revenues of $308.6 million with an EPS of $0.05 for the year.Rapid7 has been focused on three key goals - drive growth, simplify customer adoption, and improve leverage in its financial model. During the quarter, it continued to deliver on these goals through product innovation and acquisitions. Recently, it announced that it had achieved the Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN) Security Competency status for its InsightVM solution. The status recognizes Rapid7's proven technology and expertise and will help Rapid7 differentiate itself as an AWS Partner Network member that offers specialized software to handle complex security projects on AWS.It's also keeping an eye on its financial performance, and during the quarter managed to deliver a non GAAP operating profit of $0.6 million. Management feels confident in the path to profitability, but intends to continue investing for growth.Rapid7 continues to grow its footprint through acquisitions. Earlier last month, it announced the acquisition of Ireland-based NetFort for $15 million. NetFort was founded in 2002 to develop network traffic and security monitoring software. Its flagship product LANGuardian analyzes network traffic and leverages deep packet inspection techniques to provide deep visibility into network events. Using LANGuardian, organizations can manage file sharing, conduct network forensics, and monitor internet activity over its network.Rapid7 plans to integrate these capabilities into its Insight cloud offering. Post the integration, Rapid7 will be able to consolidate more data and analytics into a single platform for security and IT professionals and thus improve the ability to detect attacks, investigate incidents, and gain increased visibility into devices that pose a risk to organizations. Rapid7 is counting on leveraging NetFort's technology to broaden its data collection capabilities so as to accelerate its expansion into the enterprise segment for InsightIDR.NetFort's funding and financial details are not disclosed. Owler estimates that the company is trending at annual revenue run rate of $3 million. Rapid7 indicated that the acquisition would not have a material impact on its annualized revenue growth, revenue and non-GAAP operating and net income for this year.The security industry is dotted with several players. Like its competitors Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) and Carbon Black (NASDAQ:CBLK), Rapid7 also is focusing on growing by acquiring the smaller companies in the industry. Qualys has been improving its vulnerability management offering through acquisitions of bootstrapped and capital efficient firms such as Adya. Carbon Black has focused on the endpoint security system and acquired smaller companies that complement its offering by adding capabilities such as visualization and analytics. Then there's Tenable which has built a Cyber Exposure platform that arms security teams with the visibility to see their entire cyber attack surface at all times. Tenable hasn't made many acquisitions, and is counting on product innovation to drive growth.But there are several other bigger players like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) that have access to far more capital and scale. Companies like Splunk have managed to grow in the industry through acquisitions, a robust partner network, and a dedicated platform strategy. But there also are others like FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) that have struggled in the recent past to grow despite product innovation. Rapid7 will need to continue to drive growth both organically and inorganically to stay relevant in the market.The market is pleased with its performance. Its stock is trading at $52.02 with a market capitalization of $2.5 billion. It had peaked to a record high of $57 last month near result announcement.

It will centralize high priority security alerts and automate actions triggered by security alerts across the AWS environment.Additionally, the company also announced the addition of Cloud Configuration Assessment to its Insight cloud. It gives customers additional visibility into configuration risk within AWS environments. InsightVM will be able to gather the configuration settings customers have and compare them to the industry-standard CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark as part of this initiative. It also will help secure hybrid environments without customers having to purchase and manage multiple solution.According to Rapid7, most customers were hassled by the non-integrated approach that they had to deal with when working on hybrid environments. Its latest product gives customers the visibility into traditional and cloud environments for vulnerability risk and configuration risk and helps them automate the response and remediate.As part of its second goal, the company is investing in systems and packaging to make it easier for customers to adopt, renew, and expand usage of Rapid7 product portfolio. Finally, for leverage improvement, Rapid7 has been driving profitability.

However, costs are rising too quickly, which has led to gross margin deterioration–but this could be attributable to fixed costs needed for setting up a cloud-based service. Finally, I compare Rapid7 to competitors to give you a better idea of where the company stands among peers.I originally wrote an article on Rapid7 (RPD), a B2B provider of data analytics/security, back in September of 2018.In that article, I mentioned that despite slowing revenue growth, increases to deferred revenue proved that the company's sales were actually doing well. However, contrary to most SaaS businesses, RPD's gross margin was falling as its subscription revenues became larger in proportion. Also, Rapid7's competitors possessed superior valuation metrics and cash flow figures, which prompted me to recommend the company as a ""hold"" to investors until 2019, upon which I would reevaluate my investment thesis.Now, let's look at how Rapid7 has fared in the last three months before diving into the analysis.RPD data by YChartsRapid7 was $37.32 when my article was published on September 6th, 2018. Since then, it has fallen 20.7%, and took a decent hit on 01/03/2018 as the markets sharply fell.RPD data by YChartsCompared to the Technology Select Sector ETF (XLK), which I use as a benchmark for technology firms, RPD has practically fallen the same percentage, meaning that the share price decline is also attributable to general market sentiment rather than individual performance alone.Next, I will show you how revenues are trending at Rapid7.(Source: RPD SEC filings, tabled created by author)The table above shows third quarter revenue for each of the last 5 years. Revenue growth was strong in 2015 and 2016, in which revenue grew 28% and 30%, respectively. Upon first glance, investors may be concerned by the sudden deceleration in growth in 2017 and 2018. However, if you read my previous RPD article, you would know that this slowdown in revenue growth was due to management's ongoing transition to a SaaS business model. Rapid7's management directly cited the risk of changing its business model in their 2017 10-K:When I first learned of the effect of the transition, I told investors that looking at total revenue figures would not yield an accurate picture of Rapid7's performance. Instead, I advised them to look at recurring revenue figures for the firm.(Source: RPD SEC filings, tabled created by author)Compared to total revenue, annualized recurring revenue has been growing in excess of 30% since 2016. This has everything to do with revenue recognition, since in the past, Rapid7 would sell licensed products and recognize the entire sale as revenue immediately. Now, since subscription products entail steady revenues that are spread out over a certain period of time, Rapid7's revenue growth deceivingly appears to be slowing, when in fact, it is increasing if you take into account subscription revenues which are arriving over certain periods (such as monthly, yearly, etc.). Thus, the company seems to be handling the transition to a SaaS business model well, since sustained 30%+ gains in annualized recurring revenue mean new customers are signing up.Just to be sure new customers are indeed signing up, I checked the figures for how many customers RPD had each year:(Source: RPD SEC filings, tabled created by author)Please note that the 2018 customer count only incorporates three quarters of growth, so the change should be greater than 10% for the full year. Aside from that, a 21% gain in customers in 2016 was strong, while things slowed down in 2017 with the customer count only increasing 9%. However, 2017 was the year that RPD made heavy strides in encouraging customers, new and old alike, to purchase subscriptions. Thus, in 2016 there may have been a surge of customers who purchased licensed products, but had no need to purchase another product from Rapid7 within the next couple of years. Assuming this phenomenon existed in previous years, the customer growth rates could have been volatile since a business was only considered a customer if it purchased a Rapid7 product within the last twelve months. However, with the subscription model, a customer will always be counted as a customer until 12 months after they quit their subscription. So, it is likely that we will see steadier customer growth rates based on how a customer is defined by Rapid7.Moving on, let's take a look at how management has been managing costs.(Source: RPD 2018 Q3 10-Q)Right away, it is clear that Products cost of revenue is increasing much faster than the other revenue categories. I often tout high gross margins as a benefit of the SaaS model. While a 71.4% gross margin is by no means bad, Rapid7's gross margin has been decreasing during its ongoing SaaS transformation. From my previous article, gross margin was 74.8% in 2016. In 2017, it was 71.6%, and now has nudged downwards to 71.4% in 2018. Seeing gross margin alone does not tell us the whole story. One of the sacrifices a business makes in hosting a cloud-based subscription service is that it must pay for the IT-related expenses of storing customer data in-house. From Rapid7's perspective, its sharp increase in Products cost of revenue stems from the expense of buying more servers to host customer data, and needing to hire more IT staff to manage that infrastructure. What is important in analyzing cost of revenue for Products is knowing if the expenditures are weighted more towards one-time purchases, or if a certain gain in subscription customers will lead to a proportional increase in Products cost of revenue. I contacted investor relations last week about this question, and will update readers when I receive a response. The trajectory of gross margin is a crucial factor in knowing whether Rapid7 is worth investing in, because higher gross margin is what drives value creation for shareholders.Next, let's see how the company's balance sheet is faring.(Source: RPD 2018 Q3 10-Q)On the assets side, Rapid7's cash situation looks better than ever. Cash and cash equivalents, along with short-term investments, more than doubled; current assets as a whole increased 101%. There were no divestitures in 2018, so I immediately looked at liabilities to see if debt had been taken out.(Source: RPD 2018 Q3 10-Q)Sure enough, $172,165,000 of convertible senior notes appeared within liabilities during the period. Despite this increase in debt, Rapid7's leverage decreased. Assets increased 84%, while liabilities increased 65%. For gauging liquidity, RPD's quick ratio improved from 0.91 in the beginning of 2018, to 1.83 now. I suspect that part of the increase in current assets was in response to concerns about the firm's sub-zero quick ratio, aside from potential M&A opportunities.One the whole for the balance sheet, it was wise for management to take on debt early in this rising interest rate environment. Also, the simultaneous increase in liquidity and decrease in leverage is great for investors, since management has provided itself with a buffer to weather this ongoing business model transformation, and can make a strategic acquisition if the opportunity presents itself.Lastly, I want to see how RPD stacks up against the same competitors I compared it to last time.RPD Enterprise Value data by YChartsQualys (QLYS) and Tenable Network Security (TENB) are Rapid7's closest competitors. Three months ago, QLYS and TENB possessed enterprise values of $3+ billion, while Rapid7 was at $1.7 billion. Now, looking at the chart above, you can see that all three companies shed value, but RPD lost the least, which could be a sign that RPD is trading at a cheaper value relative to its competition.Looking at quarterly gross profit margins, Rapid7 improved its gross margin by 1.2% from last quarter, reaching 71.44%. Meanwhile, QLYS improved by about 1%, and TENB's fell by roughly 3%. So, while Rapid7's gross margin fell compared to the same quarter last year, it actually improved from last quarter. In an uncertain economic environment, management's ability to boost gross margin is a good indicator that the SaaS transition is doing better than we originally thought.RPD data by YChartsFinally, here is a graph showing how much each of the companies' share prices have fallen since I last wrote about Rapid7. TENB has lost a third of its value, while Qualys lost 22.4%. This is another indicator that either RPD's competitors were overvalued, or RPD offers better services to customers.Rapid7's share price has fallen approximately 20% since I last wrote about it three months ago, but that decrease is in line with the decline in the technology sector benchmark I mentioned earlier, and does not necessarily have anything to do with the company's own performance. On the bright side, annual recurring revenue is growing robustly, at over 30% per quarter, and gross margin increased from the last quarter after falling repeatedly in prior quarters. Rapid7's customer count is also growing at a reasonable rate. For all of those reasons, I recommend investors go long on RPD as management continues to successfully manage the transition to a SaaS business model."

I think this rise in price is unwarranted and investors would do well to avoid this name.That said, people love to speculate, and I offer a much safer way to do it here.It seems to me that the more this company sells, the more it loses. This makes me wonder why it trades for over 600 times free cash flow.","Over the past twelve months, the shares of Rapid7 Inc. (RPD) are up about 113%, and I think now would be a great time for investors to count their luck and sell the shares. I'll go through my reasoning below by looking at the financial history here, and by contrasting that mediocre history with the stock itself. I'll also ask five questions that every bull should have an answer to.All that said, I understand that some people who buy companies like this don’t mind a lack of consistent income, and judge the success of an investment by whether the share price happens to go up or not. I would argue that such people are ""speculators"" and not ""investors"", but I see the value in the activity. A company like Rapid7 could be a speculators dream, so for those people I suggest an alternative to outright share ownership. I think an investor can derive much of the benefit of share ownership at far less risk by switching to calls here. I’ll go through the specifics of the strategy below.Rapid7 is in many ways a very impressive organization. It has over 7,000 customers globally in over 127 countries, and boasts a client list that includes 52% of the Fortune 100. If you’re not aware, Rapid7 is a leading provider of security and IT analytics. The company blends a powerful combination of data collection, insight into attacker behavior and techniques, and security solutions that can identify and prioritize risks in an enterprise’s IT environment.The company offers solutions across three areas of SecOps (Security Operations).A quick review of the financial history here reveals a few things immediately. Sales growth has been impressive since 2013, having grown at a CAGR of about 27% over the past five years. The problem is that the costs have grown at a more rapid pace, with R&D, Sales and Marketing, and “G&A” up at a CAGR of 19%, 28.5%, and 19% respectively. The result of this is that losses have grown at a CAGR of about 19% as the company has grown. In order to finance itself, the company has increased the share count at a CAGR of about 28% since 2013, implying a high level of dilution here. On the bright side, the company has no debt to speak of. Finally, one group that seems to have benefited is employees. As the share price has risen, so too has the per employee stock based compensation expense.Source: Company filingsI understand the bullish case in a nutshell here. The company must grow sales in order to gain market share, at which point revenue growth will continue to grow, while the rate of growth of various costs will slow. That’s where the profits will come from. In addition, revenue will become more predictable as the company switches to a SaaS model. I understand the bull thesis, but I have five questions of itIn my view, there’s no satisfactory answer to these questions. That doesn’t disqualify the company for consideration, though. It is the case that a currently unprofitable company may be an excellent investment if the stock price is right. The problem is that it isn’t.It sometimes surprises me to learn that some investors (mostly tech investors) don’t seem to understand the importance of the price that you pay for a stream of future cash flows. The price you happen to pay for a stream of future cash flows is perhaps the single most important variable in determining whether an investment is a success or a failure. Buying the right company at the wrong price is just as bad as buying a terrible company at a cheap price in my view. With that in mind, I should look at the Rapid7 stock as a thing distinct from the business itself. For those who can’t stand the suspense, or my writing, I’ll just cut to the chase: The stock is morbidly expensive.There are a host of tools that I employ to determine whether a stock is expensive or not, two of which I typically write about on this forum. The most straightforward of these is the price to free cash flow. It seems axiomatic (to me at least) that the more you pay for a stream of future cash flows, the lower will be your subsequent return. With that in mind, here is a visual representation of Rapid7’s price to free cash flow per share.Source: GurufocusAt a price to free cash flow greater than 600, I think it’s fair to say that all of the good news is already “baked in” here. In other words, all of the positive news that investors know about here is reflected in the current price. This creates a terribly skewed risk reward relationship for investors in my view. I think that given that very good execution is already priced in, there’s little upside and a great deal of downside. In my view, if the company performs well, there’ll be little price increase from here, as it will have simply met expectations. If, as is more likely, a combination of competition or customer delay or imperfect execution conspire to deliver something less than perfection and the shares will crater. Thus, the marginal buyer faces a badly skewed risk-reward relationship in my view.I think successful investing involves paying as little as possible for a return in future. I also think that no matter how much I drone on about the importance of not overpaying, some speculators will dismiss my arguments because “technology.” Fair enough. I think I owe it to my readers to offer a strategy whereby they can enjoy most continued price appreciation at far less risk, though. With all that in mind, I recommend that people who are bullish on this name switch to call options. In particular, at the time of this writing, the bid ask spread on the May call with a strike price of $40 is $3.80-$4. This isn’t a terrible price to pay for continued upside in my view. For about 10% of the capital that it takes to own 100 shares, a speculator can enjoy another 8 months of price action from here. That allows them to capture most of any upside that this manic market will deliver, while massively reducing the risk present. Finally, in case someone was thinking of accusing me of not pointing out the patently obvious, there’s no hope of a dividend out of any organization that bleeds so much red ink, so the opportunity cost of calls is zero.In my view, it makes very little sense to buy this business at this price. The shares are trading at a near record. In addition, the company itself seems to be a money pit, growing losses as sales increase. There is some potential here, obviously, and the market seems to like bidding up the shares. With that in mind, I think it makes sense to switch from share ownership to calls on a lot for lot basis. I think it makes sense for people who insist on having exposure to this company to replace each 100 shares with a single May call option with a strike price of $40. These speculators will enjoy most benefits that will accrue to the rest of the manic crowd. At the same time, call holders will suffer far less when price inevitably falls to line up with something approaching reasonable value here."
4174152,22148,2018-05-15T10:38:33-04:00,Venture funds continue to exit Rapid7.The last offering was priced at $30.25 following two previous secondaries in 2018.Recent billings weakness could hold the stock back for the remainder of 2018 as the mode shifts to recurring revenues.,"After a bullish investment thesis on Rapid7 (RPD) last year when the cybersecurity stock traded around $15, the rash of secondary offerings is now concerning. The company has been on a solid run over the last year and large ongoing losses should make one consider exiting along with the insider venture funds.Source: Rapid7 websiteAfter reporting another earnings best, Rapid7 launched a secondary offering for 3.0 million shares. Rapid7 has now completed three public offerings this year as insiders rush to exit the stock.The most recent secondary shares were priced near the highs at $30.25 raising over $90 million for the selling shareholders that includes funds like Bain Capital Venture Investors and Technology Crossover Ventures. The firms had about 7.2 million shares outstanding after the last offering in March when both sold equal amounts in a 2.0 million share offering.Source: Rapid7 prospectusRapid7 completed a secondary of 5.95 million shares on January 30 with the company selling 1.5 million shares and insiders selling the remaining 4.45 million shares at only $22.00. The other secondary was completed on March 15 with selling shareholders cashing out on 2.0 million shares at $25.79. In total, these venture funds cashed out of 9.45 million shares in a little less than four months.Typically, venture capital firms look to dump shares after an IPO so these firms holding onto shares nearly three years after the company went public back in 2015 isn't surprising. Rapid7 had dipped to $15 by the typical 6-month lockup, so the suggestion here is that the venture funds didn't want to dump the shares at those lows, but once the stock held above $20, the situation was a different story and the rush to the exist has occurred.The implication after this latest 3.0 million share offering is that the two big venture funds will still have over 4.2 million shares to sell in yet another offering in the future.The company is a data collection and analytics firm that uses those insights for cybersecurity protection of corporate data and networks. The long-term demand for data security is strong, but Rapid7 is still on the bleeding edge with ongoing large losses.Rapid7 hasn't turned rapid revenue growth too much in the way of leverage on the bottom line. The company is still relatively small with annualized revenues just now topping $200 million. The losses though remain relatively large at roughly 16% of revenues under ASC 606.Source: Rapid7 Q1'18 presentationMaybe even more concerning were the weak Q1 billings. Billings dipped below revenues in the quarter and only grew 9% YoY to $48.0 million in the quarter. Arguably the shift to a subscription-based model makes the calculated billings less important, but the weak number has traditionally hurt other stocks. The company saw the average contract length drop from 23 months to 18 months, so the ability to actually grow billings was impressive when 5 months of bookings were eliminated from the total. Still, the company has less guaranteed revenues going into 2020.Rapid7 trades at some of the higher EV/S multiples of the smaller cybersecurity players. Both CyberArk (CYBR) and Rapid7 trade at a 6 multiple while Imperva (IMPV) trades down at nearly half the EV/S multiple of 3.3xRPD EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe comparable stocks have both had scenarios where the stocks collapsed on either weak earnings reports or disappointing guidance. Rapid7 has generally avoided that scenario that tends to hit all of the cybersecurity stocks eventually.The key investor takeaway is that holding onto a cybersecurity stock after a double with the venture funds cashing out isn't that appealing. At $30, investors can actually cash out of Rapid7 at equal prices to the recent secondary.The best option appears to take profits and sit on the sidelines while the venture funds sell the remaining shares. An investor can watch to see whether these funds were signaling future weakness without taking the risk."
4204523,103130,2018-09-06T11:30:57-04:00,"While revenue growth has appeared to slow, deferred revenue shows that sales are stronger than they appear.Strangely, Rapid7's gross margin is falling as the company derives more of its revenue from subscription products.The company's competitors are faring better on a variety of valuation metrics and cash flow figures.","Today, I am going to dive into an analysis of Rapid7 (RPD), a small software company that offers data security and analytics solutions to enterprise clients.(Source: 2017 10-K, table created by author)Revenue has been on a roller coaster, growing 28% in 2014, achieving over 40% growth for two consecutive years, and then returning to 28% growth. After investigating the financials, I realized the decrease in 2017 revenue growth was due to management's ongoing transition to a SaaS business model, as mentioned in the 2017 annual report:So, given the hiccups that generally occur when weaning existing customers off of perpetual licenses and onto subscriptions, it's too early to interpret the recent decline in revenue growth as anything other than a bump along the road.Instead, you should focus on Rapid7's billings and annualized recurring revenue (NYSE:ARR) figures.(Source: 2017 10-K)(Source: 2017 10-K, table created by author)Billings and ARR are–in my opinion–some of the most important metrics for SaaS businesses. Bookings is also important, but unfortunately management does not provide information on bookings. Billings tell us how much money RPD has received from customers for the year. Rapid7's billings actually accelerated in the last few years, rising 26% in 2016 and 31% in 2017. If you recall, revenue grew 42% in 2016 and 28% in 2016. Thus, billings growth surpassed revenue growth in 2017. This is important in explaining the effect of the transition to a SaaS model, because it proves that the company is deriving more of its revenue from subscriptions (rather than licenses), and the slower revenue recognition from subscriptions creates the illusion of lower revenue growth. (Source: 2017 10-K)To dispel the illusion of lower revenue growth, take a look at total deferred revenue, which shows how much Rapid7 collected upfront from customers. Deferred revenue has a CAGR of 39% from 2013 to 2017, and grew about 33% in the last year. So, while revenue growth may look weaker, the reality is that as fewer licensed products are sold and more subscriptions are sold, deferred revenue will be more important in determining how much money Rapid7 truly is getting from customers. Another useful figure is ARR/Revenue, which gives you the percentage of subscription revenue versus total revenue. Here are the ARR/Revenue percentages for the following years:Looking at those figures, I am a little concerned about how slowly the transition to subscriptions is occurring. Revenue is growing in both the subscription and perpetual license categories, but a major advantage of the SaaS business model involves higher gross margins, since stable income flows allow for lower and more efficient spending on sales/R&D as the company increasingly focuses on the current product instead of chasing the next big idea or wasting resources supporting older product versions. Anyways, I am eager to see the 2018 ARR/Revenue percentage. I expect it to increase for 2018 as deferred revenue is recognized as revenue in greater quantities each period. If this figure decreases, then I may become bearish on RPD, because that would indicate that customers would rather stick to the licensed products, or are abandoning Rapid7 altogether. Now, I want to discuss the costs side of Rapid7.(Source: 2017 10-K)When I noticed products costs increased 105.5%, I sought more information from management's notes:From my experience, it is very unusual to have cloud-based offerings that have lower gross margins than license products. In an attempt to discover why margins are lower, I found some factors that management claimed to affect gross margin, ""average sales price of our products and services, transaction volume growth, the mix of revenue between software licenses, cloud-based subscriptions, managed services and professional services and changes in cloud computing costs."" Rapid7's website does not provide pricing, so I could not tell if subscriptions had lower prices on average compared to license products. For transaction volume growth, since RPD is not a payment processor, I assume management means how often customers pay them. I suppose there are transaction fees each time customers pay, and the payment frequency of the subscription model could equate to higher transaction costs. My other thought was the need for an increased headcount of employees within the A/R department to handle the increased transaction volume, but that would be listed under operating expenses, and thus would not impact gross margin.(Source: Q2 2018 10-Q)Looking at the latest report, total gross margin has dropped to 70.2%. To be fair, professional services is hammering gross margin, but those services are complementary to the main product and are less scalable since RPD must have 'x' amount of trainers in proportion to 'y' amount of customers. Anyways, I favor SaaS businesses with 80% or higher margin. If revenues increase by more than 30% in successive quarters, then I could stomach total gross margin of between 80% and 70%. However, if RPD's gross margin falls below 70%, then I would hesitate to invest in it because the SaaS business model would be pointless if it led to lower margins than the license model. RPD Enterprise Value data by YChartsTo get a better idea of how Rapid7 is doing, I decided to compare it to two similar competitors: Qualys (QLYS) and Tenable Network Security (TENB). RPD is roughly half the size of its competitors, which I did not find to be a good sign. Around late 2015 to early 2016, it was of similar value to Qualys, but Qualys has grown much faster in the last three years.QLYS EV to Revenues (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsTo see which company was more expensive, I looked at their EV to Revenues multiples, and Qualys' is 12.8, while Rapid7's is 7.7. I think a large factor in QLYS having a larger EV to Revenues multiple is the fact that its gross margin is 76%, while RPD's gross margin is only at 70%. Otherwise, their revenue growth rate in the latest quarter was identical, and their overall revenues are within $10 million of each other too. So, like I said earlier, Rapid7's deteriorating gross margins will likely hurt them, since investors typically expect margins to increase when transitioning to a SaaS model. If management wants to make up for the shrinking margin, then they will have to deliver excellent revenue growth of at least 30% each quarter.QLYS Cash from Investing (TTM) data by YChartsAnother thing I noticed is that while Qualys and Rapid7 have seen their share prices increase at similar rates in the last six months, QLYS seems to be investing more, taking on less debt, and generating substantially more operating cash flow on a TTM basis. Thus, I think QLYS is doing better than RPD. I would have included TENB in more comparisons, but it has only been public for a few months, so comparisons will have to wait until more time has passed.It is hard to take a stance on Rapid7, because the transition is obviously affecting their short-term figures. Billings picked up substantially, showing that the ""decline"" in revenue is only because that deferred revenue has yet to be recognized in the future. However, the shrinking of gross margin as the company turns to SaaS was unexpected, because subscription companies tend to have higher margins than license companies. RPD also has lower gross margin than its closest competitors, QLYS and TENB, which puts it at a pricing disadvantage. Also, QLYS is investing at much higher rates and also generating much higher operating cash flows. However, I think Rapid7 needs at least two more quarters to show if they can maintain gross margin above 70%, and keep revenue growing at least 30% per quarter. For the above reasons, I do not recommend buying shares in RPD, but would recommend holding if you own shares until the 2019 annual earnings report shows if they have met the gross margin and revenue growth criteria."
4066873,103097,2017-04-28T16:05:00-04:00,RPD gained over 30% in the last 3 months.RPD showed good growth over the last 3 years and reached positive operating cash flow in 2016.My analysis show that the stock is still undervalued by over 20% against the peer group.,"Rapid7 (NASDAQ: RPD) is a data and analytics-based cyber security software company. I first came across the company in late 2016 when I was looking for a turnaround opportunity in small cap software. Rapid7 showed up on my screen. Look at the chart below and you'll see why….Source: stockcharts.comRapid7 didn't meet expectations after its IPO in 2015. This seems to happen a lot with a lot of over-hyped IPO, but that doesn't mean that this is a dog. So I decided to do further investigation. My investigation led me to start a position in November 2016.Since the recent run up, I started wondering if I should increase my position, so I updated my original analysis to reflect the latest information available to me. It's below and divided into 2 parts:Part 1 - Historical PerformancePart 2 - ValuationPart 1 - Historical PerformanceMy initial due diligence on Rapid7 focused primarily on billings/revenue growth, good gross margin (in excess of 70% for software companies. Really good software companies have gross margin north of 85%), and evidence of good customer retentions and expansion (as in, customers will start small, but their purchases grow over time as the software service become more integral to the customer's operation). I'll go over them in detail below (which I've updated for the latest Q4 filing/10-K)Revenue and Billings Growth:On the top line growth front, Rapid7 checked the box. Revenue continued its upward trajectory and billings grew year over year. I should elaborate a little more on how billing is calculated and what it means. For software companies, billing typically means:Revenue + Change in Deferred Revenue = Billing.For readers that are less accounting savvy, here's another way to think about revenue billings. Say you pay $500 today for a 2-year subscription to the NY Times. On day 0, NY Times would book $0 in revenue and $500 in deferred revenue since you already paid for the subscription, but NY Times has not earn the revenue yet since it hasn't given you a newspaper edition yet. Our Billings formula would show:$0 Revenue + $500 Change in Deferred Revenue = $500 in Billings.Let's say NY Times does not sell to anyone else this year. After the end of year 1, it would earn $250 in revenue (50% of the $500 2-year subscription) and keep the remaining $250 as deferred revenue on its balance sheet. The formula would show at the end of year 1:$250 revenue + [$500 - $250] change in deferred revenue = $500 in Billings.This makes sense because the NY Times collected $500 from you in year 1 and earns revenue as it delivers each new edition of the newspaper to you every day. Billings is still $500 for the year no matter which part the year you're in.So why do I care about billings, which is a Non-GAAP figure, in addition to revenue? Because billing correlates better with cash flow and is a better measure of sales force productivity. For a young software company, there are two keys to survival and building shareholder value:(1) You need to have cash to fund the cash burn from R&D, sales force, marketing, etc. - Billing is a good proxy for cash revenue in a given time period.(2) Most companies in this stage are running losses, and, by default, are valued on a top line multiple instead of earnings multiple. The company needs to execute well and be selling in order to achieve bullet point #1 and increase its valuation. Billing growth is a better measure of a software company's ability to execute and close deals. This is ultimately what matters at this stage of a young software company (revenue matters, but it better correlates with how many customers you have, which is also important. In assessing an opportunity, I look at both.).Looking at the graph above, you also see some seasonality to the billing figure, which makes sense given that a lot of enterprise software purchases are made in Q4 of each year.Below are the annual revenue and growth figures:Source: 10-KYou can see that growth % slowed down as the revenue and billings base got larger and larger. 2016 ended with a respectable billings growth of 26%Gross MarginSource: 10-K2016 gross margin came in at just below 75% (which is only slightly above my preference of 70+%). We can see from the chart above that the margins are dragged down by professional service - which is typically a low margin service (example: Rapid7 sends consultants to help the customers implement the software. This is a high labor, low operating/fix cost leverage service). If we look at the gross margin excluding professional services, then we see something like this:This adjusted gross margin is around 85%, but we are seeing some competitive pressure given the decreasing trend in 2016 (Something to watch in the upcoming Q1 Earnings release!).Conclusion: Good software gross margin (excluding professional service) with some concern over competitive pricing pressure. Enough to make me want to keep going.Evidence of Customer RetentionMost enterprise software business model goes something like this:Sell packaged software that includes a software product, maintenance/support, and implementation/professional service. The key is to require some or all of the elements to be renewable, so customers come back and pay for the service/product again. In the old days, the company sold perpetual software licenses with an annual maintenance contract. With the migration to the cloud, the software is hosted in the cloud and sold on an annual subscription basis (Note: Rapid7 themselves are going through this transition).The goal is for the customer to like the product so much that they will renew the renewable element AND come back and buy more subscription units. Depending on the software/industry, the subscription can be per seat, per licenses, per device, per unit of activity, etc.The best way to measure this is by measuring revenue retention or renewal rate (the inverse being revenue churn).Source: Rapid7 presentation - 2016 Q4 Feb. 2017 PresentationBased on this slide from the Q4 presentation, we see the existing customer renew at an 89% rate. However, the total revenue the ends up being renewed is over 120%, which means that customers are coming back and buying more! This is good evidence that there's good retention and expansion within the existing customer base.Wait, there is more! - a few extra things that I did not expect to findOperating Cash Flow:In 2016, Rapid7 reached an important milestone for young software companies. It generated positive operating cash flow over multiple quarters and ended 2016 with positive operating cash flow (yes, they show a net loss in the income statement but a lot of that is due to stock comp and deferred revenue. You have to accept high dilution via stock comp if you want to invest in young software companies… or even mature ones for that matter…).Source: 10-K and 10-Q filingsLots of Cash and No Debt:As of 12/31/16, Rapid7 had almost $72MM in cash and short-term investment. Plenty of cash to fund any short-term sales hiccup and/or acquisitions. This is a great position to be in for a young software company and to not have to dilute the shareholder through another secondary offering (I mean the stock comp dilution is already plenty in these businesses; if I have to sit through a secondary as an investor, I would throw up).So part 1 of my analysis shows that I've got a good young software company showing 20+% growth with good gross margin and good customer retention. The next question is how expensive is this company? Read on to Part 2 of the analysis.Part 2 - ValuationIn thinking about Rapid7's valuation, I pulled up a list of cyber security software companies to do a comp analysis. The goal is to measure the enterprise value multiple based on (1) TTM Revenue, (2) TTM Billings, (3) Fwd Revenue, and (4) Fwd Billings. This way we get a good mix of historical performance versus expectation when thinking about the valuation. Here's the end result (note that the EV figures are as of end of day on 4/27):Now that we have our data set, let's see how Rapid7 stands relative to its peers. If we look at Rapid7's valuation against the peer group, it appears that Rapid7 is undervalued.However, there may be a reason for this low valuation relative to peer group. As investors in young software companies, we are ultimately paying for growth. So let us line up the forward EV multiples against the projected growth rates and see how things look. Here it is:You can see here that Rapid7 is extremely undervalued relative to its peer group on a forward billings basis. This is after Rapid7 announced on April 11, 2017 that Q1 losses were less than expected and that it was reiterating its 2017 revenue guidance of $192MM to $198MM and 2017 billings of $224MM to $234MM (see here).If we look at how Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS), Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT), Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV), and Varonis (NASDAQ:VRNS) (companies with comparable billings growth rate) are valued, Rapid7 should really be valued closer to 3.5x forward billings (average of the four is actually 3.65x, but let's round down to be conservative). But it's trading at 2.76x. This represents a 26.8% upside based on the latest guidance and current comp.Because of (1) good historical growth, (2) undervaluation on a TTM revenue and billings basis, and (3) undervaluation on a forward billings basis, I decided to double my position in Rapid7 before the Q1 earnings release on May 9, 2017 (first time I've made a purchase so close to earnings announcement).When the Q1 earnings are released, I will be looking to see (1) how much of a top line and bottom line beat Q1 was, (2) where gross margin stands to tell us if there are more competitive pressures that cause me to re-think my position, and (3) management's outlook for the remainder of the year."

The company derives roughly 90% of its revenue from its Nexpose software, a vulnerability management (VM) tool. IT professionals and cybersecurity auditors license the product to measure a client’s networks and systems exposure to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. RPD’s core product utilizes an annual subscription model with 90% retention rates reported in the last three quarters. RPD’s stock sold off after reporting a delay in several government contracts following its most recent earnings report.RPD was founded in 2000 and went public in July of '15 at $16/share. The stock soared nearly 70% on its first day and reached a high of $27.50/share as a result of cybersecurity investment mania. Original venture investors Technology Crossover Ventures and Bain Capital Ventures each own slightly over 20% of RPD’s common stock. Neither VC investor sold shares in the IPO or since. In fact, Crossover purchased additional shares on the IPO at $16/share. RAM purchased shares in the $12 to $12.50 range with the added margin of safety that revenues grew 40% since the IPO.Our RPD investment thesis is straightforward: M&A in the cybersecurity software space has been completed at 4x and greater revenue multiples with similar growth rates, while our RPD purchase was struck at roughly 2x enterprise value to revenue. Symantec’s (SYMC) just announced purchase of LifeLock was done at 3.4x revenue and has an expected '17 growth rate of only 12%. RPD’s estimated ’17 growth rate is 23%.The company is expected to generate cash in ’17 which begins to ramp in ’18 thereby maintaining its cash-rich, debt-free, balance sheet. Free cash flow is not the primary metric to consider when you have a company growing over 20% annually, coupled with a 90% retention rate on those software license revenues. The company is correctly focused on growing its subscription revenues while not jeopardizing its balance sheet.Where did we find Rapid7? We asked to sit down with our firm’s long-time IT consultant, Alexander Chamandy of Envescent, to discuss his business, the products he uses and the ones he views as possessing a particularly strong competitive position. This meeting took place several months ago, and at that time, we identified two companies that met our criteria with the exception of price. When RPD’s sell-off occurred from the noted delay in anticipated government contracts in the fourth quarter, we were at the ready with capital. Alexander methodically walked us through why Nexpose is such a desirable product for the SMB IT marketplace, and his arguments were quite convincing. The company’s sales growth trajectory would certainly indicate it’s doing something right.We feel fortunate to have gotten access to a fast-grower at a modest price. With over $200 million in revenue, we believe the company is well situated to provide cutting-edge upgrades to its now large installed base of customers or be acquired by a larger cybersecurity firm looking to build out its suite of security software."

(NASDAQ:RPD) is a leading provider of security data and analytics solutions to organizations seeking to take a data-driven approach to cyber security. Through its portfolio of solutions, RPD equips technology professionals with the analytical tools necessary not only to identify weak spots within their networks but also to prioritize remediation efforts to optimize their IT budgets and workflow. Additionally, RPD provides the incident detection tools required to identify and effectively respond to threats across enterprises and to complete investigations internally.Given its growing portfolio of solutions, anchored by its core vulnerability management offerings and focus on equipping technology professionals with the information necessary to analyze and manage security across their enterprises, I believe RPD is well positioned as Chief Information Security Officers (""CISOs"") within companies and government agencies increasingly look to use security data and analytics to secure their enterprises while optimizing their IT budgets.Source: Company PresentationOver the next twelve months, I expect shares of RPD to appreciate to $19 for the following reasons:Security Data and Analytics Market GrowthRPD's portfolio of solutions allows customers to detect vulnerabilities, close security gaps and respond to threats in real-time across their organizations. Over the next few years, RPD is positioned to increase market share in the 14.4B security data & analytics market.Source: Company PresentationRPD's solutions can be broadly divided into two categories: Vulnerability and Threat Exposure Management and Incident Detection and Response.RPD's Vulnerability and Threat Exposure Management portfolio includes its Nexpose (vulnerability management), Metasploit (attack simulation) and AppSpider (web application assessment) solutions.Nexpose is RPD's flagship vulnerability management offering. It works by scanning across an organizations ecosystem (applications, IP addresses etc.) and provides the CISO with a holistic understanding of risk-adjusted exposure, allowing them to prioritize and close security gaps.Metaploit is RPD's attack simulation product which allows CISOs to analyze how a potential attack would unfold based on their network's vulnerabilities. This type of product is mandated for Payment Card Industry (NYSE:PCI) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance and should continue to contribute consistent growth.AppSpider is RPD's web application vulnerability product which allows CISO's to analyze vulnerability across all network applications.Source: Company PresentationRPD is known for its Vulnerability Management portfolio, however, the company has recently made a push into the Incident Detection and Response area with innovative products that allow CISOs to respond to network compromises in real-time, improve network uptime and complete investigations. The two main products in this portfolio, InsightIDR and InsightOps, were both released in 2016 and represent opportunities for future margin growth as RPD looks to execute its Land-and-Expand sales model. If RPD can successfully upsell these products, which have larger profit margins, to existing and new customers it will be a tailwind to the share price.Source: Company PresentationSolutions Geared for the Trump Era of Security and Optimized SpendingIn light of recent cyber-attacks on major enterprises, federal agencies and other organizations that were seemingly secure thanks to their massive budgets, it is clear the era of ""spending more means your more secure"" is over. Security professionals are increasingly looking for the data and analytical tools to ""spend smart.""Source: Company PresentationIn addition to the opportunity that exists within the private sector, President Donald Trump has indicated he intends to make cyber security a priority during the first few months of his administration, with a focus on identifying vulnerabilities. I believe this initiative will trickle down throughout state and local governments as well.SourceIn addition to being focused on cyber security, it is widely known that the President is always focused on cost. Thankfully, RPD's differentiated portfolio of solutions allows organizations of all sizes (including government agencies) to assess their vulnerability while providing the analysis necessary to prioritize remediation based on risk-adjusted exposure - i.e. spend money on most critical issues - as well as respond to breaches and complete investigations on their own. Based on analysis performed by RBC Capital Markets, it is expected the cyber security will be one of the top priorities at the Department of Defense (see chart below) over the next few years. I expect other federal agencies, states and municipalities to follow the DoD's lead, representing a large opportunity for RPD.(Click to Enlarge)Source: RBC Capital MarketsI believe RPD is well-positioned to provide solutions to state and federal agencies that may not show up on everyone's radar. Most of the time people think of the ""sexy"", defense-related agencies (like the DoD) when thinking of government cyber security, but in my opinion the larger opportunity for RPD is with the thousands of other government agencies at the municipal, state and federal level. As we learned in 2015 with the hack of the Office of Personnel Management, network security is important across the board. Imagine if your state's DMV was hacked? What about your child's school district?In summary, RPD is unique in that their portfolio of solutions allows customers to optimize their security and IT budgets by providing the data and analytical tools that help them prioritize their investments and measure the effectiveness of their programs.To quote the age-old parable, RPD does not just give the customer a fish, it gives them the tools to fish for themselves. Not only do I believe these types of solutions will be increasingly in demand by corporations as well as municipal, state and federal agencies, but I believe this type of recurring revenue model is more sustainable than those that rely on one-time incident-response advisory services.Addition of Senior Sales LeadershipOn November 9, 2016 RPD reported Q3 2016 results which disappointed the market, primarily due to slower than expected growth of customer billings. On the conference call, CEO Corey Thomas identified sales execution as the primary issue: ""…total billings in the third quarter were below our expectations, primarily due to internal sales execution issues in two specific areas, larger deals in the enterprise sector and in the federal sector.""Based on consistent customer renewal rates of over 120%, it appears that RPD does not struggle in the ""expand"" part of their sales model, but instead was in need of sales leadership that could drive new customer acquisition. Similar to the situation going on over at Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) I referenced in my article last week, this is a story of sales execution, not product, and I find that attractive.Source: Company PresentationOn January 11, 2017, RPD announced in a press release that Eric Erston, who previously served as Vice President of Global Enterprise Sales for the energy software company, EnerNOC (NASDAQ:ENOC), would join the company as SVP of Americas Sales. Additionally, it was announced that Stephanie Furfaro would become SVP of Customer Success and Sales Strategy.Eric ErstonAccording to a press release when Mr. Erston joined ENOC in January 2015 as the VP of Global Enterprise Sales, Mr. Erston ""previously served in a variety of sales leadership roles at RSA, the Security Division of EMC, a multi-billion dollar global provider of cloud-based IT solutions that promote data backup and recovery."" According to his Linkedin (NASDAQ:MSFT), Mr. Erston served as Vice President of Sales & Go to Market , Risk and Identity Management at RSA after rising through RSA's sales organization over the course of 14 years. During his tenure at RSA, Mr. Erston led the global integration of a strategic acquisition for RSA, and built out RSA's Sales, Professional Services, and Customer Support organizations in the EMEA and Asia-Pacific regions. When Mr. Erston joined ENOC in 2015, the SVP of Global Sales Gregg Dixon said the following, ""Eric's proven track record of triple digit software sales growth is just one of many strong qualifications Eric brings to this role.""Stephanie FurfaroAccording to RPD, Ms. Furfaro joined the company in 2011 to lead Business Strategy and Sales Operations before taking on the role of Chief of Staff in 2015.In addition to Mr. Erston and Ms. Furfari, it appears from Linkedin that Jeremy Razar, who was part of Eric's team at EnerNOC and RSA, also joined RPD as Director of National Accounts, Americas.Overall, this looks exactly like the type of team necessary to execute RPD's land-and-expand sales strategy (customer case study below) and get RPD's billings growth back on track. Mr. Erston has vast sales leadership experience in the cyber security arena and should be able to jumpstart new customer growth. It is also a great sign that Mr. Erston brought at least one member of his team, as it will allow him to hit the ground running. Based on her title, SVP of Customer Success and Sales Strategy, I assume Ms. Furfaro will be responsible for up-selling and cross-selling products to customers (""expand"" part of the strategy"") once Mr. Erston and his team has brought them onto the platform. As a long-time employee of RPD, she presumably has the deep product knowledge that would make her an ideal candidate for this type of role.Source: Company PresentationOverall, this is the catalyst I have been waiting for since the last conference call. RPD has the right products based on customer renewal rates and is in the right part of the market at the right time. However, they needed to make changes within sales leadership for billings growth, and in turn the stock, to recover. With Mr. Erston and Ms. Furfaro, RPD appears to have delivered.Undervalued Relative to PeersAfter its initial public offering in July 2015, RPD ran up to a high of $24.99 on its first day of trading before falling to a price of $9.46 on February 9, 2016. Following the most recent earnings call in November the stock dropped ~15% (see chart below), and has drifted slowly upwards since.Source: StockCharts.comAlthough the billings growth was disappointing, I believe the market overreacted to the news given that the majority of the shortfall was due to major enterprise and federal accounts. The market may not remember, due to the run up since Trump's election, but during Q3 2016 (pre-election), executive-level uncertainty was widespread. My thinking is that the uncertainty in the market may have led to some hesitancy on the behalf of RPD customers to close new deals or switchover to RPD. Either way, the new sales team and improved macro-environment should be tailwinds for RPD.RPD currently trades at an EV/S multiple of 2.3x my FY2017 Sales Estimate of $200M, below its peer group average of 4.5x.

After a tough 2016 for cyber security, RPD is the best positioned of this group going into 2017.Given that the stock sold off following its Q3 2016 conference call primarily due to sales execution issues, I expect the market to react favorably on February 9th, when RPD hosts its 4Q2016 conference call and introduces Mr. Erston and others to the broader market. Although it will take a few quarters for the impact of the new sales leadership to be reflected in the numbers, I believe that with confidence restored in RPD's ability to achieve strong billings growth, the stock will rebound over the next year to a EV/FY2017E Sales multiple of 4.0x, closer to its peer group average of 4.5x. This implies a target stock price of ~$19, which is ~47% higher than the closing price on January 20, 2017.(Click to Enlarge)Source: InternalBased on the current open options interest in the February expiration, it appears that the options market expects upward pressure on share price following the Q4 2016 conference call as well.Source: MarketChameleon.comDownside Risk FactorsAlthough I believe RPD's portfolio of solutions is optimally positioned to take advantage of the growing security data and analytics market, there are a number of downside risks that could impact share price in the near term.If on the Q4 2016 earnings call it is revealed there has been additional deal slippage that results in an accelerated decline of billings growth or if the adoption rates of InsightIDR and InsightOps are well below expectations then the share price could be pressured. Also, given that my thesis hinges on the fact that RPD has the right products (they just need to execute sales strategy), if we see a significant decline in renewal rates then I would have to revisit my target price.If a large macroeconomic event that undermines business confidence occurs or a customer-specific event occurs that impacts one of its major customers, RPD's growth trajectory and share price could be impacted.Finally, if the newly hired sales leadership is unable to gain traction throughout the year, the market could again lose confidence in the company's growth prospects.SummaryWith its portfolio of solutions aimed at providing customers with the data and analytics necessary to manage vulnerability and respond to threats across their network, RPD should be able to reach annual revenue in 2017 of $200M as demand for security data and analytics increases.In the near term, I expect the market will gain confidence in RPD's new sales leadership team and the company will be rewarded with a EV/FY2017E Sales multiple of 4x, closer to the average of its peer group, and a share price of $19 per share."
4074518,103097,2017-05-18T17:13:29-04:00,RPD grew revenue by 30% and billing by 20% in Q1 2017.Some gross margin deterioration - I discuss why.Strong positive trends in both operating cash flow and operating income.,"I previously wrote about Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) before the latest quarterly release and explained the rationale on why I doubled my own position on this stock (article can be found here). I've been digesting the earnings information and now I'm ready to share my thoughts.First - thoughts on revenue and billingsIt's not just the revenue beat that is significant here, it's also the billings growth (which, as I've mentioned in the past, is a good indicator of sales conversion - i.e.. closing deals). Keep in mind that management is still reiterating 2017 guidance:$193MM to $198MM in revenue: 23% to 26% growth - $224MM to $234MM in billings: 13% to 18% growth.So already in Q1, we are seeing above guidance topline growth. This is a good sign considering that 2016 Q4 ended with a beat and a strong revenue growth. Here's the historical trend to remind you:Source: RPD 10-Q and 10-K filingsWhat does this mean? It means the main reason for the strong Q1 top line growth is unlikely to be because of Q4 deal slippage into Q1, which is good (recall that in Q3 2016, the stock got hammered because a number of deals slipped into Q4 2016. A note to investors, this could happen in the future). Most of the deals that occurred in Q1 were organic to Q1 (hopefully, that's an appropriate way to use the word ""organic."" I couldn't think of any other word).By the way, the Q1 renewal rate was within historical range. No signs of concern here either:Source: RPD 2017 Q1 Financial Metric Data File - see investor relations website.Second - some more thinking on the deferred revenue balance and contract lengthThere's something that's kind peculiar about software revenue in enterprise software sales that readers should be aware of, especially, if you're using billings (non-GAAP figure) to track top-line growth. Billings is essentially the same thing as sales contract size, whether it's a one-year deal, two-year deal, or a 10-year deal. If a sales person books a one-year deal for $1,000, the revenue in year one would be $1,000 and so would the billing. However, if the salesperson signs the customer up for a 10-year deal, then the billing would be $10,000, but there's no real growth on the revenue side! So it's dangerous to look at billing as the only top line figure. To see if this is happening at Rapid7, I looked up the deferred revenue balance on the balance sheet (in my example of the 10-year deal, $1,000 would go to revenue and $9,000 would go to the deferred revenue balance).If Rapid7 is achieving the billing growth by selling longer term deals (which is not something you would want to see on a large scale), we would see LT Def revenue increase. Not so in this case - this matches management's assertion that average contract length has not changed significantly (about two years). So we are seeing good quality organic revenue and billing growth north of 20%.Third - some more thinking about gross marginIn my last article, I had indicated some concerns around the gross margin pressure. I had expressed some concerns that maybe this is due to competitive pressure. If you look at Q1 gross margin, you'll see that it went down by quite a bit. I've been doing a lot of thinking on this, which is why it took me some time to write and publish this article. First, here's the trend for Q1:My initial reaction to the products gross margin was holy smokes! That went down by quite a bit! But as I listened to the earnings call and other earnings call for software companies going through product transition from perpetual license to cloud subscription, my thoughts became more clear.For sure, the cyber security space is competitive and I'm sure RPD, like any other companies in this space, face pricing pressure. With the cloud subscription model, RPD is taking on the IT infrastructure cost by paying Amazon AWS, Azure, and anyone else. This is in contrast to the old perpetual license model where the customers paid for the IT infrastructure on themselves. This is why the cloud subscription product is a lower margin product. You simply have more cost to bear in order to make the customer happy. Under this model, you're probably not going to get the leverage effect on the gross margin side - most of the operating leverage is going to come from customer renewals and new customer revenue eventually leading to higher gross profit which in theory should outstrip the operating expense. There's an accounting anomaly that further penalizes the gross margin when you convert from a perpetual licensing model to cloud subscription. This is best illustrated from Tableau's (NYSE:DATA) recent earnings call.What is happening, mathematically, is that gross margin will be penalized during the initial stages of the transition and it will normalize over time. This is purely because of GAAP revenue accounting rules.Management believes that gross margin will stay around the current level. Looking at how much gross margin dropped in Q1 2017, I would expect to see some more modest declines in the near term (this is without knowing exactly what the sales mix is).Lastly - OCF, operating income, signs of fixed cost leverageI won't speak too much here because the chart kind of explains itself. We're seeing good improvements on both the cash flow side and the operating income side.Source: RPD 10-K and 10-Q filingOverallOverall, RPD had a good Q1 with strong top line growth. I think gross margin is something that should still continue to be watched. 2017 is going to be a product transition year for RPD, and so far they have done a great job on execution."
4052602,22148,2017-03-07T07:45:30-05:00,Rapid7 plays in the cybersecurity sector that is in favor with President Trump.The company has a compelling market opportunity and expansion strategy.The valuation suggests the stock is under the radar of most investors.,"The cybersecurity space is one of the areas where President Trump has supported expanding spending in the sector without some sort of concession from the businesses. Most of the sector stocks, though, typically trade at rich valuations except for possibly under the radar Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD).The data and analytics based cybersecurity solutions provider has already lost any valuation premium from the 2015 IPO. With the stock below $15, is now the time to load up on Rapid7?The cybersecurity space is difficult for retail investors to analyze as new technologies pop up and deriving the leader in the sector is hard to track. One of the best ways is to follow customer trends.Rapid7 is very successful at landing customers and expanding services. Customers unhappy with initial products and security protection from the company wouldn't expand into new services.Source: Rapid7 presentationRapid7 targets up to $200 million in revenues for 2017, yet the company has a total addressable market in excess of $14 billion. A stock with only 1% of the market is a good start in the path towards an attractive valuation.Source: Rapid7 presentationRapid7 focuses on using data analytics to detect cyber threats and respond to resolve the vulnerabilities at a low cost. The company is growing rapidly with revenue growth in 2016 in excess of 40%, but the shift to shorter subscriptions will impact 2017 billings results and slow revenue growth.The company forecasts a downshift in revenue growth, though, to a more reasonable growth track. Rapid7 forecasts revenue growth in excess of 20% for the year and analysts see similar results for 2018.For Q4, Rapid7 already had 63% of revenues based on recurring streams so further shifts will have minimal impacts to revenue growth while providing longer term benefits to cash flows and business stability.The whole sector is running into the same issues, but the stock valuation is most appealing with Rapid7. In comparison to CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV), Rapid7 has the cheapest P/S multiple trading at roughly 3.2x forward sales estimates. Only FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) is a cheaper security stock, but the company has significant structural and growth issues warranting a weak multiple.RPD PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe big difference between a CyberArk and Imperva is that both of those security stocks are profitable. Investors might be concerned that Rapid7 still produces a loss, but the company consistently beats estimates and is heading towards a profitable future as well as generating cash from operations.The key investor takeaway is that the product works based on 120% renewal rates and substantial customer expansions from the initial bookings. The stock valuation offers a compelling opportunity as Rapid7 shifts towards subscriptions and a solid future."
4088729,101421,2017-07-19T12:37:12-04:00,Rapid7 has acquired security technology company Komand for an undisclosed 'non-material' amount.Komand has developed security automation and orchestration software that makes IT and security teams more efficient in their work.Rapid7 will gain an effective 'on-ramp' for smaller size prospects for their Insight security analytics solutions.,"Quick TakeSecurity technology firm Rapid7 (RPD) has acquired startup company Komand for an undisclosed amount.Komand has developed an easy-to-use security automation and orchestration system that makes already-stretched security and IT teams more efficient.Rapid7 gains an effective ‘on-ramp’ to its Insight security platform by providing enterprise IT teams with functionality available without the need to code.Boston, Massachusetts-based Komand was founded in 2015 to develop solutions that assist enterprise security teams to automate and optimize their operations within their particular dynamic workflows.Management is headed by founder and CEO Jen Andre, who has a background in computer science within the cyber security field. Jim Salem was CTO and was previously Chief Architect at Datto and VP Engineering at Endurance International Group.An important advantage of Komand’s system is that it allows users to create automated, dynamic tasks without the need to code; users ‘orchestrate’ automation by drag and drop functionality via plug-ins that connect their existing security tools.Komand raised $1.25 million in private seed stage investment from venture capital firm Accomplice and others. The valuation was not disclosed.Neither firm divulged the acquisition price or terms and Rapid7 didn’t file an 8-K, which would have been required if the transaction had a material impact on its financial condition.In the deal announcement, Rapid7 said, ‘The acquisition of Komand is not expected to have a material financial impact to Rapid7’s calculated billings, revenue, and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share for the calendar year 2017, as guided on May 9, 2017.’According to an unconfirmed report, the consideration paid was $50 million in cash and stock.As of Rapid7’s March 31, 2017, 10-Q filing, the firm had $79.1 million in cash, equivalents and short-term investments and $191.9 million in total liabilities. The company generated $3.3 million in cash flow from operations for Q1 2017, so it appears there were ample resources to pay for the reported acquisition consideration.Rapid7, which provides analytics solutions for security teams to improve their risk management, acquired Komand to expand its Insight system.Security and IT teams are stretched thin and need every automation functionality they can use to increase efficiencies and reduce response time for security incidents.As Rapid7’s Chief Product Officer Lee Weiner stated,Komand has developed over 150 plugins that automate workflows to increase security and IT efficiency, as well as making it easier to ‘foster adoption and usage across companies of all sizes and levels of IT and security maturity.’So not only will Komand’s functionalities help Rapid7’s clients automate their security operations more, it promises to provide a simpler way for prospects to be introduced to Rapid7 – a low cost and effective ‘on-ramp’ to its more robust Insight solution.Rapid7 stands to gain access to a greater pool of prospects and speed up its initial sales cycle accordingly.I view the deal as a positive for Rapid7 in the medium term, as it integrates Komand into its technology stack and sales process over the coming 3–4 quarters.I write about M&A deals, public companies that invest in technology startups and IPOs.

3630426,88096,2015-11-01T04:04:18-05:00,Announced acquisition of Logentries on Oct 13.To report earnings on Nov 12.Stock still in IPO base.,"On Oct 13, Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) announced the acquisition of Logentries, a machine data analysis and search firm. The deal will add a key component to its efforts to build out a data analytics arm to its product lineup, especially given the enormous volume of data that is tested and evaluated as part of its cyber security mission.Logentries was founded in 2010, a spin out of University College in Dublin. It has grown to serve over 3,000 customers in 65 countries with 70 employees.Prior to the acquisition, in June, Logentries had introduced a new query syntax, to better enable it to compete with Splunk in machine data analysis. With the advent of the Internet of Things, companies of all stripes will be wrestling with enormous new sources of machine data. How they make good use of all this data will help give them an important edge on consumer and business behavior.It will be interesting how Rapid7 incorporates this acquisition across its platform, and whether it will seek to upsell Logentries products into the Fortune 500 market where Splunk currently concentrates. In a slide deck explaining the acquisition, management noted that Logentries search technology will make a good fit with its existing Detection and Response suite of products. For 2016, the acquisition will bring in an projected $10 to $12 million in revenues, and will be earnings accretive after 2017.Rapid7 reports earnings on Thursday, Nov 12 after the close. Consensus of analysts estimate an earnings loss of $0.36 for the quarter, in line with company guidance provided during the 2Q earnings report.Some metrics to watch in the earnings report:YOY Revenue growth rate: Last quarter the company reported a 44% YOY growth rate, an acceleration from the 1Q's 41% growth rate. Will this be maintained?YOY Deferred Revenue growth rate: Last quarter the company reported a 45% YOY growth rate, its seventh straight quarter of accelerating billings growth. FYI, the deferred revenue line on the balance sheet has expanded to $97.5 million as of June 30. In the 2Q, $30.4 million of new business was booked as deferred revenue, while $21.5 million of prior business booked was realized. Will the trend continue? We estimate deferred revenues to grow to around $104 to $106 million as of Sep 30.Expiring Renewal rate: Last quarter the company reported an 87% rate. Will this expand further?All-In Renewal rate: This includes a combination of renewals, up-sells and cross-sells. Last quarter this rate was 115%.Customer Count: Last quarter this stood at 4,150 companies as of June 30.Gross margin: Last quarter this stood at 74%.Cash balance: Pro forma, cash on June 30 (pre-IPO) stood at $140 million. The Logentries acquisition cost the company a reported $36 million in cash. Coupled with a $10 million cash burn rate in the 2Q, it will be key to see how this balance stands at Sep 30, especially since the company continues to invest heavily in R&D and its sales force in attempt to capture share.Technically speaking, the stock is in the 15th week of its initial IPO base. The stock took a sharp tumble on Oct 14, the day after announcing its Logentries acquisition. It was down again on Oct 21 (no news) in sympathy with its cyber-security peers. A few days before, The Wall Street Journal published a story on proposed updates to the Wassenaar Arrangement, an export regime among 41 nations that would potentially require government export licenses for security software. Such a regulatory regime may limit the international sales growth of US-based cyber firms. Rapid7 garners 12% of its revenues from international companies, something that may increase with the new Logentries acquisition.Should the stock rebound to the $25.38 price level, the Aug 19 intraday high, on above average trading volume, we would be a buyer."
3984911,98236,2016-06-28T11:54:09-04:00,"Rapid7 is yet another vendor of enterprise class cyber security solutions.The company is not in the ""next generation"" firewall space and does not compete against the best known names such as Check Point and Palo Alto.This company focuses on security from a different perspective, often referred to as security data analytics, and it uses next-generation behavioral analytics coupled with fast search as its backbone technology.The company, while small, has enjoyed substantial growth over the last several years and is expected to achieve over $150 million of revenue and 40% top line growth.The company is loss-making at its scale although there have been some improvements in profitability in the last several quarters.","Why bother looking at yet another security software vendor?Is anyone out there interested in looking at a small, somewhat unique security vendor today? It is probably more fun, although perhaps not all that profitable to speculate endlessly as to the potential impact on the economies of the U.K., the EU or perhaps even the world.But for readers who might be tired of yet another Brexit discussion, I would like to focus on a small-cap cyber-security name called Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD). At least Rapid7 has 87% of its revenues coming from North America. It is just too small and too new to have established much of an international presence although offshore has been growing lately. It does have development facilities in Belfast and in Dublin and those, of course, have been so located both to take advantage of lower labor costs on both sides of the Irish border which are not insignificant compared to Greater Boston and to take advantage of subsidies that are available these days both in the Irish Republic and in Northern Ireland.And I really do not think that Brexit is going to have much impact on potential data security breaches one way or the other. Users buy security software for one reason and one reason only and that the costs and the impacts of a breach can be catastrophic. Price is not a huge consideration except competitively and the status of international trade is not a significant consideration in terms of security breaches either.OK then, why look at this company which on the surface seems like many, many other smaller loss-making tech vendors? Simply put, Rapid7 is really competing in a rather different part of the software security space and hence has a relatively significant competitive moat when compared to the giants of that market. I will try to explain below, as best as I can, the concept of SIEM and the solutions that use it to deliver some level of cyber-security protection for users. Rapid7, along with a couple of other competitors, has a second generation solution in the universe of SIEM applications that really obsoletes much of the older technology. What Rapid7 sells is really a bit unique and quite differentiated from the solutions sold by many competitors who offer older versions of the SIEM technology.Further, the shares are relatively cheap with an EV/S of 3, far less than many other companies in IT with subscription models and it seems to have a realistic path to profitability. By no means a rapid path, I believe, and I think at some point management is going to have to think through the trade between growth and profitability again, but there is a path there and it can be seen. Given its size the company doesn't have the coverage of some other IT vendors. Only seven analysts follow the name.And while insiders own almost half of the shares, institutional ownership of 10% is low and the short interest of 9% of the float is relatively high. There's the tendency to think that low institutional ownership and particularly lower ownership by hedge funds must mean that something is wrong with the company. It surely can, but it can also mean that this company is a bit small to fit into many institutional portfolios. And that's a rare opportunity for individual investors.The company is forecasting positive operating cash flow this year of $10 million and its capex of about $1 million/quarter is not very high. Stock based comp was 16% of revenues last quarter. In the prior year's quarter RPD was not yet a public company and hence there's no meaningful comparison. Rapid7 is a small-cap name that is loss making, but it has some other far more interesting characteristics that might intrigue investors given the potential level of appreciation potential and the potential the company has to be consolidated.So what is Rapid7 and how are they positioned in the cyber security market?Yes, this is a relatively small security software vendor with a name that reminds me of Motel 6, perhaps not the most pleasant of analogies. The name actually derives from the fact that two of the founders used the No.7 line of the of the New York subway that goes from Times Square (nowadays from 34st and 11th) to Flushing in the borough of Queens. The line passes by Citi Field and the Tennis Center and the rest of the ride is notable mainly for the dreary views of Queens that can be seen from the elevated tracks. It isn't one of the more pleasant experiences to endure day to day and apparently to pass the time two of the founders focused on conversations that led to the development of what is now Rapid7.Now I grew up using what is now the No. 4 line that goes from the southern tip of Manhattan to Woodlawn, a bucolic setting for a famous cemetery. Nothing that special has ever happened to me while riding the trains. I was once bullied by a bunch of kids from Dewitt Clinton HS which was somewhat frightening but I never thought up some great trading strategy or a brilliant idea with which to launch a company. Perhaps the breezes on the elevated line in the West Bronx lacked some kind of magic elixir present in Flushing or Jackson Heights or even Sunnyside.It is just irresistible for me to add that trying to discuss anything, let alone corporate strategy within a New York City subway car at rush hour is likely one of the more fraught experiences in the world. Personally, I would rather hear a choir singing flat than take the No. 7 to and from work end to end, day after day. But despite the venue of its genesis, Rapid7 has managed to build a company that is rapidly growing and which appears to offer differentiated solutions. Who knew that rides on the No. 7 made up for their unpleasantness with such corporate mojo.Rapid7 went public just last summer and it has never again sold as high as the IPO price. Indeed, it is just less than half the price it closed back in July 2015. And therein, I believe, lies the opportunity. For a fast growing company in the security space it is quite modestly valued - perhaps because of its loss making history. It is definitely a minnow in a sea of sharks with revenues estimated this year at $152 million compared to say $1.6 billion for calendar year 2016 for Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW).Almost inevitably the company is loss-making although company CFO Stephen Gatoff has forecast that the company will achieve ""meaningfully positive operating cash flow in 2016."" Mr. Gatoff has forecast that overall operating cash flow will come to $10 million for the year with positive free cash flow. And if it is going to be a survivor (by which I mean that it is going to remain unconsolidated) it has a relatively low EV/S at just greater than 3X. Growth this year is forecast to be 38% and that is likely more than anyone else in the security software space with the exception of PANW - but is that fast enough? And what is it that RPD7 does that makes it unique and able to withstand competition from much larger and better known competitors?Basically Rapid7 is not another advanced firewall security product. It is essentially a different category called security data analytics as I will try to explain below. The overall size of the market is said to be about $5 billion this year and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11% through the end of the decade. There are various categories and sub-categories within this space that are of interest to potential users. As it happens, Rapid7 has dogs in all of the races in the overall space and during Q1-2016 it indicated that percentage growth was relatively consistent across all of the categories. I'm not going to go too deep into which category has which product. It doesn't matter in terms of evaluating the stock. My interest is really to see if Rapid7 might be a decent investment.One thing to note this particular niche is not dominated by the usual suspects who compete in firewall security - no Palo Alto, no Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP) and no Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT). And for potential investors, that is a very, very good thing. There are, to be sure, more than enough competitors such as Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), EMC (NYSE:EMC), HP (NYSE:HPE) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). Most of these competitors have products that are built around what is called the SIEM (security information and event management) paradigm. It is an approach to security that seeks to provide a holistic view of an organization's overall IT security. The best known of the independent vendors in the SIEM space is Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK).Rapid7 has products that use next-generation behavioral analytics coupled with fast search to overcome the challenges/limitations of the current generation of SIEM offerings, that rely on an almost endless series of rules that sometimes simply overwhelm security analysts who try to keep up with the alerts issued by their software. To a degree, the Rapid7 approach uses a somewhat different paradigm than the approaches used by advanced firewall vendors. Firewalls, by their nature, are essentially designed to prevent breaches. In the approach used by Rapid7, statistical analysis determines the parts of a network that are most under threat. The paradigm continues with a service that identifies what are thought to be inevitable breaches. The company's InsightDR (IDR) attempts to secure data quickly and automatically in the wake of breaches. The company's AppSpider product, acquired through a recent acquisition, is the tool the company sells to assess threat vulnerabilities. The two competitors that offer solutions more comparable to those offered by Rapid7 are Splunk and LogRhythm. There are occasions on which Rapid7 partners with LogRhythm and the two companies have integrated some of their technology. The unified solution includes the LogRhythm SIEM 2.0 with the RPD risk assessment solutions.In October 2015, RPD acquired Logentries for $68 million of which $36 million was cash and $32 million was in RPD shares. Logentries is a company that has a portfolio centered on log management and search. Logentries is a direct competitor of Splunk and gets quite high marks in the user surveys, significantly besting Splunk in the ones that I have seen. It is almost certainly early days to evaluate how the competition between Logentries and Splunk might go now that RPD has acquired that company.Typical users of this next generation technology currently are said to include larger enterprises, including telecom, energy and power financial services. So far, RPD has been moderately in terms of acquisitions. More than three years ago it acquired a mobile security company Mobilsafe which specialized in risk management for mobile devices. Adding Mobilsafe allowed Rapid7 to address threats coming from what is called the BYOD (bring your own device) space. And of course it acquired Logentries and has made a deal to acquire some Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) customers. But by the standards of this era, RPD has not been a serial acquirer.Compared to many smaller start-up companies that primarily generate revenue through subscriptions, Rapid7 has a significant consulting practice that actually enjoyed the greatest percentage growth last quarter. In Q1, 31% of total revenues came from consulting. The consulting gross margin was 30%. There's plenty of room to grow gross margins at scale. Given the specialized nature of its consulting expertise, consulting services could readily enjoy gross margins of 40% or more as is the case for Indian outsourcers with a far less specialized practice.Self-evidently, professional services revenue is not recurring. That said, this company has a strong balance of deferred revenue and even with the outsize proportion of consulting it has decent short-term visibility. I believe that the company's practice is a significant competitive benefit that RPD can offer prospective users.What are the issues keeping these shares down?Fair question. The shares are down almost 16% YTD and that's in spite of two quarters that were beats and raises. Since the start of the year, the IGV software index has fallen 4%.The company announced its Q4-2015 results on 2/10/16. The shares did rally 50% between the time of the earnings release and 3/7/2016, but that was during a period during which tech shares were all rallying from the February 9, 2016, bottom. RPD announced its Q1 results on May 10. The shares did rally by 7% after hours because of the beat and raise. Perhaps the beat wasn't large enough. Even though full-year guidance was increased noticeably, the forecast for Q2 was more or less consistent with prior expectations. In any event the shares declined about 5% over the next week. As the IGV was rallying a bit at that time, it seems that investors were disappointed at some elements of the earnings release and judging by conference call questions I believe that was the case. Management said on the call that the year would be second-half weighted (60-40% in terms of bookings) and their guidance reflects those observations. I have no reason to believe that Q2 results will not be another ""beat and raise."" Well no reason other than any Brexit induced panic amongst IT security customers. Estimates are aligned with guidance and estimates indicate a revenue growth slowdown from 48% to 40% for this quarter and to 36% in the September quarter. The math suggests those numbers might easily be exceeded and management has reaffirmed that it intends to show operating leverage at scale going forward.The earnings forecasts show little or no evidence that analysts really believe that will happen. The September quarter has a forecast of $2.3 million of sequential revenue growth but the growth in sequential profits is only $.8 million. 2017 estimates show revenue growth of almost $40 million, but show only $6.5 million of profit improvement. Those numbers are really not what is meant by terms like ""operating leverage"" or ""path to profitability.""It is probably instructive to look at the Q1 earnings release in some detail. I will use a GAAP presentation. Non-GAAP might have lower expense ratios but it tells the same story directionally. Gross margins were at 75%. Given the drag from professional services, gross margins are not a significant issue for this company. What the significant issues are S&M and R&D spend. R&D spend increased 81% year on year and are at 35% of revenues. The CFO on the call commented that the first place to expect spend ratio improvement would be on the R&D line and said specifically that ""this is due in large part to our talented offshore engineering teams in Belfast and Dublin and as a result we expect continued marginal decrease in our R&D expense to revenue ratios in 2016."" I have no idea what the term ""marginal decrease"" means in terms of actual numbers. There's at least a 1000 bps opportunity to bring R&D spend in line with that which other companies in the security space spend.The GAAP spend on marketing is 65.5%. That's a quite remarkable number and in itself might suggest the reasons for the current valuation of the shares, Marketing spend was up 73% in Q1 compared to the prior year. Speaking with a bit of experience on the subject I simply have to question the efficiency of that kind of spending increase. Rapid increases in sales spending inevitably lead to sub-optimal hiring patterns and to efforts to fit square pegs in round holes. It amazes me that real analysts do not ask company managements about those kinds of ratios and force them to defend what the CFO called the company's ""dual mandate."" But I suppose a 73% increase in spend is better than increasing R&D spending by 81%. Management chose to look at the metric differently. The CFO said that the non-GAAP marketing expense ratio fell from 64% to 57% on a sequential basis. Again, the CFO is forecasting ratio improvement on the sales and marketing line during the balance of 2016.It probably ought to be noted that last October Intel discontinued its McAfee Vulnerability product and has made Rapid7 its exclusive partner for vulnerability management based on RPD's Nexpose technology. There are royalty payments associated with the transaction which closed in early January and those royalty payments are going to be recorded as a part of the sales and marketing expense category. The company never quantified its expectations regarding incremental revenue from this deal but did say it was ahead of plan thus far but was proving to be quite labor intensive in terms of the time spent by the sales force contacting all of Intel's customers.While the G&A expense ratio is not as egregious there's certainly room for improvement. GAAP G&A expense grew 63% last quarter year on year and G&A is 19% of revenue - 16% on a non GAAP basis. RPD is a relatively small company and G&A expense is normally higher as a percentage for companies this size than for larger companies but at least the growth in G&A spend can just track revenue growth.Overall, the company is forecasting a 500 bps improvement in operating loss percentages in the current year. For the stock to work that is a minimum expectation. The greatest catalyst for the shares would be a more substantial improvement in operating loss margins. I believe that the greatest factor in the mediocre share price performance recently is the rather elongated path to profitability. The non-GAAP operating loss margin last quarter was 27%. I do not think investors are disposed to wait five more years until this company reaches break-even non-GAAP operating margins. I'm sure that management is far more aware than I am of the trade-offs in terms of growth and profitability. If the company doesn't address the issues of profitability with greater celerity by itself, there are plenty of PE firms and strategic acquirers that will do the surgery for them.In Q1 some of the sub-headline numbers were displeasing to some observers. In particular, while deferred revenue increased by 49% year on year, its sequential growth was quite small. In addition, Q1 bookings showed only a 34% increase compared to the reported revenue growth of 48%. Much of the lower level of growth in bookings than in revenues had to do with the duration of new contracts which went from 24 months to 22 months. Absent that change, bookings would have been nearly 10% higher and the growth in bookings would have been in the mid 40% range. Much of the contraction is seasonal because Q1 sees a smaller percentage of larger deals that tend to have longer terms. In any event, the company's visibility has been enhanced by the Intel/MVM deal and also by the recent launch of the company's IDR product. IDR is a product that has the potential to directly replace SIEM technology and hence has a very significant revenue potential for this company.I think that the explanations for these sub-headline anomalies are quite reasonable and the success of MVM transitions and IDR will be important in sustaining growth going forward. To the extent that the 34% bookings number may have concerned investors, I have reasonable confidence that large deals will expand sequentially - that is just seasonal and drive up term lengths and hence bookings to more pleasing levels. I do not think it matters all that much to the company's business one way or the other but it is likely to matter to the shares.Acquisition PotentialIt would, I think, be inappropriate not to mention the acquisition potential for RPD7. This is a small company with a modest enterprise value (about $460 million). It is growing rapidly and it stands in an important technology trend in the cyber security space. Most consolidators in this space are far larger than RPD and would conclude that the short-term dilution would be essentially negligible relative to the significant benefits to be attained through a merger. Under the circumstances it would be more surprising if there had not been potential proposals for a consolidation at significant percentage appreciation. Most consolidators are going to look at financials and conclude that they can readily enhance profitability by controlling expenses in terms of the percentage spend on both R&D but also sales and marketing. And most potential acquirers are going to think that they will be able to dramatically increase sales of the RPD solutions. On that basis it becomes a very compelling potential transaction.The level of premium that has lately been seen in some acquisition deals in the IT space is such that applying those kinds of valuations to RPD shares could result in a high enough bid to interest the insiders who still essentially control the company with an interest of near 50%. Almost all of the current vendors of traditional SIEM solutions are likely to have an interest in acquiring this company simply to give them a significant competitive advantage.I obviously have no way of knowing if there are any deals or how management might receive overtures. But lightning does strike and this company is the equivalent of a tall building on high ground in the midst of a thunderstorm.Summing Up!Rapid7 has indeed been rapid in terms of moving to exploit an element of new technology in the cyber security space. It has done so, for better or worse, by being rapid as well in its ramping of expenditures. Perhaps in the longer run that may not matter if those expenditures better set up the company to continue its hyped growth or to get acquired."
3685426,87586,2015-11-14T15:24:05-05:00,"Strong results beat for third quarter make Rapid7 a standout performer to the rest of their cyber security peers.Rise in renewal and deferred revenue in the third quarter coupled with decrease in sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue a testament to their product capabilities.Their current valuation based on EV/Sales is not undemanding relative to the sector, I maintain my buy rating.","IntroductionRapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) reported third quarter results this past Thursday, beating revenue and earnings estimates. Their results show a marked contrast to the rest of their cybersecurity peers in the market with revenue growing at a much faster pace compared to the previous period. Despite the competitive landscape, they still managed to improve their overall gross margins for the third quarter, which is a huge plus for me. I reiterate my Buy rating on the back of a very strong third quarter result for RPD.Strong Third quarter performance a standoutRPD's share price has taken a beating lately largely due to the lackluster performance of their cybersecurity peers. The slower growth seen by their peers in the industry raised fears that the cybersecurity sector might be getting overcrowded. More on this later.RPD's third quarter results saw them beat third quarter consensus earnings estimates by over $0.09. This underscores the huge effort management has embarked on to manage costs. This has long been my contention for RPD, that in order for them to attract new and retain existing investors in the counter, management will need to show that they are capable of reigning in costs and ultimately show that the company can be profitable.Their third quarter's revenue also grew by 39.3% versus the 31.6% they managed last year and 30.9% in 2013. This underscores the company's ability to continue growing at an accelerated pace as compared to the overall industry's slower growth rates which is a huge plus for management.Improvement in gross margins driven by professional servicesAdmittedly, this came as a slight surprise to me. Given the underperformance of their peers in the sector, I had expected overall gross margins to contract for this quarter (even though I had initially forecast gross margins to expand in my earlier report). However, their gross margins inched up by 1% from last quarter, but are still lower by 3% on a year-on-year basis. This was driven primarily by professional services, which expanded by 5% on a yoy basis.Source: Company dataRise in renewal and deferred revenue is coupled with declining advertisingOverall sales and marketing costs increased by 33.8% on a yoy basis, which is lower than the 39% top-line expansion. As a whole, sales and marketing costs as a percentage of revenue declined by 3& on a yoy basis from 59% to 56%.Despite the reduction discussed above, renewal rates (which include a combination of renewals, up-sells and cross sells) are up 122% versus Q215's 115% and full year 2014's 111%. Total deferred revenue is also up 52% yoy, providing investor's clear earnings visibility for the full year. I think both the renewal rates and deferred revenue increase is a strong testament to their product and services solutions. The result is that customer count is up 32% yoy.ValuationBased on Thursday's closing price, RPD is currently trading at a current year EV/Sales estimate of 6.7x vs. the cybersecurity sector's 5.4x. Despite the higher valuations relative to their peers, RPD stands out among the rest of their peers for their ability to grow at an accelerated pace in terms of top-line in the third quarter. I think management has done a really good job and reiterate my buy rating.Source: BloombergQuestion to PonderI think the overall slow down in growth in the cybersecurity sector means that investors are now getting more cautious in assigning steep valuation multiples to companies in the space. The question moving forward is whether RPD can continue to maintain their growth rates and command the valuation premium over the rest of their peers.My own take on the above at this stage is that the RPD management has done an excellent job in terms of managing costs and growing the business. The strong order book is a testament of that. Investor expectations will be high and they need to maintain this to continue attracting the valuation premium to the rest of their peers, failing which, they will be punished by the capital markets."

Even though the name continues to be a beneficiary of secular growth trends favoring the online security vendors in general, the sentiment towards the name, with the stock having corrected close to 50% over the past year, seems to have turned around completely, thus worthy of another look. Like many others, I have been negative (link) on the space, but the risk/reward ratio around the current level hardly looks favorable to carry Short positions.The top issue, not a small one by any means, seems to be the lack of profitability for much of the online security space and even for Rapid7, it is difficult to expect breakeven anytime before 2-3 quarters, but even in light of these challenges, changing market conditions and decent execution seems to suggest that there is a strong floor available to the stock around these levels, provided the growth trajectory is maintained.Fluff is out, a good time to consolidateChanging demand dynamics have taken the wind out of the sails of most cyber security names, be it the web application scanning peers of Rapid7 like McAfee by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) or the players like Palo Alto Network (NYSE:PANW), FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Barracuda (NYSE:CUDA) that are very active in the advanced firewall space. Most of the players have corrected anywhere between 35-65%, as the growth rate slowed after two years of strong demand, even though the businesses continue to grow between 25-45%.Besides the high growth rate, the cyber-security space is known for fragmented market shares and strong balance sheets, conditions that usually help drive consolidation in any space, as the blowout growth decelerates.New products may improve the attractiveness of the businessRelatively, the company has edged players like Palo Alto Networks and FireEye in the user behavioral analytics market and benefited from McAfee's EOL (end of life) for its Vulnerability Manager, a web application scanner. Even though the demand may have moved away from the 2014-15 type of market when a series of high-profile hacker attacks led to significant increase in IT security orders, but the technological edge and ramp of new products should allow the business to hold up well, with help from market share gains, enterprise growth and potential takeout premium.Total available market opportunity. Source: Rapid7With a decent product portfolio in the security data & analytics and threat exposure management space, the topline should benefit from the launch of the new InsightIDR platform with better behavioral analytics and search capabilities, which can help monetize the demand for SIEM (security information and event management) offerings that are undergoing an upgrade cycle.Strong financial performance and forward indicators for the business provide confidence in these positive product trends. Not just the topline numbers, with revenues growing around 35% CAGR over the past few years, but the quality of numbers overall has been impressive, with all three revenue segments - products, maintenance & support and professional services growing at near identical growth rates, more than 60% of revenue coming from subscription-based recurring sources, deferred revenues growing at almost 50% in the most recent quarter and renewal rates of more than 120%.Still expensive, but the floor getting strong for the stockThe company is making losses, but a quick back of the envelope calculation suggests breakeven is possible over the next year or two if the current growth momentum and operating expense structure is maintained, faster than current Street expectations.As one of the smaller names with decent positioning in niche areas, the business should be high on the potential acquisition target list of larger names in the space, providing further downside support."

(NASDAQ:RPD) launched its IPO on the 17th of July 2015 which saw strong interest. It hit a high of $27.45 before closing at $25.28, 58% above the IPO price of $16. This was raised from the earlier indicated range of $13-$15. The closing price gave them a market capitalization of around $955 million, just shy of the $1 billion mark.I initiate with a Strong Buy on clear visible growth prospects and under-valuation.BodyRPD provides security data and analytics solutions. The Company provides services to collect, contextualize, and analyze security data to reduce threat exposure and detect compromise in real-time (Source: Bloomberg)Readers are advised to read the initiation report on FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE), initiation report on CyberArk, (NASDAQ:CYBR) and on Palo Alto Network (NYSE:PANW) to get a better understanding of the business.What RPD is able to do is to empower organizations to prevent attacks by providing visibility into vulnerabilities and to rapidly detect compromises, respond to breaches and correct the underlying causes of attacks.Business ModelRPD sells their products and services through their direct inside sales team, a direct field sales team established and significantly expanded in 2014 and indirect channel partner relationships. Their global channel partner network complements their sales organization, working closely with their sales teams to extend their geographic reach and to close sales of our offerings as part of larger purchases, particularly in key markets such as Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America.They have three offerings: (1) threat exposure management, (2) incident detection and response, which include their incident response services and (3) security advisory services.Their customers typically engage with them based on their current IT organizational needs, whether to address a current breach or to help them mature their security programs. An organization that has just detected that it has been breached, for example, may purchase their incident detection and response products and services, whereas a customer with a new chief information security officer looking to gain insight into the organization's security environment may purchase their threat exposure management solutions, and a customer whose board has mandated a security review may purchase their security advisory services.They generally bill customers and collect payment for both their product and services up front.Financials The information below represents their financials; their revenue as mentioned above is broken down into 1) Products, 2) Maintenance and Support and, 3) Professional services.Source: Company data (In thousands)As a whole, total revenue grew by about a third - compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) from FY11 to FY14. Products accounted for about 61%, Maintenance and support accounted for 25% and Professional services accounted for 14% of total revenue. All three revenue segments registered more than a third CAGR from FY11 to FY14.Gross MarginConsistent with other players in the industry, the cyber security business brings about generous gross margins, the weighted average Gross Margin is 76% in the latest financial year. This has been compressed over the years due to increasing competition. But Gross profit is still up 32.8% CAGR over the period.I think the trend is for margins to be compressed because of competition but for overall Gross Profits to still increase from increased volume growth.CustomersRPD counts Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), IBM and LVS (NYSE:LVS) amongst their list of 3,902 customers. Other than corporations, they count government agencies such as National Security Agency and the US Department of Homeland security as their customers, adding reliability to their product.As seen above, the total number of RPD customers increased 18% CAGR from FY12 to FY14, in the latest quarter this year, this has increased further, I think RPD will continue to see increased growth in the number of customers now with 1) greater visibility from listing and 2) efforts from increased marketing and sales expenses.Sales and Marketing CostsSimilar to FireEye , RPD is currently not profitable due to their high sales and marketing costs which accounted for 63.7% of total revenue in FY14, up from 52.9% in FY13, in line with the growing trend in the industry and the increased cyber-security threats.I dwelt at length in the FEYE report above on the danger of burning too much cash continuously through sales and marketing which can inhibit the company from being profitable. Consistent with FEYE, the spending on sales and marketing in the beginning is crucial considering the need to disseminate product information and to differentiate themselves from their competitors. In the latest analyst day, FEYE's management dealt at length on how they intend to reduce sales and marketing costs, I think this is something investors need to watch but that RDP will eventually follow the path of FEYE in reducing their sales and marketing costs through lesser need for product demonstration for instance.ManagementSimilar to my report on FEYE and CYBR, I focused on the importance of management in any new startup business as the growth trajectory is always less clear and requires strong stewardship from the management to steer the ship.The President and CEO of RPD, Corey Thomas, served as Group Project Manager of the Microsoft Tools and Servers department and holds and MBA from Harvard Business School.ValuationsConsistent with the valuation methodology discussed in my FEYE report, I have used the Price/Sales valuation methodology for valuing such companies. As of last Friday, 17th July 2015's close, RPD is trading at 12.4x historical FY14 sales. They are trading at a discount to Palo Alto's (PANW: NYSE) 14.0x.I forecasted their expected revenue growth based on historical and 1Q15 revenue to derive a forward Price/Sales of 10.1x vs. Palo Alto's 12.5x, representing a discount based on forecasted earnings.Risks 1) RPD has never been profitable historically, like FEYE and other firms in the sector. As mentioned earlier, I think this is normal in the early stages of the business, but RPD will eventually need to show investors a clearer path to profitability. It is noteworthy that FEYE's latest analyst day saw them dwelling on this issue.2) Product failure. The success of RPD is dependent on the product's ability to detect and prevent any cyber breach. A single breach into the system can lead to massive loss of customer confidence in their system.Conclusion:Despite the risks above, I think RPD is well poised to grow given their track record and customer base. There is a 180 days lockup period for the insider shares, which is around January 2016. They are also trading at a discount to Palo Alto Network. I initiate with a strong buy call."

3887696,87586,2016-02-11T12:22:05-05:00,Rapid7 beat market expectations for earnings in the fourth quarter.Rapid7’s path to profitability remains well on track based on their latest quarter results and on guidance for 2016.Valuations of Rapid7 at a discount to peers in the sector.Global risk-off appetite could keep Rapid7 depressed for a while.I remain long on Rapid7 and will be looking to add on dips.,"Introduction:Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) reported fourth quarter results after the market closed yesterday, beating top- and bottom- line estimates by analysts. Long-term holders of RPD have every reason to be disappointed by the share price performance of RPD, which has corrected by over 60% from their closing price on the first day of listing about six months ago and is now more than 37% lower than their listing price of $16. I think the sell-down can be attributed to two main reasons: 1) cyber security sector sell down, and 2) global sell down resulting in a loss of appetite for high risk, high multiple stocks. Despite this, I continue to think RPD is a standout performer amongst the rest of the cyber security names that have collectively taken a hit. Their stronger than industry top-line growth rate is testament to this, but if there is one lesson we learn from the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), it is that the market rewards you for achieving bottom-line expansion more than top-line growth. I continue to remain bullish on RPD, but continue to keep a close eye on their bottom-line.Rapid Acceleration In Top-line growthRPD reported their fourth quarter results after the market closed on Wednesday, beating analyst's estimates for top- and bottom-line. For the full year, top-line grew by 50% from a year ago, which is even faster than the 28% they managed to achieve in 2014. Whilst investors in RPD have reason to be upset with the share price performance of RPD in the last six months, I think the $0.05 earnings beat is a positive as they reported a narrower than expected loss of $0.31. This shows their ability to manage costs despite being at the growth stage of the cycle.Path to Profitability remain on trackRegular followers of RPD will recall that RPD's path to profitability has long been my concern. In my initiation report on RPD last year, I talked about the importance of showing investor's a clear path to profitability in order to attract a higher valuation multiple from investors.These are the lessons I gleaned from looking at other high-growth and high-multiple stocks in the market. AMZN is a case in point. From the years 2011 to 2014, the revenue of AMZN grew by a compounded 22.8%, the shares of AMZN however, only increased by 60+% during the period. When AMZN announced unexpected positive earnings in the second quarter of 2015 after years of reporting earnings losses, their shares jumped over 60% in less than six months. Notice the stark difference.I think the above illustrate that whilst high revenue growth is important, positive earnings is even more important. And high-growth companies who can maintain top-line growth and reign in costs will see investors reward them through an expansion in valuation multiples assigned.This is why I am reasonably assured by the guidance issued by RPD for the full year 2016, which sees them guiding a narrower loss of $0.97 - $0.88 from the $1.46 and $2.32 loss in 2015 and 2014 respectively. I think the market seems to like the guidance too, with RPD trading up 9.2% in the after-hours. Nonetheless, I think RPD will have to do more in terms of cost management in order to attract sustained interest in their counter. The good news is that management appears to have paid heed to this and have performed better than expected. The challenge moving forward is, whether they can sustain this.Key Operating Metrics: ValuationsI think the most apt valuation methodology to value RPD is the Price to Sales (trailing) valuation methodology, which is currently at 3.2x vs. the industry's 24.3x.Source: BloombergI think the steeper than peers valuation discount is unjustified at this point given their history of beating performance (beating earnings three out of three times) estimates by the market since their listing in July last year.ConsiderationsI think the main consideration at this point is, given the global sell down in equity markets around the world, do investors still have appetite for risky high multiple stocks like RPD? I think the answer at this point is no. The global uncertainty is best seen in my view by the strong rally in gold prices this year. On a year-to-date basis, gold is already up 10%. I think this flight to safety mode might keep counters like RPD depressed for a while.ConclusionRPD's strong history of beating market expectations and guidance for a narrower loss in 2016 bodes well for the long-term future of the company. I think the global sell down coupled with a loss of interest in cyber security stocks by investors could keep RPD depressed for the time being. Nonetheless, I think the fundamentals of RPD remain sound and the fundamentals of the business have not deteriorated despite the market sell-off. I remain long RPD and will accumulate on dips."
3480076,88096,2015-08-31T18:35:00-04:00,A leading vulnerability management provider for the cybersecurity market.Leveraging its Metasploit framework products.Expanding into user behavior analytics and consulting services.,"The Stuxnet virus is not your typical piece of malware. It represented a big leap in the complexity and functionality of software viruses that could exploit any network's vulnerabilities. In reading the NATO report linked above, it was noted that the Stuxnet did not specifically target the personal computers through which it navigated. Rather, it was seeking to infiltrate the programmable logic controllers which operated a specific type of industrial equipment.As more and more of our business systems and processes become automated, via the Internet of Things or the cloud, where software is deemed to be eating the world, making secure all of these systems and networks is becoming ever more complex. If you believe that no technology like the Stuxnet tends to stay bottled up, then there should be little doubt that online security must be an embedded feature of everything built today.In the aftermath of Stuxnet, a small group of programmers formed a research study known as Project Basecamp in order to investigate and better understand the vulnerabilities in several commonly used industrial PLC devices. They worked with a company called Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) and its Metasploit framework in order to gather and disseminate their findings. To this day, research continues on ways to better secure the PLCs that run many of our industrial processes.Metasploit may not be a household name. But among IT security professionals, it's one of the most recognized open-source frameworks in which to share threat and vulnerability information. A quick search on GitHub for security repositories reveals that among 21 open-source projects that are showcased, Metasploit ranks #2 with 4,360 stars and 3,363 forks (as of this writing).Metasploit was founded in 2003 by H.D. Moore. It was created as a portable network tool allowing IT programmers and security professionals to investigate vulnerabilities and share their work. Metasploit's tools can be used to test any network's vulnerabilities or break into remote systems. For this reason, it can be used for both legitimate or unauthorized purposes.In 2007, Moore agreed to merge Metasploit's commercial applications with Rapid7, an emerging cybersecurity company headquartered in Boston. To this day, Moore remains with the company as its chief research officer.At the time of this merger, Rapid7 was marketing its Nexpose security appliance, a software app that would scan a network's entire field of endpoints and seek to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities. This sector of the cybersecurity business is known as vulnerability management. It's highly fragmented, but the top two vendors, as of this writing, are Qualys (NASDAQ:QLYS) and Rapid7.Rapid7 was founded in 2000 by Alan Matthews (now Chairman), Tas Giakouminakis (now Chief Technology Officer) and Chad Loder (left company in 2014 under good terms, at least publicly). The three were executives working at other tech firms in New York City before they agreed to found the company, and named it after a NYC transit train they shared while going to work. The company IPO'd on July 16, 2015, at $16, and after a first day gain of 58%, it has settled in the low $20s as the market has undergone its recent correction.Rapid7's 2007 merger with Metasploit was a great success. Prior to the transaction, Nexpose was not highly rated in the IT press. For instance, in February 2006, SC magazine reviewed the company's Nexpose product, and while it found it to be effective and easy to use, documentation and support were found lacking. It gave Nexpose a three-star rating.Post-merger, in February 2010, SC magazine reviewed a newer version of Nexpose and noted that its more extensive suite of features and a Metasploit plug-in made it far more effective. While SC still found that documentation was lacking, it gave the product a four-star rating and called it a ""solid vulnerability management product.""Three years later, in February 2013, SC reviewed Nexpose again and came away very impressed. It gave the product its highest five-star rating and called it an outstanding value.For another review of Nexpose, see this one from 2013 via blogger Carmin Yadin.Vulnerability management, as we said earlier, is a fragmented sector of the cybersecurity industry. But its importance should not be understated. Many other companies, especially the public ones, concentrate of other aspects of IT security: next-generation firewalls, signature-based anti-malware, sandbox anti-malware and endpoint security. All of these products are effective in combating cyber threats, but organizations need to know first where they are most vulnerable. They need tools in order to assess their networks. They need to look at their network in the eyes of a black hatter. That's where vulnerability management comes in.The beauty of vulnerability management is that it uses the same tools that the hackers use. And there are a lot of tools available. For instance, a hacker could use the nmap tool. This is a software code that debuted in 1997 as a simple Linux-only port scanner. It is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, and creates a ""map"" of the network in order to pinpoint possible security weaknesses. The nmap tool was featured in one of the Matrix movies, when the character Trinity used it to break into a power company computer.By using the same tools as hackers, IT security professionals can be proactive in their approaches to security. They can tailor their needs among the universe of security products available and test and re-test their security weaknesses to find the right security strategies.Rapid7's flagship Nexpose product, coupled with the open-source Metasploit framework, gives it a leading product offering in this vital area of IT security. It competes with Qualys's suite of VM products.Having said that, it's clear that many corporations and governments do not utilize these VM tools available to them. In the case of the breach at the US Government Office of Personnel Management, it's safe to say that many organizations are flying blind, with no real sense of where their vulnerabilities lie. Why is that? Aren't all of these well-publicized hacks finally forcing the corporate world and governments to pay close attention to this problem?The answer lies not in the size of IT security budgets, which are growing, but in what has become known as the Skills Gap. Simply put, there are not enough properly trained IT professionals in the world to secure today's networks. What's more, just as the Internet spreads its influence exponentially into more and more critical functions via the cloud, and as all manner of devices become connected via the Internet of Things, the skills gap of IT professionals is only getting wider.According to the seventh annual Global Workforce Survey released in April 2015, the ISC2 projected that there will be a shortage of 1.5 million security professionals by 2020. ISC2 is the largest not-for-profit membership body of certified IT security professional in the world with over 100,000 members in more than 160 countries.Reading this survey, you quickly get a sense for how overwhelming the job of an IT security professional has become. Sixty-two percent of survey respondents say they don't have enough professionals on staff and there is a very small pool of candidates to recruit from. Almost all those surveyed reported increased spending on IT spending, but most did not believe their organizations were improving their IT security.When asked to rank their top 10 list of security concerns, the top item, with 72% of responses, was the scanning of application vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanning was not done routinely at the majority of organizations, in spite of the growing ""technology sprawl"" that networks are undergoing.Eighty five percent of those surveyed by ISC2 said that remediating attacks and malware consumed a significant amount of time. As the survey reported, ""the net result is that IT professionals are increasingly cornered into a reactionary role of identifying compromises, recovering from mistakes, and addressing security incidents as they occur rather than proactively mitigating the contributing factors.""In its conclusions, the survey noted three areas in which IT spending needed to concentrate:This last area is one in which Rapid7 is addressing with its new UserInsight product. Launched in the fall of 2014, UserInsight is part of a new breed of online security defenses. It is described as User Behavior Analytics.In many online attacks, like the one that hit Target (NYSE:TGT) in November and December 2013 and resulted in 40 million stolen credit cards, hackers were able to infiltrate the company network via compromised credentials. They then hacked into an administrator account, giving it access to the entire network. Until someone noticed the unusual behavior emanating from that administrator account, the hackers had free reign over all network activity to include all card swipe scanners on every point of sale terminal in company stores.Rapid7 has a video webcast which explains how its analytics work in detecting cyber threats.To date, the company has not broken out its revenues from UserInsight. However, market acceptance has been very favorable, according to management on its first quarterly conference call on August 18. Though it has been on the market for less than one year, SC magazine nominated UserInsight as a finalist in the category of Best Computer Forensic Solution in its 2015 Awards.Rapid7 is now competing with several other larger analytics products and companies with this new product launch: FireEye's (NASDAQ:FEYE) TAP product, IBM's (NYSE:IBM) QRadar, HP's (NYSE:HPQ) ArcSight, McAfee's ESM, Palo Alto's (NYSE:PANW) AutoFocus, Splunk's (NASDAQ:SPLK) App, Exabeam, Fortscale and Securonix, to mention a few.Nevertheless, we view Rapid7's UserInsight to be a promising new launch, given its company focus on network security and its existing customer base. Coupled with its expanded Incident Response and Security Advisor Services, we view this segment of the company's market can grow in excess of 30% CAGR thru 2020.User behavior analytics is a nascent field. Its market size is hard to quantify. In an August 2014 report by Gartner, it was estimated that by 2020, 60% of enterprise IT security budgets will be allocated for rapid detection and response approaches, up from less than 10% today. Within this broad definition, security-related analytics was estimated to be a $15 to $20 billion addressable market.Rapid7's recent quarterly billings have begun to reflect this emerging market opportunity. Since the first quarter of 2014, the company's quarterly billings growth has accelerated:1Q14 = 32% YOY2Q14 = 34% YOY3Q14 = 37% YOY4Q14 = 42% YOY1Q15 = 45% YOY2Q15 = 45% YOYThese billings provide the company with great top-line visibility since 60% of revenues are recurring in nature and are booked ratably over the contract term of service as deferred revenues.Currently, the company's pace of R&D and sales force investment has kept its reported earnings at a loss. Assuming revenues continue their current track, we believe gross margins will mature at the 75% level, comparable to its security software peers, with operating margins driving toward 15% to 20% long term.We compared Rapid7 to the following ten companies: PANW, SPLK, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), FEYE, New Relic (NYSE:NEWR), QLYS, Hortonworks (NASDAQ:HDP), Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA), Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN), CyberArk (NASDAQ:CYBR) and SolarWinds (NYSE:SWI).On a price-to-sales basis, the average among these companies equals 10.4 times. The lowest two price-to-sales ratios was Qualys' at 6.6 times and Rapid7's at 7.2 times. At the peer group mean, Rapid7's valuation would equate to $30 per share.On a DCF basis, we project revenues to grow 30% per year through 2020, and then slowing to a 15% growth rate by 2024. We model gross margins at 75%, with R&D as a percent of sales at 20% and SG&A declining from 80% of sales in 2014 to 35% of sales in 2024.With a discount rate at 10% and a 3% terminal growth rate, we arrive at a $48 per share intrinsic value. This assumes no net share dilution (big assumption). We model positive free cash flows beginning in 2018.ConclusionRapid7 is a market leader in vulnerability management within the broader cybersecurity industry. Its established suite of products is currently undergoing a transformation as the company pivots to include analytics and services to its product offerings.The well-publicized pace of IT security hacks is evolving fast, and it's apparent that the majority of companies are still not employing security products at the scale required, given two key challenges:Rapid7 is a uniquely positioned company which assists companies in assessing their network security vulnerabilities and thus addresses these two challenges. In addition to a large addressable market and strong long-term revenue growth prospects, the company would make a great acquisition candidate for a larger company looking to create a foothold in the vulnerability management market and consolidate within an emerging analytics market."

Reiterate buy.","Introduction:Since my Initiation Report on Rapid7 (NASDAQ:RPD) where I recommended a Strong Buy, RPD is up 7% based on yesterday's close. The results beat was not unexpected and I will discuss this in greater detail below.The results beat by $0.24 was not unexpected, and I had accumulated prior to earnings release in anticipation of this. I think valuations now is still compelling and reiterate my buy call.The strong 2Q results beat was not unexpected in my view given RPD's position in the market place. Revenue of $25.8 million came in ahead of the street by $2.2 million and EPS beat by $0.24. Ahead of this, I am maintaining my third quarter results that is slightly ahead of the street for revenue and gross profit but below for bottom line expectationsSource: BloombergReferring to the table above, I have provided my estimates for the third quarter results above in the last three columns and Bloomberg's estimates beside. I am expecting them to beat the street's estimates by $3.4 million, which is 13% above the street. I think they will be able to do this as their efforts to up-sell start to bear fruit and require lesser product demonstrations.I have also modeled in a higher Gross Profit vs. that of the street by $2.5 million. This will continue to be driven by Professional services for the rest of the year and renewal rates from existing customers which accounted for 60% of sales in the latest quarter.I am factoring in however a deterioration in their third quarter earnings vs. that of the street by $24.8 million, I think the street is too optimistic in their expectations and the higher costs will be driven by both higher marketing and sales spend and R&D spending as RPD continue to differentiate themselves from their peers.ValuationsBased on their last closing price on the 18th of August 2015, RPD is trading at 8.6x Price to Sales, which is a slight premium to the industry but given their continued strong performance is well justified.ConclusionSince my initiation report on RPD, RPD is already up more than 7%. The results beat like I mentioned above was not unexpected as I have discussed in detail in the initiation report why I think they have a very sound model. For the third quarter, I am expecting them to continue to beat the street expectations but investors need to have patience as management rein in costs. I reiterate my Buy call."

Securing enterprises in 2020 will require a shift to information- and people-centric security strategies, combined with pervasive internal monitoring and sharing of security intelligence.Accordingly, RPD believes that the market opportunity is large and growing and will be positively impacted by the ongoing shift in security spending from a traditional passive, ""block and protect"" approach to an active, analytics-driven approach to cyber security.Gartner, Inc. estimates that by 2020, 60% of enterprise information security budgets will be allocated for rapid detection and response approaches - up from less than 10% in 2014.RPD's estimate, based on International Data Corporation data, is that the overall market for security data and analytics is a $12.6 billion opportunity in 2015. Included in the estimates are all or a portion of the markets for Security and Vulnerability Management, Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention, Endpoint Security Suites and Security Services.RPD believes that the market opportunity will grow as organizations continue to move away from prevention-based solutions and toward analytics-driven security environments.CustomersAs of March 31, 2015, RPD had more than 3,900 customers, including over 30% of the organizations in the Fortune 1000.Number of reported security incidentswithin enterprises increasing 48% in 2014 over the prior year, according to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLPDeferred revenue85% of the revenue recognized in the first quarter of 2015 was recorded on the balance sheet as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2014. As of March 31, 2015 deferred revenue was $60 million.Security data & analyticsRPD combines its extensive experience in security data and analytics and deep insight into attacker behaviors and techniques to make sense of the wealth of data available to organizations about their IT environments and users.There has been an explosion of increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks as the proliferation of mobile devices, cloud-based applications and solutions relying on user credentials has eliminated the boundaries that previously defined an organization's network perimeter and expanded the threat surface that organizations must now defend.RPD's powerful and proprietary analytics enable organizations to contextualize and prioritize the threats facing their physical, virtual and cloud assets, including those posed by the behaviors of their users.Leveraging RPD's security data and analytics platform, its solutions enable organizations to strategically and dynamically manage their cyber security exposure.RPD's solutions empower organizations to prevent attacks by providing visibility into vulnerabilities and to rapidly detect compromises, respond to breaches and correct the underlying causes of attacks.This balanced and analytics-focused approach ultimately better secures organizations' environments and reduces the likelihood of, and risks associated with, cyber attacks.Technology & solutionsRPD believes its technology and solutions revolutionize the practice of cyber security and are central and critical to implementing a modern security program.With its security data and analytics platform at its core, RPD is pioneering active, analytics-driven solutions to cyber security that enable organizations to find and eliminate critical weaknesses and detect attacks in their IT environments.RPD's threat exposure management offerings include its industry-leading vulnerability management products, which RPD enhances with deep security analytics capabilities to quickly deliver contextual risk prioritization, critical threat awareness and impactful remediation guidance.Similarly, RPD added analytics and automation to traditional manual penetration testing to be able to deliver robust ongoing attack simulation solutions that provide organizations with visibility into real world threats.By providing and combining analytics and actionable insights related to both an organization's attack surface and the dynamic threat landscape, RPD's security data and analytics platform enables organizations to manage their threat exposure above and beyond traditional vulnerability management products on the market.Incident detection productFurther leveraging its technology platform and analytics capabilities, RPD recently introduced its incident detection product to provide organizations with the ability to rapidly detect and respond to cyber security incidents and breaches.Proprietary behavioral and pattern-recognition analytics are central to this capability, which functions in part by automatically mapping an organization's assets and users relative to the threat landscape, such that aberrant and risky user-specific and asset-specific behaviors are rapidly identified, escalated for investigation and prioritized by threat level.To complement its incident detection product, RPD also recently introduced its incident response services, which provide its customers with critical access to its security experts and experience, enabling them to accelerate incident response and containment.RPD also offers security advisory services that help organizations develop a holistic approach to their cyber security programs and advance their cyber security program maturity.Intellectual propertyAs of March 31, 2015, RPD had four issued patents and 15 patent applications pending in the United States relating to its products.RPD cannot assure you that any patents will issue from any patent applications, that patents that issue from such applications will give RPD the protection that it seeks or that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented.Any patents that may issue in the future from RPD's pending or future patent applications may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.RPD has registered the ""Rapid7,"" ""Nexpose"" and ""Metasploit"" names and logos in the United States and certain other countries.RPD has registrations and/or pending applications for additional marks in the United States and other countries;
